&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/09/isnt_pleiotropy_handy/clawed_snake.jpeg" width="400" height="250" alt="clawed_snake.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can this happen? Genes are pleiotropic — they tend to have lots of different functions. The genes involved in making a limb are also expressed in other places; for instance, the Hox genes that specify identity along the length of the body are also reused in specifying identity along the length of the limb. What that means is that when the snake evolved limblessness, it didn&amp;#39;t do so by simply throwing away a collection of leg genes — it couldn&amp;#39;t, not without also destroying genes that functioned in generating its body plan. Instead, it evolved genes or modified the regulation of genes to actively suppress limb development…but the genes to build a limb are still in the genome, and still functional, and still actively working in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What most likely happened here is that some environmental agent suppressed the suppressor, allowing the old developmental program for a limb to be re-expressed. The retention of such programs is, of course, evidence that this animal evolved from limbed ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to know what triggered this change. It's not likely to be genetic (the asymmetry suggests that), but is probably a consequence of some pollutants that disrupt development. It's not a good sign, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good suggestions from the comments: it may not even be a teratogenic deformity. It could just be a poor lizard that punched a claw through the abdominal wall as it was being digested, and the snake was briefly trundling about in pain from the injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 42 per cent of messages which included the word "atheist" achieved replies, significantly higher than the average response rate of 32 per cent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
References to "Christian", "Jewish" and "Muslim" boosted a message's success rate only marginally, while mentioning "god" in a first approach actually discouraged people from replying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They wanted to know which words/phrases were more or less likely to generate a response from the other person.  (They compared all results to the overall average response rate of 32%.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We analyzed over 500,000 first contacts on our dating site, OkCupid. Our program looked at keywords and phrases, how they affected reply rates, and what trends were statistically significant. The result: a set of rules for what you should and shouldn’t say when introducing yourself online.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some obvious results.  Don’t spell like a teenage moron.   Don’t use the word “sexy” or “beautiful” in your first email (I assume it makes the recipient uncomfortable).  It helps to point out a shared, possibly-unique interest (e.g. Vegetarianism, tattoos, grad school, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is the bit that stood out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mentioning your religion helps you, but, paradoxically, it helps you most if you have no religion.&lt;/strong&gt; We know that’s going to piss a lot of people off, and we’re more or less tongue-in-cheek with this advice, but it’s what the numbers say.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/how_to_get_replies_2/god-chart.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/how_to_get_replies_2/god-chart.png" title="Date-theism" width="439" height="419"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you bring up your atheism, you have a better-than-average chance of getting a reply!  Mention god and your response rate goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are unanswered questions: We don’t know how “atheist” and “god” are used in the emails (perhaps they say, “I hate atheists” or “I hate god”).  Perhaps atheists are more likely to be drawn to OKCupid than theists.  (It’s not like you’ll meet a ton of atheists on &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/06/16/eharmony-saying-no-to-atheists/"&gt;eHarmony&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s encouraging to know that, at least on one dating site, being an atheist may not be such a liability.  &lt;/p&gt;

In my post on ADHD I made what seemed to be a very straight-forward analogy to feminism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some feminists insist, against the evidence, that there are no significant differences between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point was only this – that it is a mistake to base a moral position on scientific facts, for then either you must insist that the facts conform to your moral desires, or your moral position is vulnerable to falsification. I specifically referenced Steven Pinker who made this point in The Blank Slate. Pinker also, by the way, gives numerous examples of feminists committing this fallacy in his book – so this is a secondary reference, but sufficient for the minor side point I was making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few, however, have completely missed my point, despite my later clarifications in the comments. I will pick on M. Davies since he wrote such a long comment. He writes, regarding my claims that some feminists hold this position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have some citations for this, some evidence that a distinct philosophy within feminist theory adheres to this claim?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I must point out that whether or not any feminists actually hold this position is not relevant to my point – it was an analogy. To the extent that anyone takes the position that there are no significant difference between the sexes, they are committing the fallacy I am discussing. But I do hold that this is a distinct philosophy within feminism, and as I said I gave Pinker as one source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here are more - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_and_gender_feminism"&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers&lt;/a&gt; in her book &lt;em&gt;Who Stole Feminism?&lt;/em&gt; published in 1992 coined the terms Equity Feminism and Gender Feminism to describe distinct philosophies within feminism. The former emphasizes equality in law and opportunity (while acknowledging that the sexes are different), while the latter emphasizes the notion that our society is patriarchical and oppressive and that attempts to document differences between men and women are just a mechanism of oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, there is a very real debate going on over the question of whether or not there are meaningful cognitive sex differences. Here is, in fact, &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html"&gt;a debate between Steven Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke&lt;/a&gt; on this issue. And to get back to my point – this debate should not be about feminism, but about objective science. We can maintain, as equity feminists do, that the sexes should be equal even if science tells us they are not equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was clear on this point, and yet M. Davies felt the need to write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of course the question remains whether those ‘clear and persistent differences’ manifest themselves in a way which is socially meaningful and whether those differences justify unequal social arrangements (they don’t; only a misplaced naturalism would assert this). And you probably agree; this is an established and uncontroversial position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do not understand is why Davies felt the need to raise this point as a response to what I wrote and why the statement that I only “probably agree.” There is no probably about it – the second part of the statement was the actual point of bringing it up – that differences do not justify unequal social arrangements. The first part – whether or not such differences are socially meaningful – is a scientific question and can and should be separate from the moral question of equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps M. Davies was just agreeing with me, and I could not tell from his comment. If so, then forgive my using your comment as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually Davies does get to the actual content of my blog post – the nature of mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a disorder is an alteration or deficiency of a typical feature or function that results in demonstrable harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, fair enough. But what about homosexuality? This is ‘an alteration or deficiency of a typical feature or function’ (first criterion) and ‘that results in demonstrable harm’ (second criteria). But of course homosexuality is not a mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not think that homosexuality meets either criteria, but there is definitely ambiguity here. It also does highlight that with cognitive criteria it is challenging to come up with culturally neutral objectivity, but that does not mean that thoughtful and useful criteria do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, homosexuality seems to be a ubiquitous trait in the animal kingdom – present in all species in a sizable minority. Also, sexual preference is a spectrum, not a dichotomy. It is therefore probably more accurate to say that animals display a variety of sexual orientations as a function of natural variability. There is even some evidence that having a certain percentage of homosexuals in the population may have a selective advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, and perhaps more importantly, sexual preference is not a “deficiency” as defined by the criteria for disorder. It is not a lack or deficiency of a trait or ability normally possessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does bring up an interesting concept – in biology in general we tend to be biased toward the notion that there is one correct configuration of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, etc. and that any deviation from that is less than normal. But as we have gained a more sophisticated understanding of biology we have realized that variation is the norm, and for almost every feature we can point to there are “normal” variants. I often point out to my residents that the neuroanatomy they will see in textbooks is simply an average or dominant representation, but that there is tremendous normal variability among individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to what might be called a demarcation problem – where do we draw the line between normal variants and an abnormality or deficiency? There is no sharp line, but that does not mean we cannot apply rules that will work most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second criteria – demonstrable harm – is much more important for the notion of “disorder”. I think to be meaningful demonstrable harm must refer to harm that results fairly directly from the trait or deficiency itself – due to a lack of function. This specifically rules out  indirect harm that comes from cultural stigma or a similar source. Being left handed is not a disorder simply because culture favors the right handed. It may be an inconvenience, but it’s not a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davies continues to another point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is a major theme of my critique of mental illness denial – if you apply their arguments consistently, then you end up denying all of medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I am not sure where the fallacy lies. I don’t deny all of medicine either, but if ‘their arguments’ can be applied consistently, then the conclusions must stand, mustn’t they, even if we don’t like them? Or rather, not liking the conclusion does not mean that the argumentation is unsound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is a legitimate use of the argument ad absurdum – if you apply their logic consistently, then their criticisms of psychiatry apply to all of medicine, which is an absurd conclusion that they themselves are not taking. And to clarify – Szasz and his followers claim that psychiatry is not medicine because of x, y, and z – my point is that x, y, and z are features generic to medicine, not unique to psychiatry as they claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, they claim that mental diagnoses are not legitimate because they are based entirely on symptoms and not biological markers. I pointed out that many diagnoses in medicine, like migraine, are based upon symptoms and not biological markers. So then they slide over to a separate point – that some symptoms, like pain, count while others, like behavior, do not count. But this is simply circular reasoning – they take as a premise that mental symptoms do not count, therefore there are no mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, it is easy to get caught up in the semantic game of how to define disorder, when the real issue is when is it reasonable to give an intervention to address an identified problem or issue, and what are the risks and benefits of any specific intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Szasz and his followers are saying is that we should not treat people who display the suite of symptoms we currently conceptualize as ADHD, but they use semantic tricks and poor logic to make their case.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253109854441"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9283">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1b001c6a00f4c4e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 9.16</title><published>2009-09-16T13:00:39Z</published><updated>2009-09-16T13:00:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/skepchick-quickies-9-16/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Today, it's 203#.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting journey.  For the first time, I've found what seems like a sustainable way to eat healthy.  I feel like I'm actually a good role model for my daughter and my patients.  I've also eaten several acres of lettuce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning I stated that if you're not hungry, you're doing it wrong, and was taken to task by many educated readers.  And while I don't always feel hungry, I do wonder about certain phenotypic differences between individuals.  "Hunger" is a slippery term, but let's all assume that we all mean about the same thing.  I'm standing by my line, but with modification---many of us who are phenotypically fat will feel very hungry when dieting, no matter what types of foods we eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, things are working.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/bmi_tmi_update_9.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/OemTfoqtie8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253108561820"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1574">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a657d98b3f150583</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics and Regulation"/><category term="Public Health"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="FTC"/><category term="Kevin Trudeau"/><title type="html">Kevin Trudeau’s Legal Trouble</title><published>2009-09-16T12:34:45Z</published><updated>2009-09-16T12:34:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1574" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kevin Trudeau has made millions of dollars selling dubious medical products. He started his snake-oil salesman career selling coral calcium through infomercials. Trudeau claimed that this magical form of calcium could cure cancer and whatever ails you. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Trudeau, who was making millions off his claims, and found that he was being, let us say, less than honest. As a result the&lt;a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/ftc_greens.html"&gt; FTC banned Trudeau&lt;/a&gt; from selling health products through infomercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Trudeau is tenacious and creative – an innovator. Prior to getting into infomercials he was small time – he was convicted for writing bad checks and credit card fraud and spent some time in prison. I always find it interesting that convicted con-artists seem to hit upon such well-guarded secrets. Dennis Lee claims to have found the secret of limitless energy, if only he were not attacked by Big Oil and a corrupt government. Kevin Trudeau claims to have found the cures for just about everything, but The Man is trying to shut him down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undeterred by the FTC ban, Trudeau decided that even though he could not sell health products he could sell information – that was protected under free speech – so he started selling books through infomercial, including Natural Cures They Don’t Want You To Know About. Trudeau claimed he went from writing bad checks to discovering not only hundreds of natural cures but uncovering a government and Big Medicine conspiracy to keep this vital information from the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is even more amazing than the audacity of these claims is that a sufficient portion of the population is credulous enough to throw millions of dollars at the likes of Trudeau and Lee. Thankfully in most civilized nations it is a crime to lie to people in order to take their money. The problem has always been enforcement – authorities don’t have the resources to keep up with the constant whack-a-mole game against con artists. Sometimes they lack adequate authority to hand out punishments that would serve as a true deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has apparently kept their sights on Kevin Trudeau and seem to finally be putting a dent in his snake oil empire – perhaps. Trudeau’s financial success with natural cures led him to follow up with the books for debt management and then weight loss. Apparently in addition to being a convicted fraud, Trudeau is a medical and financial genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is his weight loss cure that now has the  FTC;s attention – they are taking him to task for misrepresenting his diet cure, which Trudeau has claimed is an “easy” method for weight loss. This “easy” method involves a 500 calorie per day diet (OK, you can stop there, but he adds), prescription hormone injections, and colonics for a month. It’s just that easy – no wonder the diet industry wants to keep this under wraps. If people knew they could lose weight just by eating 500 calories per day, why would they waste time and money on any other diet product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Federal judge (aka The Man) decided that Trudeau violated the consent decree that the FTC had placed on Trudeau – essentially saying he cannot lie to the public to sell his wares. The Chicago Tribune reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Gettleman imposed a $5.2 million fine. The FTC petitioned for a modest increase, and without a detailed explanation the judge jacked it up to $37.6 million, the regulator’s estimate of how much the book took in through infomercials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fine Trudeau was banned for three years from infomercial. In response Trudeau is pleading poverty. He actually has the temerity to claim that he made no money from the book, that it was all altruism and charity on his part. Just stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present the case is still in appeal. The fine and 3-year ban is being questioned.&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/managementIssues/idUSN2732751020090827"&gt; Reuters reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing for a three-judge panel, Judge John Tinder said a lower court judge properly held Trudeau in contempt for having “outright lied” about the content of a book, “The Weight Loss Cure ‘They’ Don’t Want You to Know About.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the judge was “troubled” by the punishment because it was unclear how the fine was determined, and because the infomercial ban did not consider the possibility that Trudeau could mend his ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully they will be able to back up the fine, which was apparently based on estimates of how much money Trudeau made from sales of the book. That is a factual claim that will hopefully be settled by reviewing the evidence. However, it is incredible to me that the judge was troubled because he feels Trudeau could mend his ways. It is hard for me to see this sentiment as anything but hopelessly naive – not a characteristic common among judges. Trudeau has been a relentless con-artist. He graduated from credit card fraud to infomercials selling snake oil, then weasled out of an FTC ban by selling books, and now is yet again determined to be lying to the public to take their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can anyone familiar with Trudeau’s history, and faced with the fact that he is still working the system with the incredible claim that he made no money from his book, come to the conclusion that he could “mend his ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This must also be put into the context that the people who followed the medical advice in Trudeau’s books, or relied upon his coral calcium claims, or bought into his anti-mainstream medicine conspiracy theories put their health at risk. Trudeau is beyond three strikes. In my opinion he should be banned for life from selling anything to the public and fined every dime he earned through fraud and deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the laws themselves are inadequate. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act"&gt;RICO laws&lt;/a&gt; were passed because organized crime could often weasle out of individual convictions or minimize their prison time. RICO allows for career criminals to be prosecuted for a conspiracy to commit ongoing criminal activity. In other words, the pattern of criminality is taken into consideration. Such laws should also apply to career con-artists – or new laws should be passed to deal with such cases. Otherwise FTC fines and bans are little more than a minor nuisance and the cost of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Perhaps it’s because &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/09/pandanapping.php"&gt;he lost Professor Steve Steve&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps it’s because I’ve criticized the views of his close colleague Eugenie Scott, and certainly it involves his visceral rejection of my non-accommodationist atheism. (Rosenau is a diehard faitheist, just the type the NCSE likes.)  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/09/on_vampires_and_ways_of_knowin.php"&gt;This week &lt;/a&gt;he’s going after me for my claim that religion is not a “way of knowing” that produces truths about the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His argument is woolly and poorly written, and confuses “truth” (whose existence he denies), with “ways of knowing” and “knowledge”.  He gets all balled up in a completely irrelevant riff on vampires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I don’t have to waste time going after him because Ophelia Benson &lt;a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=2912"&gt;has already done so at &lt;em&gt;Butterflies and Wheels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, obligingly assisted by &lt;a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notescomment4.php?id=2912&amp;amp;numcomments=13"&gt;several commenters&lt;/a&gt;, most notably Eric McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a particularly good specimen of Rosenau’s ability to sustain a rational argument; it’s a comment he made in response to Ophelia Benson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t care for golf, nor do I find dance terribly meaningful either as a spectator or a participant. I also don’t personally find religion to be useful in my life. I know, however, that other people get great meaning from golf, from dance, and from religion. How is your indifference to religion any different than my indifference to dance? Would I be wrong to claim that dance is incompatible with science since the insights dance brings to dancers are not empirical in nature? How do we decide that some non-empirical ways of knowing are OK, while others are incompatible with science?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only basis Coyne offers, and the only one I can recall being offered by other enablers, is that religion and science are incompatible because religions can make false empirical claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But so can art. I think that people who would read A Tale of Two Cities as an historical account of the French revolution are being just as bad as those who read the Bible as an historical account of the Bronze Age. It’s perfectly possible to read Dickens or the Bible as true, but not as empirically true. And if the battle is between people who read the Bible in a non-empirical sense and those who don’t, then it seems like we should strengthen the hand of moderate theists, not disparage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t aware that there was a movement to replace the teaching of European history with the view given in Dickens’s novels, nor a push to deny people contraception because that’s what Dickens would want, or to keep women subordinate because Mrs. Micawber would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; desert Mr. Micawber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenau’s shambling, from-the-hip style of argument doesn’t bode well for the NCSE.  Or maybe it does — if they want somebody who is good at regurgitating ill-considered reasons for coddling religion. As Eric McDonald says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"&gt;Rosenau’s piece is so terrible it’s hard to read without holding one’s nose. It’s as though he’s saying that anything that makes me feel good, makes me &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; as though I understand something, is, in some sense, a way of knowing. With that debased coinage it’s hard to say what is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a way of knowing. Instead of being an accomodationist, Rosenau is an obscurantist, and that should be a matter of considerable concern, considering that he works for NCSE.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues involved in science communication are complex and often seem intractable. We’ve seen many different approaches, but guessing which will work (An Inconvenient Truth, Field Notes from a Catastrophe) and which won’t (The Eleventh Hour) is a tricky call. Mostly this is because we aren’t the target audience and so tend to &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0801/full/climate.2007.77.html"&gt;rate popularizations&lt;/a&gt; by different criteria than lay people. Often, we just don’t ‘get it’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into this void has stepped Randy Olsen with his new book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Be-Such-Scientist-Substance/dp/1597265632"&gt;“Don’t be such a scientist”&lt;/a&gt;. For those who don’t know Randy, he’s a rather extraordinary individual – one of the few individuals who has run the gamut from hard-core scientist to Hollywood film maker. He’s walked the walk, and can talk the talk–and when he does talk, we should be listening!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41j-0AyiM%2BL._BO2,204,203,200_AA240_SH20_OU01_.jpg" align="right"&gt;While there may be some similarities in theme with &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/07/unscientific-america-a-review/"&gt;“Unscientific America”&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum that we reviewed previously, the two books cover very different ground. They share the recognition that there is currently a crisis in area of scientific communication. But what makes “Don’t be such a Scientist” so unique is that Olsen takes us along on his own personal journey, recounting his own experiences as he made the transition from marine biologist to movie-maker, and showing us (rather than simply telling us–you can be sure that Randy would want to draw that distinction!) what he learned along the way. The book could equally well have been titled “Confessions of a Recovering Scientist”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything else, the book attempts to show us what the community is doing wrong in our efforts to communicate our science to the public. Randy doesn’t mince words in the process. He’s fairly blunt about the fact that even when we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we’re doing a good job, we generally aren’t. We have a tendency to focus excessively on &lt;em&gt;substance&lt;/em&gt;, when it is often as if not more important, when trying to reach the lay public, to focus on &lt;em&gt;style&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, it’s not just &lt;em&gt;what you say&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;how you say it&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a recurring theme in Randy’s work. His 2006 film, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800334/"&gt;Flock of Dodos&lt;/a&gt;, showed, through a combination of humor and insightful snippets of reality, why evolutionary biologists have typically failed in their efforts to directly engage and expose the “intelligent design” movement. In his 2008 film &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270787/"&gt;Sizzle&lt;/a&gt;, he attempted the same thing with the climate change debate–an example that hits closer to home for us–in this case using more of a “mockumentary”-style format (think “Best in Show” with climate scientists instead of dogs) but with rather more mixed results. Randy makes the point that the fact that &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; panned it, while &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; loved it, underlines the gulf that still exists between the worlds of science and entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the book is not simply a wholesale, defeatist condemnation of our efforts to communicate. What Randy has to say may be tough to hear, but its tough love. He provides some very important lessons on what works and what doesn’t, and they ring true to us in our own experience with public outreach. In short, says Randy: Tell a good story; Arouse expectations and then fulfill them; Don’t be so Cerebral; And, last but &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; not least: &lt;em&gt;Don’t be so unlikeable&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. don’t play to the stereotype of the arrogant, dismissive academic or the nerdy absent-minded scientist).  Needless to say, it’s easy for us to see our own past mistakes and flaws in Randy’s examples.  And while we might quibble with Randy on some details (for example, &lt;em&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/em&gt; didn’t get to be the success it was &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of its minor inaccuracies), the basic points are well taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is not only extremely insightful and full of important lessons, it also happens to be funny and engaging, self-effacing and honest. We both agree that this book is a must read for anyone who cares about science, and the problems we have engaging the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the book has a flaw, it might be the seemingly implicit message that scientists all need to take acting or comedy lessons before starting to talk – though the broader point that many of us could use some pointers in effective communication is fair. More seriously, the premise of the book is rooted in perhaps somewhat of a caricature of what a scientist is (you know, cerebral, boring, arrogant and probably unkempt). This could be seen merely as a device, but the very fact that we are being told to not be &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; scientists, seems at times to reinforce the stereotype (though to be fair, Randy’s explanation of the title phrase does show it to be a bit more nuanced than might initially meet the eye). Shouldn’t we instead be challenging the stereotype? And changing what it means to the public to be a scientist? Maybe this  will happen if scientists spend more time not being so like &lt;em&gt;stereotypical&lt;/em&gt; scientists – but frankly there are a lot of those atypical scientists already and the cliches still abound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.gregcraven.org/images/stories/bookcover_lg.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right:10px"&gt;When it comes to making scientists better communicators, Greg Craven’s book “&lt;a href="http://www.gregcraven.org/en/the-book"&gt;What’s the worst that can happen?&lt;/a&gt;” demonstrates how it can actually be done. Craven is a science teacher and is very upfront about his lack of climate science credentials but equally upfront about his role in helping normal people think about the issue in a rational way. Craven started off making &lt;a href="http://www.gregcraven.org/en/the-videos"&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; explaining his points and this book is a further development of those including responses to many of the critiques he got originally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craven’s excellent use of video to discuss the implications of the science is neatly paired with the work that Peter Sinclair is doing with his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/greenman3610"&gt;“Climate Denial Crock of the Week”&lt;/a&gt; series. Both use arresting graphics and straightforward explanations to point out what the science really says, how the contrarians distort and misinform and take some pleasure in pointing out the frequent incoherence that passes for commentary at sites like WUWT.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, neither Craven nor Sinclair are scientists, but they are excellent communicators of science. Which brings up a point raised by both Mooney &amp;amp; Kirshenbaum and Olsen – what role should working scientists play in improving communications to the public? Video editing and scriptwriting (and even website design!) is probably best left to people who know how to do these things effectively, while content and context needs to be informed directly by the scientists themselves. To our mind this points to enhanced cooperation among communicators and scientists as the dominant model we should be following. We don’t all need to become film directors to make a difference!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>group</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253102790677"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/16/hidden-circles-illusion/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7ba705452cdc2d3a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Hidden circles illusion</title><published>2009-09-16T11:08:23Z</published><updated>2009-09-16T11:08:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/16/hidden-circles-illusion/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Richard Wiseman has &lt;a href="http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/battle-of-the-clever-stuff-3/"&gt;another fantastic illusion on his site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty good with these things, and it took me a while to see the circles… and even when I did, they kept popping in and out of existence. Shading is critical in this particular illusion! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illusion’s been around awhile; I found a reference to it &lt;a href="http://www.hemmy.net/2007/12/12/hidden-circles-illusion/"&gt;from 2007&lt;/a&gt;, and I imagine it’s a lot older than that, too. Mnd man, it’s one of the more maddening ones I’ve ever seen! The one above it on Richard’s page made me a little woozy, too. I know men tend to be somewhat more prone to red/orange color blindness than women (I have a touch of it myself, but it’s not bad), so I wonder how the genders break down in seeing that particular illusion. &lt;a href="http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/battle-of-the-clever-stuff-3/"&gt;Go take a look&lt;/a&gt; and leave a comment on Richard’s blog!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253101166544"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/president_carter_and_keith_olb.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e729b2ef6ab7d68</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Race and Racism"/><title type="html">President Carter and Keith Olbermann seem to think there is a racialized feature to this anti Obama thing.</title><published>2009-09-16T12:26:48Z</published><updated>2009-09-16T12:26:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/MLcN5Joiv48/president_carter_and_keith_olb.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/president_carter_and_keith_olb.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This includes Jimmy Carter's comments.  &lt;/p&gt;

The way it breaks down offers clues as to how it works. For example, you&amp;#39;ll never find that a thump causes the screen to selectively stop displaying women, because there&amp;#39;s no mechanism in the machine that exclusively supports the transmission of female images. Cognitive neuropsychologists pursue a similar approach with the human brain, except of course they don&amp;#39;t kick people, but rather they study patients with a brain damaged through some other misfortune.A new study focuses on the way the brain represents knowledge and facts about the world - what psychologists and linguists call semantics. Faye Corbett and colleagues compared the deficits shown by eight patients with semantic dementia - a form of neurodegenerative brain disease that affects the front region of the temporal lobes - and seven stroke patients with semantic aphasia. The stroke patients had damage either to the left, frontal part of their brains, or to the junction where the temporal and parietal cortices meet.Superficially, the two groups of patients have remarkably similar impairments. They struggle to find the correct words to refer to things, and their factual knowledge and comprehension of words also seems affected. However, with the help of an extensive battery of tests, Corbett&amp;#39;s team have shown that there are striking differences in the way the two patient groups are affected - a finding that helps further our understanding of the way the brain supports language and knowledge. The patients with semantic dementia performed consistently across tests. So, if they struggled with a word on one test, such as matching a picture to the word &amp;quot;hammer&amp;quot;, then they would also struggle when they were asked to mime the use of a hammer, or if they were asked to match a picture of a hammer to another object with a similar function. Moreover, the rarer a word, the more likely these patients were to have a problem. Altogether their performance suggests that they are progressively losing their core knowledge about objects.By contrast, the performance of the patients with semantic aphasia was inconsistent. They&amp;#39;d perform well on a simple task, such as pointing to a picture of a hammer when prompted with the word, but they&amp;#39;d struggle as soon as a task was made more complicated - for example, involving pairing objects by their function, or by action. Moreover, the rarity of a word didn&amp;#39;t predict whether these patients would have a problem.This difference between the groups was particularly striking when it came to miming object use. The patients with semantic dementia could either do this for an object or they couldn&amp;#39;t. By contrast, the aphasic patients would get some of the mime correct, but would then perform an inappropriate action, as if they were suddenly using a different type of object.The researchers think the overall picture shown by the two groups of patients reveals that the semantic system of the brain is comprised of at least two components - a core representation of knowledge, and an overall control system that navigates through the corridors of the mind finding and comparing meanings. Core knowledge is subserved by the frontal area of the temproral lobes, which is the region afflicted by the disease process in semantic dementia, whilst the cognitive control component is subserved by the prefrontal cortex and the temporo-parietal junction, which are the areas, which when damaged, lead to semantic aphasia.&amp;quot;We propose that semantic dementia patients have damage to core amodal semantic representations, whereas patients with semantic aphasia have a more general executive impairment that leads to difficulty controlling activation within the semantic system in a flexible, task appropriate fashion,&amp;quot; the researchers said._________________________________Corbett F, Jefferies E, Ehsan S, &amp;amp; Lambon Ralph MA (2009).

I call refer to him as a professional murderer, which, while seeming hyperbolic, is close to being true. His bogus health advice gets people killed. And the government’s had a hell of a time trying to put the man out of business permanently by squeezing a lousy few million dollars out of him even though that’s only a drop in the bucket given how much he’s made off of getting people killed. As an example of his amazing health advice, he promotes a diet plan, which he claims is easy, that involves eating no more than 500 calories a day. He calls it a cure “they don’t want you to know.” I call it the Auschwitz Diet.&lt;/p&gt;

Its focus is to attack the Cambrian fossil record. Of course it will no doubt be a whole load of crap but the real story here is that a reputable science museum agreed to host a showing of the film.

But the latest update on this story suggests that there’s a bidding war for the film’s distribution rights. There was also a brief myth going around that that Mel Gibson’s distribution company (the same company that distributed &lt;em&gt;The Passion of the Christ&lt;/em&gt;) bankrolled the film. This turned out to be not true.&lt;/p&gt;

I finally thought I was done talking about M&amp;amp;K’s much criticized book but every time I think I’m out, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/15/a-reply-to-sam-harris-regarding-unscientific-america/"&gt;they pull me back in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time it’s Mooney’s response to &lt;a href="http://www.reasonproject.org/archive/item/the_strange_case_of_francis_collins2/"&gt;Sam Harris’ criticisms&lt;/a&gt; during his criticisms of Francis Collins. Now I still haven’t read the book at the heart of the controversy and I’m not really planning on it. So I’m not critiquing their book, only their blog response to Harris, which I have read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainly, I wish to focus on this paragraph here in Mooney’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The point is not to watch what you say, but to understand the context in which you are trying to communicate—and to recognize that most Americans are not going to be dragged all the way from fundamentalism to atheism thanks to the force of reasoned arguments. No matter how much we may wish it, it just isn’t going to happen. Giving them some more moderate stopping off points along the way is the only common sense approach if you want to change minds, or change the culture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I think Chris is giving away his hand. Harris is right. This is about M&amp;amp;K just trying to get converts who will say they accept evolution. Chris is himself an atheist, and I surmise that if asked about it, he’d say he has good reason for his atheistic position. But his argument condescendingly says that while you and I might be able to understand the full atheistic ramifications of science, some people aren’t as smart as us, so we need to feed them science-lite first to ween them off religion slowly to a less true middle ground. Then once they reach science OT Level III, we can tell them the full truth about Xenu–err, I mean we can eventually get them to embrace full science a lot easier once we’ve gotten them to this bogus middle ground position we originally told them was correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just a strategy, a deceptive tactic for manipulating people in order to convert them to our way of thinking. But that’s not what scientific-minded people should do; that’s what the cranks do. We’re better than that. We should be teaching people critical thinking and have enough confidence in our scientific conclusions to expect critical thinkers to embrace it on their own. Even if we assumed that M&amp;amp;K’s tactic was more effective at getting more evolution converts than just being honest with people by admitting the atheistic implications of science, I’d still prefer honesty to Chris’ “giving them some more moderate stopping off points along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, you can read it for free at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006924" title=""&gt;A New Basal Sauropod Dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of Niger and the Early Evolution of Sauropoda&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early evolution of sauropod dinosaurs is poorly understood because of a highly incomplete fossil record. New discoveries of Early and Middle Jurassic sauropods have a great potential to lead to a better understanding of early sauropod evolution and to reevaluate the patterns of sauropod diversification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Principal Findings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new sauropod from the Middle Jurassic of Niger, Spinophorosaurus nigerensis n. gen. et sp., is the most complete basal sauropod currently known. The taxon shares many anatomical characters with Middle Jurassic East Asian sauropods, while it is strongly dissimilar to Lower and Middle Jurassic South American and Indian forms. A possible explanation for this pattern is a separation of Laurasian and South Gondwanan Middle Jurassic sauropod faunas by geographic barriers. Integration of phylogenetic analyses and paleogeographic data reveals congruence between early sauropod evolution and hypotheses about Jurassic paleoclimate and phytogeography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spinophorosaurus demonstrates that many putatively derived characters of Middle Jurassic East Asian sauropods are plesiomorphic for eusauropods, while South Gondwanan eusauropods may represent a specialized line. The anatomy of Spinophorosaurus indicates that key innovations in Jurassic sauropod evolution might have taken place in North Africa, an area close to the equator with summer-wet climate at that time. Jurassic climatic zones and phytogeography possibly controlled early sauropod diversification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, this blog passed the 5,000,000 mark a few weeks ago, and I didn't even notice. I must be getting jaded. Either that, or I'm full of crap with false modesty. Take your pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I do think there must be a bug in the software somewhere to let me hit number one. I expect that the error will be fixed any day now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/were_1_were_1_how_is_this_possible_or_is.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/ousDhs9UfFY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253080803299"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/?p=976">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f29e5c27a94ca91</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="physics denial/woo"/><category term="physics"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="particle physics"/><category term="FermiLab"/><category term="LHC"/><category term="Large Hadron Collider"/><category term="particle accelerator"/><category term="CERN"/><category term="end of the world"/><category term="apocalypse"/><category term="black hole"/><category term="strangelet"/><category term="exotic matter"/><category term="cosmic rays"/><category term="Tevatron"/><category term="armaggedon"/><category term="Dragon Con"/><category term="Dragon*Con"/><category term="DC"/><category term="atom smasher"/><category term="cyclotron"/><category term="synchrotron"/><title type="html">Three Reasons Why the Large Hadron Collider Will NOT Destroy the Earth</title><published>2009-09-16T05:04:28Z</published><updated>2009-09-16T05:04:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/three-reasons-why-the-large-hadron-collider-will-not-destroy-the-earth/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I did at &lt;a href="http://www.dragoncon.org/"&gt;Dragon*Con&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago was to give a talk on the physics of the &lt;a href="http://www.cern.ch/lhc"&gt;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a&gt;.  The last part of the talk dealt specifically with the claims that the LHC will destroy the Earth.  My response to this nonsense claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="dont panic" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/dont-panic.jpg?w=369&amp;amp;h=295" alt="dont panic" width="369" height="295"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, really, don’t panic… &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/05/the_lhc_black_holes_and_you.php"&gt;the Large Hadron Collider is NOT going to destroy the Earth.&lt;/a&gt; Yes, I know what the cranks have said, and I know that words such as “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt;“, “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangelet"&gt;strangelet&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_matter"&gt;exotic matter&lt;/a&gt;” get thrown around to make them sound like they know physics from their buttholes… but really, it’s going to be fine.  Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Cosmic Rays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally occurring events, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays"&gt;cosmic ray collisions with our planet&lt;/a&gt;, have been taking place at greater than TeV levels (up to 10^20 eV, whereas TeV = 10^12 eV) of energy for &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of years.  The Earth has yet to be destroyed despite such an enormous number of such natural “experiments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. FermiLab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some cranks imply that – somehow – having artificially induced high-energy collisions will lead to different physics than the naturally occurring ones via cosmic rays, but it actually doesn’t matter.  You see, the &lt;a href="http://www-bdnew.fnal.gov/tevatron/"&gt;Tevatron accelerator at FermiLab&lt;/a&gt; in Batavia, Illinois has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; been conducting experiments almost identical to those proposed for the LHC.  These include collisions of roughly 2 TeV which have been conducted nearly continuously for 20+ years!  Illinois is still there &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The “Worst Case Scenario” isn’t that bad – at all!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose all of the energy of the highest energy LHC collisions  create a black hole which proceeds to “eat the Earth”, as some claim… wouldn’t that &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;SUCK&lt;/span&gt;?!!  Well, not so much…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Imagine a million collisions at maximum energy (14 TeV each in the LHC) all create black holes, and then assume those black holes all merge into one “monster” black hole!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*How massive would this “monster” black hole be?  According to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence"&gt;mass-energy equivalence equation&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;strong&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/strong&gt; – we find that the mass of this “planet-eater” is 2.5×10^-14 grams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*What would be the size of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon#Event_horizon_of_a_black_hole"&gt;event horizon&lt;/a&gt;?  This matters because the event horizon of the black hole is like the “point of no return” from which nothing, not even light, can escape a black hole’s gravitation pull.  If the event horizon of a “monster” black hole is large enough, it could conceivably suck in large chunks of matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius"&gt;Schwarzchild equation&lt;/a&gt;, which determines the size of a black hole’s event horizon, shows…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R = 2Gm/c^2&lt;/strong&gt; where &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_gravitational_constant"&gt;G is the universal gravitational constant&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light"&gt;c is the speed of light&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R = 3.7×10^-44 meters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… which, btw, is about 2.4×10^28 , or 24,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times smaller than a proton!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even if this “planet-eater” was created by the LHC, and if it did fall into the Earth, further calculations show that it has such little size &amp;amp; mass that it would take 3 BILLION YEARS to eat up &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;ONE GRAM&lt;/span&gt; of Earth’s mass!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah… I’m soooooo worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, I’ve heard some responses from the woos on this front, but they are pathetic at best.  For instance, one response I received was that “we don’t know what could happen at that energy level, so why take the chance?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially this is a blatant &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Argument_from_Ignorance"&gt;argument from ignorance&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that because we don’t know what will happen then we know it will be very dangerous – which is a complete and utter contradiction.  In addition, when I point out my calculation to such &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Pseudoscience"&gt;pseudoscientific&lt;/a&gt; physics cranks, I often get the response that I’m “merely speculating with the math”… excuse me?  I’m using well-founded physics theories to do what we do with such theories all the time: make predictions!  And what do the cranks have?  Nothing… no math, no coherent theories, just wild speculation.  Yet in their twisted worldview, &lt;em&gt;I’m&lt;/em&gt; the one who is speculating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another criticism, one which was leveled at me during my talk at Dragon*Con, was that due to the “checkered past” of high-energy physics (specifically the development of the atomic bomb via the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project"&gt;Manhattan Project&lt;/a&gt;) then “how can we trust scientists on such questions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, my response is to point out that science is an amoral process – the question is what do we do with knowledge once we gain it?  And that’s a question humanity has been struggling with for ages, long before the development of modern science.  I agree that some of the implications of our modern science &amp;amp; technology can be scary, but to make the argument that because of this we should somehow stop doing science is downright silly!  Because that’s what we’re really talking about here folks: &lt;em&gt;the end of science.&lt;/em&gt; If you take this kind of argument to its logical conclusion, you are talking about ending the process of scientific exploration because we are too scared to do anything for fear of “The Unknown”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the end of this long rant I have to say that, in conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

Here I thought it was the kind of place where individuality was valued, and there was some good old rugged common sense to the people. But then I read &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article6830145.ece"&gt;this ghastly story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Tegan Leach gets pregnant at the age of 18, she and her boyfriend sensibly realize they are too young to be having children, and she obtains some RU486 to induce an abortion. That's smart and practical, although it would have been better if she'd gotten the assistance of a health care professional to monitor the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, that wasn't an option. Doctors refuse to perform abortions of any kind in Queensland, and the laws are hopelessly muddled. The courts are &lt;i&gt;freaking out&lt;/i&gt;, and the citizens are &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt;. These kids had their house firebombed, and their car attacked. Now she's being prosecuted, and faces &lt;i&gt;seven years in prison&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe she'll feel mature enough to bear children when she gets out. It's an interesting social strategy: perhaps you could cage all the girls and women until they are of an age to get pregnant, and then you could release them briefly for breeding? Then, of course, they'd be returned to a larger cage with a crib and a changing table.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/what_kind_of_laws_do_you_have.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/m1ZIrNEYta8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253075333063"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-4442664295399549231">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/698b8278363c4f50</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Mark Siddall on leeches, cooking, and cooking leeches.</title><published>2009-09-16T02:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-16T02:41:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/XUoUwlNHXS4/mark-siddall-on-leeches-cooking-and.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=4442664295399549231" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/09/mark-siddall-on-leeches-cooking-and.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Dr. Mark Siddall is a friend of mine who is a curator at the American Museum of Natural History and a world expert on leech evolution.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006964" title=""&gt;Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed; How the Thermoacidophilic Archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus Responds to Oxidative Stress&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To avoid molecular damage of biomolecules due to oxidation, all cells have evolved constitutive and responsive systems to mitigate and repair chemical modifications. Archaea have adapted to some of the most extreme environments known to support life, including highly oxidizing conditions. However, in comparison to bacteria and eukaryotes, relatively little is known about the biology and biochemistry of archaea in response to changing conditions and repair of oxidative damage. In this study transcriptome, proteome, and chemical reactivity analyses of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced oxidative stress in Sulfolobus solfataricus (P2) were conducted. Microarray analysis of mRNA expression showed that 102 transcripts were regulated by at least 1.5 fold, 30 minutes after exposure to 30 µM H2O2. Parallel proteomic analyses using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), monitored more than 800 proteins 30 and 105 minutes after exposure and found that 18 had significant changes in abundance. A recently characterized ferritin-like antioxidant protein, DPSL, was the most highly regulated species of mRNA and protein, in addition to being post-translationally modified. As expected, a number of antioxidant related mRNAs and proteins were differentially regulated. Three of these, DPSL, superoxide dismutase, and peroxiredoxin were shown to interact and likely form a novel supramolecular complex for mitigating oxidative damage. A scheme for the ability of this complex to perform multi-step reactions is presented. Despite the central role played by DPSL, cells maintained a lower level of protection after disruption of the dpsl gene, indicating a level of redundancy in the oxidative stress pathways of S. solfataricus. This work provides the first "omics" scale assessment of the oxidative stress response for an archeal organism and together with a network analysis using data from previous studies on bacteria and eukaryotes reveals evolutionarily conserved pathways where complex and overlapping defense mechanisms protect against oxygen toxicity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007006" title=""&gt;Climate Change and the Potential Spreading of Marine Mucilage and Microbial Pathogens in the Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marine snow (small amorphous aggregates with colloidal properties) is present in all oceans of the world. Surface water warming and the consequent increase of water column stability can favour the coalescence of marine snow into marine mucilage, large marine aggregates representing an ephemeral and extreme habitat. Marine mucilage characterize aquatic systems with altered environmental conditions. We investigated, by means of molecular techniques, viruses and prokaryotes within the mucilage and in surrounding seawater to examine the potential of mucilage to host new microbial diversity and/or spread marine diseases. We found that marine mucilage contained a large and unexpectedly exclusive microbial biodiversity and hosted pathogenic species that were absent in surrounding seawater. We also investigated the relationship between climate change and the frequency of mucilage in the Mediterranean Sea over the last 200 years and found that the number of mucilage outbreaks increased almost exponentially in the last 20 years. The increasing frequency of mucilage outbreaks is closely associated with the temperature anomalies. We conclude that the spreading of mucilage in the Mediterranean Sea is linked to climate-driven sea surface warming. The mucilage can act as a controlling factor of microbial diversity across wide oceanic regions and could have the potential to act as a carrier of specific microorganisms, thereby increasing the spread of pathogenic bacteria.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007042" title=""&gt;A Serological Survey of Infectious Disease in Yellowstone National Park's Canid Community&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Gray wolves (Canis lupus) were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park (YNP) after a &amp;gt;70 year absence, and as part of recovery efforts, the population has been closely monitored. In 1999 and 2005, pup survival was significantly reduced, suggestive of disease outbreaks. We analyzed sympatric wolf, coyote (Canis latrans), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) serologic data from YNP, spanning 1991-2007, to identify long-term patterns of pathogen exposure, identify associated risk factors, and examine evidence for disease-induced mortality among wolves for which there were survival data. We found high, constant exposure to canine parvovirus (wolf seroprevalence: 100%; coyote: 94%), canine adenovirus-1 (wolf pups [0.5-0.9 yr]: 91%, adults [≥1 yr]: 96%; coyote juveniles [0.5-1.5 yrs]: 18%, adults [≥1.6 yrs]: 83%), and canine herpesvirus (wolf: 87%; coyote juveniles: 23%, young adults [1.6-4.9 yrs]: 51%, old adults [≥5 yrs]: 87%) suggesting that these pathogens were enzootic within YNP wolves and coyotes. An average of 50% of wolves exhibited exposure to the protozoan parasite, Neospora caninum, although individuals&amp;#39; odds of exposure tended to increase with age and was temporally variable. Wolf, coyote, and fox exposure to canine distemper virus (CDV) was temporally variable, with evidence for distinct multi-host outbreaks in 1999 and 2005, and perhaps a smaller, isolated outbreak among wolves in the interior of YNP in 2002. The years of high wolf-pup mortality in 1999 and 2005 in the northern region of the park were correlated with peaks in CDV seroprevalence, suggesting that CDV contributed to the observed mortality. Of the pathogens we examined, none appear to jeopardize the long-term population of canids in YNP. However, CDV appears capable of causing short-term population declines. Additional information on how and where CDV is maintained and the frequency with which future epizootics might be expected might be useful for future management of the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006968" title=""&gt;EpiCollect: Linking Smartphones to Web Applications for Epidemiology, Ecology and Community Data Collection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Epidemiologists and ecologists often collect data in the field and, on returning to their laboratory, enter their data into a database for further analysis. The recent introduction of mobile phones that utilise the open source Android operating system, and which include (among other features) both GPS and Google Maps, provide new opportunities for developing mobile phone applications, which in conjunction with web applications, allow two-way communication between field workers and their project databases. Here we describe a generic framework, consisting of mobile phone software, EpiCollect, and a web application located within www.spatialepidemiology.net. Data collected by multiple field workers can be submitted by phone, together with GPS data, to a common web database and can be displayed and analysed, along with previously collected data, using Google Maps (or Google Earth). Similarly, data from the web database can be requested and displayed on the mobile phone, again using Google Maps. Data filtering options allow the display of data submitted by the individual field workers or, for example, those data within certain values of a measured variable or a time period. Data collection frameworks utilising mobile phones with data submission to and from central databases are widely applicable and can give a field worker similar display and analysis tools on their mobile phone that they would have if viewing the data in their laboratory via the web. We demonstrate their utility for epidemiological data collection and display, and briefly discuss their application in ecological and community data collection. Furthermore, such frameworks offer great potential for recruiting 'citizen scientists' to contribute data easily to central databases through their mobile phone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006974" title=""&gt;A Non-Humanoid Robot in the 'Uncanny Valley': Experimental Analysis of the Reaction to Behavioral Contingency in 2-3 Year Old Children&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Infants' sensitivity to social or behavioral contingency has been examined in the field of developmental psychology and behavioral sciences, mainly using a double video paradigm or a still face paradigm. These studies have shown that infants distinguish other individuals' contingent behaviors from non-contingent ones. The present experiment systematically examined if this ability extends to the detection of non-humanoids' contingent actions in a communicative context. We examined two- to three-year-olds' understanding of contingent actions produced by a non-humanoid robot. The robot either responded contingently to the actions of the participants (contingent condition) or programmatically reproduced the same sequence of actions to another participant (non-contingent condition). The results revealed that the participants exhibited different patterns of response depending on whether or not the robot responded contingently. It was also found that the participants did not respond positively to the contingent actions of the robot in the earlier periods of the experimental sessions. This might reflect the conflict between the non-humanlike appearance of the robot and its humanlike contingent actions, which presumably led the children to experience the uncanny valley effect.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_194.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/d_dr1HszCgk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253074141904"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/i_3_obama.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/79d8dbe5b5bfdf94</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">I &amp;lt;3 Obama</title><published>2009-09-16T02:48:43Z</published><updated>2009-09-16T02:48:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/nR-2A2ZsMQc/i_3_obama.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/i_3_obama.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;...because &lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/scott/obama-calls-kanye-a-jackass"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is brilliant!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/i_3_obama.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/nR-2A2ZsMQc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253068947523"><id gr:original-id="http://actionforautism.co.uk/?p=327">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2e71c68afbfe438a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Patent Nonsense</title><published>2009-09-15T23:03:50Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T23:03:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionforautism.co.uk/2009/09/15/patent-nonsense/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Last month Dr Paul Offit, the chief of Infectious Diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, was invited to throw out the first ball at a major league baseball game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Arizona Diamond Backs.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Taking on the issue of the cost of health care, a Washington Post editorialist intoned recently that “knowing more about which treatments are effective is essential” — &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;knowing about when to use a plural verb is tough, too&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; — “but, without a mechanism to put that knowledge into action, it won’t be enough to &lt;em&gt;bend the cost curve&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase in boldface blue was too much for reader Anthony Ambrosini:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Am I missing something?  &lt;em&gt;Which&lt;/em&gt; with a plural verb just implies a plural response to the question, and I doubt he thinks that &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; should take a plural verb.  What's he on about?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just as puzzled as Anthony is. Safire's parenthetical remark is true, more or less, but the maxim of quantity dictates that it should have some minimal relevance to its context. And this would imply either that the quoted phrase (“knowing more about which treatments are effective is essential”)  involves an error in verb agreement (surely false), or that the quoted phrase is a case where it's especially tricky to determine verb plurality (also apparently false, unless you're borderline aphasic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So come on, LL readers, help us out. Is Safire starting to have problems with linguistic impulse control? Is he using the aleatoric compositional methods pioneered by John Cage and Price Stern Sloan? Or is there some simple exegesis that we're missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;One thing about Safire&amp;#39;s column remains consistent — the failure of his staffers to do the research that he pays them for (or his failure to pay attention to the research they do):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Why has curve-bending become such a popular sport? Because the language is in the grip of graphs. The graphic arts are on the march as “showing” tramples on “explaining,” and now we are afflicted with the symbols of symbols. As an old Chinese philosopher never said, “Words about graphs are worth a thousand pictures.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The first straight-line challenge to the muscular line-benders I could find was in the 1960s, when the power curve was first explained to me by a pilot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OED has citations for &lt;em&gt;power curve&lt;/em&gt; going back to 1908:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1908&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Philos. Trans.&lt;/em&gt; (Royal Soc.) A. 207 441 When the pressure observations are plotted to a suitable scale they coincide with the integrated power curve. &lt;strong&gt;1934&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; 27 May 8/7 This Riley engine in acceleration is rapid and clean, it never fusses or vibrates, and the power curve must be a good one, for the engine capacity, throughout its range.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are plenty of other cgraphical curve-collocations earlier than 1960, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1886 &lt;/strong&gt;K. PEARSON in I. Todhunter &lt;em&gt;Hist. Theory Elasticity &lt;/em&gt;I. 503 There exist certain materials for which even in a state of ease the *stress-strain relation is not linear; that is to say the stress-strain curve..is not a straight line even for very small elastic strains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though in fairness, I don't think that &lt;em&gt;stress-strain curve&lt;/em&gt; has ever had much of a second life as a metaphorical expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagined that &lt;em&gt;bell curve&lt;/em&gt; was an old expression, but the OED's first citations are from 1970 and 1973:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1970&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/em&gt; Oct. 64/2 Research may be used to classify the effort into three basic methods:..(2) through use of the normal distribution hypothesis (*bell curve) [etc.].&lt;strong&gt; 1973&lt;/strong&gt; T. PYNCHON&lt;em&gt; Gravity's Rainbow&lt;/em&gt; I. 51 Exit doors painted beige, but with edges smudged browner in bell-curves of farewell by the generation of hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as an opportunity for antedating, rather than a genuinely late coinage. And indeed, a few minutes of web search turns up Godfrey H. Thomson, "Interpretation of Threshold Measurements", &lt;em&gt;Psychological Review&lt;/em&gt;, 1920, p. 304:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BellCurve1920.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that the expression is used in that passage leaves the impression that it was already a commonplace expression in 1920.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only example of &lt;em&gt;bell curve&lt;/em&gt; in Literature Online is from Martin Espada's poem "Do Not Put Dead Monkeys in the Freezer", 1996:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15   I was a lab coat and rubber gloves&lt;br&gt;
16   hulking between the cages.&lt;br&gt;
17   I sprayed down the batter of monkeyshit&lt;br&gt;
18   coating the bars, fed infant formula in a bottle&lt;br&gt;
19   to creatures with real fingers,&lt;br&gt;
20   tested digital thermometers greased&lt;br&gt;
21   in their asses, and carried boxes of monkeys&lt;br&gt;
22   to the next experiment.&lt;br&gt;
23   We gathered the Fear Data, keeping score&lt;br&gt;
24   as a mechanical head&lt;br&gt;
25   with blinking red bulbs for eyes&lt;br&gt;
26   and a siren for a voice&lt;br&gt;
27   scared monkeys who spun in circles,&lt;br&gt;
28   chattering instructions&lt;br&gt;
29   from their bewildered brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30   I did not ask for explanations,&lt;br&gt;
31   even when I saw the sign&lt;br&gt;
32   taped to the refrigerator that read:&lt;br&gt;
33   Do Not Put Dead Monkeys in the Freezer.&lt;br&gt;
34   I imagined the doctor who ordered the sign,&lt;br&gt;
35   the moment when the freezer door&lt;br&gt;
36   swung open on that other face,&lt;br&gt;
37   and his heart muscle chattered like a monkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;38   So I understood&lt;br&gt;
39   when a monkey leapt from the cage&lt;br&gt;
40   and bit my thumb through the rubber glove,&lt;br&gt;
41   leaving a dollop of blood that gleamed&lt;br&gt;
42   like icing on a cookie.&lt;br&gt;
43   And I understood when one day, the doctors gone,&lt;br&gt;
44   a monkey outside the bell curve of the Fear Data&lt;br&gt;
45   shrieked in revolt, charging&lt;br&gt;
46   the red-eyed mechanical head&lt;br&gt;
47   as all the lab coats cheered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It surprised me to see no literary uses in the 1930s through 1970s of such a simple and evocative phrase for such a basic and important concept. But Herrnstein and Murray's 1994 book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve"&gt;The Bell Curve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; guaranteed that this term would enter the linguistic mainstream, in a variety of more-or-less metaphorical interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253064750953"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=1046">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d291df23a334094b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">A simple request</title><published>2009-09-16T00:36:46Z</published><updated>2009-09-16T00:36:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/09/15/a-simple-request/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of you unfamiliar with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/"&gt;GrrlScientist&lt;/a&gt;, might I have your attention:&lt;/p&gt;

In general, the pitchers produce nectar that attract insects and other small animals (I have found frogs and salamanders in Sarracenia purpurea leaves), which then fall into the pitchers, drown, and decompose.  The plant is then able to absorb nutrients from this decomposing material.  Generally decomposition within the pitchers is aided by an inquiline community of microbes, rotifers, copepods and a variety of other invertebrates.Pitcher plants usually grow in  nutrient poor environments (acid bogs, tropical mountain tops etc..) and the carnivory is assumed to be an adaptation to such environments, allowing the plants to obtain the nitrogen and phosphorous necessary for growth.The genus Nepenthes has gained attention over the last year with the recent discovery of one of the largest pitcher plants, Nepenthes attenboroughii, that can have 1.5-2 liters of water within their pitchers.  A recent paper in Biology Letters (see cover image) describes another novelty within the pitcher plants.  Nepenthes lowii has two types of pitchers: young plants produce ground-level pitchers which are well-suited to insect capture, whereas larger, more mature plants produce aerial pitchers which are not well-suited to insect capture, and various hypothesis have been put forth as to what these aerial pitchers were doing.  In their recent paper, Clarke and colleagues show via isotope analysis that the majority of Nitrogen in the aerial pitchers was coming from the faecal matter the mountain tree shrew, Tupaia montana.The aerial pitchers are have wide, non-slippery mouths and a large hood that folds away from the pitcher.  The nectar is produced on the hood, and in order for the mountain shrew to gain access to the nectar, it much perch itself on the pitcher with its &amp;#39;rump over the pot&amp;#39; if you will.  It seems that this placement of the shrew on the pitcher is prime placement for the pitcher to collect faeces that are dropped by the shrew while it eats its dinner. Here is an example of a plant that collects its own manure fertilizer.  What a great system.Clarke, C., Bauer, U., Lee, C., Tuen, A., Rembold, K., &amp;amp; Moran, J. (2009).

It's complete nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This documentary will examine what many consider to be the most powerful refutation of Darwinian evolution--the Cambrian fossil record. Charles Darwin realized that the fossil evidence did not support his theory of gradual, step-by-step evolutionary development. He hoped that future generations of scientists would make the discoveries necessary to validate his ideas. Today, after more than 150 years of exploration fossil evidence of slow, incremental biological change has yet to be excavated. Instead, we find a picture of the rapid appearance of fully developed, complex organisms during the outset of the Cambrian geological era. Organisms that embody almost all of the major animal body plans that exist today. This remarkable explosion of life is best explained by the existence of a transcendent intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, what? They're planning to overstate the rapidity of the Cambrian, ignore the vast amounts of morphological change that has occurred in the half a billion years since, and do the usual stunt of waving away scientific explanations so they can claim creationism wins by default. An utterly worthless bit of hokum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real shame, though, is that they've &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS157689+14-Sep-2009+PRN20090914"&gt;landed a respectable venue for the premiere&lt;/a&gt;: The &lt;a href="http://www.snomnh.ou.edu/"&gt;Sam Noble Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; in Oklahoma. Well, it was respectable. This will put a little spot of schmutz on their glossy reputation, I fear. And they're planning to turn it into a real kookfest, with both Jonathan Wells (whose book, &lt;i&gt;Icons of Evolution&lt;/i&gt;, revealed that he was an ignorant maroon on the subject of the Cambrian) and Stephen Meyer, the philosopher-creationist with his own book on molecular biology (hah!) to peddle, there to lecture at the opening. I guess any clown can rent the integrity of the U of Oklahoma for a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where are the University of Oklahoma biology professors? Where is the staff of the museum? Where are the rational people of the state of Oklahoma? They should all be rising up in disgust to mock this ridiculous affair. At least they've got &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/09/nomnomnom_wells_and_meyer_comi.php"&gt;ERV to stick up for them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the Oklahoma legislature will try to censure the university for allowing religion on campus, as they did against Richard Dawkins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the department of NO-FRICKIN&amp;#39;-BIG-SURPRISE, the movie has two big name scientists in it, Simon Conway Morris and James Valentine…and their &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/09/this_seems_fishy_to_me.php"&gt;interviews were obtained under false pretenses&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Of course&lt;/i&gt;.

Tool over to St. Cloud and visit Michele Bachmann's Town Hall meeting, which she rudely scheduled on the same day as a visit to Minneapolis by President Obama.  Or, you could go to see President Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rep. Michele Bachmann was in St. Cloud on Saturday for a town hall meeting. Apparently quite a few people in her district just don't care about her anymore. Her event at the St. Cloud Technical High School was attended by only 60 people!

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, 18,000 people were at the Target Center to listen to President Obama's speech and he had to compete with the Gopher's first home game in their new stadium!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to read this book.  Years ago, I found out about Henrietta Lacks and I thought it was one of the most interesting science stories I'd ever  heard.  It was so interesting that I kept telling people about it, but the tale is so strange that few would believe me.  So finally, I stopped telling people. Now, with  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400052173?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwgregladenc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1400052173"&gt;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwgregladenc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1400052173" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt; coming on line in a few months, this will all change again!

It lead to a "rebuttal" on Dr. Bremner's blog, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1504"&gt;an additional response from Dr. David Gorski&lt;/a&gt;.  The discussion has been interesting (no, not Doug's incoherent response, but the comments and emails of others).  One letter in particular helps sum up the ideologic rift between science-based medicine and "everything else".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following was written by a physician:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would ask Drs Gorski and Lipson if an iconoclast like Dr Bremner might be serving a valuable role as gadfly to an entrenched failing status quo in bio-medicine who have made the mistake of deifying science? I would posit that the very essence of science is always and incessantly asking the question- "is it possible that I  may be wrong?". And I strongly support the return of narrative- the patient's individual story- to the practice of  medicine. The incomparable Sir William Osler, one of my heros in medicine, knew that well. 

&lt;p&gt;I believe that of all the determinants of successful US bio-medicine medicine going forward that a strong dose of humility is in very tall order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make progress our egos must die first- a basic psychiatric principle. It is much better and much more important to be tolerant and kind than to be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I support Dr Doug Bremner's role as a colorful and passionate iconoclast. We need more like him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deserves a thorough &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking"&gt;fisking&lt;/a&gt;, given that it is rife with logical fallacies.

Given that the current calendar we’re using was constructed thanks to a committee retroactively selecting Christ’s birth year as Year Zero (or One?), if atheists were to get together to select a new Year Zero to reflect our credo, whose birth should get the honors?

In fact, one could argue that we are getting a more veridical picture of the neural networks supporting speech perception when we use standard pulse sequences than when we use sparse or clustered acquisition.  (I am TOTALLY going to use this argument the next time a reviewer says my study is flawed because I didn’t use sparse sampling!)  This is why I think it is a brilliant strategy to develop a research program to study speech processing in noise using fMRI, as Lee Miller at UC Davis has done.  Not only is it the case that speech is typically processed in noisy environments (ecological validity) and that processing speech in noise is often disproportionately affected by damage the auditory/speech system (clinical applicability), but fMRI is really noisy.  Brilliant!A recent fMRI study by Bishop and Miller tackled this issue by adding even more noise to speech.  They asked subjects to judge the intelligibility of meaningless syllables (the signal) presented in a constant babble (the noise) created by mixing speech from 16 people talkers.  They manipulated the intensity (loudness) of the signal to create a range of signal to noise ratios.  In addition, they presented visual speech in the form of a moving human mouth that was either synchronous with the speech signals or temporally offset.  The visual speech information was blurred to preserve the gross temporal envelope information but obscure the fine details so that syllable identification could not be achieved using visual information alone.  They also had an auditory-only condition.They did a couple of analyses.  The one that would seem most interesting and the one that was emphasized in the paper was the contrast between stimuli that were judged intelligible verses those that were judged unintelligible, collapsed across the visual speech conditions. Oddly, no region in the superior temporal lobes in either hemisphere showed an effect of intelligibility.  This is completely unexpected given the very high-profile finding by Scott and her colleagues who claim to have identified a pathway for intelligible speech in the left anterior temporal lobe (Scott et al. 2000).  Instead, Bishop &amp;amp; Miller found an intelligibility effect bilaterally in the temporal-occipital boundary (in the vicinity of the angular gyrus), in the left medial temporal lobe, right hippocampus, left superior parietal lobule, left posterior intraparietal sulcus, left superior frontal sulcus, bilateral postcentral gryus, and bilateral putamen -- not your typical speech network! They then assessed audiovisual contributions to intelligibility by looking for regions that show both an intelligibility effect (intelligible &amp;gt; unintelligible) and an audiovisual effect (synchronous AV &amp;gt; temporally offset AV).  This conjunction led to activation in a subset of the intelligibility network including left medial temporal lobe, bilateral temporal-occipital boundary, left posterior inferior parietal lobule, left precentral sulcus, bilateral putamen, and right post central gyrus. The authors discuss the possible role of medial temporal lobe structures in speech “understanding” (e.g., “evaluating cross-modal congruence at an abstract representational level”) as well as the role of the temporal-occipital boundary (e.g., “object recognition … based on features from both auditory and visual modalities”).  But what interests me most about this study, and what I think is the most important contribution, is not the intelligibility contrast but their acoustic control.  Recall that they parametrically manipulated the signal to noise ratio (SNR).  They ran an analysis to see what correlated with this SNR variable.  The goal was to see if SNR could explain their intelligibility effect.  The answer was no, “the BOLD time course for our understanding network was not adequately explained by SNR variance.”  But the regions that did correlate with SNR turned out to be a familiar set of speech-related regions: bilateral STG and STS, and left MTG!What I think this study has actually shown is that phonological perceptibility is strongly correlated with activity in a bilateral superior temporal lobe network (SNR variable) and that the “understanding network” reflects those top-down (or higher-level) factors that influence how the phonological information is used (e.g., to make an intelligibility decision).  Of interesting in this respect is the high degree of overlap in the distribution of SNR values judged to be intelligible (red) versus unintelligible (blue).  Because there was so much overlap in these distributions, the contrast between intelligible and unintelligible yielded no effect in regions that were responding to the phonemic information in the signal.  In sum, I think this study nicely supports the view that phonemic aspects of speech perception are bilaterally organized in the superior temporal lobe, but goes further to outline a network of regions that provide top-down/higher-level constraints on how this information is used in performing, in this case, a cross-modal integration task.

By &amp;#39;authoritarian&amp;#39; I mean someone who&amp;#39;s predisposed to follow the dictates of a strong leader and traditional, conventional values.But, in a secular society, this leads to a potential for conflict. How do religious people respond if the government authority contradicts religious authority? A new study suggests that it depends on how firm their moral convictions are.First off, let me just quote from the paper on the difference between religious and moral conviction:Theories in moral development suggest that people’s religious beliefs are based more on authorities, rules, etc., whereas people’s moral beliefs are comparatively authority independent (Nucci &amp;amp; Turiel, 1978; Turiel, 2002). Consistent with this idea, religious authorities or institutions determine what is permissible or impermissible and at least some of these determinations evaporate in the absence of authority or institutional support.Conversely, people’s moral imperatives hold even in the absence of authority or institutional support (Nucci &amp;amp; Turiel, 1978). Moreover, belief in God and a general high level of trust in religion load on the same factor structure as general trust in the state and average trust in the government to handle a host of specific issues (Proctor, 2006).In short, these results suggest that religiosity reflects a generalized willingness to trust authority, regardless of whether the authority is secular or religious.To look into this further, they looked into data they got from a survey of a cross-section of around 700 Americans.  The topic was physician-assisted suicide, and they wanted to know firstly whether panel supported making it legal, and also whether they trusted the Supreme Court to make the right decision. To tease out the effects of the different factors, they used multiple regression.So what did they find. Well, basically, the more religious the person was, the more likely they were to agree that &amp;quot;I trust the Supreme Court to make the right decision about whether physician-assisted suicide should be allowed.&amp;quot; However, people with strong moral convictions were less likely to trust the judgement of the Supreme Court.They also tested how fast people answered the question. Both strong religious and moral conviction resulted in faster response times. This seems to suggest that the effect here is visceral and emotional, rather than logical and considered.So much for their conclusions. Personally, I&amp;#39;m a bit dubious. Religious people might trust the Supreme Court to make the right decision simply because they expect the Supreme Court to agree with them.So this study leaves a lot unanswered. It&amp;#39;s clear that religious people do tend to be authoritarian, but it is not at all clear that that translates into obedience to secular authorities in cases of conflict.In fact, there&amp;#39;s some rather interesting evidence from the world of medicine that this is not at all the case! But that&amp;#39;s a topic for the next post._______________________________________________________________________________________Wisneski, D., Lytle, B., &amp;amp; Skitka, L. (2009).

While I feel quite uncomfortable with using animals for these studies (especially if you read the explicit method sections of these kind of neurobiological papers :-\) , the results could well contribute to a better insight in how music might be functional in the neurohabilitation of humans.About sixty rats were divided in four groups, two of which had callosotomy performed on them: a small section of the brain was removed just after they were born, an area that is considered important for e.g. spatial memory. The research elaborates on earlier studies that showed music to have an effect on hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as facilitated spatial memory (e.g., Kim et al., 2006).The authors conclude that an enriched sound environment -exposing rats to piano music- helps the recovery from neural damage. Rats with a damaged brain showed signs of recovery after about fifty days of listening to Mozart piano sonates for about 12 hours a day. Compared to rats that also had brain damage, but that did not listen to music, they performed significantly better in a spatial memory task (finding their way in a maze) and in their emotional reactivity (using a marble burying task).While it remains unclear whether sounds other than music would have the same effect, the study is a striking example of research showing that music has a larger role in shaping the brain than previously thought.Amagdei, A., Balteş, F., Avram, J., &amp;amp; Miu, A.

Now, it’s not unusual for Google to change their logo from day to day, but when I logged on this morning, I wondered why they had chosen crop circles.&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/"&gt;&lt;img title="1" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/1-300x86.gif" alt="1" width="300" height="86"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And clicking it displayed links to a ton of crop circle information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have discussed &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2008/06/secrets-of-crop-circles-revealed/"&gt;crop circles&lt;/a&gt; here at &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt; in the past, and we had a good time with it. And it’s always fun to listen to the explanations for crop circles by people who believe they are made by all manner of wonderfully crazy things, like alien space craft with cloaking devices, or by atmospheric vortexes, electromagnetic fields, plasma storms, or my personal favorite, subterranean earth gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is Google getting mixed up in this? Has the Googleplex been taken over by aliens? Why would otherwise rational people promote these pieces of artwork that are made with a length of rope and a board?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google Twitter post of GPS coordinates (51.327629, -0.5616088) spread across the Internet at about the time the crop circle logo went live, sending tweeple scurrying to Google Earth software, where they discovered that the digits denoted Horsell, U.K., site of the first UFO landing in H.G. Wells’s novel &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last week, Google ran an alien themed logo, depicting a flying saucer abducting the letter ‘O.’ Clicking on the logo brought Google users to a search page about ‘unexplained phenomenon.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So . . . Is this all being done simply in recognition of the father of science fiction’s ( H.G. Wells) upcoming birthday? Is Google just having some fun promoting Google Earth? Does it point to some special Google event taking place in the coming week? Or is it Google’s way of saying look to the skies? What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253050866240"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16077">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/67643371e66b8170</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="General"/><category term="Richard Wade"/><title type="html">Ask Richard: When Religious Friends Ask Us to Not Say “Oh My God”</title><published>2009-09-15T21:00:46Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T21:00:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/15/ask-richard-when-religious-friends-ask-us-to-not-say-%e2%80%9coh-my-god%e2%80%9d/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Richard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back I was waiting for a lecture to start with a friend when I casually used the word “God” in a sentence.  I don’t remember the exact sentence, but it was probably something like “oh my God,” certainly not an uncommon turn of phrase.  She then asked me, politely, if I could not use the word “God” because it goes against her religion.  Well, for that lecture at least I stopped using the word, but that’s probably because I wasn’t really using any words, it stunned me into silence.  I was caught totally off guard and, as an atheist, felt like it was wrong for her to request that.  Even so, I felt bad about it after, to the point that I was paranoid about telling other friends I have with views similar to mine, because they could agree with her and slam me down.  I’m still friends with her, and it’s never come up again, even though I know I’ve used the word again, in much the same way.  I didn’t want to be confrontational about it, she’s a good person, even if I believe she’s a bit misguided, but it’s stuck with me for a while now.  I still feel like I missed a beat and I should have said something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could you please advise me as to how I should have handled the situation?  Not because I want to confront her, but because I’d like to know how to deal with that sort of situation, should it arise again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;
Strong but Silent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Strong but Silent,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would appear from the outcome that you handled the situation quite well.  You said nothing, and since then, when you have used the word “God” in a similar way, your friend has raised no further objection. What you said sounded pretty colloquial, so maybe while in a less fussy mood she shrugged it off.   Perhaps she has relaxed her feelings about it, realizing that for American conversational standards, she was being unreasonable.  Or maybe she’s simply given up on that issue with you. So you were passive about it, and it seems to have blown over.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that only worked because of a change in her.  There is a change in yourself that you need to make, because being passive will only work some times, and you want to have better ways of dealing with the demands and requests that people make of you.  I think that what feels unfinished for you is how you muffled yourself both with her and your friends, and things got better only because she somehow adjusted.  You’re dissatisfied because you didn’t take an active role in the situation.  I think that dissatisfaction means that you’re coming to a point where you will be more able to take that active role.  It will take time and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the impression that you are very sensitive to the feelings of your friends, and equally sensitive to criticism from your friends.  You even kept quiet to those of your friends who share similar views, for fear of their disapproval.  Such sensitivity is an admirable trait only when you balance it with being able to freely express yourself.  That balance will be different with each friend, and it will change with different situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what should we do when a religious friend asks us to curb our speech or behavior in some way that we think is unreasonable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we should avoid the extremes on either side.  Being aggressive, and telling them to go stuff their objections up their lower digestive tract is counter-productive if you’re interested in preserving the friendship. On the other hand, being passive and censoring yourself into muteness will be counter-productive to keeping your sanity. The balance that I’ve &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/25/ask-richard-paying-for-religious-activities-that-he-doesn%E2%80%99t-believe-in/"&gt;discussed in another post&lt;/a&gt; is called assertion. Read the assertion bill of rights there and imagine yourself applying it when someone like your friend makes a similar unreasonable demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you would say to her in a warm and friendly way something like, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh come on, you’re going to hear “Oh my God” a hundred times a day. You know I’m not saying it to be disrespectful, it’s just a common expression.  If it really bothers you, I’ll try to avoid it, but please don’t get on my case if I slip. That habit is not out of disrespect. I care about your feelings, but you don’t want me to start tip-toeing around you, do you? We have to respect each other, but we also have to accept each other as we are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By saying something like this, you will have brought up the point of what was your &lt;em&gt;intention&lt;/em&gt; by the God remark.  You are establishing a general understanding that you and she have a shared intention to &lt;em&gt;respect&lt;/em&gt; each other balanced with a shared intention to &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; each other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That balance of  being mutually willing to adjust because of respect, and to relax because of acceptance can and should apply to your other, like-thinking friends as well.  You need to have them as allies with whom you can confide without inhibition, because being an atheist on your own is tough.  Comrades are essential.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong but Silent, when you recognize that you really &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; strong, you won’t have to be so silent.  As time goes by and you successfully negotiate more of these assertive balances in your friendships, you’ll gain a greater general self-confidence.  You’ll see that you are strong in a mature way that means you can be in command of your behavior without stifling yourself, and you can also fully express yourself without deliberately offending others. You’ll be able to hold your tongue when it’s appropriate, to speak out when it’s appropriate, and to do both in ways that are not hurtful to yourself or others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ever someone does have some criticism for you, you’ll be able to hear that criticism without humiliation. From that mature strength you’ll also be able to offer criticism to others without crushing their self-esteem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your friends will benefit from such relationships with you, and you will benefit from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;

The most dramatic demonstration might be Daniel Simons' "experiment" that took place before participants even knew they were being studied:

More recently researchers have uncovered a similar phenomenon for sounds: Change deafness. Listeners are asked to listen to two one-second clips separated by 350 milliseconds of white noise. The clips are composite sounds, combinations of four different familiar sounds:

 

If one of the sounds is simply omitted during the second clip, then most people notice the difference. But if it's replaced by a different sound, then the change becomes much more difficult to notice.

But why? Are we simply unable to parse out the different sounds in the mishmashed sound clip? Or do the substituted sounds sound too similar? Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Nothing strange about that. What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a little bit strange is that my friend has written a draft of a book—a novel—and is about to start editing it. He’s asked me to take a look in a month or two, and tell him if it’s any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before the rest of you start going and getting ideas, I should explain that Nigel is a very good friend, I believe he &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; write; and I showed him Josh Olson’s &lt;a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/09/i_will_not_read.php"&gt;rant&lt;/a&gt; and only then said I’d do it (&lt;a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/09/harlan_ellisons.php"&gt;this Seussization&lt;/a&gt; of that rant is superb, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I telling you this? Well, it’s not because he’s taken a rather startling event from the end of my DPhil as the basis of his plot, nor because it sounds like &lt;a href="http://www.lablit.com/the_list"&gt;Lab Lit&lt;/a&gt;. I mention it because I’ve been completely crap at writing recently, but for some reason I don’t feel &lt;em&gt;jealous&lt;/em&gt; that he’s managed to finish his book first: rather, I am chuffed to pieces and feel spurred to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I don’t feel jealous of Jenny’s nicely lined-up kit, nor her writing of papers. There is a very slight pang because dammit, I enjoyed doing all that, and I don’t get to do it any more; but most of all I am happy that she and other people here are still doing good science. It makes me happy even if I can’t take a direct part in it (even if she still hasn’t let me come in to split her cells—come to that, &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/scurry/blog"&gt;SCurry&lt;/a&gt; isn’t letting me near his x-ray sets, the tight-fisted barsteward).  It’s not jealousy, but rather a vicarious chuffedness. And it inspires me to do more, do &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’m going to have a look at that half-written short story.

It consists of an object - any object will do - and a printed caption, put together in a whitewashed room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suspect the printed captions and the whitewashed rooms will come to be seen by future generations as clichés of this art movement, just as with the tiresome forms in Mannerism or the stark colours of the Pre-Raphaelites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conceptual art will then be seen - rightly, I think - as an effect and a function of the emergence of dedicated, well-lit galleries in the post-war world. Once these spaces became available, and the convention took hold of presenting an object in that space with a caption and calling it &lt;em&gt;Art&lt;/em&gt;, I suppose conceptual art was a near-inevitability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damien Hirst has done well out of this artistic movement. He is not known for the galleries or for the printed captions, but he does create some of the objects - perhaps the least important component of conceptual art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hirst has been in the news recently, deploying the law: full details are &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/damien-hirst-in-vicious-feud-with-teenage-artist-over-a-box-of-pencils-1781463.html"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summary, Hirst used both civil law and criminal law against a nineteen year artist called Cartrain. The civil law used was the law of copyright or design infringement and the criminal law used was theft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hirst of course cuts a ridiculous figure. Here, one cannot really improve upon &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/14/charlie-brooker-damien-hirst"&gt; Charlie Brooker &lt;/a&gt; in The Guardian:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Overvalued, irksome, conceited, pudge-faced, balding, boring, awful celebrity art nob Damien Hirst has apparently become embroiled in a ludicrous feud with a 19-year-old graffiti artist called Cartrain. Hostilities erupted in 2008, when Cartrain created a sarcastic collage that included an image of Hirst's stupid bling-encrusted skull "artwork" (the one that reportedly sold for £50m at auction, although that figure is disputed by virtually anyone who still retains some degree of faith in humankind).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"When Cartrain's humorous collages were put up for sale online, Hirst reportedly complained to the Design and Artists Copyright Society. The website selling Cartrain's works buckled under legal pressure and surrendered the collages, along with an apology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Anyway, so far, so 2008. But the Hirst-Cartrain battle resumed in July this year, when the latter strolled into Tate Britain and allegedly removed a box of pencils from Hirst's art installation "Pharmacy". Cartrain then created a mock ransom note, demanding the return of his collages in exchange for the pencils. If the artworks weren't given back, then the pencils would be "sharpened".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"All rather daft and annoying. But a few weeks ago, Cartrain was arrested by Scotland Yard's art and antiques squad and told that the pencils had been valued at £500,000. The officers also initially arrested Cartrain's father, on the grounds that he was "suspected of harbouring the pencils".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Er, where was The Guardian's libel reader when we needed him/her? Imagine what Simon Singh could have got away with...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From a legal perspective, Hirst appears generally to be in the right. The theft seems obvious, even if the police involvement is needlessly heavy-handed. The copyright or design infringement may be less clear-cut, as does the apparent remedy of forced delivery-up of the infringing pieces, but Hirst is (on balance) within his legal rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But - as with another legal manoeuvre we can all think of - his use of the law here is misconceived. The issues involved really could be better dealt with by other means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, one cannot be surprised by Hirst. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see this readiness of a conceptual artist to use the law in such a misconceived way as similar to that of some CAM practitioners and various religious enthusiasts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;At least neither Cartrain nor Charlie Brooker accused Damien f happily promoting bogus art without a jot of talent.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(And nor do I...)&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-4979321687206072122?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253046615536"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6588342610746853835">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/be4f39790bd32049</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Darwin's Dilemma</title><published>2009-09-15T19:25:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T19:46:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/09/darwins-dilemma.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6588342610746853835/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6588342610746853835" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The students in my class have to read Icons of Evolution by Jonathan Wells.

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for my lack of blogging of late. I am away from home, flitting about the East Coast of the USA for a series of talks and conferences, covering science communication, scepticism, and science. I have already done Dragon*Con which was amazing, Vanderbilt Uni at Nash&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5621.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="border:2px solid black;margin:6px" title="IMG_5621" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5621.JPG" alt="IMG_5621" width="268" height="171"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ville, NECSS in NYC and am currently on a bus (with wifi) to Boston to do SiTP and a talk at Harvard Medical School. We are currently speeding through New England on the Interstate 90, on the outskirts NYC (see the pic left) on the awesome BoltBus!*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled to be a speaker at the Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism (&lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org/index.htm"&gt;NECSS&lt;/a&gt;) in NYC on Saturday September 12. A joint effort of New York City Skeptics (&lt;a href="http://www.nycskeptics.org/"&gt;NYCS&lt;/a&gt;) and The New England Skeptical Society (&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/"&gt;NESS&lt;/a&gt;), NECSS was a huge success. The one day conference was a sell out with over 400 people attending and many people turned away at the door. It’s hard to believe that in a town of over 9 million people, the NYCS are only 2 years old. But, based on the success of Saturday’s conference, a skeptical group in NYC is certainly something that the city wants. The line-up was stellar and featured Professor &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Offit"&gt;Paul Ofitt&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Wiseman, George Hrab, the SGU team doing a live podcast, Carl Zimmer, John Rennie, John Snyder and many others all overseen and slickly mc’eed by Jamy Ian Swiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5374.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="border:2px solid black" title="IMG_5374" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5374-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_5374" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGU are joined live on stage for Q&amp;amp;A by Paul Offit and Jamy Ian Swiss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day kicked off with a talk from Paul Offit, the director of the education centre at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, author of “&lt;em&gt;Autism’s False Prophets&lt;/em&gt;“, “&lt;em&gt;Vaccinated&lt;/em&gt;” and the co-inventor of the vaccine for rotavirus. Paul talked about the public perception of vaccines as a result of the campaign by the anti-vaxers including Jenny McCarthy, in the USA. (See what they have to say about him here at &lt;a href="http://www.pauloffit.com/"&gt;pauloffit.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a panel discussing Skepticism and Media with John Snyder, pediatrician and contributor to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/"&gt;Science Based Medicine blog&lt;/a&gt;, and Howard Schneider, journalist and academic at Stony Brook College. Our esteemed moderator was John Rennie recently retired editor-in-chief for Scientific American magazine and a recipient of the Carl Sagan award for the public understanding of science. Rennie also penned one of the most downloaded articles for Scientific American called “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=15-answers-to-creationist"&gt;15 answers to creationist nonsens&lt;/a&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;” in 2002 (I interviewed John for the Zone – listen to upcoming episodes for full details John’s work). We were invited to give a brief overview of our involvement with the media with an emphasis on conveying skeptical information, then John Rennie opened up the panel for discussion. John Snyder spoke about the damage of “false balance” in journalism and whilst balance is important in most stories, when it comes to giving a platform to anti-vaxers, it can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/7529_791303075140_911470_45830628_2452202_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="7529_791303075140_911470_45830628_2452202_n" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/7529_791303075140_911470_45830628_2452202_n-300x225.jpg" alt="7529_791303075140_911470_45830628_2452202_n" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;L-R: Me, John Snyder and Howard Schneider. We were later joined by Carl Zimmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally Howard came to the defence of journalists, by asserting that it is not their responsibility to educate the public, rather the public should research the information presented to them to determine where the truth lies. This was where things began to get feisty and interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to audience members, it was during Howard’s presentation that I was apparently shaking my head and indicating to John Rennie that I has something to say. On the topic of false balance, I suggested to Howard that if he was to do a piece on the Holocaust deniers, he would not get an opinion from a holocaust denier, not would a journo consider a flat-earther a legitimate part of a science based story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion was in response to John Snyder’s presentation about the NBC Dateline piece on Andrew Wakefield, “&lt;a href="http://insidedateline.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/08/25/2044554.aspx"&gt;A Dose of Controversy&lt;/a&gt;” that had recently aired in the USA. This credulous piece by Matt Lauer and co., gave substantial air time to the discredited scientist and his quackery for autism, including invasive techniques such as colonoscopies on children for which there is no evidence of a benefit. John and I asserted to Howard that when it comes to important health issues such as vaccination, any hint of false claims such as they cause SIDS autism, cancer, contain aborted feotuses, toxic levels of heavy metals plants a seed with parents, scares them and as Paul had also stated, people are very hard to “unscare”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:258px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/9517_1214976567955_1035042875_661782_8067458_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="9517_1214976567955_1035042875_661782_8067458_n" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/9517_1214976567955_1035042875_661782_8067458_n-300x225.jpg" alt="9517_1214976567955_1035042875_661782_8067458_n" width="248" height="196"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;A packed house. Photo by Tim Farley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opinion was echoed very succinctly (more so than I did) by an audience member once questions were opened up to the panel. Questions ranged from why are parents who do not vaccinate not held responsible for the death of those who die as a result of a loss of herd immunity to why are the authorities not doing anything about the anti-vax lobby?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lively and interesting panel which I thoroughly enjoyed and it didn’t finish after we left the stage. The four of us continued our discussions in the green room, to the bemusement of several other participants who were milling around. John made a very good point about the social aspects of vaccine deniers and asked why the social and psychological issues of this area are not addressed. We all agreed that this is a  story that has not been covered and would certainly be a worthwhile endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard then asked me how much time anti-vaxers should be given by the medias and my emphatic answer was none. I suggested to Howard that unless journos “went in deep” (John’s phrase) and challenged everything they said, instead of letting them state their piece largely unopposed as was my experience, then they deserved no platform at all. Eventually it was agreed that the anti-vax lobby need be treated as different beasts when it comes to balance in journalism. Because they don’t deserve a platform for their lies and misinformation. Even Howard seemed to agree (mostly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:272px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/9517_1214977687983_1035042875_661793_243583_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="9517_1214977687983_1035042875_661793_243583_n" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/9517_1214977687983_1035042875_661793_243583_n-300x225.jpg" alt="9517_1214977687983_1035042875_661793_243583_n" width="262" height="196"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I interview Travis Roy (aka Scooter) on stage after the conference. Photo Tim Farley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased that the feedback since the conference has been overwhelmingly positive for our media panel. Let’s hope we can do more like these, especially given the (perceived?) gap between what scientists really get up to and how it is reported in the media (this was also an underlying topic discussed throughout the weekend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NECSS was a huge success and plans are already underway for a bigger and better event in 2010. Thanks to NESS and NYCS for putting on a  well organised and top notch event. I hope to be a part of the con again one day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*BTW, I thoroughly recommend the BoltBus from NYC: $14 on a very comfy bus with free wifi and power points, plenty of leg room and space – thanks to Rebecca and Scooter for the tip off).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is a &lt;a href="http://futurity.org/about/" title=""&gt;collaborative effort of, for now, 35 major Universities&lt;/a&gt; in the United States (those include, for my local readers, &lt;a href="http://www.unc.edu/" title=""&gt;UNC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.duke.edu/" title=""&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; - why is NCSU lagging behind?!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is the answer to the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How will the public learn about important breakthroughs at leading research universities as traditional news outlets continue to shrink?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is taking selected science stories from the participating Universities and putting them together in one place, sorted by topics and searchable by tags (by topic or by school). Let's hope that more schools choose to join in, and also, that their feed gets incorporated on major news sites. The site is a "pull" strategy vehicle (it will be found and read by people who are interested in science and actively seaching for information) and inclusion on front pages of mainstream media sites would add a "push" strategy (making sure everybody sees the science news, even those who are not specifically looking, but may say "Wow - this is cool!") which is necessary for more widespread popularisation of science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/new_science_news_service.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/YVsQhyN-uPE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253041275468"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/15/undue-influenza/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/490e09abe0108225</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alt-Med"/><category term="Antiscience"/><title type="html">Undue influenza</title><published>2009-09-15T18:30:30Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T18:30:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/15/undue-influenza/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The flu season is rapidly approaching, and as you may already know, swine flu is already here. There was a case of it at PAX, and a friend of mine at Gnomedex had it as well. Some doctors I know are seeing far more flu cases than usual for this time of year, and so when the real season hits we may be in for quite a ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly urge you &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1229"&gt;to read this influenza primer&lt;/a&gt; by my friend Dr. Joe Albietz. I’ve linked to his stuff before; he’s a pediatrician and skeptic who cares very deeply about the health of children. He is a clear and thoughtful writer, and his primer will give you a huge amount of basic info on the &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; flu as well as the swine flu, and why he’s worried about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antivax folks have been spreading their usual manure about the swine flu, and (as also usual) giving bad and frankly dangerous advice about it. Go read what Dr. Albietz has to say, and then talk to your own doctor. This is a serious matter, and we need to rely on serious professionals.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253039389821"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=18175">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d72148f5246ac7bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="financial crisis"/><category term="macroeconomics"/><title type="html">Lucas on the Shortcomings of Modern Macro</title><published>2009-09-15T18:22:58Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T18:22:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/lucas-on-the-shortcomings-of-modern-macro/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">And so the debate about the state of modern macroeconomics continues.

Mostly it's to eliminate comment spam, but it also means the rare death threat is not going to post without me approving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second of all, why would you think you have the evidential basis to discern the religious convictions (or lack thereof) of either this blogger or her offspring?  Even if you did, why would that be germane to a discussion of a classroom snake?  And why, in any case, would it make you feel justified in asserting "you have forfeit your life"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you feel like you have an important message to convey to someone.  I would like to suggest that I am not the right audience for that message (and that the readers of the Friday Sprog Blogging feature probably aren't, either).  And, I'm disinclined to let you hijack my soapbox to convey it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have better luck getting your message out by way of a blog of your very own.  You can get one for free from Blogger and WordPress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/to_those_who_think_its_appropr.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/EEWexIQInSU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253036854211"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=6417">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a04aa12bfd5c1d1e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Autism Advocacy Conference"/><category term="Autism Lit"/><category term="Autism Organizations"/><category term="Divorce"/><category term="New Jersey"/><category term="new york"/><category term="guide"/><category term="surfing"/><category term="Wiley"/><title type="html">Market Guide, Local Meetings, Surf’s Up</title><published>2009-09-15T16:59:42Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T16:59:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/market-guide-local-meetings-surfs-up/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Noted business publisher John Wiley and Sons has released the new book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6ad4eb/a_practical_guide"&gt;A Practical Guide to Autism: What Every Parent, Family Member, and Teacher Needs to Know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by Fred Volkmar and Lisa Wiesner. Pretty exhaustive topic, and indeed this book provides comprehensive information about recent scientific developments with a guide for how they’re being implemented. Issues are presented with charts, Q.-and-A., and chapters that vary from describing diagnostic issues to stating very specifically how to expand and evaluate the services one is receiving. Topics include definition and causes of autism, diagnoses and services, and overview of educational programs, teaching specific skills, working with children and adults, managing medical issues and problems, safety, seizures, regression, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to make one correction to the puzzle-piece motif often used as autism’s … what? logo? … today, it would be to disassemble the pieces and show them alongside scissors and glue, like today’s offering. Not only do we all have a mess of pieces, but we’re always trying to not just assemble them, but fix them in a good order to last. Worst part of that, I guess, is that we’re never ever sure how much we succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t make the actual meeting because you don’t live in the area, you can still check out a couple of relatively local events that could serve as good models for meetings to be organized in your part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NAA NY Metro Chapter, for instance, will hold a Parent Network Exchange Meeting with the subject “How to Keep Your Marriage Strong While Raising a Child With Special Needs (a poser, often), on Thursday, Sept. 17, 6:30-9:00 p.m. at the library at 408 East 79th Street in Manhattan. The husband-and-wife presenters, both social psychologists and parents of a child with special needs, will explore why the rate of divorce is much higher among parents taking care of a child with special needs. Topics will include financial stress, exhaustion, “and the sheer challenge of just getting through each day.” More is &lt;a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102679138519&amp;amp;s=1&amp;amp;e=001lsm0QsTiqFzuH7uAQtJtRW8ZMnS"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Virginia chapter of the Autism Society of America is also hosting their annual conference at the Pullman Plaza Hotel this weekend. &lt;a href="http://www.aswv.org/"&gt;“Climbing Mountains to Inclusion”&lt;/a&gt; will bring in speakers Paula Kluth, a former special education teacher and inclusion facilitator, and Stephen Shore, a professor at Adelphia University who teaches courses in special education and autism. (Shore was diagnosed with autism as a child.) Workshops run Thursday through Saturday. An awards dinner banquet will be Friday evening, featuring stand-up comedy and dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Autism Family Services of New Jersey really rode the curl last Sunday with its Fifth Annual Beach Bash in Belmar. Surfing is coming to be seen as calming on many youngsters with autism. Surfers rode in to shore accompanied by a professional surfer from the San Clemente, Calif.-based &lt;a href="http://www.surfershealing.org/"&gt;Surfers Healing &lt;/a&gt;organization.&lt;/p&gt;

Dave is a very open-minded fellow, in the sense that he thought it might behoove his flock to have them hear what scientists think some plausible natural and normal explanations there are for the various supernatural and paranormal phenomena that his members tend to believe in and talk about at such conferences (there was even a ghost hunting expedition on the Queen Mary later that night, but I was wasted from flying for so long and passed on being spooked on the ship).&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My keynote talk was &lt;a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/weird-things/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why People Believe Weird Things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a shortened version of which you can see on &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/michael_shermer_on_believing_strange_things.html" title="WATCH Michael&amp;#39;s TEDTalk"&gt;Ted.com&lt;/a&gt;, where I originally delivered this lecture. It includes much discussion about how east it is to fool the brain, perceptual illusions, cognitive missteps such as the confirmation bias, priming effects (where you prime the brain to see or hear the world in a certain way), and especially the power of expectation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, everyone there was most friendly toward me, even though what I was basically telling them is that pretty much everything they believe about the paranormal is wrong. Many came up after to tell me that they too are skeptical of many of the phony baloney scam artists there are out there who are ripping people off with various flim flams, but of course they added the proviso that not all paranormal phenom are perpetrated hoaxes and that they like science because it can help them to discriminate between the true and false paranormal patterns. Okay, whatever it takes to get people interested in science, however, I did make it clear that to date science has yet to find any conclusive evidence for ESP and the like, so that instead of turning to the paranormal as an explanation for presently unsolved mysteries, why not just leave it as a mystery until science can explain it? In science, I noted, it’s okay to say “I don’t know.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shermer/sets/72157622252941593/"&gt;some iPhone pics&lt;/a&gt; I snapped while waiting for my talk to begin. Included is a pic of Frank Sumption and I. Frank is the inventor of “Frank’s Box,” which I wrote about in the &lt;a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/2009/01/telephone-to-the-dead/"&gt;January, 2009 issue of &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Frank’s Box is also called the “Telephone to the Dead,” and consists of a simplified radio receiver that cycles through the stations at breakneck speed such that one only hears snippets of words and sentence fragments, and it is here where the dead allegedly sneak in their messages to us living (or, where in my explanation, the “patternicity” happens, or the natural tendency to find meaningful patterns in random noise. I also snapped some pics of Bruce Goldberg, with whom I once appeared in the mid 1990s on a television show about past lives. Bruce is still churning out the self-published books, now on how he communicates with time travelers from the future. Finally, I will admit that New Agers have the coolest crystals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight is my last night hosting &lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?p=387"&gt;Boston Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/a&gt; . . . at least for a little while. The reason, as some of you may know or guess, is that I’m going to be leaving Boston at the end of this month &lt;em&gt;in search of adventure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sidandrebecca.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin-left:5px" title="sidandrebecca" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sidandrebecca-300x287.jpg" alt="sidandrebecca" width="300" height="287"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last week I mentioned that I had &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/i-quit-my-schmob/"&gt;quit my schmob&lt;/a&gt;, which of course was just one piece of my master plan. Yesterday, I received word that I had been granted a visa to live in the UK, meaning that I can finally reside on the same continent as my dear husband (shown at right wearing Surlyramics). I leave in less than two weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next several months, I plan to visit a lot of new places (adventure!). Here’s my itinerary . . . if you live near any of these places and want to hang out, please let me know! Also, if you know of any nearby skeptic meet-ups that want a speaker or just another warm body, give me the info and I’ll try to make it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, September 15 (That’s Tonight!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?p=387"&gt;Boston Skeptics in the Pub with Dr. Rachael Dunlop&lt;/a&gt;! Be there. (SitP will continue with my good friend Liz Gaston hosting, and with the help of our fellow Boston Skeptics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, September 26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is my last full day in Boston, so I’m considering having a party in my newly-emptied apartment. More details on that will come as soon as I’m confident I’ll be able to empty my apartment in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, September 28&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At 7am, I’ll arrive in Iceland. I have a 9-hour layover, and will be meeting up with at least one Twitter-friend. I’d like to check out Reykjavik before relaxing at the Blue Lagoon, before hopping back over to the airport for my flight to London that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, September 30—Monday, October 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s TAM London! I’m going to be at &lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org/blog/TAMLondon/2009/09/tam-london-fringe-events/"&gt;as many fringe events as possible&lt;/a&gt;, plus of course at the main event. I hope to be able to blog about it as I go, so you can follow along here at Skepchick or in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, October 13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Singapore! I’ll be spending a few days in and around Singapore, after which I’ll be traveling around Southeast Asia with friends until October 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe Sometime in November?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Norway! Some very cool skeptics have invited me out to Norway to speak at a meet-up or two. We’re working out the dates now—they’ve been very patient with me as I solidify my schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, November 20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The week before Thanksgiving, I’ll be back in the States for &lt;a href="http://skepticon.broadcast44.com/"&gt;Skepticon II at Missouri State University&lt;/a&gt;! I’m mega-excited about this, since I’ll be hanging with D.J. Grothe, P.Z. Myers, and other people without initials for first names like Joe Nickell, Dan Barker, Victor Stenger, Robert Price, and Richard Carrier. This is going to be a wonderful (and FREE) event, and I encourage you all to attend. If you can’t attend, you can still help them out by &lt;a href="http://broadcast44.com/FSM/donate.htm"&gt;donating to help cover the costs&lt;/a&gt; of flying out so many awesome people (plus me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s what’s going on! There may be other places and dates added in the near future, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already written about finding your voice, linking to the really good Rational Moms piece about that. But let’s say you’re ready to go, and you’ve got yourself all ready to go. Where can you find out what else is going on, so you can sign up to help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I got the site for you: &lt;a href="http://ohioskeptic.com/grassrootsskeptics/"&gt;Grassroots Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; is the place to be. It’s a compendium of skeptical events for, well, grassroots efforts to make the world a more rational place. They have a calendar with events listed, a forum and links to other venues as well. They’re just starting out, so there’s not a huge amount of info there yet, but this is a really good idea and could use your support.

OSX or Windows, iPhone or Blackberry, Myspace or Facebook, Ruby on Rails or PHP. Everyone has an opinion as to which is &amp;quot;better&amp;quot;, and as often as not it seems to be the far less popular one in terms of overall adoption (such as OSX or RoR) that the experts like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this quite a bit in the online poker world too. Before the UIGEA forced them out of the market, Party Poker was so much larger than any of the other sites that even after they were forced to turn away 85% of their customers they were still virtually tied for second place, and not too far off of first. But hardly anyone would call Party Poker &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; than Poker Stars, or maybe even Full Tilt. For one thing, their software was atrocious. Most of the programmers I know will tell you that PokerStars is rather impressive from an engineering standpoint, and most players would agree about their superior ease of use, responsiveness, etc. On Party, the software crashed all the time, but was still more reliable than their customer support. You were lucky to get any response at all from their reps if you sent in a problem, and if you did it was unhelpful, incomprehensible, and sometimes even rude. PokerStars has always had someone who actually speaks English respond to you with actual help in a few hours. If you compared the two sites from the user experience standpoint, it was like the difference between Edvard Munch’s &amp;quot;The Scream&amp;quot; and the crayon drawing your 3 year-old made that’s hanging on your fridge. They’re both sort of the same thing, but one belongs in a museum and the other is going in the trash as soon as you can do it without hurting a little kid’s feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet Party Poker was massive and PokerStars, while still most likely very profitable and better in almost every way, was considerably less successful. Why? Because &amp;quot;better&amp;quot;, as used generally, is a totally meaningless term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two competing products or services, even in the same industry, compete across a number of different battlefields and usually only one or two of them matter. I call them the critical points of differentiation, and they’re what determines who gets Windows market share and who gets OSX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take mobile devices for instance. If you read much in the way of gadget blogs or tech-related news, you’ve heard about the iPhone 20 times a day for the last two years. The only time you hear about RIM is when someone is lampooning their new products or talking about how much they &amp;quot;just don’t get it&amp;quot;. And yet while Apple’s sales have been impressive at about 20 million units in 2 and a quarter years, Blackberry sold almost 8 million units &lt;i&gt;in the last fiscal quarter&lt;/i&gt;. And Windows Mobile, about which a favorable word has not been uttered in all of history, sold 20 million units in 2008 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the question is, if the iPhone is so much “better”, then why are Blackberry and WinMo outselling it by a wide margin? Surely it’s not because of brand awareness. Nobody beats Apple on that. The answer is because on many of the critical points of differentiation, the competition wins hands-down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to line up the many features on which the phones compete, you’d arrive at a table something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*such as remote wipes, Blackberry/Active Sync server support, Word/Excel support, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to some of the critical points of differentiation, the Blackberry and its WinMo cousins are clearly inferior (most notably the consumer ones) and for some (most notably the business ones) they’re clearly far superior. And the market demand for those individual points determines which is the winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was similar in online poker. If you compared Party and Stars, you’d get a table like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;td valign="top" width="74"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokerstars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="77"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Party Poker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="103"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="74"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="77"&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;x&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="103"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything Else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="74"&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;x&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="77"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that people play poker, especially online, primarily to make money, and how much money they make is directly correlated with the amount of action the site has. Party Poker was aggressive at marketing, especially in the early days of poker on TV, and as such they built a massive user base early on. And because they had the most action, especially amongst average Joes who were pretty easy to win against, they earned the biggest marketing budget to spend on ads, which in turn brought in new action. They also won the word of mouth game too because guys like me were making boatloads of cash there and not nearly so much on PokerStars, and of course were telling our friends about it. Plus they had a very lucrative affiliate program, which nets traffic directly and leads to lots of links which also helps boost your popularity with search engines, so despite almost everyone who played at both sites considering them inferior, they were getting more players through every conceivable channel. I can’t tell you how many times I or one of my friends said something like “Jesus I hate Party Poker but those $30/$60 games are so good.” Some of us even wrote in begging Poker Stars to advertise on TV so they’d get more action and we could play there instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the iPhone, PokerStars wasn’t a dud by any means, because &amp;quot;everything else&amp;quot; counted for something. Their tournaments, which they were the first site to really promote, brought lots of suckers to the tables and made sure that every week a number of them fell ass-backwards into enough cash to play some decent stakes ring games. And for the people who just played to have fun those tournaments, combined with the better software and support, at least sometimes made them not mind that they were losing more than they would have against the weaker competition over on Party Poker. Plus general randomness combined with superstition ensured that some people who tried both sites had better luck on Stars and saw a pattern where none really existed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite all that, Party’s peak traffic was many times that of Stars, and the reason was that they were better at the one thing the market prized above all of the rest combined by a factor of five. The same is almost always observable in any product that the &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; call &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; but still greatly undersells its competition. It’s why Windows is so much more popular than OSX, and it’s why Michael Bay grosses 10 times what the Coen Brothers do. People just want a cheap computer that runs lots of programs and a movie with a couple shots of exposed breasts and a bunch of crap blowing up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question I always ask when someone says X &amp;quot;is better than Y&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;in what way(s)?&amp;quot; (It turns out people on arguing on the internet almost never stop to consider anything that deeply before typing, even at the places supposedly populated by an above-average-intelligence crowd.) The only way one product is ever truly and generally better than another, in the way critics use the term, is if it is actually superior at every point of differentiation, which is incredibly rare. (And if someone ever makes that claim you’ve almost certainly got a fanboy on your hands so just hang up the metaphorical phone.) If it’s not, then you have to ask yourself on which points is the product better, and which ones are the ones that really matter, because any business trying to make something that isn’t better, in terms of the critical points of differentiation, is really just a charity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you’re examining your own product, it’s important to ask who your competition is, in what ways are you better than them, in what ways are they better than you, and how much do people really care each of those points. If you find that people care more about the points where you’re losing, then you’re wasting your time. &lt;/p&gt;

The reason, as some of you may know or guess, is that I’m going to be leaving Boston at the end of this month &lt;em&gt;in search of adventure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sidandrebecca.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="sidandrebecca" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sidandrebecca-300x287.jpg" alt="sidandrebecca" width="300" height="287"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last week I mentioned that I had &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/i-quit-my-schmob/"&gt;quit my schmob&lt;/a&gt;, which of course was just one piece of my master plan. Yesterday, I received word that I had been granted a visa to live in the UK, meaning that I can finally reside on the same continent as my dear husband (shown at right wearing Surlyramics). I leave in less than two weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next several months, I plan to visit a lot of new places (adventure!). Here’s my itinerary . . . if you live near any of these places and want to hang out, please let me know! Also, if you know of any nearby skeptic meet-ups that want a speaker or just another warm body, give me the info and I’ll try to make it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, September 15 (That’s Tonight!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?p=387"&gt;Boston Skeptics in the Pub with Dr. Rachael Dunlop&lt;/a&gt;! Be there. (SitP will continue with my good friend Liz Gaston hosting, and with the help of our fellow Boston Skeptics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, September 26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is my last full day in Boston, so I’m considering having a party in my newly-emptied apartment. More details on that will come as soon as I’m confident I’ll be able to empty my apartment in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, September 28&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At 7am, I’ll arrive in Iceland. I have a 9-hour layover, and will be meeting up with at least one Twitter-friend. I’d like to check out Reykjavik before relaxing at the Blue Lagoon, before hopping back over to the airport for my flight to London that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, September 30—Monday, October 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s TAM London! I’m going to be at &lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org/blog/TAMLondon/2009/09/tam-london-fringe-events/"&gt;as many fringe events as possible&lt;/a&gt;, plus of course at the main event. I hope to be able to blog about it as I go, so you can follow along here at Skepchick or in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, October 13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Singapore! I’ll be spending a few days in and around Singapore, after which I’ll be traveling around Southeast Asia with friends until October 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe Sometime in November?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Norway! Some very cool skeptics have invited me out to Norway to speak at a meet-up or two. We’re working out the dates now—they’ve been very patient with me as I solidify my schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, November 20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The week before Thanksgiving, I’ll be back in the States for &lt;a href="http://skepticon.broadcast44.com/"&gt;Skepticon II at Missouri State University&lt;/a&gt;! I’m mega-excited about this, since I’ll be hanging with D.J. Grothe, P.Z. Myers, and other people without initials for first names like Joe Nickell, Dan Barker, Victor Stenger, Robert Price, and Richard Carrier. This is going to be a wonderful (and FREE) event, and I encourage you all to attend. If you can’t attend, you can still help them out by &lt;a href="http://broadcast44.com/FSM/donate.htm"&gt;donating to help cover the costs&lt;/a&gt; of flying out so many awesome people (plus me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s what’s going on! There may be other places and dates added in the near future, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

She mentions his crazy outbursts – and even links to my story here on FriendlyAtheist about laughing at his accusations.  But she brings up something important to remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Galef says in his account, it’s almost impossible to do anything but laugh when faced with such ludicrousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, unfortunately, Donohue’s nonsensical temper tantrums are not only funny. They’re &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKLlxAgMO-w"&gt;also&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200702070005"&gt;often&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200412210001"&gt;hateful&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,451369,00.html"&gt;dangerously dismissive of the First Amendment&lt;/a&gt;. Donohue has positioned himself as the voice of American Catholicism and he both courts and manufactures controversy in order to get attention and to further his agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fair point – the nonsense he spouts shouldn’t be a laughing matter.  They do real harm, and not just to my feelings.  If anyone takes him seriously – and news outlets give him the platform to reach people – his twisted views are spread.  To that I say: and that’s exactly why we SHOULD laugh, to dismiss his ignorant and offensive influence.  If people see us laughing at him, it’s a powerful signal not to take it seriously.  (For more on this school of thought see &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;Myers, PZ&lt;/a&gt;.)  Plus, the silly accusations are usually funny as hell, aren’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue laughing at the punchline that is Bill Donohue, check out &lt;a href="http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1667"&gt;his press release&lt;/a&gt; about the new book.  Look at who he quotes as support.  Sing it with me: “One of these things is not like the others…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wake up, America! The secular minority has cut the brake cables on America’s In-God-We-Trust-Mobile™! Not even all 43 of our Christian presidents can save us now.” – Stephen Colbert, host of “The Colbert Report”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right.  He quoted &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/strong&gt; to bolster his argument.  Stephen Colbert.  The satirist.  I know there’s &lt;a href="http://hij.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/2/212"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; finding that conservatives are more likely to believe Colbert is doing some kind of complex double-satire, but do they think he lampooned President Bush to his face out of homage?  You would think Donohue’s press people would be younger and more aware of the act.  No, we have to assume that he used the quote on purpose, knowing that many people – a lot of his target audience, probably – would be fooled.  That’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still… I can’t help but laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

I happen to disagree with him &lt;a href="http://www.reasonproject.org/archive/item/the_strange_case_of_francis_collins2/"&gt;about Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt;, but I have to credit the force of Harris’s take-no-prisoners approach with regard to all forms of “faith”–even when I think it goes too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of taking on Collins, Harris also &lt;a href="http://www.reasonproject.org/archive/item/the_strange_case_of_francis_collins2/"&gt;argues against us and against &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–and for some time, I have been meaning to answer him on this. Life intervened until now; but I trust it is not too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris quotes one of our book’s passages in which we argue that if we can depolarize the science versus religion battle, we can likely broaden public acceptance of evolution. It’s an argument, Harris says, “that, I fear, most people would accept.” Unlike many New Atheists, then, Harris implicitly realizes the obvious and, indeed, commonsensical force of our argument–even though he rejects it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Harris reject our case? Let’s run through:&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to notice is that Mooney and Kirshenbaum are confused about the nature of the problem. The goal is not to get more Americans to merely accept the truth of evolution (or any other scientific theory); the goal is to get them to value the principles of reasoning and educated discourse that now make a belief in evolution obligatory. Doubt about evolution is merely a symptom of an underlying problem; the problem is faith itself—conviction without sufficient reason, hope mistaken for knowledge, bad ideas protected from good ones, good ideas occluded by bad ones, wishful thinking elevated to a principle of salvation, etc. Mooney and Kirshenbaum seem to imagine that we can get people to value intellectual honesty by lying to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with Harris about the importance of not only knowing the truth about evolution, but knowing something about critical thinking and the scientific method (which is after all how we know that evolution is good science in the first place). Yet it isn’t a lie that, as we write in the book, “A great many scientists believe in God with no sense of internal contradiction, just as many religious believers accept evolution as the correct theory to explain the development, diversity, and inter-relatedness of life on Earth.” This statement is factually true. Harris may think these people are wrong, but he can’t claim they don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, insofar as Harris thinks these people wrong, his disagreement with them is philosophical or theological in nature–not scientific. That’s also fine: But we’re talking about the promotion of science, not an atheistic worldview, in our book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is invariably advertised as an expression of “respect” for people of faith, this accommodationism is nothing more than naked condescension, motivated by fear. Mooney and Kirshenbaum assure us that people will choose religion over science, no matter how good a case is made against religion. In certain contexts, this fear is probably warranted. I wouldn’t be eager to spell out the irrationality of Islam while standing in the Great Mosque in Mecca. But let’s be honest about how Mooney and Kirshenbaum view public discourse in the United States: watch what you say, or the Christian mob will burn down the library of Alexandria all over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of bravado here. The point is not to watch what you say, but to understand the context in which you are trying to communicate—and to recognize that most Americans are not going to be dragged all the way from fundamentalism to atheism thanks to the force of reasoned arguments. No matter how much we may wish it, it just isn’t going to happen. Giving them some more moderate stopping off points along the way is the only common sense approach if you want to change minds, or change the culture. In this sense, what is derided as “accommodationism” is actually an extremely important position between two poles on the intellectual spectrum, a position where many people will want to reside–right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the “combativeness” of the “New Atheists” seems entirely collegial. We merely assume that our fellow Homo sapiens possess the requisite intelligence and emotional maturity to respond to rational argument, satire, and ridicule on the subject of religion—just as they respond to these discursive pressures on all other subjects. Of course, we could be wrong. But let’s admit which side in this debate currently views our neighbors as dangerous children and which views them as adults who might prefer not to be utterly mistaken about the nature of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly question the “collegiality” claim, but that’s another story. As for Harris, it seems to me he is simply being an idealist. There are worse things to be, of course. But the reality is that people don’t want to give up their beliefs, and will fight to hold on to them, dismissing many or all direct assaults. This is human nature. We need a narrative, an internal sense of who we are—and once we’ve got one, we fiercely protect it. (Also be sure to read Jean Kazez on &lt;a href="http://kazez.blogspot.com/2009/07/chris-mooneys-apostasy.html"&gt;whether ridicule works&lt;/a&gt; at changing minds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t view our neighbors as “dangerous children,” then; we view all humans as members of a species know for fiercely clinging to its own beliefs. That includes, most emphatically, the New Atheists. But that’s another post…..&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253028035640"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/are_we_not_good_enough_for_dar.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7a70b80c36205607</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="biology"/><title type="html">Are we not good enough for Darwin?</title><published>2009-09-15T15:43:59Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T15:43:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/are_we_not_good_enough_for_dar.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6173399/Charles-Darwin-film-too-controversial-for-religious-America.html"&gt;read something&lt;/a&gt; in international news that made me so mad I needed to share it with you:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/are_we_not_good_enough_for_dar/telegraph%20darwin.jpg" width="500" title="Too controversial?  For real?" alt="telegraph darwin.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right; my home country, the United States, &lt;i&gt;will not distribute this film.&lt;/i&gt;  There was no problem for &lt;a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com/"&gt;the movie Expelled&lt;/a&gt;, a poorly argued anti-evolution flop that grossed just $7,598,071 despite appearing on more than 1,000 screens.  And this new biopic, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974014/"&gt;Creation&lt;/a&gt;, is much more about Darwin's life and personal struggles (which were &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt;, by the way) than it is about evolution.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no information about the quality of this movie other than that reviews on the internet tell me it's pretty good.  But the story of Darwin's personal life is legitimately incredible.  Darwin realized, long before he published his &lt;i&gt;Origins of Species&lt;/i&gt;, what the mechanism of Natural Selection meant for the origin of man, including its religious implications.  As someone struggling with the death of his favorite child (daughter Annie), a steadfastly religious wife and a slow-witted son, Darwin's internal demons were -- in a way -- just as volatile as the ones he, Hooker and Huxley had to fight for evolution to triumph.  And  -- perhaps paramount to Darwin's struggles -- what of the ethical dilemma of robbing good people of their faith?  The last glimpse of Darwin's life I got to see was through the Off-Broadway play &lt;a href="http://www.atlantictheater.org/page.aspx?id=12016798"&gt;Trumpery&lt;/a&gt;, which was both riveting and tear-jerking.  (Image below courtesy of the &lt;a href="http://theater2.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/theater/reviews/06trum.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/are_we_not_good_enough_for_dar/Trum600.jpg" width="500" title="An excellent story, well-told, should always find its audience." alt="Trum600.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all of this -- plus the amazing story of the acceptance and resistance of evolution -- I want to see this new movie.  I want it to do well; I want it to be as good as my hopes for it are.  But I'll probably never get the chance in this country.  Why?
&lt;blockquote&gt;The film was chosen to open the Toronto Film Festival and has its British premiere on Sunday. It has been sold in almost every territory around the world, from Australia to Scandinavia.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, US distributors have resolutely passed on a film which will prove hugely divisive in a country where, according to a Gallup poll conducted in February, only 39 per cent of Americans believe in the theory of evolution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with us?  Is every major U.S. distributor really afraid to carry this?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping that this movie finds a distributor, and that someone steps up to the plate.  If they carried the rebellious &lt;i&gt;Fahrenheit 9/11&lt;/i&gt;, and they carried the thoroughly misleading &lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;, surely somebody will be brave enough to carry this one?  When I first heard this my first reaction was that I should start my own production company and distribute it myself, because this type of information/entertainment should be accessible, here of all places.  And yet, I have hopes for this movie.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope it's fair, intelligent and compassionate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope it's true and accurate, and I hope it tells a wonderful, riveting dramatic story.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I hope that reason eventually carries this day, both for this movie and for the larger issue of having an educated public.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/are_we_not_good_enough_for_dar.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253027651610"><id gr:original-id="http://marmorkrebs.blogspot.com/2009/09/experiment-gone-wrong-in-hong-kong.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1551fee75ca3471f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">An experiment gone wrong in Hong Kong?</title><published>2009-09-15T07:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T07:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/iAzhL4_Z37c/experiment-gone-wrong-in-hong-kong.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://marmorkrebs.blogspot.com/2009/09/experiment-gone-wrong-in-hong-kong.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I was re-reading the recent paper on the introduction of marbled crayfish in Italy, and noticed this:

&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1980s, he was on the top of the world, scientifically speaking. A brilliant virologist with an impressive record of accomplishment, publication, and funding, he seemed to be on a short track to an eventual Nobel Prize. Then something happened. The AIDS epidemic happened. Something about the AIDS epidemic led this excellent scientist in the late 1980s to fall directly into pseudoscience and crankery by latching onto and promoting the idea that HIV does not cause AIDS. Of course, at the time scientists didn't yet know a lot about the virus and how it slowly destroyed the immune system. There was a lot of room for new knowledge. It might have been possible that something other than HIV was contributing to the development of AIDS. However, science and evidence accumulated. More importantly, in the 1990s, new antiretroviral drugs were developed. The success at prolonging the lives of HIV patients of drug cocktails designed to target HIV by different mechanisms and thus forestall the development of resistance represented the final evidence that HIV definitely caused AIDS. Scientists' understanding of the virus had led for the first time to effective therapies--and in record time, a mere decade A deadly disease became a chronically manageable one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this mattered to HIV/AIDS denialists. They continued to believe that it couldn't possibly by HIV that cause the slow destruction of the immune system suffered by AIDS patients. They continued to insist that it must be some combination of pills, diseases spread by promiscuous sex, or other vague, unnamed factors. And Peter Duesberg was right there among them, destroying his own scientific career in the process. Oh, sure, he's recently tried to resurrect it by pushing an&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/04/peter_duesberg_chromosomal_chaos_and_can.php"&gt; interesting "everything old is new again" hypothesis for cancer causation&lt;/a&gt;, but even doing that he's behaved like a crank by branding his hypothesis The One True Cause of Cancer and castigating other scientists for not immediately appreciating his brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, for some reason that still escapes me, a whim took me and I decided to see what Duesberg was up to, scientifically speaking. So I did a quick &lt;a href="http://www.pubmed.gov"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt; on Peter Duesberg's name, and I came across &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619953?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;this abstract for a &lt;em&gt;Medical Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; by Duesberg. My first reaction was to think was that Duesberg has really come down in the world if he's actually publishing in &lt;em&gt;Medical Hypotheses&lt;/em&gt; these days. My second reaction was laughter, and lots of it. Read the abstract and you will see why:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/pity_poor_peter_duesberg_even_medical_hy.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/pity_poor_peter_duesberg_even_medical_hy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/qQULbWBvGWQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253025856283"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7664/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6481b04b2f47aa06</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Researchers Reveal New Weapon in Flu Fight</title><published>2009-09-15T14:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T14:58:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7664/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Associated Press) -- Researchers on Sunday delivered a double dose of good news in the fight against flu: successful tests of what could become the first new flu medicine in a decade, and the strongest evidence yet that such drugs save lives, not only shorten illness...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx</id><title type="html">Science In The News Daily</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253025856283"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7663/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5ba6a51a4f44b73e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Leukemia, Stem Cell Scientists Get Lasker Awards</title><published>2009-09-15T14:56:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T14:56:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7663/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most prestigious prizes in medicine is being awarded this year to scientists working on stem cells and leukemia--and to New York's mayor for his fight to cut tobacco use... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx</id><title type="html">Science In The News Daily</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253025856283"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7662/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b79fd9f1ed12fc0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Is Happiness Catching?</title><published>2009-09-15T14:54:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T14:54:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7662/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;

Yesterday one of their favourite topics, Patrick Swayze, star of Ghost, Dirty Dancing and various other films I've been forced to watch by girlfriends, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8256033.stm"&gt;tragically died of pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; at just 57 years old. His death followed a two-year battle with the disease, and two years in which his every appearance fuelled a sort of sick and morbid game among tabloid hacks to predict his demise. Here's a little run through of the Daily Mail's various predictions over the last 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story broke in the first week of March 2008, and the papers gave less chance of seeing the summer than Frosty the Snowman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7th March, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-527009/Hollywood-rallies-Patrick-Swayze-vows-continue-work-cancer-battle.html"&gt;Hollywood rallies around Patrick Swayze as he vows to continue work during his cancer battle&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"An American magazine claimed the star was facing as little as five weeks to live in a report revealing he was battling the disease."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14th March, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-533432/Patrick-Swayze-smoking-despite-diagnosed-pancreatic-cancer.html"&gt;Patrick Swayze still smoking despite being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"...if, as reports suggest, Patrick Swayze has only a few weeks to live..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the first few months a pattern emerged. There were two possible Patrick Swayze stories; i) Patrick Swayze is about to die and ii) Patrick Swayze's doing great. Now cancer patients will often have good times and bad times, but what's remarkable is the way that newspapers reached these conclusions on the basis of a photo or an off-hand remark. If Swayze looks a bit glum, he's facing the end. If he's got a bit of a tan he's making a miraculous recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9th April, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1011782/Patrick-Swayze-having-excellent-response-cancer-treatment.html#ixzz0RAahwSZI"&gt;Patrick Swayze having 'excellent response to cancer treatment'&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"A month ago, it was reported that Swayze had been "close to death". The actor was said to have as little as five weeks to live."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th May, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-563932/Patrick-Swayze-looks-grey-gaunt-battle-cancer-takes-toll.html#ixzz0RAb016ri"&gt;Patrick Swayze looks grey and gaunt as battle against cancer takes its toll&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"But reports suggest he is preparing for the end..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9th June, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1025014/Brave-cancer-sufferer-Swayze-goes-work-new-TV-series.html"&gt;Brave cancer sufferer Swayze goes back to work in new TV series&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"The Dirty Dancing star, 55, is said to have been responding well to treatment"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Patrick gets &lt;strike&gt;better&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;worse&lt;/strike&gt; better, and things calm down few a few months until the papers decide in the run up to Christmas to accuse him of dying - the accusation here being that he may have dared to start dying &lt;i&gt;without telling them first&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd December, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1091461/Im-fighting-Angry-Patrick-Swayze-hits-reports-hes-dying-cancer.html#ixzz0RAcbBBBB"&gt;I'm still fighting: Angry Patrick Swayze hits back at reports that he's dying from cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"Last week, a U.S. supermarket tabloid claimed the Dirty Dancing actor was beginning 'the countdown to the end' after being told the cancer had spread to his liver."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports prompted Swayze to take some time out from his life-threatening battle with a fatal disease in order to fight another battle with the gutter press; a battle he had even less chance of winning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's upsetting that the shoddy and reckless reporting from these publications cast a negative shadow on the positive and good fight I'm fighting. For me, my family, and those close to me, it amounts to downright emotional cruelty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite. The papers backed off for a while, after he appeased their morbid fascination by doing a television interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16th January, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1111152/Cancer-stricken-Patrick-Swayze-doing-treated-hospital-pneumonia.html"&gt;Cancer stricken Patrick Swayze is 'doing well' as he is treated in hospital for pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"In an interview last week he spoke of time running out, with the words: ‘I’d say five years is wishful thinking. Two years seems likely if you’re going to believe the statistics.’"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it didn't last long. By the end of January, they were spreading wild rumours that he'd stopped treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;28th January, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1131056/Cancer-stricken-Patrick-Swayze-stops-treatment-doctors-say-little-do.html#ixzz0RAeqxQLa"&gt;Cancer-stricken Patrick Swayze 'stops treatment after doctors say there is little they can do'&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"A family friend told the Enquirer: 'There's nothing more doctors can do for him. We are down to the wire and the goal now is to keep Patrick comfortable.'"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again Swayze was forced to step in, patiently explaining to 'journalists' that their story about him stopping treatment was accurate apart from the big about him stopping treatment. Connoisseurs of tabloid double-think will appreciate the weasel-worded addition of "reportedly" to a quote otherwise taken verbatim from the previous story. Classy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;30th January 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1132442/Patrick-Swayze-denies-reports-stopped-having-cancer-treatment.html#ixzz0RAfLlwjH"&gt;Patrick Swayze denies reports he has stopped having cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"A family friend reportedly told the Enquirer: 'There's nothing more doctors can do for him.'"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked for about another fortnight, at which point reports about his treatment degenerated into a bizarre fictional reality, in which Patrick Swayze entered a sort of quantum state in which he responded well to the treatment that he had rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14th February, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1145486/Gaunt-Patrick-Swayze-defiantly-chain-smokes-battles-cancer.html#ixzz0RAg0IPbo"&gt;Gaunt Patrick Swayze defiantly chain-smokes as he battles cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"Reports from the US suggest that he has stopped treatment for the cancer..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14th March, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1161965/Brave-Patrick-Swayze-looks-frail-shopping-trip-continues-cancer-battle.html#ixzz0RAkcWWyE"&gt;Brave Patrick Swayze looks frail on shopping trip as he continues cancer battle&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;The actor is said to be responding well to chemotherapy after suffering a setback in January when he was admitted to hospital suffering from pneumonia.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double-think doesn't just apply to current events, but to history. Talking without a trace of irony about his 2008 series "The Beast" on April 15th, the virtually omnipresent Daily Mail Reporter &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1170249/Frail-Patrick-Swayze-shadow-self-cancer-takes-toll.html"&gt;remarks that&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The series arrived on a wave of publicity mainly driven by the grim prognosis and exaggerated accounts that he was near death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite. But no matter, because Patrick was about to be saved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;25th July, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1202108/How-new-advances-help-Patrick-Swayze-beat-cancer.html"&gt;How new advances may help Patrick Swayze beat cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"...his recovery is due to recent advances in radiotherapy-surgery and chemotherapy that give patients a better chance of surviving longer, and some even a hope of being cured."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6th August, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1204547/Patrick-Swayze-proves-hes-beating-odds-cancer-battle--hes-STILL-smoking.html"&gt;Patrick Swayze proves he's beating the odds in his cancer battle...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than six weeks later, Patrick Swayze died. Rest in peace. Peace from cancer, and peace from insensitive tabloid rumour-mongering. &lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday one of their favourite topics, Patrick Swayze, star of Ghost, Dirty Dancing and various other films I've been forced to watch by girlfriends, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8256033.stm"&gt;tragically died of pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; at just 57 years old. His death followed a two-year battle with the disease, and two years in which his every appearance fuelled a sort of sick and morbid game among tabloid hacks to predict his demise. Here's a little run through of the Daily Mail's various predictions over the last 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story broke in the first week of March 2008, and the papers gave less chance of seeing the summer than Frosty the Snowman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7th March, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-527009/Hollywood-rallies-Patrick-Swayze-vows-continue-work-cancer-battle.html"&gt;Hollywood rallies around Patrick Swayze as he vows to continue work during his cancer battle&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"An American magazine claimed the star was facing as little as five weeks to live in a report revealing he was battling the disease."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14th March, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-533432/Patrick-Swayze-smoking-despite-diagnosed-pancreatic-cancer.html"&gt;Patrick Swayze still smoking despite being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"...if, as reports suggest, Patrick Swayze has only a few weeks to live..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the first few months a pattern emerged. There were two possible Patrick Swayze stories; i) Patrick Swayze is about to die and ii) Patrick Swayze's doing great. Now cancer patients will often have good times and bad times, but what's remarkable is the way that newspapers reached these conclusions on the basis of a photo or an off-hand remark. If Swayze looks a bit glum, he's facing the end. If he's got a bit of a tan he's making a miraculous recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9th April, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1011782/Patrick-Swayze-having-excellent-response-cancer-treatment.html#ixzz0RAahwSZI"&gt;Patrick Swayze having 'excellent response to cancer treatment'&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"A month ago, it was reported that Swayze had been "close to death". The actor was said to have as little as five weeks to live."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th May, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-563932/Patrick-Swayze-looks-grey-gaunt-battle-cancer-takes-toll.html#ixzz0RAb016ri"&gt;Patrick Swayze looks grey and gaunt as battle against cancer takes its toll&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"But reports suggest he is preparing for the end..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9th June, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1025014/Brave-cancer-sufferer-Swayze-goes-work-new-TV-series.html"&gt;Brave cancer sufferer Swayze goes back to work in new TV series&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"The Dirty Dancing star, 55, is said to have been responding well to treatment"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Patrick gets &lt;strike&gt;better&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;worse&lt;/strike&gt; better, and things calm down few a few months until the papers decide in the run up to Christmas to accuse him of dying - the accusation here being that he may have dared to start dying &lt;i&gt;without telling them first&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd December, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1091461/Im-fighting-Angry-Patrick-Swayze-hits-reports-hes-dying-cancer.html#ixzz0RAcbBBBB"&gt;I'm still fighting: Angry Patrick Swayze hits back at reports that he's dying from cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"Last week, a U.S. supermarket tabloid claimed the Dirty Dancing actor was beginning 'the countdown to the end' after being told the cancer had spread to his liver."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports prompted Swayze to take some time out from his life-threatening battle with a fatal disease in order to fight another battle with the gutter press; a battle he had even less chance of winning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's upsetting that the shoddy and reckless reporting from these publications cast a negative shadow on the positive and good fight I'm fighting. For me, my family, and those close to me, it amounts to downright emotional cruelty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite. The papers backed off for a while, after he appeased their morbid fascination by doing a television interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16th January, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1111152/Cancer-stricken-Patrick-Swayze-doing-treated-hospital-pneumonia.html"&gt;Cancer stricken Patrick Swayze is 'doing well' as he is treated in hospital for pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"In an interview last week he spoke of time running out, with the words: ‘I’d say five years is wishful thinking. Two years seems likely if you’re going to believe the statistics.’"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it didn't last long. By the end of January, they were spreading wild rumours that he'd stopped treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;28th January, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1131056/Cancer-stricken-Patrick-Swayze-stops-treatment-doctors-say-little-do.html#ixzz0RAeqxQLa"&gt;Cancer-stricken Patrick Swayze 'stops treatment after doctors say there is little they can do'&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"A family friend told the Enquirer: 'There's nothing more doctors can do for him. We are down to the wire and the goal now is to keep Patrick comfortable.'"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again Swayze was forced to step in, patiently explaining to 'journalists' that their story about him stopping treatment was accurate apart from the big about him stopping treatment. Connoisseurs of tabloid double-think will appreciate the weasel-worded addition of "reportedly" to a quote otherwise taken verbatim from the previous story. Classy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;30th January 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1132442/Patrick-Swayze-denies-reports-stopped-having-cancer-treatment.html#ixzz0RAfLlwjH"&gt;Patrick Swayze denies reports he has stopped having cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"A family friend reportedly told the Enquirer: 'There's nothing more doctors can do for him.'"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked for about another fortnight, at which point reports about his treatment degenerated into a bizarre fictional reality, in which Patrick Swayze entered a sort of quantum state in which he responded well to the treatment that he had rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14th February, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1145486/Gaunt-Patrick-Swayze-defiantly-chain-smokes-battles-cancer.html#ixzz0RAg0IPbo"&gt;Gaunt Patrick Swayze defiantly chain-smokes as he battles cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"Reports from the US suggest that he has stopped treatment for the cancer..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14th March, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1161965/Brave-Patrick-Swayze-looks-frail-shopping-trip-continues-cancer-battle.html#ixzz0RAkcWWyE"&gt;Brave Patrick Swayze looks frail on shopping trip as he continues cancer battle&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;The actor is said to be responding well to chemotherapy after suffering a setback in January when he was admitted to hospital suffering from pneumonia.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double-think doesn't just apply to current events, but to history. Talking without a trace of irony about his 2008 series "The Beast" on April 15th, the virtually omnipresent Daily Mail Reporter &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1170249/Frail-Patrick-Swayze-shadow-self-cancer-takes-toll.html"&gt;remarks that&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The series arrived on a wave of publicity mainly driven by the grim prognosis and exaggerated accounts that he was near death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite. But no matter, because Patrick was about to be saved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;25th July, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1202108/How-new-advances-help-Patrick-Swayze-beat-cancer.html"&gt;How new advances may help Patrick Swayze beat cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"...his recovery is due to recent advances in radiotherapy-surgery and chemotherapy that give patients a better chance of surviving longer, and some even a hope of being cured."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6th August, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1204547/Patrick-Swayze-proves-hes-beating-odds-cancer-battle--hes-STILL-smoking.html"&gt;Patrick Swayze proves he's beating the odds in his cancer battle...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than six weeks later, Patrick Swayze died. Rest in peace. Peace from cancer, and peace from insensitive tabloid rumour-mongering. &lt;/p&gt;

The book is a look at six Christian families and how they homeschool their children.  Not every family fits the stereotype I know I have in my mind.  Some are impressive; others leave much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following passage, the authors talks to one (relatively sane) mother about specific criticism toward homeschooling parents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“But I wonder if there’s some point at which people would agree that a child is being ill served educationally,” I suggest.  “For instance, if your thirteen-year-old is functionally illiterate, then maybe your unschooling stinks.  I agree that there’s legitimate concern from homeschoolers whenever requirements are proposed, that it could be a slippery slope to further regulation.  But at least on a level of principle, wouldn’t any reasonable person be concerned about the educational environment of a teenager who didn’t have those basic skills?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But there are public schools all over America where thirteen-year-olds cannot read, cannot add, cannot subtract,” Carrie says.  “I wouldn’t want to single out homeschooling for standards that are not met by people who are in school and get by with it, year after year, graduating illiterate, completely unfunctioning members of society.  I don’t understand why — if you’re in school and not learning things — why &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; okay, but if you’re at home and you’re not learning things, you’re not testing well, then it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what about the nonsense from academics that says I can’t educate my children?” she continues.  “That is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; offensive to me.  Because there is no chance that I could go in the classroom right now — I could not walk up the hill to the elementary school right now and teach.  I couldn’t teach somebody else’s twenty-five children to save my life.  I’m not a teacher in the sense of being prepared to teach large groups of strangers.  But if I didn’t think I was the best teacher for my own children, I wouldn’t do it.  There is &lt;em&gt;nobody&lt;/em&gt; who can teach my kids better than I can.” (p. 210)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I’m done quoting excerpts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic book that gives you an insight into a subculture that often goes unnoticed and is certainly not well-documented.  I urge you to &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807032913?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0807032913"&gt;read the whole thing&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Here's a piece of fragmentology. In the 19th century a brooch (inset) was found at Vistena in Allhelgona parish, Östergötland. It's a copper-alloy piece decorated with embossed silver sheet panels in the Nydam style, approx. AD 375-450. In 2008 a member of my metal detector team found part of a similar brooch at Sättuna in Kaga parish, a few tens of kilometers east of Vistena. Apparently we're dealing with a regional metalworking tradition. The complete brooch measures 57 mm across the head plate, the fragment 42 mm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/09/5th_century_regional_brooch_de.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/6LkQS8GzOAE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253023305192"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=4867">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0f53b3e7701328e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Articles"/><title type="html">If it walks like an atheist and talks like an atheist. . .</title><published>2009-09-15T13:31:52Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T13:31:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/09/15/if-it-walks-like-an-atheist-and-talks-like-an-atheist/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s one thing that both atheists and the devout agree on: Karen Armstrong’s God-is-but-a-transcendence-beyond-a-symbol theology is not only unrepresentative of religion in general, but hard to distinguish from atheism.  Case in point: Albert Mohler, President of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, has &lt;a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/blogs/mohler/11608516/"&gt;a post at &lt;em&gt;Crosswalk&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;analyzing the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574405030643556324.html"&gt;recent dustup&lt;/a&gt; between Armstrong and Richard Dawkins.   He flat-out rejects Armstrong’s apophatic nonsense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Armstrong offers a superficial and theologically reckless argument that comes down to this:  Until the modern age, believers in God were not really believers in a God who was believed to exist.  Then along came Sir Issac Newton and the “modern” belief that God must exist in order to be God.  When Darwin came along to show “that there could be no proof for God’s existence,” he was doing God a favor — allowing his survival as a mere symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She makes statements that amount to elegant nonsense.  Consider this:  “In the ancient world, a cosmology was not regarded as factual but was primarily therapeutic; it was recited when people needed an infusion of that mysterious power that had — somehow — brought something out of primal nothingness: at a sickbed, a coronation or during a political crisis.”  So she would have us to believe that, in centuries past, cosmology was merely therapy.  She simply makes the assertion and moves on.  Will anyone believe this nonsense?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well,  a lot of intelligent and sophisticated theologians do!  Mohler continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, it is Dawkins, presented as the unbeliever in this exchange, who understands God better than Armstrong.  In fact, Richard Dawkins the atheist rightly insists that Karen Armstrong is actually an atheist as well.  “God’s Rotweiller” sees through Armstrong’s embrace of a “God beyond God.”. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . We should at least give Dawkins credit here for knowing what he rejects.  Here we meet an atheist who understands the difference between belief and unbelief.  As for those, like Armstrong, who try to tell believers that it does not matter if God exists –  Dawkins informs them that believers in God will brand them as atheists.  “They’ll be right,” Dawkins concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the exchange in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;turns out to be a meeting of two atheist minds.  The difference, of course, is that one knows he is an atheist when the other presumably claims she is not.  Dawkins knows a fellow atheist when he sees one. Careful readers of &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; will come to the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow I don’t think that Armstrong’s sweaty lucubrations are going to convince the religious masses that “existence” isn’t something they need in their deity.  Southern Baptists and their comrades-in-faith may be wrong about the existence of God, but they aren’t fools when it comes to theology.  They know that when the Rapture comes, both Dawkins and Armstrong will be left sitting on Earth with their thumbs up their butts.&lt;/p&gt;

So let me try to rectify this problem by challenging them to become more informed.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian, what skeptical and/or liberal books have you read? Have you &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-i-became-atheist.html"&gt;read my book?&lt;/a&gt; [It will be available again after a reprinting around October 8th]. Have you read any of the ones in the &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/11/take-debunking-christianity-challenge.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debunking Christianity Challenge&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/a&gt; Have you read any of the ones linked to in the sidebar from evangelicals? Have you considered what &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/sound-familiar-anyone.html"&gt;one Mormon wrote?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm curious because only someone who has not done so could make your case so blithely without a clear understanding of the issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alvin Plantinga himself admits that the results of biblical criticism could show him wrong. The problem is that he does not show an awareness of knowing anything much about biblical criticism. He's a philosopher defending as best as he can what he was raised to believe based upon conservative biblical scholarship. Well, the conservatives have finally caught up in some ways to critical scholarship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/what-is-critical-scholar.html"&gt;Critical scholarship&lt;/a&gt; is what we should all try to attain. Critical scholars “are prepared to interpret the text against their own preferences and traditions, in the interest of intellectual honesty.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you disagree with this? Are you prepared to look into these issues in a greater detail with that attitude? This is what my &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/outsider-test-for-faith_20.html"&gt;Outsider Test for Faith calls upon you to do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Save this comment for future reference. Let it provoke you to do your own investigation of the issues. Read all of the links. Tell me about the books you've read and then proceed to read those books I recommend. Start with Kenton Sparks evangelical book, then read Peter Enns book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Investigate, don't simply regurgitate these pat answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7537128534685830682?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Yesterday one of their favourite topics, Patrick Swayze, star of Ghost, Dirty Dancing and various other films I've been forced to watch by girlfriends, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8256033.stm"&gt;tragically died of pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; at just 57 years old. His death followed a two-year battle with the disease, and two years in which his every appearance fuelled a sort of sick and morbid game among tabloid hacks to predict his demise. Here's a little run through of the Daily Mail's various predictions over the last 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story broke in the first week of March 2008, and the papers gave less chance of seeing the summer than Frosty the Snowman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7th March, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-527009/Hollywood-rallies-Patrick-Swayze-vows-continue-work-cancer-battle.html"&gt;Hollywood rallies around Patrick Swayze as he vows to continue work during his cancer battle&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"An American magazine claimed the star was facing as little as five weeks to live in a report revealing he was battling the disease."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14th March, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-533432/Patrick-Swayze-smoking-despite-diagnosed-pancreatic-cancer.html"&gt;Patrick Swayze still smoking despite being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"...if, as reports suggest, Patrick Swayze has only a few weeks to live..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the first few months a pattern emerged. There were two possible Patrick Swayze stories; i) Patrick Swayze is about to die and ii) Patrick Swayze's doing great. Now cancer patients will often have good times and bad times, but what's remarkable is the way that newspapers reached these conclusions on the basis of a photo or an off-hand remark. If Swayze looks a bit glum, he's facing the end. If he's got a bit of a tan he's making a miraculous recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9th April, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1011782/Patrick-Swayze-having-excellent-response-cancer-treatment.html#ixzz0RAahwSZI"&gt;Patrick Swayze having 'excellent response to cancer treatment'&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"A month ago, it was reported that Swayze had been "close to death". The actor was said to have as little as five weeks to live."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th May, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-563932/Patrick-Swayze-looks-grey-gaunt-battle-cancer-takes-toll.html#ixzz0RAb016ri"&gt;Patrick Swayze looks grey and gaunt as battle against cancer takes its toll&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"But reports suggest he is preparing for the end..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9th June, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1025014/Brave-cancer-sufferer-Swayze-goes-work-new-TV-series.html"&gt;Brave cancer sufferer Swayze goes back to work in new TV series&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"The Dirty Dancing star, 55, is said to have been responding well to treatment"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Patrick gets &lt;strike&gt;better&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;worse&lt;/strike&gt; better, and things calm down few a few months until the papers decide in the run up to Christmas to accuse him of dying - the accusation here being that he may have dared to start dying &lt;i&gt;without telling them first&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd December, 2008:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1091461/Im-fighting-Angry-Patrick-Swayze-hits-reports-hes-dying-cancer.html#ixzz0RAcbBBBB"&gt;I'm still fighting: Angry Patrick Swayze hits back at reports that he's dying from cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"Last week, a U.S. supermarket tabloid claimed the Dirty Dancing actor was beginning 'the countdown to the end' after being told the cancer had spread to his liver."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports prompted Swayze to take some time out from his life-threatening battle with a fatal disease in order to fight another battle with the gutter press; a battle he had even less chance of winning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's upsetting that the shoddy and reckless reporting from these publications cast a negative shadow on the positive and good fight I'm fighting. For me, my family, and those close to me, it amounts to downright emotional cruelty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite. The papers backed off for a while, after he appeased their morbid fascination by doing a television interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16th January, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1111152/Cancer-stricken-Patrick-Swayze-doing-treated-hospital-pneumonia.html"&gt;Cancer stricken Patrick Swayze is 'doing well' as he is treated in hospital for pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"In an interview last week he spoke of time running out, with the words: ‘I’d say five years is wishful thinking. Two years seems likely if you’re going to believe the statistics.’"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it didn't last long. By the end of January, they were spreading wild rumours that he'd stopped treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;28th January, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1131056/Cancer-stricken-Patrick-Swayze-stops-treatment-doctors-say-little-do.html#ixzz0RAeqxQLa"&gt;Cancer-stricken Patrick Swayze 'stops treatment after doctors say there is little they can do'&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"A family friend told the Enquirer: 'There's nothing more doctors can do for him. We are down to the wire and the goal now is to keep Patrick comfortable.'"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again Swayze was forced to step in, patiently explaining to 'journalists' that their story about him stopping treatment was accurate apart from the big about him stopping treatment. Connoisseurs of tabloid double-think will appreciate the weasel-worded addition of "reportedly" to a quote otherwise taken verbatim from the previous story. Classy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;30th January 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1132442/Patrick-Swayze-denies-reports-stopped-having-cancer-treatment.html#ixzz0RAfLlwjH"&gt;Patrick Swayze denies reports he has stopped having cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"A family friend reportedly told the Enquirer: 'There's nothing more doctors can do for him.'"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked for about another fortnight, at which point reports about his treatment degenerated into a bizarre fictional reality, in which Patrick Swayze entered a sort of quantum state in which he responded well to the treatment that he had rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14th February, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1145486/Gaunt-Patrick-Swayze-defiantly-chain-smokes-battles-cancer.html#ixzz0RAg0IPbo"&gt;Gaunt Patrick Swayze defiantly chain-smokes as he battles cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"Reports from the US suggest that he has stopped treatment for the cancer..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14th March, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1161965/Brave-Patrick-Swayze-looks-frail-shopping-trip-continues-cancer-battle.html#ixzz0RAkcWWyE"&gt;Brave Patrick Swayze looks frail on shopping trip as he continues cancer battle&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;The actor is said to be responding well to chemotherapy after suffering a setback in January when he was admitted to hospital suffering from pneumonia.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double-think doesn't just apply to current events, but to history. Talking without a trace of irony about his 2008 series "The Beast" on April 15th, the virtually omnipresent Daily Mail Reporter &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1170249/Frail-Patrick-Swayze-shadow-self-cancer-takes-toll.html"&gt;remarks that&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The series arrived on a wave of publicity mainly driven by the grim prognosis and exaggerated accounts that he was near death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite. But no matter, because Patrick was about to be saved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;25th July, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1202108/How-new-advances-help-Patrick-Swayze-beat-cancer.html"&gt;How new advances may help Patrick Swayze beat cancer&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;"...his recovery is due to recent advances in radiotherapy-surgery and chemotherapy that give patients a better chance of surviving longer, and some even a hope of being cured."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6th August, 2009:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1204547/Patrick-Swayze-proves-hes-beating-odds-cancer-battle--hes-STILL-smoking.html"&gt;Patrick Swayze proves he's beating the odds in his cancer battle...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than six weeks later, Patrick Swayze died. Rest in peace. Peace from cancer, and peace from insensitive tabloid rumour-mongering. &lt;/p&gt;

There are some real lunatics associated with Sarah Palin: she's linked to her home-town priests, Ed Kalnin and Thomas Muthee, who are linked to Morningstar Ministries and Rick Joyner. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-wilson/palin-pastors-re-educatio_b_283230.html"&gt;These cranks have a plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muthee is an international celebrity for his role in a series of documentary videos, seen by millions worldwide, that claim Christians can reduce crime, murder, traffic accidents, addiction, and environmental degradation by driving out, from cities and towns, demon spirits and accused witches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am most amused by the clip at that link in which Joyner complains about the unfair treatment Palin received from the press, because they jumped on every crazy little thing she said. The press largely missed her religious beliefs, possibly because they're so far out there it's hard to believe a candidate for high office believes in any of that nonsense. She's a "third wave" Christian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview for a September 12, 2008 Religion News Service story Rick Joyner stated, "We are probably described as Third Wave. We have had a lot of influence from movements that I think are identified as Third Wave." The Third Wave is a newly emergent tendency in Christianity, little more than two decades old, which now encompasses by some estimates five percent of the Earth's population and has been promoted from Ted Haggard's former Colorado Springs mega-church.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Third Wave doctrine teaches that Christians must reclaim the Earth from demons spirits which possess cities, towns, geographic territories, people, ethnic groups, and even family lines. The cleansing of those demons, and unbelievers, from Earth will usher in a Christian utopian age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there's Pastor Steven Anderson, the loon who has been praying for Obama's death. There is a &lt;a href="http://www.michaelnugent.com/2009/09/15/ten-kinky-quotes-by-pastor-anderson/"&gt;short compendium of some of the most hateful, looney things Anderson has said&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;#39;s not pretty. Homophobia and petty-minded vindictiveness are apparently not obstacles to claiming spiritual authority…they seem to be more like preliminary qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's keep all of these nasty, crazy people out of political power, OK? Please?&lt;/p&gt;

(Screw brilliant prose.  I can’t wait to read it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown did an interview with &lt;strong&gt;James Kaplan&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt; in which &lt;a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/32801010/ns/today-today_books/"&gt;he discussed his religious beliefs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To no one’s surprise, he’s not very religious.  But it’s always nice to hear someone say as much in public:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: Are you religious?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: I was raised Episcopalian, and I was very religious as a kid. Then, in eighth or ninth grade, I studied astronomy, cosmology, and the origins of the universe. I remember saying to a minister, “I don’t get it. I read a book that said there was an explosion known as the Big Bang, but here it says God created heaven and Earth and the animals in seven days. Which is right?” Unfortunately, the response I got was, “Nice boys don’t ask that question.” A light went off, and I said, “The Bible doesn’t make sense. Science makes much more sense to me.” And I just gravitated away from religion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of us have had that same epiphany…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown does admit he has a spiritual side, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: Where are you now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: The irony is that I’ve really come full circle. The more science I studied, the more I saw that physics becomes metaphysics and numbers become imaginary numbers. The farther you go into science, the mushier the ground gets. You start to say, “Oh, there is an order and a spiritual aspect to science.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the hell he’s talking about.  But Brown knows as well as anyone: if you make it &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; deep, people will assume it’s deep.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a beauty to science and math.  But to coat it in spirituality just lessens their natural beauty for me.&lt;/p&gt;

After spending time in prison for bad checks and credit card fraud, he would have us believe that he somehow hit upon “cures they don’t want you do know about.” Isn’t it interesting that convicted con-artists always seems to hit upon such well-guarded secrets. Dennis Lee claims to have found the secret of limitless energy, if only he were not attacked by Big Oil and a corrupt government. Kevin Trudeau claims to have found the cures for just about everything, but The Man is trying to shut him down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is even more amazing than the audacity of these claims is that a sufficient portion of the population is credulous enough to throw millions of dollars at the likes of Trudeau and Lee. Thankfully in most civilized nations it is a crime to lie to people in order to take their money. The problem has always been enforcement – authorities don’t have the resources to keep up with the constant whack-a-mole game against con artists. Sometimes they lack adequate authority to hand out punishments that would serve as a true deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has apparently had their sights on Kevin Trudeau and seem to finally be putting a dent in his snake oil empire. Trudeau became rich using infomercials to sell the public the “natural cures they don’t want you do know about,” and then follow up with the cure for debt and weight loss they don’t want you to know about. Wow – this guy is versatile, a medical and financial genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC is taking him to task for misrepresenting his diet cure, which Trudeau has claimed is an “easy” method for weight loss. This “easy” method involves a 500 calorie per day diet (OK, you can stop there, but he adds), prescription hormone injections, and colonic for a month. It’s just that easy – no wonder the diet industry wants to keep this under wraps. If people knew they could lose weight just by eating 500 calories per day, why would they waste time and money on any other diet product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a Federal judge (aka The Man) decided that Trudeau violated the consent decree that the FTC had placed on Trudeau – essentially saying he cannot lie to the public to sell his wares. The &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-mon-burns-infomercial-0914-sep14,0,584242.column"&gt;Chicago Tribune reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Gettleman imposed a $5.2 million fine. The FTC petitioned for a modest increase, and without a detailed explanation the judge jacked it up to $37.6 million, the regulator’s estimate of how much the book took in through infomercials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response Trudeau is pleading poverty. He actually has the temerity to claim that he made no money from the book, that it was all altruism and charity on his part. Just stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present the case is still in appeal, mainly over the 37.6 million dollar fine and three year ban from infomercials. I think the ban should be lifelong, and if Trudeau does not end up in the poor house the fine is too little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is at least encouraging – it’s good to see someone like Trudeau on the ropes.&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry for the confusion, BABloggees!  &lt;del&gt;The Hive Overmind is doing a blog upgrade today from about 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern time, and during that period commenting will be turned off. Don't panic!&lt;/del&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists using data from the Cassini spacecraft have found something amazing: a lightning storm on Saturn that’s lasted for nearly eight months! And it’s still going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long lasting storms on planets aren’t unusual; the Great Red Spot on Jupiter is at least 400 years old! But active lightning storms are more difficult to detect… unless you happen to be close by. Giant lightning bolts create vast discharges of radio energy, and Cassini’s has an instrument sensitive to them. It’s been monitoring Saturn for about five years now, and has seen lots of lightning storms. The previous record holder was 7.5 months, for a system that lasted from November 2007 to July of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new one has been raging since February, and shows no signs of abating. Storms on Saturn are a bit more violent than on Earth: they can be 3000 km (1800 miles) across, and discharge energy at rates 10,000 times higher than storms here on Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5066/Peace_Above_Turmoil_Below"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/saturn_lightning.jpg" alt="Lightning on Saturn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, this stuff is cool — giant killer electrical storms , woohoo! — but it’s also science. As these waves of energy plow through Saturn’s ionosphere, scientists can use them to map out the structure of Saturn’s environment and learn how the giant planet behaves. That’s really the whole point, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, plus planet-spanning disaster-movie sized lightning storms! Cooooool.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253010008482"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/kanye_west_uncivil_rebel_or_ob.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07e5a7693a43d833</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Troll Bait"/><title type="html">Kanye West: Uncivil Rebel or Obnoxious Lover of Goats?</title><published>2009-09-15T09:46:10Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T09:46:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/fOOnHie8SrA/kanye_west_uncivil_rebel_or_ob.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/kanye_west_uncivil_rebel_or_ob.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You all know who Kanye West is.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out Microsoft mogul Bill Gates and a team of scientists have filed a patent on technology that would seek to eliminate the danger of hurricanes. The idea is pretty simple: A fleet of barges would be dispatched to the waters ahead of a raging storm. There, they would use a system of conduits to both push warm surface water below the ocean surface while bringing deeper, colder water up. This would theoretically weaken the approaching hurricane, possibly saving lives and money and binding all those affected into a blood debt with Mr. Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates may be onto something but some experts aren’t convinced for various reasons. For more info, click the link above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stem cells have a unique ability: when they divide, they can either give rise to more stem cells, or to a variety of specialised cell types. In both mice and humans, a layer of cells at the base of the skin contains stem cells that can develop into the specialised cells in the layers above. Scientists at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Monterotondo, in collaboration with colleagues at the Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnologicas (CIEMAT) in Madrid, have discovered two proteins that control when and how these stem cells switch to being skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He’s been suffering for a long time now and modern medicine kept him going for awhile, but unfortunately, it was only a matter of time. But the reason I’m blogging about this story is because I’d previously blogged about how quacks had tried to use Swayze’s negative prognosis to recruit him as another celebrity spokesperson for their bogus cancer cures, to which Swayze awesomely told the vultures to get lost:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anybody had that cure out there, like so many people swear they do, you’d be two things. You’d be very rich, and you’d be very famous. Otherwise, shut up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very rare to see a celebrity so rational and suspect that Swayze had previous experience with quacks trying to sell him crap. Unfortunately, now of course, the quacks will inevitably now blame Swayze’s death on medical science and insist on the now unfalsifiable claim that he would have lived if only he’d listened to them. Orac says it best, I think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/the_ghouls_descend_upon_the_corpse.php"&gt;Despicable ghoul&lt;/a&gt; that he is, I can only wonder how long it will be before Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com publishes another despicable abuse of a dead celebrity proclaiming how, if Patrick Swayze had only pursued “natural” therapy instead of that nasty, awful, evil science-based medicine, he would have eliminated his pancreatic cancer and would still be Dirty Dancing today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that if I go to the NaturalNews site, Adams has already probably written his inevitable response to the news.&lt;/p&gt;

A paper released in PLoS One sheds new light on this question.A quick review.  To the first approximation, the genetic code consists of 3 nucleotide units called codon; there are 64 possible codons.  Twenty amino acids plus stop are specified by these codons (again, 1st approximation).  So, either a lot of codons are never used or at least some codons mean the same thing.  In the coding system used by the vast majority of organisms, two amino acids are encoded with a single codon whereas all the others have 2, 3, 4 or 6 codons apiece (and stop gets 3).  For amino acids with 2, 3 or 4 codons, it is the third position that makes the difference; for the three that have 6, they have one block of 4 which follows this pattern and one set of two which also differ from each other in the third position. For two amino acids with 6 codons, the two groups are next to each other so that you can think of the change between the blocks as a change in the second position; Ser is very strange in that the two blocks of codons are terribly like each other.  For amino acids with two codons, the 3rd position is either a purine (A,G) or pyrimidine (C,T).  For a given amino acid, these codons are not used equally by a given organism; the pattern of bias in codon usage is quite distinct for an organism and its close cousins and this has wide effects on the genome (and vice versa). For example, in some Streptomyces I have the codon bias pattern pretty much memorized: use G or C in the third position and you'll almost always pick a frequent codon; use A or T and you've picked a rarity.  Some other organisms skew much the reverse; they like A or T in the third position.Furthermore, within a species the genes can even be divided further.  In E.coli, for example, there are roughly three classes of genes each with a distinctive codon usage signature.  One class is rich in important proteins which the cell probably needs a lot of, the second class seems to have many proteins which see only a soupcon of expression and the third class is rich in proteins likely to have been recently acquired from other species.So, it was natural to infer that this mattered for protein expression.  In particular, if you try to express a protein from one species in another.  Some species seemed to care more than others.  E.coli has a reputation for being finicky and had one of the best studied systems.  Not only did changing the codon usage over to a more E.coli system seem to help some proteins, but truly rare codons (used less than 5% of the time, though that is an arbitrary threshold) could cause all sorts of trouble.  However, the question remained how to optimize.  Given all those interchangeable codons, a synthetic gene could have many permutations. Several major camps emerged with many variants, particularly amongst the gene synthesis companies.  One school of thought said "maximize, maximize, maximize" -- pick the most frequently used codons in the target species.  A second school said "context matters" -- and went to maximize the codon pair useage.  A third school said "match the source!", meaning make the codon usage of the new coding sequence in the new species resemble the codon usage of the old coding region in the old species.  This hedged for possible requirements for rare codons to ensure proper folding.  Yet another school (which I belonged to) urged "balance", and chose to make the new coding region resemble a "typical" target species gene by sampling the codons based on their frequencies, throwing out the truly rare ones.  A logic here is that hammering the same codon -- and thereby the same tRNA -- over and over would make that codon as good as rare.The new work has some crumbs for many of these camps but not many; it suggests much was wrong with each -- or perhaps, the same thing was wrong with each.  The problem is that even with these systems some proteins just didn't express well, leaving everyone scratching their heads.  The GFP work seemed to suggest that the effects of codon usage were unpredictable if present, and in any case other factors, such as secondary structure near the ribosome, were what counted.What the new work did is synthesize a modest number (40) of versions of two very different proteins (a single-chain antibody and an enzyme, each version specifying the same protein sequence but with a different set of codons.  Within each type of protein, the expression varied over two logs; clearly something matters.  Furthermore, they divided some of the best and worst expressors into thirds and made chimaeras, head of good and tail of bad (and vice versa).  Some chimaeras seemed to have expression resembling their parent for the head end but others seemed to inherit from the tail end parent.  So the GFP-based "ribosome binding site neighborhood secondary structure matters" hypothesis did not fare well with these tests.After some computational slicing-and-dicing, what they did come up with is that codon usage matters.  The twist is that it isn't matching the best used codons (CAI) that's important, as shown in the figure at the top which I'm fair-using.  The codons that matter aren't necessarily the most used codons, but when cross-referenced with some data on which codons are most sensitive to starvation conditions the jackpot lights come on.  When you use these as your guide, as shown below, the predictive ability is quite striking.  In retrospect, this makes total sense: expressing a single protein at very high levels is probably going to deplete a number of amino acids.  Indeed, this was the logic of the sampling approach. But, I don't believe any proponent of that approach ever predicted this.Furthermore, not only does this work on the training set but new coding regions were prepared to test the model, and these new versions had expression levels consistent with the new model.What of secondary structure near the ribosome?  In some of the single-chain antibody constructs an effect could be seen, but it appears the codon usage effect is dominant.  In conversations with the authors (more on this below), they mentioned that GFP is easy to code with secondary structure near the ribosome binding site; this is just an interesting interaction of the genetic code with the amino acid sequence of GFP.  Since it is easy in this case to stumble on secondary structure, that effect shows up in that dataset. This is all very interesting, but it is also practical.  On the pure biology side, it does suggest that studying starvation is applicable to studying high level protein expression, which should enable further studies on this important problem.  On the protein expression side, it suggests a new approach to optimizing expression of synthetic constructs.  A catch however: this work was run by DNA2.0 and they have filed for patents and at least some of these patents have issued (e.g. US 7561972 and US 7561973).  I mention this only to note that it is so and to give some starting points for reading further; clearly I have neither the expertise nor responsibility to interpret the legal meaning of patents.Which brings us to one final note: this paper represents my first embargo!  A representative of DNA2.0 contacted me back when my "bunk" post was written to mention that this work was going to emerge, and finally last week the curtain was lifted.  Obviously they know how to keep a geek in suspense!  They sent me the manuscript and engaged in a teleconference with the only proviso being that I continued to keep silent until the paper issued.  I'm not sure I would have caught this paper otherwise, so I'm glad they alerted me; though clearly both the paper and this post are not bad press for DNA2.0.  Good luck to them!  Now that I'm on the other side of the fence, I'll buy my synthetic genes from anyone with a good price and a good design rationale....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It emphasizes evidence-based medicine and most articles include a table showing strength of evidence ratings for key recommendations for practice. Lately, its scientific rigor has been slipping. I have complained to the editor about several articles whose recommendations were not based on the best science, and I have been consistently ignored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acupuncture for Chronic Low Back Pain&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent article on chronic low back pain recommended acupuncture and gave it an “A” rating corresponding to “consistent, good-quality patient-oriented evidence.” I wrote the following letter to the editor and to the author of the article: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent article on chronic low back pain &lt;a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/20090615/1067.html"&gt;http://www.aafp.org/afp/20090615/1067.html&lt;/a&gt; I was very disturbed to see acupuncture listed as beneficial with an evidence rating of “A.” That rating was supported by 4 references:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference 2 (Chou et al.),&lt;/strong&gt; consisted of practice guidelines recommendations that lumped acupuncture with other nonpharmacologic interventions (intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation).” And labeled all of these as a “weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference 22 (Sherman et al.)&lt;/strong&gt; addressed current practices but did not comment on the efficacy of acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference 23 (Furlan et al.)&lt;/strong&gt; was a Cochrane review showing no evidence that acupuncture is effective for acute low back pain and commenting that the studies indicating its effectiveness in chronic low back pain were of “lower methodologic quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference 24 (Witt et al.)&lt;/strong&gt; only showed that adding acupuncture to routine care improved outcome and was cost-effective: it did not assess the effectiveness of acupuncture as a stand-alone treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, this recent systematic analysis &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19250001?ordinalpos=7&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19250001?ordinalpos=7&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&lt;/a&gt; showed that true acupuncture is no more effective than sham acupuncture. Numerous studies with a retractable sham acupuncture needle (like a stage dagger) have shown that the sham procedure is equally effective (and at least in one study the sham procedure was more effective). Even toothpicks seem to work! &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1897636,00.html"&gt;http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1897636,00.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19433697?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19433697?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&lt;/a&gt; showed that it doesn’t matter where you put the needle or whether you penetrate the skin and commented “These findings raise questions about acupuncture’s purported mechanisms of action. It remains unclear whether acupuncture or our simulated method of acupuncture provide physiologically important stimulation or represent placebo or nonspecific effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture studies are all less than ideal in that double-blinding is impossible: the acupuncturist always knows whether he is administering a sham treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies have suggested that acupuncture releases endorphins in the brain, but studies also show that placebos elicit endorphin release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that acupuncture is nothing more than an elaborate placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we had similar evidence that an analgesic drug was no better than a sham drug (a sugar pill), you would not be recommending it. How can you justify recommending acupuncture? How can you justify an “A” evidence rating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received no response from either the editor or the author. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acupuncture for Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current issue features&lt;a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/20090901/481.html"&gt; an article “Acupuncture for Pain”  by Robert B. Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician who is associate director of a family medicine residency program and associate professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. He is also a member of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture and a diplomate of the American Board of Medical Acupuncture. In the “author disclosures” this was not listed as a conflict of interest, but it should have been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article claims&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on published evidence, acupuncture is most likely to benefit patients with low back pain, neck pain, chronic idiopathic or tension headache, migraine, and knee osteoarthritis. Promising but less definitive data exist for shoulder pain, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular joint pain and postoperative pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It assigns “A” strength of evidence ratings (consistent good-quality patient-oriented evidence) to acupuncture for low back pain, neck pain, headache (chronic idiopathic), and headache (migraine). It assigns “B” ratings (inconsistent or limited quality patient-oriented evidence) to acupuncture for shoulder pain, knee osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular joint pain, and postoperative pain. Note the inconsistency: knee osteoarthritis is listed among the conditions “most likely to benefit” but then is given only a “B” rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It presents a biased picture of the published research.  For chronic low back pain, it cites these studies: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18978583?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt; A systematic review of RCTs &lt;/a&gt;that found “There is moderate evidence that acupuncture is more effective than no treatment, and strong evidence of no significant difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture, for short-term pain relief.” In other words, acupuncture is no better than placebo, and using a placebo is better than doing nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16505266?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A randomized controlled trial &lt;/a&gt;showing that acupuncture was better than no treatment, but that the control (superficial needling at non-acupuncture points) was equally effective. In other words, acupuncture was no better than their placebo control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17893311?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A randomized controlled trial &lt;/a&gt;that concluded “Effectiveness of acupuncture, either verum or sham, was almost twice that of conventional therapy.” There was no significant difference between “verum” acupuncture and the sham (placebo).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095547?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A pragmatic randomized trial &lt;/a&gt;that compared usual care to acupuncture. There was no attempt to control for possible placebo effects with a sham acupuncture control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16798792?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A pragmatic randomized trial &lt;/a&gt;that compared routine care with or without acupuncture. There was no attempt to control for possible placebo effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15674876?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A Cochrane review &lt;/a&gt;that concluded  “The data do not allow firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. For chronic low-back pain, acupuncture is more effective for pain relief and functional improvement than no treatment or sham treatment immediately after treatment and in the short-term only. Acupuncture is not more effective than other conventional and “alternative” treatments. The data suggest that acupuncture and dry-needling may be useful adjuncts to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. Because most of the studies were of lower methodological quality, there certainly is a further need for higher quality trials in this area.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15838072?ordinalpos=4&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A meta-analysis &lt;/a&gt;that concluded “Acupuncture effectively relieves chronic low back pain. No evidence suggests that acupuncture is more effective than other active therapies.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not cite these studies: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18978583?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A systematic review of RCTs &lt;/a&gt;that concluded “There is moderate evidence that acupuncture is more effective than no treatment, and strong evidence of no significant difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture, for short-term pain relief.” No significant difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture means acupuncture is not better than placebo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10796434?ordinalpos=32&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A Cochrane review &lt;/a&gt;that concluded  “The evidence summarised in this systematic review does not indicate that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of back pain.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10361661?ordinalpos=34&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A systematic review of RCTs &lt;/a&gt;that concluded:   “Because this systematic review did not clearly indicate that acupuncture is effective in the management of back pain, the authors would not recommend acupuncture as a regular treatment for patients with low back pain.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not cite the other studies I cited in my letter showing that acupuncture is no better than placebo and that it makes no difference where you put the needle or even whether you use a needle (toothpicks and retractable needles are equally effective).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Kinds of Pain&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly says “&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10190797?ordinalpos=29&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A systematic review on temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain &lt;/a&gt;concluded that acupuncture significantly improved symptoms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not exactly what the review said. Its conclusion was: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, their results &lt;strong&gt;suggest&lt;/strong&gt; that acupuncture &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt; be an effective therapy for temporomandibular joint dysfunction. However, &lt;strong&gt;none of the studies was designed to control for a placebo effect&lt;/strong&gt;. CONCLUSION: Even though all studies are in accordance with the notion that acupuncture is effective for temporomandibular joint dysfunction, this &lt;strong&gt;hypothesis requires confirmation&lt;/strong&gt; through more rigorous investigations. [emphasis added] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also discusses the use of acupuncture for other painful conditions including neck and shoulder pain, headache, and arthritis. The evidence he cites is similarly unconvincing for those conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excuses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly offers excuses and special pleading in an attempt to validate his recommendations. He suggests that “Western scientific methods” like RCTs do not lend themselves to the study of individualized treatment based on such things as pulse diagnosis, tongue diagnosis, herbal therapies, dietary modifications, ear, hand, or scalp acupuncture in addition to or instead of body acupuncture. He admits that there is no statistical difference between sham and actual acupuncture, but he doesn’t acknowledge the implications of that fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acupuncturists believe in what they are doing. Personal experience, patient gratitude, the natural course of illness, the placebo response and other factors conspire to impair judgment. This makes it difficult for them to be as objective as an outside observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a clear case of denial. To see why, substitute “drug” for acupuncture and “sugar pill” for sham acupuncture. When a controlled study shows that your treatment works no better than your placebo control, the only logical conclusion is that the treatment is no better than placebo. Imagine a drug company saying “Our drug works and the placebo works too.” Neither the drug nor the placebo would get past the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one science. The same standards apply to acupuncture as to drug therapies. A placebo by any other name is still a placebo.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sad to see a journal I respected depart from rigorous science-based medicine and succumb to the CAM temptation, especially when it tries to justify its defection by misrepresenting the state of the evidence. It has been said that there is no such thing as alternative medicine: there is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn’t. When a treatment is shown to work, it is adopted by mainstream medicine and is no longer “alternative.” Acupuncture remains “alternative,” and even &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; recognizes that fact by listing this article as one in a series on “Alternative and Complementary Medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;

They found that suppressing sharp wave-ripple (SPW-R) complexes in the hippocampus-entorhinal cortex of rats during post-training rest and sleep significantly impaired spatial memory. The authors suggest that SPW-Rs play a crucial role in memory consolidation by temporarily compressing reactivations of waking firing sequences thus allowing activation of NMDA receptors and spike time-dependent plasticity.You may be wondering at this point if there&amp;#39;s anything you can do to avoid the risk of spatial memory loss other than getting good sleep. Well you&amp;#39;re in luck according to 2008 study conducted by Ron-Harel and colleagues. They found that functional cell-mediated immunity was necessary for the maintenance of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory in mice. In other words, the healthier the mice the better the spatial memory.   So remember kids, rest up and stay healthy or you might literally lose your marbles.

In nature there are numerous genetic entities, various forms of DNA, that parasitise bacteria:

&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just learned that earlier today Patrick Swayze finally &lt;a href="http://www.ktla.com/news/ktla-swayze-obit,0,3031658.story"&gt;died of his pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; after having survived far longer (20 months) than the average patient diagnosed with stage IV disease (less than 6 months). All I can say is: Rest in peace, Patrick. Not only did Swayze deal with his terminal illness with courage, humor, and panache, but he was awesome when he &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/abusing_celebrities_with_cancer_to_sell.php"&gt;slapped down the quacks&lt;/a&gt; offering bogus cancer cures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If anybody had that cure out there, like so many people swear they do, you'd be two things. You'd be very rich, and you'd be very famous. Otherwise, shut up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_gonzalez_protocol_worse_than_useless.php"&gt;recent revelation&lt;/a&gt; of how badly pancreatic cancer patients undergoing the quack therapy known as the Gonzalez protocol did is just one more bit of evidence of how right Swayze was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/the_ghouls_descend_upon_the_corpse.php"&gt;Despicable ghoul&lt;/a&gt; that he is, I can only wonder how long it will be before Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com publishes another nauseating abuse of a dead celebrity designed to proclaim how, if Patrick Swayze had only pursued "natural" therapy instead of that nasty, awful, evil science-based medicine, he would have eliminated his pancreatic cancer and would still be Dirty Dancing today, perfectly cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/rip_patrick_swayze.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/yr66kGBjhfo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252991109518"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c3e7cc03fa5cc27a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Details, Detectives and Drama</title><published>2009-09-15T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/708-details-detectives-and-drama.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a brief analysis of criminological psychic predictions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Muslims who commit adultery in Indonesia’s Aceh province may be stoned to death under a controversial new sharia law passed by the local parliament on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provincial government initially proposed the law but now says it rejects some of the clauses added by parliament and wants to make some further revisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new parliament will be sworn in next month which may be more willing to tone down the law, some experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We feel that it is time now for people to understand the real meaning of sharia,” said Bustanul Arifin, secretary of Aceh parliament’s special committee for drafting the law, and a member of the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, adultery — presumably taking place between consenting adults — could be punishable by death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rape, on the other hand, will (only) earn you “100-200 strokes of a rattan cane — in public — and 100-200 months in jail.”  But you’ll still live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/09/14/world/AP-AS-Indonesia-Islamic-Law.html?_r=1"&gt;homosexuality&lt;/a&gt;?  That’ll get you public lashings and up to 100 months in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know where these particular Islamic punishments derive from, but it’s frightening that people could find them reasonable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans complain about entanglement of church and state, religion and politics… but when you hear about what goes on in other countries, you realize our issues are trivial in comparison to other parts of the world where religion really does control everything.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, the province of Aceh, which &lt;a href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/"&gt;passed a couple of new laws&lt;/a&gt;.  If you head over to that link, you'll see that the good folks there think it's just dandy to inject "government" powers into your marriage and...what's that term?...stone you to fucking death.  Yes, that's it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More and more, I'm reminded of why religion is such a fucking plague on this planet.  There are moderate Muslims out there who think these laws are as barbaric and stupid as I do, but the wackjobs will always be right if you stick to the "holy" texts.&lt;blockquote&gt;24:2 "The adulterer and the adulteress, scourge ye each one of them (with) a hundred stripes. And let not pity for the twain withhold you from obedience to Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of believers witness their punishment." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;25:68 And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah, nor take the life which Allah hath forbidden save in (course of) justice, nor commit adultery - and whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty; 25:69 The doom will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein disdained for ever;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Right, so a hundred lashes or death.  Nice.  It always kills me (HA!) that these morons think people are offending the literal creator of the universe, but they think they have to interfere and dole out these punishments themselves.  The *creator of the fucking universe* can't handle that job.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I'm over here trying to make a triple neutron star cluster and...what's that?  On Earth?  They cheated on their wives?  Oh, fuck me, I've got to go ALL the way over there to lash them... What?  Oh, right, KILL them.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000197" title=""&gt;Real Lives and White Lies in the Funding of Scientific Research&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a summer day in 2009 in Cambridge, England, and K. (39) looks out of his lab window, wondering why he chose the life of a scientist [1]. Yet it had all begun so well! His undergraduate studies in Prague had excited him about biomedical research, and he went on to a PhD at an international laboratory in Heidelberg. There, he had every advantage, technical and intellectual, and his work had gone swimmingly. He had moved to a Wellcome-funded research institute in England in 1999. And although his postdoc grant, as is typical, was for only two years, he won a rare career development award that gave him some independence for four more years. A six-year postdoc was an unusual opportunity, and it allowed him to define his own research field. By 2004, he had published six experimental papers in good journals, and on four of these, he was first author. It was the high point in his career, and when he applied for posts in Cambridge, London, Stanford, and Tubingen, he was short-listed for them all. He chose Cambridge University and a Royal Society Research Fellowship that offered him up to ten years' salary. This should have brought the peace of mind to plan projects that would take five years, or even longer. So, what went wrong?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000198" title=""&gt;Silent Springs: Why Are All the Frogs 'Croaking'?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Amphibians became the most ancient class of land-dwelling vertebrates when, 360 million years ago, primitive amphibia such as Ichthyostega first hauled themselves out of their aquatic environment. Since that ancient event, the amphibia have ramified into over 6,300 species of breathtaking diversity: they inhabit all continents (excepting Antarctica), from deserts to altitudes of over 5,300 metres, manufacture an astoundingly complex arsenal of chemicals, and undergo complex metamorphic transitions that bridge aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000151" title=""&gt;Grading Quality of Evidence and Strength of Recommendations: A Perspective&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Evidence-based practice requires translating research findings into clinical and policy decision making. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) serve this purpose by evaluating evidence and making recommendations about therapeutic and diagnostic interventions and clinical management strategies. Systematic reviews are considered the best available evidence and are often used in the development of CPGs [1],[2]. Since guideline development involves an assessment of the overall quality of evidence and complex balancing of trade-offs between the important benefits and harms of any given intervention, arbitrariness, value judgements, and subjectivity ultimately come into play in the guideline development process and associated recommendations [3]. In order to minimize cognitive bias in interpreting evidence and make the inherently subjective process more transparent and consistent, CPGs have traditionally employed formal systems or frameworks to understand and grade the quality of the body of evidence and strength of recommendations [4],[5].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007033" title=""&gt;Oxygen Consumption Can Regulate the Growth of Tumors, a New Perspective on the Warburg Effect&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The unique metabolism of tumors was described many years ago by Otto Warburg, who identified tumor cells with increased glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial activity. However, "aerobic glycolysis" generates fewer ATP per glucose molecule than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, so in terms of energy production, it is unclear how increasing a less efficient process provides tumors with a growth advantage. We carried out a screen for loss of genetic elements in pancreatic tumor cells that accelerated their growth as tumors, and identified mitochondrial ribosomal protein L28 (MRPL28). Knockdown of MRPL28 in these cells decreased mitochondrial activity, and increased glycolysis, but paradoxically, decreased cellular growth in vitro. Following Warburg's observations, this mutation causes decreased mitochondrial function, compensatory increase in glycolysis and accelerated growth in vivo. Likewise, knockdown of either mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) or cytochrome oxidase had a similar effect. Conversely, expression of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) increased oxygen consumption and decreased tumor growth. Finally, treatment of tumor bearing animals with dichloroacetate (DCA) increased pyruvate consumption in the mitochondria, increased total oxygen consumption, increased tumor hypoxia and slowed tumor growth. We interpret these findings to show that non-oncogenic genetic changes that alter mitochondrial metabolism can regulate tumor growth through modulation of the consumption of oxygen, which appears to be a rate limiting substrate for tumor proliferation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007032" title=""&gt;Characterization of an Enantioselective Odorant Receptor in the Yellow Fever Mosquito Aedes aegypti&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enantiomers differ only in the left or right handedness (chirality) of their orientations and exhibit identical chemical and physical properties. In chemical communication systems, enantiomers can be differentially active at the physiological and behavioral levels. Only recently were enantioselective odorant receptors demonstrated in mammals while their existence in insects has remained hypothetical. Using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp of Xenopus oocytes, we show that the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, odorant receptor 8 (AaOR8) acts as a chiral selective receptor for the (R)-(--)-enantiomer of 1-octen-3-ol, which in the presence of other kairomones is an attractant used by blood-sucking insects to locate their hosts. In addition to steric constraints, chain length and degree of unsaturation play important roles in this recognition process. This is the first characterization of an enantioselective odorant receptor in insects and the results demonstrate that an OR alone, without helper proteins, can account for chiral specificity exhibited by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007004" title=""&gt;Eye-Hand Coordination during Dynamic Visuomotor Rotations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For many technology-driven visuomotor tasks such as tele-surgery, human operators face situations in which the frames of reference for vision and action are misaligned and need to be compensated in order to perform the tasks with the necessary precision. The cognitive mechanisms for the selection of appropriate frames of reference are still not fully understood. This study investigated the effect of changing visual and kinesthetic frames of reference during wrist pointing, simulating activities typical for tele-operations. Using a robotic manipulandum, subjects had to perform center-out pointing movements to visual targets presented on a computer screen, by coordinating wrist flexion/extension with abduction/adduction. We compared movements in which the frames of reference were aligned (unperturbed condition) with movements performed under different combinations of visual/kinesthetic dynamic perturbations. The visual frame of reference was centered to the computer screen, while the kinesthetic frame was centered around the wrist joint. Both frames changed their orientation dynamically (angular velocity = 36°/s) with respect to the head-centered frame of reference (the eyes). Perturbations were either unimodal (visual or kinesthetic), or bimodal (visual+kinesthetic). As expected, pointing performance was best in the unperturbed condition. The spatial pointing error dramatically worsened during both unimodal and most bimodal conditions. However, in the bimodal condition, in which both disturbances were in phase, adaptation was very fast and kinematic performance indicators approached the values of the unperturbed condition. This result suggests that subjects learned to exploit an "affordance" made available by the invariant phase relation between the visual and kinesthetic frames. It seems that after detecting such invariance, subjects used the kinesthetic input as an informative signal rather than a disturbance, in order to compensate the visual rotation without going through the lengthy process of building an internal adaptation model. Practical implications are discussed as regards the design of advanced, high-performance man-machine interfaces.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_57.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/NQQ1UcxmRQA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252976077364"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/laser_video.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/394b64aa20416903</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words"/><title type="html">Laser (video)</title><published>2009-09-15T00:55:10Z</published><updated>2009-09-15T00:55:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/0-SUGdy2aYw/laser_video.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/laser_video.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new video by &lt;a href="http://asymptotia.com/2009/09/14/laser/" title=""&gt;Clifford V.

The &lt;a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/entertainment/movies/Creation-May-Cause-Big-Bang-in-US-59246832.html"&gt;news source got it wrong&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original article confused the film’s distributor, Icon Distribution, with Mel Gibson owed Icon Productions.  The companies use the exact same logo and indeed Icon Distribution was once owned by Gibson.  It is no longer.  We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; movie controversy just got weirder.  First, producers &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/14/creation-movie-cant-find-distributor/"&gt;could not find&lt;/a&gt; an American distributor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there’s a &lt;a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/entertainment/movies/Gibsons-Creation-May-Cause-Big-Bang-in-US-59246832.html"&gt;bidding war for the film&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we have this interesting note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… the film was bankrolled by Mel Gibson’s Icon Productions which was also behind “The Passion of the Christ.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson!?  How did he get a piece of this action?  Does he just deal with religion-related “controversial” movies these days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there’s a dilemma.  Do you go see this movie now that you know who is partly responsible for it? &lt;/p&gt;

In Mischel's experiment, he found that children who could delay gratification and wait for the second marshmallow were considered "more dependable" later as adolescents and generally scored higher on the SATs. Mischel and colleagues also found a relationship between seconds of delay of gratification and scores of ability to deal with stress and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

The absurd analogy apparently goes like this: the Nazis euthanized undesirables, and the proposed health bill would effectively do the same thing, therefore Obama is Hitler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's back up a bit.  &lt;i&gt;Aktion T4&lt;/i&gt; was Hitler's personal pet program of tasking the medical community to identify and murder those considered "incurable".  In practice, this meant the murder of the mentally ill and cognitively disabled---the total murdered was probably about 100,000 German and Polish children and adults with various mental and physical disabilities----or at least &lt;em&gt;said to have&lt;/em&gt; these disabilities.  This was not a "euthanasia" program, but a carefully organized mass murder based on Hitler's ideas of "fitness" and "hygiene".  &lt;br&gt;

Lauder, as discussing the current &amp;quot;adaptationist&amp;quot; program.   Evidently, the &amp;quot;adaptationism&amp;quot; discussed by Dr. Filler, and the papers mentioned above, is what Rose and Lauder define as the &amp;quot;Old Adaptationism&amp;quot;.   This is, by all appearances, dead.   The &amp;quot;new adaptationism&amp;quot; takes some account of the ability of mutations to be &amp;quot;large&amp;quot;, as well as accepting the the reality of developmental limitations on variation.)A Recently Generated Example of Homeotic MutationI&amp;#39;m going to (briefly) discuss a recent paper documenting an artificial homeotic mutation[15], in which an entire homeotic gene was rendered non-functional, and the impacts to various developmental systems was analyzed.   This is certainly not the first such experiment, however its recent provenance, and the widespread impacts to diverse systems including &amp;quot;thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae and in the pelvis, along with alterations in the bones and ligaments of the hindlimbs&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a reduction in lumbar motor neurons and a change in locomotor behavior&amp;quot;,[15] make it an excellent example of the sort of mutations that underlie the concept of &amp;quot;homeotic mutationism&amp;quot;.Before we start, however, let&amp;#39;s take a look at genes and how they work.   Wiki defines a gene as &amp;quot;the basic unit of heredity in a living organism.&amp;quot; This is fine as a functional definition, but the history of research into the subject has provided some excess baggage:   some deadwood that needs to be cleared away.  ...I&amp;#39;m not going to even summarize the process by which DNA sequences are translated into proteins.   I&amp;#39;ve discussed this in past posts, and Wiki has a good description here (including the larger articles they link to).Figure 1:  Summary level cartoon of the &amp;quot;central dogma&amp;quot; regarding transcription and translation from DNA sequences to proteins.   (From Wiki)Specifically, the &amp;quot;central dogma&amp;quot; has often been taken to mean that a gene consists of the portion of DNA that codes for proteins.   This isn&amp;#39;t actually true, according to Wiki:  The central dogma of molecular biology was first enunciated by Francis Crick in 1958[ref] and re-stated in a Nature paper published in 1970:[ref] The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the detailed residue-by-residue transfer of sequential information.  It states that information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid.   As you can see, this &amp;quot;dogma&amp;quot; applies only to the translation of DNA sequences into amino acid sequences in proteins.   It says nothing about whether the gene is, by definition, limited to the protein-coding region.A Local and Temporary Definition of &amp;quot;Gene&amp;quot;For purposes here, I&amp;#39;m going to use a limited definition of gene:   only for protein-coding genes of Eukaryotes.A1   A gene is the DNA that codes for proteins, all the sequence that is transcribed with it, and all the control sequences that (in sum) determine when/whether that gene is going to be transcribed.This is different from the more common (often unstated) definition of only the coding region.   It includes all the introns that are transcribed to RNA and then removed by editing prior to the beginning of translation.   It also includes all the control sequences by which its transcription is controlled.   From the point of studying mutations, adaptation, and selection, this allows most of the mutations that affect development to be included within the gene, by definition.Technically, a gene also should include the DNA sequences that, while not affecting transcription, are close enough to do so if they should mutate from a neutral sequence to one that impacts transcription.Now, many genes code for proteins that perform simple metabolic and/or &amp;quot;housekeeping&amp;quot; functions within the cell.   Others code for structural proteins, that are used to build the cellular skeleton.   But the most important genes, from the point of view of controlling development, are those whose proteins contribute to the activation of other genes.   The network of information handling these proteins are involved in constitutes a powerful and complex analog computer within the cell.How do these proteins and their DNA interact?  Basically, any protein that can interact on a sequence-specific basis with DNA is a Transcription Factor (TF).  (Technically, TFs are enzymes, as are all proteins that can catalyze a chemical process of any sort.   In addition, we should probably demand that the interaction with DNA have some significant effect.)  TFs can work to enhance the rate of transcription, reduce it, suppress it entirely, or do any of the foregoing to the effects of other TFs.   They do this by spending part of their time connected to the sequence(s) they act on, and while they do other parts of the molecule interact with other enzymes, creating a complex analog logic.   (See my early post How Smart is the Cell? Part II:  The Gene Activation network as an Analog Computer for a more detailed discussion of this, and links to more technical and peer-reviewed discussions.)All this depends on the interaction between the TF and the &amp;quot;Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS or &amp;quot;binding site&amp;quot;) that interact with&amp;quot; the TF.   Now, as I mention:  A TF can interact with many binding sites, and its activity with each site will be independent of the others, except that when it&amp;#39;s present in relatively small amounts, there will be competition among sites for TF activity....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, three teenagers are &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-ap-nj-ballpark-etiquette,0,4076357.story"&gt;suing another baseball team&lt;/a&gt; — the minor league Newark (N.J.) Bears — because they were forced to leave the ballpark after not standing during the same song.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The boys say their constitutional rights were violated when they were asked to leave Newark’s Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium in June by Bear’s president co-owner Thomas Cetnar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cetnar confirms the boys were asked to leave but declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boys — Millburn High seniors Bryce Gadye (gah-DEE’) and Nilkumar (NIHL-koo-mahr) Patel, both 17, and junior Shaan (shahn) Mohammad Khan, 16 — sued in federal court Friday seeking unspecified damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/09/three_teens_sue_newark_bears_h.html"&gt;The Ledger reported&lt;/a&gt; that Mr. Cetnar had yelled, “Nobody sits during the singing of ‘God Bless America’ in my stadium,’” and “Now the get the (expletive) out of here.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this story is accurate, then good for the boys.  I hope they win their case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to stand up for that song.  I can understand an argument that it might be more polite to do so, but it’s not mandatory by any means.  Anyone who overreacts about it needs to relax.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think the boys are overstepping their bounds here, just think about those students who are coerced into standing for the Pledge of Allegiance in school every day — but who don’t want to make any oath to an imaginary god.  If they were kicked out of the classroom for not standing, I suspect atheists would be almost universally in support of the students’ actions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of essays counters common Intelligent Design/Creationist  arguments  against the fixation of the fusion that produced human chromosome 2. To recap briefly, ID/C’s  argue that the fusion would have resulted in a chromosome with two centromeres, which would then be torn apart during meiosis. In &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/the-rise-of-hum.html" rel=""&gt;“The Dicentric Problem”&lt;/a&gt;  I explained how the presence of two centromeres does not necessarily interfere with proper segregation. ID/C’s also claim that heterozygotes for the fusion suffer from greatly reduced fertility, preventing the fusion from ever becoming fixed. I explained how this is not true for centric fusions in &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/the-rise-of-hum-1.html" rel=""&gt;“The Fertility Problem”&lt;/a&gt; . Using realistic values for human populations, &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/05/the-rise-of-hum-2.html" rel=""&gt;“Fixation Within a Deme”&lt;/a&gt; showed that the fixation probability of the fusion within a local breeding population, or deme, may be between 4.5 and 10 percent. This final essay will look at the probability of fixation for the fusion in the species as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lande (1979) looked at the problem of fixation for chromosomal rearrangements with heterozygote disadvantage. He constructed a model with populations subdivided into numerous, semi-isolated subpopulations, or demes, in which spontaneous chromosome rearrangements with heterozygote disadvantage occur. In addition, the model included random extinction and colonization of demes. Lande did not include mechanisms like meiotic drive (see &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/05/the-rise-of-hum-2.html" rel=""&gt;“Fixation Within a Deme”&lt;/a&gt; for explanation) in his model, letting genetic drift (i.e., chance) be the primary force for fixation within a deme. He found that the biggest obstacle to overall fixation was establishment of the fusion within one deme. The overall fixation probability turned out to be the probability of fixation within that first deme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once established in a deme, a negatively heterotic [one with a selective disadvantage for heterozygotes–DW] gene arrangement can spread in homozygous form through a subdivided population by random local extinction and colonization. For this process, the fixation rate in a species composed of many semi-isolated demes is approximately equal to the rate of establishment of new gene arrangements in a single one of its demes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/05/the-rise-of-hum-2.html" rel=""&gt;“Fixation Within a Deme”&lt;/a&gt;, I showed that meiotic drive plays a major role in influencing fixation of centric fusions in humans. In addition, the probable structure of early human populations is very similar to that used in Lande’s model. It is therefore reasonable to suggest the overall fixation probability for the human chromosome 2 fusion is at least the value  of 4.5 -10% determined earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there may be another factor that influenced the rise in frequency of human chromosome 2.  Hedrick and Levin (1984) suggested a mechanism that greatly increases the probability of fixation for negatively heterotic chromosome rearrangements during migration and colonization of other demes. They pointed out that the process of colonization often involves small groups of individuals, so genetic drift in the form of the “founder effect” plays an important role. Furthermore, the individuals in these founder groups may be closely related. So, if a chromosome rearrangement becomes established in a deme, then any founder groups derived from it will already have the rearrangement at a very high frequency to start with. If the group establishes itself in an unoccupied area, fixation would be instantaneous for that deme. If the group joins another existing group, given that most demes are small, the newcomers may compose a significant percentage of the combined deme. Therefore, the initial frequency of the rearrangement could already be high enough to exceed the unstable equilibrium frequency (see “Fixation Within a Deme” for discussion of this) and thus drive the rearrangement to fixation there as well.  Hedrick and Levin called this “kin-founding”.  They note that kin-founding is common in many groups of organisms.  Anthropological data confirms this in humans (Fix, 1978). Since Lande’s model does not incorporate mechanisms that influence fixation such as meiotic drive and kin-founding, there is reason to believe that the overall fixation probability for human chromosome 2 may be higher than the base calculation for the deme.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this series of essays effectively counters every ID/C claim about the probability of fixation of human chromosome 2, using actual data from human populations as well as population models based on plausible assumptions. It is up to the ID/C community to present data that specifically supports their contentions.    &lt;/p&gt;

That’s quite a difference from last week when it opened in theaters in the UK with little hope of finding a US distributor.&lt;/p&gt;

My book, &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt;, is of course the best book you’ll ever read in any genre of all time. That goes without saying (at least, in my mind it does). So of course I want to see it selling as widely as possible…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well conservative yahoos have been passing around, blogging, twittering, and jerking off to a photograph showing a ZILLION people at the Washington  Mall.

Steve, of Romford, Essex, was attacked after confronting one of the yobs who had been taunting him about his cousin. Another of the violent louts hit him so hard that he was sent flying and struck his head on the path. Steve plunged into a coma for two weeks as his shattered mum and distraught family kept a bedside vigil at Queen&amp;#39;s Hospital, Romford....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Although no two people see one hundred percent eye-to-eye on any given topic, I would wager that the great majority of people feel the most basic senses of sadness and loss. Stemming from sadness and loss, there bursts a plethora of emotions and feelings that cover just about any spectrum of adjectives you care to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through my past blog posts and contributions on the SGU podcast, I have shared my feelings of sadness and loss concerning September 11th. However, I also feel anger and frustration, brought about by those that have chosen to champion the causes of revisionist history, data cherry-picking, and a revolting extreme political ideology. The antagonists that have brought my feelings to the surface are the so-called “9/11 Truthers”. These “truthers” consist of organizations and individuals who actively contribute to the crafting our generation’s modern mythology. It has been happening since shortly after the 9/11 attacks, and it continues to manifest today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2004, &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20041111195501242"&gt;a CNN poll&lt;/a&gt; showed that 89% of their viewers believe that there was a 9/11 U.S. government cover-up. In a &lt;a href="http://www.zogby.com/features/features.cfm?ID=231"&gt;2006 Zogby poll&lt;/a&gt;, 42% of people polled believed the U.S. government and the federally funded and mandated ‘9/11 Commission’ were covering up information. Penn &amp;amp; Teller reported (via their &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcrF346sS_I"&gt;Bullshit! episode&lt;/a&gt; on 9/11 conspiracy theories) that in a recent poll, 49.3% of New York City residents believe that government officials knew of the impending attack and willingly allowed the attack to commence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our culture now includes a portion of the population that has been saturated by extreme and unproven “truths” about 9/11, so much so that the best way to properly describe what has happened is that we are in the midst of an active mythology, unfolding right before our eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As September 11, 2009 approached, we were reminded that “the lunatics are (still) on the grass” thanks to one of the “truth” movement’s most recognizable figures, the actor Charlie Sheen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Charlie did us all the great service of crafting a dialogue between himself and U.S. President Barack Obama titled “20 Minutes With the President.” Because Charlie (thankfully) has little or no shot of ever being able to engage a US President in such a manner, the best Charlie the actor could do to satiate himself and his audience was to pretend to have a conversation, or to show how a conversation between himself and President Obama might go down in Charlie’s brain. (Thankfully, the art of teaching through use of fictional dialogues is still the domain of the likes of Plato or Aristotle instead of Sheen, but I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of the website &lt;a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/"&gt;prisonplanet.com&lt;/a&gt; (Alex Jones’ website, and he’s a whole other blog post subject for another day), here are some “highlights” of Charlie’s imaginary encounter with President Obama:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie Sheen - … In researching your position regarding the events of 9/11 and the subsequent investigation that followed, am I correct to understand that you fully support and endorse the findings of the commission report otherwise known as the ‘official story’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama – Do I have any reason not to? Given that most of us are presumably in touch with similar evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS – I really wish that were the case, sir. Are you aware, Mr. President, of the recent stunning revelations that sixty percent of the 9/11 commissioners have publicly stated that the government agreed not to tell the truth about 9/11 and that the Pentagon was engaged in deliberate deception about their response to the attack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBO – I am aware of certain “in fighting” during the course of their very thorough and tireless investigative process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS – Mr. President, it’s hard to label this type of friction as “in fighting” or make the irresponsible leap to “thorough,” when the evidence I insist you examine regarding 6 of the 10 members are statements of fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(At this point one of Obama’s senior aides approaches the President and whispers into his ear. Obama glances quickly at his watch and nods as the aide resumes his post at the doorway, directly behind me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBO – No disrespect Mr. Sheen, but I have to ask; what is it that you seem to be implying with the initial direction of this discussion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS – I am not implying anything Mr. President. I am here to present the facts and see what you plan to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Charlie, he’s not implying anything. Oh, really Charlie? Continuing …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CS – Mr. President, are you aware of the number of days it took to begin the investigation into JFK’s assassination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBO – If memory serves I believe it was two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS – Close. Seventeen days to be exact. Are you aware sir, how long it took to begin the investigation into Pearl Harbor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBO – I would say again about….two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS – Close again sir, eleven days to be exact. Are you aware Mr. President how long it took to begin the investigation into 9/11?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBO – I know it must have seemed like a very long time for all the grieving families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS – It was a very long time Mr. President – four hundred and forty days. Roughly 14 months. Does it bother you Mr. President that it only took FIVE HOURS for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld after the initial attack to recommend and endorse a full scale offensive against Iraq?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you implying anything yet, Charlie? Or are these still simply the “facts”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the script, Obama reminds Charlie that he’s down to his last five minutes, so Charlie goes into &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gish_gallop"&gt;rapid-fire classic Gish-Gallop&lt;/a&gt; mode as he throws up crunchy nuggets of “truth” such as: Osama Bin Laden was never charged with any crimes by the Department of Justice in relationship to the 9/11 attacks, an ex-CIA employee claims that Bin Laden was on the CIA payroll on September 10th, 2001, that NY City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was informed by a mysterious person of the tower’s imminent collapse just minutes before the first tower collapsed, that years prior to 9/11 the U.S. government simulated exercises to respond to hijacked airliners crashing into the World Trade Center, that government “Doomsday planes” were sighted over New York City and Washington DC the morning of 9/11, that Dick Cheney usurped NORAD control just months before the attacks, that the black boxes from the planes that struck the towers were recovered and covered up by officials, he carelessly invokes WTC7 with no facts whatsoever …it goes on and on. If you have the patience and the stomach, you can read the whole work of fiction &lt;a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/twenty-minutes-with-the-president.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cut to the chase, all of the questions surrounding 9/11 that the “truthers” validate themselves by can all be found within a few sources. First, read the &lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/4199607.html?page=1"&gt;Popular Mechanics article&lt;/a&gt; by James Meigs who does a wonderful job of summarizing what the 9/11 “truthers” (who are more accurately described by rational skeptics as “9/11 deniers”) are all about. The article includes links to the original Popular Mechanics March 2005 cover story which thoroughly examined actual evidence, refuting many of the items Charlie touches upon in his dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, everyone should read Gerald Posner’s book &lt;a href="http://www.posner.com/why_america_slept.htm"&gt;‘Why America Slept’&lt;/a&gt; for an unbiased appreciation of the actual political factors and government failings since the late 1970’s that all led to the events of the 9/11 attacks. (Sorry, Charlie, it can’t all be pinned on Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld and company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, check out the website &lt;a href="http://www.debunk911myths.org/topics/About"&gt;debunk911myths.org&lt;/a&gt;, a valuable and non-ideological resource whose acknowledgements include: Mark Roberts who wrote the Loose Change Guide, Mike Williams who runs 911myths.com, Pat and James B. (authors of the Screw Loose Change blog), the authors of Debunking911.com, the editors of Popular Mechanics who wrote “Debunking The 9/11 Myths - Mar. 2005 Cover Story”, members of the JREF forums, “RealityBites” and Abby Scott (creator of 911 Conspiracy Wars - “The Movie.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, give &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/rumors.asp"&gt;snopes.com&lt;/a&gt; a look at their collection of 9/11 related stories. Only a few of them directly relate to Charlie’s pretend conversation with the President, but several of these items are still cited by 9/11 deniers to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Sheen believes he is performing a noble service with his work of fiction. What he is actually doing is giving credence and weight to a set of incorrect notions that are poisoning our culture and incorrectly re-writing our history. Much the same way Jenny McCarthy attacks the science and evidence concerning vaccinations, or someone like Oliver Stone perpetuates the myths about the assassination of President Kennedy, Charlie Sheen’s behavior helps sway public opinions against the facts and evidence surrounding one of the most defining, important, and emotional days in United States history - simply becasue he is a famous actor. Charlie’s attempt at a noble service is actually a great disservice to us all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evan Bernstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252957073417"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/just_because_they_wont_mention.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3a07e8a150ae51f5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">Just because they won&amp;#39;t mention it…</title><published>2009-09-14T19:10:19Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T19:10:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/jFwmkwJL2Jg/just_because_they_wont_mention.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/just_because_they_wont_mention.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's another &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/reviews/2009/09/unscientific-america-surprisingly-unscientific.ars"&gt;negative review of &lt;i&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

A new study reveals that pulling out is equally as effective at preventing pregnancy as condoms. Sure, it has it’s flaws, and it doesn’t prevent against STIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of people argued that, in the heat of the moment, pulling out doesn’t happen. Others argued that the STI issue is too big to ignore. And others said that teaching people that withdrawal is as good as a condom for preventing pregnancy will result in most people choosing to forgo condoms for the better feeling, easier, cheaper, and always available “pearl necklace” option. (Don’t look that up if you’re at work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One suggestion was that we should not even teach withdrawal as an effective pregnancy prevention option because of the fact that people &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;use it irresponsibly, especially teenagers who are not experienced enough sexually or disciplined enough to know when it’s time to get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I still disagree that withdrawal should remain stigmatized, the last suggestion got me thinking, and I wonder where you guys stand on the idea of this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it ever a good idea to keep information away from the public, information that could benefit many, to protect them from possibly using it irresponsibly?  Does it matter what the information is? Does the ratio of possibly benefiting from vs possibly misusing the info matter? Does it matter who is receiving and possibly distributing the information?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

See &lt;a href="http://www.bibleinterp.com/opeds/ethics_3579.shtml"&gt;Philip Davies’ post &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Davies' conclusions are not really that different from my argument that the Bible is largely irrelevant to modern society in terms of its ethical values (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The End of Biblical Studies&lt;/span&gt; [2007]). But I would add that the appeals to biblical authority are still causing a lot of ethical problems in modern society. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I particularly appreciated Davies’ criticisms of those who see the prophets as paradigms of ethics.  To me, many of these prophets are simply promoters of Yahwistic imperialism. In addition, many Christian readers uncritically assume that the prophets’ critiques of their society were accurate. This would be like assuming that Glenn Beck’s tirades against President Obama are always correct or ethical.  Actually, it may be the kings labeled as “evil” who are being imitated in our society (at least in some very limited areas such as a more liberal religious pluralism for which the prophets often attacked them).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, to read what other biblical scholars are saying, see &lt;a href="http://ancienthebrewpoetry.typepad.com/ancient_hebrew_poetry/2009/09/roundup-of-posts-in-response-to-philip-r-davies-latest.html#more"&gt;Responses to Davies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have covered a lot of the issues mentioned by these responses in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence&lt;/span&gt; (2005) and in T&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;he End of Biblical Studies&lt;/span&gt; (2007).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-964716721315070144?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

So says one Christian Blogger named Joshua, who answers the accusation against me that I left the Christian fold merely for "emotional" reasons. He gets it!! &lt;blockquote&gt;There is plenty of theology floating around that indicates that the church and people with God’s spirit “inside” of them will have certain features, and that the church will not be merely nominal in nature. So bad experiences are more epistemically relevant than you and many others might like to think. After all, doesn’t this approach what Jesus suggests when he says that people will know his disciples by their love? Indeed, only if we could rely solely on esoteric argumentation, and not our lives, to be a witness and sustainer of faith. &lt;a href="http://egalicontrarian.com/index.php/2009/09/10/why-i-became-an-atheist-by-john-loftus-preliminaries/#comment-1091"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-1414945842109007023?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

And it can be, because demanding civility has been a way to control or limit the voice of alterity or the unprivileged.  When it comes to Joe Wilson's now-infamous shouted remark at the joint session, the question arises as to whether the tone or style of this act was the important issue, or whether the meaning or content of what he said ... the truth of his "You lie!" ... is what should be focused on.

Since so many people have digital cameras at the ready, why isn’t Flickr flooded with ETs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, though, we’ve found our first live-Tweeted alien abduction. Last night, Twitter user @&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Randazzoj"&gt;Randazzoj&lt;/a&gt; Tweeted the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
WTF!!! Anyone else in Brooklyn/NYC seeing this UFO?! http://twitpic.com/hnkqc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randazzo continued updating Twitter with info on the UFO, before this happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/randazzo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/randazzo.jpg" alt="randazzo" title="randazzo" width="419" height="568"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is still developing as Randazzo continues to Tweet his experiences, but apparently it has yet to break into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because your Skepchicks are always on the cutting edge, we decided to investigate this a little more closely before the media gets a hold of it. While Randazzo’s photos and personal correspondences are very convincing, there are a number of problems we discovered that lead us to believe that he may not be telling the truth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. UFOs have been in the news a lot lately, since Wednesday when &lt;a href="http://news.aol.com/article/glow-in-sky-was-astronaut-kevin-fords/667880?ncid=bannadusaolp00000003"&gt;astronaut Kevin Ford’s pee&lt;/a&gt; put on a light show as it was ejected from Discovery. Events like this can convince more people to look to the skies and misidentify normal objects (like the space station, bright planets, planes, and even the moon) as possible alien crafts. &lt;a href="http://www.thisisjersey.com/2009/09/12/more-sightings-in-the-sky/"&gt;This appears to be happening in New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, where two elderly women claimed to see “the Gorey UFO” Friday, prompting others to join in with their own spooky stories of mysterious lights in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Randazzo’s photos look suspiciously like a blimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Randazzo’s Tweets are being uploaded alternately from Twitterfon and by computer on Twitter.com. This is strange because, as my fellow Skepchick Elyse noted, “Who logs on to their laptop while being abducted by aliens? Your iPhone, though… yeah, you’re totally going to grab that and tweet. But not your laptop. That’s just ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Do aliens have wi-fi or another way to connect a laptop to the Internet? And would cell reception even be good on a spaceship? I was just in New York and found a number of dead spots where my iPhone wouldn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Is it even possible to Tweet via Twitterfon or otherwise while being anally probed? At press time, we were unable to locate any porn stars on Twitter to confirm or deny this, so we’re hoping that those with experience with this type of multitasking might leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. What kind of alien visits Brooklyn? Don’t be fooled by movies like Independence Day—the facts show that most abductions occur in rural ‘Merica, usually late at night on dark country roads where innocent men in pick-ups are terrorized by our galactic neighbors. When’s the last time you saw a Park Slope baby beamed out of its $3,000 carriage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Randazzo is editor of &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com"&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps when Randazzo is returned to this planet (hopefully mostly intact), he’ll grant Skepchick an interview about his experiences. Don’t worry, everyone, we’ll get to the bottom of this!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252951761433"><id gr:original-id="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=543">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a7240859c2bd7107</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Careless sourcing"/><title type="html">Press not likely to fall for latest anti-vaccine ruse</title><published>2009-09-14T17:50:51Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T17:50:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/543" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://autism-news-beat.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The fallout from &lt;em&gt;NBC Dateline’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=514"&gt;report about a disgraced UK physician&lt;/a&gt; continues. One of the anti-vaccine groups to feel the pain was the National Autism Association, whose major asset is its legitimate sounding name. Don’t let that fool you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week after the episode appeared, the NAA issued a &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS106778+08-Sep-2009+PRN20090908"&gt;press release &lt;/a&gt;claiming that Dr. Paul Offit hid his financial interests from Matt Lauer and NBC Dateline, thus jeopardizing the nation’s swine flu vaccine program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Lauer very clearly says in the interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Offit is a target. Not just for supporting vaccine safety, but because he himself made millions of dollars for inventing a vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NAA’s only quoted sources for this “news” are the group’s attorney and its president. For good measure, the NAA hangs its charge on erroneous estimates of Offit’s financial reward for inventing a life-saving vaccine, RotaTeq:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), who was interviewed for a Dateline NBC television special, failed to tell millions of viewers that while he was promoting MMR as safe he had also made tens of millions of dollars from selling another vaccine patent to Merck, which is the manufacturer of MMR.  According to CHOP documents, Offit’s share of a royalty sale for the Rotateq vaccine to Merck is a minimum of $29 million and may approach $50 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a far more competent investigation by Sullivan at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3051"&gt;LeftBrainRightBrain&lt;/a&gt; found that Offit’s compensation is about $6 million, which is easily determined by following a formula posted on the website of Offit’s employer, the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked whether a retraction is coming, an NAA publicist responded “We have no plans at the moment to act on this or any other new information, which at the most amounts to a distinction without a difference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When contacted by AutismNewsBeat, NAA president Wendy Fournier simply said “No comment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NAA release makes several other demonstrably wrong assertions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That Offt was a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice when it voted to include rotavirus vaccine in the Vaccines for Children program, “which ultimately made his Rotateq product worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Merck.” That vote came in 2006, three years after Offit was no longer a voting member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That Offit “does not treat children with autism.” Dr. Offit is an infectious disease expert and a pediatrician, and treats children, autistic and otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That Offit is a paid consultant for Merck. He is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offit addressed these and other falsehoods on Sept. 9, in a correspondence with blogger Kim Wombles, which you can read &lt;a href="http://counteringageofautism.blogspot.com/2009/09/paul-offit-responds-to-press-release-by.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Autism Association lists its headquarters as Nixa, MO. But its latest press release names Austin, Texas, in the dateline. Austin is home to Thoughtful House, an “alternative health clinic” run by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who prefers not to have the focus on himself for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>autblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism News Beat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252951018708"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=1041">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9feb9a0829512b28</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Oscillococcinum</title><published>2009-09-14T16:56:46Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T16:56:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/09/14/oscillococcinum/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yea, a “natural flu medicine.” Let’s do the math.&lt;/p&gt;

There is no methodology here; you don’t state in this “summary” how the study was done, what the patients were told, or, for that matter, whether the individuals being tested ACTUALLY had influenza. We have tests for this now, by the way. We can even tell you what type of influenza it is.&lt;br&gt;
How were patients chosen?&lt;br&gt;
It says it was a “double blind” study, but it doesn’t say it was randomized or the sample size. It also doesn’t say how the patients were treated. Usually, especially for influenza, it’s not just a “here, take this and feel better,” but a systematic set of precautions including a means to limit transmission and treat symptoms and disease. Additionally, it was not established as to whether or not the individuals actually HAD influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, you’re making claims without substantiation. Make ALL of the evidence available with the methodology, procedures, and data, then we’ll talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of note, the “active ingredient” is a “200X” duck heart and liver extract. That’s about 1×10&lt;sup&gt;-400&lt;/sup&gt;g or&lt;br&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/search/?q=grothe&amp;amp;init=quick#/photo.php?pid=2257999&amp;amp;op=1&amp;amp;o=global&amp;amp;view=global&amp;amp;subj=543210855&amp;amp;id=814959644"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/grothe_dragoncon.jpg" alt="The combating woo panel at DragonCon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When I was at DragonCon, I was on a panel we called &amp;quot;How to Combat Woo&amp;quot;, with four other skeptics (Jeff Wagg, D. J. Grothe, Maria Walters, and Naomi Baker), where we took one simple idea about skepticism and talked about how to implement it. Jeff did &amp;quot;Be Yourself&amp;quot;, for example, while I took to heart the advice from the great philosopher &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098206/quotes"&gt;Dalton&lt;/a&gt; who said, &amp;quot;Be nice… until it’s time to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be nice.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel wound up being a nice, basic discussion on how to actually go out and be skeptical, and be an active skeptic. It’s not all that hard to do, certainly no harder than just getting our of bed every day (which I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; underestimating). Laurie T. from Rational Moms was in the audience for that panel, and she wrote up a nice blog post (by &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; I mean &lt;em&gt;sufficiently pandering to me&lt;/em&gt;) about &lt;a href="http://www.rationalmoms.com/2009/09/11/im-not-a-skeptical-celebrity-how-can-i-be-involved/"&gt;a few simple things you can do to spread the wonder and joy of being a skeptic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just asking you to do two simple things: read it, and do it. You’ll be doing a good thing for yourself and, seriously, for the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252949151894"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6473739788020134353">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b2acd3d9ca1f66b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Evolution and "Modern" Religion</title><published>2009-09-14T16:25:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T17:11:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/09/evolution-and-modern-religion.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6473739788020134353/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6473739788020134353" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Karen Armstrong, a former Roman Catholic nun,  was asked to write an article about evolution for The Wall Street Journal.

The book is a look at six Christian families and how they homeschool their children.  Not every family fits the stereotype I know I have in my mind.  Some are impressive; others leave much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following passage, the author asks one father about the isolation his children face at home.  How can they be “salt and light to the world” if they’re not mixing with other children on a regular basis?  The father responds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Roger pauses for a moment as he considers his response.  “If the public school was a neutral ground,” he says, “I could agree with it.  But public schools are not a neutral ground; public school is the enemy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the deck is too stacked?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The deck is absolutely stacked,” he says with conviction.  “I mean, me sending &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; kid &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; is like them sending &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; kid to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.  Do you think they’d be willing to do that?  I don’t think so.  The public education system, in general, is teaching exactly the opposite of what I believe.  And they expect me to put &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; kid into &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; hands for the better part of every day?  How silly.  Now they start sending their kids to me—” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chuckle at the offer… (p. 154)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I like the idea of the puzzle piece, but not that computer-generated clip art that is often used as a shorthand to say “autism.” Today’s image, from a photographer named Jared on flickr.com, seems even more appropriate to the spectrum because the pieces are from a sky-patterned puzzle, and I often view the sky, with its sense of the unfathomable and limitlessness, as an image that feels so right to describe autism.&lt;/p&gt;

Sixteen-year-old high school student, female, diagnosed with autism (though able to communicate verbally), pressed into sexual relationship with her basketball coach. The girl’s parents found out when they discovered a letter in her backpack describing explicit sexual acts and signed by the coach, Freddie Lamont Wilson, 61.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl, who is highly intelligent and capable but whose social skills may lag those of her peers, loved to play basketball. Wilson saw her shooting hoops and recruited her for his  now-defunct basketball program, and she jumped at the chance to participate in a sport she excelled in and form friendships with other teens, a chance that was especially welcome since she’d been turned down for several basketball teams in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson, whose credentials in basketball and coaching seemed impeccable, was the owner of a minor league basketball team and the father of two grown sons. The girl’s parents thought she’d be safe when that they left her in the care of his family for two days in the summer of 2008. But far from looking out for the girl, Wilson forced her to have sex with him. The family of the girl say she’d been acting differently but had no clue as to what was going on until they discovered the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clear-cut case of sexual assault, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But North Carolina state law is clear on the age of consent. It’s 16. And Wilson waited until the girl turned 16 to force her into a sexual relationship. Consider a 16-year-old teenager with a developmental disability that does not impair her intellectual ability or her ability to communicate. But her judgment is not perfect. (And, honestly, what 16-year-old’s judgment is flawless, especially when it comes to a relationship with a much older person who is in a position of authority?)  The girl’s mother says that her daughter’s mental age and sexual development are not the same as those of girls the same age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the law’s the law. In what many are calling a loophole in the state law, Wilson was sentenced to serve from one year and five months to two and a half years. Really, a slap on the wrist for violating a vulnerable teen in the most damaging way. In March, a senator tried to introduce legislature that would expand the second-degree rape law to include a person of authority, a definition other states have on their books. But the bill never made it out of the proposal stage, while legislators pondered who might be considered a person of authority — as if it takes a brain surgeon to figure out that teens and young people can be considered at a disadvantage in any sexual relationship with a person decades older, and if there’s a training, professional or mentoring aspect to the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

Red light passes through the atmosphere pretty well, but blue light gets scattered more easily.  When you look to the horizon at sunset/sunrise, the light passes through a tremendous amount of atmosphere, scattering the blue light all over the sky, but allowing the red light through to your eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why/800px-SDIM0241b.jpg" width="500" title="From 500 meters up, looking at the sky just minutes after sunset."&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, I got a very good follow-up question:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sometimes, either at night or in the morning, not just the horizon but nearly &lt;i&gt;the entire sky turns red!&lt;/i&gt;  Why does this happen, and is the old saying, 'Red sky at night, sailors' delight; red sky at morning, sailors take warning' true?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
First off, this is something that really happens.  Take a look at a typical "red sky at night", and you'll immediately recognize the difference from what's typical:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/q_a_sailors_delight_fact_or_fi/20090805224540_red%20sky%20at%20night.jpg" width="500" title="Much, much more of the sky is red than normal here." alt="20090805224540_red sky at night.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.marvinbeatty.ca/index.php?showimage=56"&gt;Marvin Beatty&lt;/a&gt;.)  So the sky really &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; turn red all over, either at dawn or dusk, &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of the time.  But, what could cause so much of the sky to turn red, and what does it have to do with predicting fair or stormy weather?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that, while air (mostly Nitrogen and Oxygen) will scatter light &lt;i&gt;a little bit&lt;/i&gt;, it takes about a hundred kilometers of dense atmosphere to scatter the blue light away.  But you know what intensifies light scattering?  &lt;b&gt;Dust.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/q_a_sailors_delight_fact_or_fi/dust.jpg" width="500" title="Pretty diverse dust, isn&amp;#39;t it?" alt="dust.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have lots of tiny impurities in your air, they can assist with the scattering.  Even more of the blue light gets scattered away, reducing the amount of blue you have to see.  But this dust will &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; scatter &lt;i&gt;more red light&lt;/i&gt;, sending lots of red light to other parts of the sky.  As long as there's something else for the light to bounce off of (like more dust or clouds), you're going to see a spectacular, &lt;b&gt;red sky!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/q_a_sailors_delight_fact_or_fi/red_sky.sized.jpg" width="500" title="If this is dusk, we&amp;#39;re in good shape!  But if this is sunrise..." alt="red_sky.sized.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.rphotosonline.com/slideshow.php?set_albumName=album01"&gt;Cindy&lt;/a&gt;.)  So what causes dust to just stay in the air like this, allowing the sky to turn red?  Stagnant, unmoving air.  This happens in highly polluted cities, but it &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; happens naturally over the ocean.  All you need is a &lt;b&gt;stable, high pressure weather pattern!&lt;/b&gt;  High pressure areas mean low chances of rain and storms; generally, they indicate fair weather.  When air to the west is stable and high pressure, that means there is &lt;i&gt;good weather coming up&lt;/i&gt;, since weather patterns move from west to east.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/q_a_sailors_delight_fact_or_fi/El_nino_north_american_weather.png" width="500" title="Blame the jetstream, but also blame the rotating Earth with our thin atmosphere." alt="El_nino_north_american_weather.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when air to the &lt;i&gt;east&lt;/i&gt; is stable and high pressure, that means another weather system, farther west, has pushed that stable, high pressure air off to the east, meaning that lower pressures (and greater chances of storms) are in your future.  Additionally, you'll only see the red sky if there is a high content of water vapor in the atmosphere, a further indicator of foul weather ahead:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/q_a_sailors_delight_fact_or_fi/7_RedSkyOttawaRiver.jpg" width="500" title="Believe it or not, this red sky in the morning did *not* bring any storms with it." alt="7_RedSkyOttawaRiver.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image Credit: &lt;a href="http://continuouswave.com/sail-logs/ottawaRiver2006/day7.html"&gt;James Hebert&lt;/a&gt; on the Ottawa River.)  Amazingly, this old adage has a fair bit of truth behind it, and now you know the science explaining it!  Thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/weather-sailor.html"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt; (?!) for having some great information on this, as well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And please, for your own safety, remember that the saying is no excuse for going out on the water unprepared.  Not every red sky at night leads to fair weather the next day, and not every red sky in the morning brings storms with it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/q_a_sailors_delight_fact_or_fi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252945550856"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2173723644113788317">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/87c05bd7c63c5874</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Richard Dawkins Speaks About Evolution</title><published>2009-09-14T16:07:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T16:14:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/09/richard-dawkins-speaks-about-evolution.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2173723644113788317/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2173723644113788317" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> During last week&amp;#39;s class I asked my students if they had heard of Richard Dawkins.

You might start with an essay by Aubrey de Grey, in which he coins a new term for an aspect what has in the past been called actuarial escape velocity - the point at which steadily increasing life expectancy rises by more than one year with each passing year: Aging, being a composite of innumerable types of molecular and cellular decay, will be defeated incrementally. I have for some time predicted that this succession of advances will feature a threshold, which I here christen the 'Methuselarity,' following which there will actually be a progressive decline in the rate of improvement in our anti-aging technology that is required to prevent a rise in our risk of death from age-related causes as we become chronologically older. Various commentators have observed the similarity of this prediction to that made by Good, Vinge, Kurzweil and others concerning technology in general (and, in particular, computer technology), which they have termed the 'singularity.' In this essay I compare and contrast these two concepts.......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Two of them, a teachers' workshop and the Yodzis Colloquium, have already run, but there is another coming up that I am pleased to announce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://arts.uoguelph.ca/eayd2009/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;This View of Life: Evolutionary Art for the Year of Darwin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;University of Guelph and Ed Video&lt;br&gt;Oct. 9 - 30&lt;br&gt;Reception Oct. 16, 5:00-7:00pm Science Complex Atrium&lt;br&gt;Admission is free&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Sq5IJrOQ7NI/AAAAAAAAAwc/9UZrFDOnT7I/s1600-h/thisviewposter.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;width:259px;height:400px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Sq5IJrOQ7NI/AAAAAAAAAwc/9UZrFDOnT7I/s400/thisviewposter.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Click poster for larger view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;‘This View of Life’ showcases the melding of artistic and scientific disciplines in this year of celebration for Charles Darwin.  This group exhibition presents recent work from contemporary Canadian artists and features several collaborative projects created with scientists from the University of Guelph.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The investigation of evolutionary theory is not limited to the lab, field or fossil bed.  Darwinian theory, after a century and a half, continues to inspire creativity which perpetuates the evolution of these ideas in their own right.  Forms of expression can be compared to instruments of observation, magnifying some aspects of evolution while masking or distorting others.  Presented by the University of Guelph and Ed Video, these exhibits offer unique perspectives into the nature and scope of biological novelty, organic variation, and evolving life forms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reception will feature artwork, biological specimens, and presentations by project participants.  Artwork will also be exhibited at the Ed Video Gallery and at various locations on campus for the duration of the show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Artists:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Mat Brown &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Jefferson Campbell-Cooper &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Alison Judd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Christy Langer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Jean Maddison &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Allyson Mitchell &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Jenn E Norton &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Prof. Burnaby Q.

She was a little girl in Yemen — she would still be in elementary school in the US, or would be just entering middle school. Twelve year old girls are still interested in dolls, and are maybe giggling over those gawky immature boys, and should be learning prior to the awkward business of growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Yemen, Fawziya was married to a 24 year old man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was &lt;i&gt;pregnant&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was in labor for 3 agonizing days — twelve year old girls usually aren&amp;#39;t physically developed enough to cope with childbirth, at least not with the relative (emphasis on that word, please, labor is rough enough on adults) ease of a grown-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/09/14/yemen.childbirth.death/index.html"&gt;She bled to death and died in pain&lt;/a&gt;. The baby died, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was &lt;i&gt;twelve years old&lt;/i&gt;, and won't be getting any older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The father, of course, experienced no discomfort, and is ready to receive consolation for his loss. He's probably looking for a new wife, too. Maybe he'll see the problem with child-raping, though, and will pick one who is a little mature.&lt;/p&gt;

As you watch, your eyes will dart back and forth across the images, so that you can perceive the most important features. And even though you might not be consciously aware of the differences, your brain will have picked up on them. This implicit form of remembering is referred to as relational memory; in this case, the brain is encoding the perceptual associations between items in the image. And recent studies have shown that relational memory retrieval is evident in eye movements - even if you did not explicitly detect the change in the second image, you will, without knowing it, have spent more time looking at the changed area than at others.

However, it was unclear whether relational memory retrieval involved the same neural substrates as retrieval of other, more familiar types of memory, such as your recollection of what you had for breakfast this morning, or what you did last weekend. This latter form of memory (known as declarative memory) is well known to involve the hippocampus, a brain structure buried deep with the brain, in the medial temporal lobe. Now researchers from the University of California, Davis, report that unconscious retrieval of relational memory also involves the hippocampus, and that activity in this part of th ebrain can predict the eye movements associated with expression of this type of memory.

I was also a bit perplexed when I read the following headline: “Avatars could help fight obesity.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was a title of an article in the Triangle Business Journal discussing the results of a preliminary study published in the largely obscure Journal of Virtual Worlds Research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In essence, this study (and I use the term ‘study’ very generously here) found that individuals who had personal virtual avatars of normal weight which exercised frequently tended to exercise frequently and be of normal weight in reality – as opposed to the virtual reality of Second Life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are wondering what exactly I am referring to when I say ‘avatar’ or ‘Second Life’ – don’t worry, you’re not alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, Second Life is a virtual world that can be accessed via the internet. It was launched back in 2003, and as of 2008 Second Life apparently had over 15 million accounts. In this virtual world, every person with an account (which you can get for free) has their own avatar, or a virtual representation of themselves (think Mii avatars you create of yourself and your friends on Nintendo Wii – if you are still lost, sincere apologies). In this world, acting through their avatars, people can do just about anything from chatting to strangers, shopping for clothes for their avatar, selling virtual goods, exercising, taking university courses (from 300 different accredited universities worldwide, honestly) and of course romancing other avatars (one of the most popular activities of this virtual world).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are interested to read more about Second Life, watch the video below – it is quite fascinating and somehow a little frightening as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/1a9ve_L1wQs%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So this is where this new publication on avatar’s weight status and exercise habits comes in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors of the study wanted to test 2 main hypotheses:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Individuals with avatars who engage in physical activities in Second Life are more likely to engage in physical activities in real life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Individuals with thinner avatars are more likely to be thinner in real life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I have read some interesting and arcane study methodology throughout my academic career, none even come close to this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some excerpts from the methods section of this ‘study':&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“For this study, we conducted interviews of Second Life residents in our facility in Second Life. Avatar respondents were recruited through a notification sent to all members of the facility’s Survey Group in Second Life. The facility’s Survey Group is free for any avatar to join by signing up at a kiosk in the facility in Second Life; by joining, residents expressed interest in learning about participating in the facility’s surveys. Interested participants were asked to notify one of our staff avatars via Instant Message (IM) to schedule an appointment. Once contact was made via IM, our staff avatar screened the respondent for eligibility. In this study, our only eligibility requirement was that the respondent live in the United States in real life…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This last part gave me a good laugh – “in real life…”)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Each interview took about 10 minutes. Respondents were paid 500 Linden dollars (the equivalent of approximately $2) for their time. All interviewing was done using the private text chat feature in Second Life that allows for privacy, as well as easy transcribing. Voice chat was not used.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So did you catch all that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These researchers actually had a virtual research facility made in a virtual world. Then, random avatars responded to the researcher’s virtual ad for a study and made an appointment to meet with a virtual researcher in a virtual research building in a virtual world. They then came for their appointment, and were interviewed (not in real life of course), and in return they made virtual dollars. All of this happened while the parties involved sat at some computer with an internet connection, with no actual visual or audio contact with a live human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not sure if it’s just me, but this alone is simply mind-blowing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They ended up getting 29 different avatars to participate in the study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s what they found:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In response to their 1st hypothesis, “of those who reported high levels of physical activity for their Second Life avatars, 80.0% also reported participating in high physical activity in real life.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In response to their 2nd hypothesis, the authors found that owners of thin avatars tended to be thinner than those who owned ‘average sized’ avatars – BMI of 24.7 versus 27.4 kg/m2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When discussing the results of the study, the lead author, Elizabeth Dean was quoted as saying: "Based on these preliminary results, it seems likely that virtual reality users may adjust their identity to be consistent with that of their avatars."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, this VERY preliminary evidence consisting of NO statistical comparisons suggests nothing of the sort. In other words, Dean is shamelessly over-interpreting the findings of her study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think about it – is it any surprise that thin people chose to have thin avatars? Is it also surprising that people who regularly exercise in their real life would have their virtual selves also exercising?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not at all! This does not suggest in any way that people would adjust their habits to conform to that of their avatar – if any causality can be implied, it would surely be in the reverse order (first comes real life, then your Second Life.)&lt;br&gt;This obvious caveat has not stopped many, including the study author, from misinterpreting the preliminary results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end, I think it is unlikely that Second Life will help you shed pounds in real life – in fact, the idle sitting at the computer while interacting with the virtual world of Second Life may actually push the scale in the opposite direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver="&gt;Elizabeth Dean, Sarah Cook, Michael Keating and Joe Murphy, RTI International (2009).

As commonly occurs with such pieces, the comments attracted some discussion of what I call mental illness denial. For those who are interested in this topic I recommend reading my five-part blog series on this topic &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=168"&gt;beginning here&lt;/a&gt;. But I would also like to address some of the specific points raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commeter Pious Fraud relates feedback from a friend who is a follower of Thomas Szasz. Szasz is definitely the father of mental illness denial. Forty years ago he had a point, and I admire his defense of autonomy, informed consent, and universal human rights. At the time a psychiatric diagnosis was akin to a loss of rights and autonomy. But there are two major malfunctions of the Szasz position today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that whatever legitimate points he had forty years ago were fought and won. He should just accept his victory – psychiatry has been reformed, partly from a series of legal precedents that reaffirm the rights of the patient. Second, Szasz committed a fallacy that is all-too common – making the scientific facts fit his ideology. Even when the ideology is a good one, like human dignity and autonomy, nature does not have to comply to our moral wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Szasz went too far is saying that because psychiatry abused the notion of mental illness, that mental illness in fact does not exist, and all of psychiatry is nothing but political oppression. He zoomed past his legitimate points headlong into pseudoscience and denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this very similar to other areas in which in order to support a noble moral value, like equality of the sexes, science is abused. Some feminists insist, against the evidence, that there are no significant differences between the sexes. I think Steven Pinker gets it exactly right in The Blank Slate when he points out the fallacy of that position – if you make your moral position dependent upon certain scientific facts, then you make your moral position vulnerable to falsification or you may be motivated to alter the facts to suit your moral needs. Rather, the facts are what they are and we can accept them while simultaneously taking a moral position. Men and women can be equal without being equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the same token we can decry the abuses of psychiatry without denying the science of psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now onto the comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he says, “My reading of the literature is that the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that ADHD is a brain disorder. Of course it is modified by the environment – but at its core, it’s a problem of brain function.” Then he says,“To clarify, no one says that ADHD is a disease, or that there is some pathological process going on. It may be just one end of the Bell curve of typical human variation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may just be my reading of it, but those two statements sound a bit conflicting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do not conflict, but the commenter is conveying Szasz’s exact error in failing to see the difference between a disease and a disorder. My point is that ADHD can be a disorder without being a pathological disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this has to do with the unique complexity of the brain. Brain function depends upon aspects of brain physiology and anatomy such as the activity of certain neurotransmitters and the particular pattern of connections among neurons. These do not fit any classic definitions of pathology – but they do affect brain function, and therefore can produce a disorder. There is no analogy to the liver because the liver does not contain this layer of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words – brain cells may be normal (lacking pathology) but the connections among them may be dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commenter continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But besides that, first, the definition of disease and disorder need to be worked out. Lots of things are on the far end of the bell curve, like having your heart in the right side of your chest (but it retains function), being left-handed, and murdering your family, but those are not considered diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more confusion about disease and disorder here, despite the fact that I defined disorder quite specifically – a disorder is an alteration or deficiency of a typical feature or function that results in demonstrable harm. This may contain features that are at one end of the Bell curve of variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commenter gives examples of things which do not cause demonstrable harm and are therefore not disorders, but ignores other examples which do. High blood pressure, for example is a disorder. Even if we ruled out secondary hypertension – when high blood pressure is due to an underlying disease, and only consider primary hypertension, when high blood pressure is present in the absence of an underlying disease. Blood pressure is simply at the high end of the Bell curve of human variation. Where do we arbitrarily draw the line to say that beyond this point there is high blood pressure? Simple – we use data to determine at what level high blood pressure causes demonstrable harm, when does it increase the risk of strokes and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see the straw man approach that Szasz takes to deny mental illness in these comments. First the confusion of disease and disorder, then the focus on variation while leaving out the “demonstrable harm” bit. But then the commenter migrates over to another straw man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think he is arguing the “harmful dysfunction” idea, which holds 2 criteria for “mental disorder”: 1) there is a dysfunction, generally based on an evolutionary model of natural function, and 2) the dysfunction is deemed harmful by the standards of the person’s culture. So, for example, without understanding how a hallucination works, you can infer it is a disorder with the explanation that it represents something gone wrong with how our perceptual mechanisms are designed to function. One problem with this idea is in determining what is “natural function”. For example, drapetomania – the disease of runaway slaves – was based on the idea that black people were naturally designed to be submissive and to serve,…of course a false idea of what is “natural”. But it illustrates that the whole harmful dysfunction framework is limited by our current cultural understandings of what is “natural”, as well as what is “harmful”. Using the bell curve as the basis for determining what is natural (i.e., most people don’t hallucinate – or don’t claim to hallucinate – so hallucinating is not natural or normal) has similar and other flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a field of straw men, and the internal logic is not consistent. I laid out the two criteria above and in my previous posts – lack or alteration in a typical trait, and causing demonstrable harm. The commenter mangles both criteria, the first as being based on an evolutionary model of “natural” (and they also confusingly incorporate the notion of “dysfunction” which really is part of the second criterion). But this first criterion is not at all dependent on what is “natural” – it simply reflects a relative deficiency of a common trait (like lack of executive function) or deviation from the statistical norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By itself this is not sufficient for the definition of disorder. It is  a common denialist tactic to separate two linked criteria and argue that neither stands alone. Variation and natural selection alone cannot generate evolutionary change – you need both working together. By the same token, you need deviation from the typical and demonstrable harm to be a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drapetomania example is, frankly, an absurd non sequitur as it has nothing to do with the modern concept of disorder, which is not dependent upon any subjective definition of what is “natural.” You cannot equate “natural” and “typical”, which I think is one of the mental errors being committed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next they try to dismiss the concept of “harmful” as if it is as culturally subjective as the slave example. But by “demonstrable harm” we really mean demonstrable – as in there is a measurable negative outcome. For example, decreased life expectancy – that’s as concrete as you can get. If you dismiss life expectancy as a culturally determined value, then you are dismissing pretty much all of medicine. That is a major theme of my critique of mental illness denial – if you apply their arguments consistently, then you end up denying all of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ADHD other criteria of harm are also used – like increased divorce rate, higher rate of incarceration, lower lifetime income, etc. These are the kinds of outcomes we use for a mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, to the extent that there is some legitimacy to the point that such criteria are culturally subjective, that does not render them useless. Because in effect the approach to ADHD and similar disorders is to say to individual people – if you think that being divorced, in prison, and broke is a bad thing that you would like to avoid, there are treatments available that have been shown to be safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words – it is OK to allow individuals to define for themselves what matters in terms of their quality of life. Ironically, offering patients proven treatments for ADHD (as long as proper informed consent is given) reaffirms individual autonomy – exactly what Szasz was fighting for in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we get to what is actually the most legitmate point in the denial arsenal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, his first statement I quoted underestimates the bi-directionality between biology and experience. There are many examples demonstrating that behavior, experience, and function can alter and determine brain structure – just as the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completely agree that there is bi-directionality. I am not underestimating it. The brain has memory, it learns, and learning means changing brain function to reflect experience. Older studies of brain function in mental illness did not adequately control for this, but as the science evolved researchers got better and more careful at controlling for this. For example, including a group of subjects who have never been medicated rules out effects of medication on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in my experience mental illness deniers continue to use the bi-directionality argument as blanket dismissal of all studies that show alterations in brain chemistry or function correlating with clinical entities, like ADHD – even when it makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study I discussed last week, researchers found that dopamine regulation was different in subjects with ADHD – different in ways that reflect underlying genetics, not any known mechanism of brain memory or plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we get to the core of the Szasz position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also makes the comparison between diagnosing ADHD and diagnosing a migraine, as we wouldn’t question the existence or reality of a migraine even though we have no objective markers (in other words, the diagnosis is based on subjective symptoms). But, in the words of Thomas Szasz, behaviors are not and can never be diseases. So, yes, I believe labeling and treating a person’s behavior is very different from labeling and treating a person’s physical complaint of pain. There is a moral component involved in the former that is not involved in the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analogy between migraine and ADHD is, in my opinion, perfectly valid. What we have here is most of the Szaszian fallacies brought together – such as the confusion of disease and disorder. But that aside, the commenter makes a fallacy of circular reasoning – that mental illness does not exist because behaviors cannot be diseases. These are just two formulations of the same premise. No independent reason is given for a behavior not being a legitimate criterion of a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, children with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesch%E2%80%93Nyhan_syndrome"&gt;Lesch-Nyhan syndrome&lt;/a&gt; exhibit self-mutilation behavior – they will chew off their own lips if left to their own devices. This is a behavior caused by a disorder of brain function – an extreme example to make a point. No one seriously doubts that this behavior counts as a dysfunction. We don’t need to wring our hands about whether or not we are being culturally parochial is saying that it is not a good thing for kids to chew their own faces off. Yet it is just a behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, in the end the denialists get caught up in semantics and labels. If you don’t want your child to chew their own face off, perhaps we can intervene to mitigate this behavior. If your child is failing in school and is exhibiting behaviors that correlate with poor life outcomes, there are treatments that have been proven safe and effective in improving those outcomes. Don’t worry about the label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there is a false dichotomy between symptoms, like pain, that are supposedly objective while other symptoms, like inability to focus attention, require a moral judgment. In fact all symptoms require a value judgment to some degree. It is just that some are more obvious or universal than others. Most people (not all) desire to avoid pain and premature death. Many people also would like to function better in their lives, and avoid what they consider to be undesirable outcomes such as incarceration and divorce. This is not functionally different from treating patients with dementia so that they can live at home longer and delay entry into a nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicine is not free of value judgments. What is important is that patients have autonomy and informed consent – again, principles for which Thomas Szasz orginally campaigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I just want to point out the denialist strategy of switching criteria mid-argument. The commenter constrantly raises different objections in order to make unrelated points. In other words, I made the point that migraine is a diagnosis based upon clinical criteria rather than objective biological markers – specifically countering the argument that it is not legitimate to criticize ADHD as a diagnosis on the basis that it is based on clinical criteria. The commenter raised the common counter that the specific clinical criteria are not behavior but rather are pain. This is a  non sequitur, and simply raises a separate point. What I never get is an admission that clinical criteria are OK – that point is just side-stepped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I can never seem to get to common ground with mental illness deniers. They just shift around until them come full circle. But when we try to nail them down as to their specific objections to mental diagnoses it amounts to either semantic games, or denying practices that are not only perfectly legitimate, they are ubiquitous in medicine – so the denial of mental illness in reality is a denial of all medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, I know it's a cliche, but it's really true this time. Last month, a major study whose results had been anticipated by the alt-med community, as well as those of us who consider it to be highly unethical pseudoscience, were reported. However, they were reported without fanfare, without press releases, without any sort of publicity whatsoever. Only a handful of bloggers who have paid attention to the issue (myself included) even noticed, and even I wouldn't have noticed if someone hadn't forwarded the journal article to me and asked me what I thought of it. So under the radar is this important paper that not a single alt-med website that I've been able to find has commented on it, even nearly four weeks after its release.

I wonder why.

I suspect that you'll soon understand why. The study is of an "alternative" medical therapy for pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal, if not the most lethal, cancer there is. There are several reasons for the lethality of pancreatic cancer. Less than 5% of all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are alive five years after diagnosis. To put it another way, pancreatic cancer is the tenth most commonly diagnosed cancer but number four in the list of cancer killers. That's because most (at least 80%) are diagnosed with unresectable and/or metastatic disease, for whom surgery cannot be performed. Given that the only currently known possible chance of long term survival in pancreatic cancer comes from a complete surgical resection of the cancer with negative surgical margins (i.e., no tumor at the margins of the surgical specimens and a rim of normal tissue between the margin and the tumor), any pancreatic cancer patient who is not a candidate for surgery has incurable disease. Of the minority of patients who do have their cancer completely resected surgically, the five year survival rate is better, perhaps in the range of 15-20% or so, but still the vast majority will be dead within five years, usually much less. Moreover, known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple procedure, the surgery necessary to remove a pancreatic cancer in the head of the pancreas (the most common location) is a huge operation that involves removing the head of the pancreas and the duodenum and then reconstructing the connections between the bile and pancreatic ducts and the GI tract and establishing continuity between the stomach and small intestine. It's a tour de force operation that often takes 8 hours or more and is fraught with the potential for complications, both short term and long term. However, for someone with a potentially resectable pancreatic cancer in the head of the pancreas, it is the patient's only hope. Even so, after surgery, median survival times still only range from 12 to 19 months.

I devoured it in one evening.Whew. Now, I can go back to my normal science mode.Randy Olson has been working in Hollywood for over a decade, but he’s still one of us. He gets what being an academic scientist does to you: you become literal, critical, and absolutely focused on destroying error – and it never goes away. He gets us. But he also gets how other people see us, and Olson has a message for us, his former colleagues: For other people, it’s not just about the data, guys.Olson isn’t the first person to say that persuading non-scientists about the truth of things requires more persuasion than just evidence. This has not been a popular message, particularly among a lot of my fellow science bloggers.* These kinds of messages get characterized as weak-kneed capitulation, compromising the truth.For that reason, Olson will probably face his strongest criticism for suggesting that scientists not be unlikeable. It sounds a lot like admonitions of other writers never to offend, which has generated a growling response that there are some people that we scientists want to offend: the people who deal out lies, errors, and untruths.Olson has not cracked that hard problem: how to communicate with those nice people who are just like you and me, except for a few beliefs that are divorced from reality. You know the ones: the creationists, the climate change deniers, the anti-vaccine campaigners, the moon landing conspiracy theorists, the birthers, and so on. Olson’s tips and suggestions won’t matter when dealing with those people, but that’s not Olson’s book. It’s a book that somebody needs to write – badly – but Olson’s approach shouldn’t be dismissed because of that. He’s pointing out that when you launch a full out assault on your enemies, you risk inflicting a lot of casualties on people who might have been on side.Part of what convinced that Olson is on the right track were uncomfortable moments reading this book when you recognize yourself, and think, “Oh, damn, he’s right.”For instance, Olson talks about how being an academic means being critical. We academics forget that even honest and correct criticism can be very deflating.Have you ever walked out of a movie that you loved, and you’re replaying some of those favourite moments and lines in your head... and one of the people you’re with points out something that’s completely illogical? Do you happily respond to that honest and correct criticism, “Wow, I’m so glad you pointed that out!” If so, you’re a better person than me, because my response was an irritated, “That’s not the point.” **And yet, we scientists are routinely praised for pointing out those annoying little untruths. On the very day I received my copy of Olson’s book, one of my blog posts was picked as an editor’s choice specifically because it was critical.On that note, I don’t think it’s any accident that the words highlighted in the blurbs on the back are the ones that say how critical this book is. After all, this book is aimed at scientists and academics, so if you want their respect, you’ve got to show them that you’re criticizing! In fact, the tone here is very amiable and affable. The most critical sections of the book seem more exasperated than stinging.On a similar note, Olson also talks about how scientists are extremely literal. Here again, you don’t have to look further than recent stuff on the blogosphere. The new film Creation is starting to get reviews, and here’s Eugenie Scott’s review on Panda’s Thumb.As someone with a stake in how the public understands evolution and it’s most famous proponent, the bottom line for me was that the science be presented accurately. The second was that the story of Darwin’s life be presented accurately.Her bottom line is not whether the movie has a good story, is emotionally powerful, well acted, or any of the other dozens of things that most people look for in a movie. Her bottom line is accuracy. Such a scientist. For many, looking for that first is missing the point of why they watch a movie.Finally, Olson has something in common with Adam Savage. It’s not just that they do science-y stuff on film. MythBusters host Savage was quoted as saying recently:I realized that my humiliation and good TV go hand in hand.Olson is not afraid to make a point at his own expense. Don’t Be Such a Scientist starts with Olson on the receiving end of a truly terrifying bawling out by an acting teacher. Those four pages alone are near worth the price of admission, but it’s not the lowest or most embarrassing moment for Olson in the book. This is self deprecation taken to a new high, and it’s an illustration of one of Olson’s key tactics for communication: don’t “rise above,” as he puts it. In other words, don’t be high and mighty. Audiences tend not to like such people.*** I’ve tried to avoid righteous indignation on this blog, there are occasions where I bet someone reading it thought, “Boy, is he full of himself.”There is more about this book that I’d like to comment on and explore, but I’ll leave them for later. I’m teaching a class on biological writing this semester, and I hope I can bring some of the issues Olson raises into the class. Don’t Be Such a Scientist is a rich source of ideas, and I’ll be riffing off them for some time to come.ReferenceOlson, R. (2009). Don't Be Such a Scientist. Island Press, 1-216 ISBN: 9781597265638* That Olson mentions the tenor at scienceblogs.com as something damaging rather than helpful... let’s say I’ll be interested to read the response.** For me, the movie was Edward Scissorhands.*** I do have to wonder what Olson makes of the success of House, a show that has a character that seems to violate almost single suggestion that Olson has. The character is unlikeable, always rising above......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know it's a cliche, but it's really true this time. Last month, a major study whose results had been anticipated by the alt-med community, as well as those of us who consider it to be highly unethical pseudoscience, were reported. However, they were reported without fanfare, without press releases, without any sort of publicity whatsoever. Only a handful of bloggers who have paid attention to the issue (myself included) even noticed, and even I wouldn't have noticed if someone hadn't forwarded the journal article to me and asked me what I thought of it. So under the radar is this important paper that not a single alt-med website that I've been able to find has commented on it, even nearly four weeks after its release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that you'll soon understand why. The study is of an "alternative" medical therapy for pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal, if not the most lethal, cancer there is. There are several reasons for the lethality of pancreatic cancer. &lt;a href="http://cancer.emedtv.com/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-survival-rates.html"&gt;Less than 5%&lt;/a&gt; of all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are alive five years after diagnosis. To put it another way, pancreatic cancer is the tenth most commonly diagnosed cancer but number four in the list of cancer killers. That's because most (at least 80%) are diagnosed with unresectable and/or metastatic disease, for whom surgery cannot be performed. Given that the only currently known possible chance of long term survival in pancreatic cancer comes from a complete surgical resection of the cancer with negative surgical margins (i.e., no tumor at the margins of the surgical specimens and a rim of normal tissue between the margin and the tumor), any pancreatic cancer patient who is not a candidate for surgery has incurable disease. Of the minority of patients who do have their cancer completely resected surgically, the five year survival rate is better, perhaps in the &lt;a href="http://cancer.emedtv.com/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-survival-rates.html"&gt;range of 15-20% or so&lt;/a&gt;, but still the vast majority will be dead within five years, usually much less. Moreover, known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple procedure, the surgery necessary to remove a pancreatic cancer in the head of the pancreas (the most common location) is a huge operation that involves removing the head of the pancreas and the duodenum and then reconstructing the connections between the bile and pancreatic ducts and the GI tract and establishing continuity between the stomach and small intestine. It's a tour de force operation that often takes 8 hours or more and is fraught with the potential for complications, both short term and long term. However, for someone with a potentially resectable pancreatic cancer in the head of the pancreas, it is the patient's only hope. Even so, after surgery, median survival times still only range from 12 to 19 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_gonzalez_protocol_worse_than_useless.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_gonzalez_protocol_worse_than_useless.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/veLHVDi5c6E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252937199302"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16028">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e13d7057001b503f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Churches"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Why Don’t Churches Promote Other Churches?</title><published>2009-09-14T14:00:53Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T14:00:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/14/why-dont-churches-promote-other-churches/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://unitedcor.org/"&gt;United Coalition of Reason&lt;/a&gt; is one of the groups responsible for putting up atheist billboards and bus ads across the country.  It’s not really a group in and of itself.  It’s main purpose is to promote local atheist groups in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want atheists to know there are other like-minded people out there and groups for them to join.  Which group?  It doesn’t matter.  Whether you’re a Secular Jew or a Humanist or a capital-a Atheist is besides the point.  But since we all don’t believe in God, we need to help each other out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, if someone is looking for a group to join, &lt;em&gt;maybe your group isn’t the best one for them&lt;/em&gt;.  But maybe you can direct them to another group in the area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something the &lt;a href="http://secular.org"&gt;Secular Coalition for America&lt;/a&gt; has done as well.  Some donors may be unable to give money to SCA because it’s a 501(c)(4) lobbying group… but our staff directs those people to any of the 501(c)(3) member organizations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a competition if we’re focused on the overall idea of getting people to support any non-theistic organization.  When one group does well, we all benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I’m surprised Christian churches don’t direct people to other churches more often.  They seem so set on getting people to join &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; church that they lose sight of their ultimate goal of “winning people to Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But look at &lt;a href="http://www.parkcommunitychurch.org/im-new-to-park/looking-for-a-church/"&gt;what this Chicago church does&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We understand that there’s no “one size fits all” church for everyone, so here’s a list of other churches in the city we’d encourage you to check out as you look for a church home. These are Gospel-centered churches that we love and support:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And look at &lt;a href="http://www.collidemagazine.com/blog/index.php/1269/the-coolest-thing-ive-seen-on-a-church-website"&gt;this reaction&lt;/a&gt; from one Christian blogger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Wow. That’s the coolest thing I’ve seen on a church website — a local church providing new folks with a list of other local churches to consider. (I’m not saying Park is the first or only church to do this — that really doesn’t matter — I’ve just never seen it before.) By telling me about other churches in the area, Park actually tells me a lot about itself as an organization.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shock at seeing that is what I’m surprised about.  You figure churches would’ve been doing this a long time ago.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this isn’t about Christianity or which churches they’re promoting.  It’s the very idea of supporting other people who share the big ideas with you even though they might differ in the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why aren’t more churches doing this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, while they lag behind in supporting each other, atheists better take advantage of this interest in our ideas and support anyone who wants to donate or join a non-theistic group, even if it’s not the one we give to or belong to.&lt;/p&gt;

And why it might be used to treat heroin addiction? The entire literature seems to be in Chinese. I came across that particular paper while searching for others, specifically reports on ablative psychosurgery1  for the treatment of opiate addiction in China (Gao et al., 2003 is the first in English). Hence, the title of the present post is a reference to the book by  Elliot Valenstein, Great and Desperate Cures: The Rise and Decline of Psychosurgery and Other Radical Treatments for Mental Illness.Are there other "unusual" Chinese treatments for addiction, beyond what might be expected (e.g., acupuncture and traditional medicine)? Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a neurotoxin found in puffer fish, is a worthy runner up to aerosol bioelectricity. TTX inhibits action potentials by blocking voltage-dependent sodium channels. It has been tested as a treatment for severe cancer pain, which motivated Shi and colleagues (2009) to compare low dose TTX to placebo in abstinent addicts. After watching a heroin-related video, the group receiving TTX reported lower levels of craving and anxiety, without alterations in heart rate or blood pressure. However, these acute results were from a single session with no long-term follow up.Although Chinese treatments for internet addiction are getting all the headlines these days, drug addiction is actually a much more serious problem. In their review of the literature, Tang et al. (2006) inform us that:Historically, China has had extraordinarily high rates of opiate dependence. These rates declined drastically following the 1949 revolution; however, opiate abuse has re-emerged in the late 1980's and has spread quickly since then. ... The number of registered addicts in 2004 was 1.14 million (more than 75% of them heroin addicts), but the actual number is probably far higher. Opiate abuse contributes substantially to the spread of HIV/AIDS in China, with intravenous drug use the most prevalent route of transmission (51.2%). Currently, the main treatments for opiate dependence in China include short-term detoxification with opiate agonists or non-opiate agents, such as clonidine or lofexidine [alpha-2 adrenergic drugs that inhibit norepinephrine release]; Chinese herbal medicine and traditional non-medication treatments are also used. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has not been officially approved by the Chinese government for widespread implementation, but some pilot studies are currently underway.Which brings us back to neurosurgery. But before discussing the results of Gao et al., a quick review. In the last post, we learned about a new and less desperate cure, the application of Deep Brain Stimulation for Severe Alcoholism. The target region in this small clinical trial (n=3) was the  nucleus accumbens (NAcc), which has been called a "pleasure center" and "hedonic hot spot" that responds to food and pharmaceutical and financial and sexual rewards. The idea behind NAcc DBS was to reduce alcohol craving and "incentive sensitization" in severely impaired patients who had failed multiple treatments (Heinze et al., 2009). The researchers drew upon the experimental and theoretical work of Berridge and colleagues (2009) distinguishing between the "wanting" (incentive salience) and "liking" (hedonic impact) aspects of reward:Usually a brain ‘likes’ the rewards that it ‘wants’. But sometimes it may just ‘want’ them. Research has established that ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ rewards are dissociable both psychologically and neurobiologically. By ‘wanting’, we mean incentive salience, a type of incentive motivation that promotes approach toward and consumption of rewards, and which has distinct psychological and neurobiological features."Liking" has been strongly linked to endogenous opioid systems in the NAcc and ventral pallidum [part of the globus pallidus] as shown below.2From Fig. 1 (Berridge et al., 2009). Forebrain hedonic hotspots in nucleus accumbens shell and in ventral pallidum where mu opioid agonist microinjections cause amplification of ‘liking’ reactions to sweetness. Red/yellow indicates greatest amplification of ‘liking’ for the sensory pleasure.In contrast, "wanting" has been most strongly associated with dopamine in the NAcc, but in reality......brain substrates for ‘wanting’ are more widely distributed and more easily activated than substrates for ‘liking’. Neurochemical ‘wanting’ mechanisms are more numerous and diverse in both neurochemical and neuroanatomical domains... In addition to opioid systems, dopamine and dopamine interactions with corticolimbic glutamate and other neurochemical systems activate incentive salience ‘wanting’. Pharmacological manipulations of some of those systems can readily alter ‘wanting’ without changing ‘liking’. For example, suppression of endogenous dopamine neurotransmission reduces ‘wanting’ but not ‘liking’.Addiction is conceived as a process by which drugs of abuse produce neural sensitization and compulsive "wanting" even in the absence of "liking". With this literature in mind, Gao et al. (2003) wished to:...explore a new way of treating drug addiction by ablating the NAcc... using stereotactic surgery, blocking the mesocorticolimbic dopamine circuit, alleviating craving for drugs and lowering the relapse rate after detoxification. On the basis of animal experiments, stereotactic surgery was performed in 28 patients by making a lesion in the NAcc bilaterally to treat opiate dr...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

In an &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/09/11/qa-with-frank-page-the-obama-faith-councils-most-conservative-member.html"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, he talks about what's going on in that council, and there is actually some good news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My hope was that there would have been more time for focusing on formulating actual policy recommendations for the president. They keep saying that that's something we'll have more time for in the future. But most of our time so far has been briefings from administration officials about various government programs that are already in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they&amp;#39;re wasting a little money and time by keeping these believers around, but they&amp;#39;re not wasting a lot of money by actually paying attention to them and letting them set policy. That&amp;#39;s reassuring, but not particularly efficient…unless, of course, the efficiency lies in keeping the delusional thinkers tied up in committee meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, the way they're thinking delusionally is aggravating. Page is the most conservative member of the team, and what do they put him on? A fatherhood committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been times when my voice and voices of others have been kindly heard, but the wish is always expressed that we need to find common ground or consensus. For example, I'm on the fatherhood task force, and there have been times when I have attempted to deal with the issue of fathers being better fathers because of their faith traditions, that they need to be true to the Bible or some other holy book about what makes a man a good father.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And they kindly listen, and then we move on to what government programs are available for fathers. It's more about how the government would like to help fathers and here's what government money is available for this problem. I feel that the key to solving those problems is not government money but the responsibility that's rooted in one's faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't quite imagine a more disastrous social policy than basing male roles on the patriarchal misogyny of the Bible. Well, except for using that book to define female roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also doubt that they're actually honestly looking for common ground. There's a notable absence of fierce god-hating atheists on the council (hey, if they can put conservatives who want to destroy the public school system on school boards, why not anti-religious crusaders on the Faith Council?), so I think the system is more interested in stacking the deck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/a_peek_into_obamas_faith_counc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ectNNBOiWrc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252936310749"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/14/lcross-impact-site-picked/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c522eeefb393eddc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NASA"/><title type="html">LCROSS impact site picked</title><published>2009-09-14T13:30:20Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T13:30:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/14/lcross-impact-site-picked/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/lcross.jpg" alt="LCROSS"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; NASA has chosen the final destination for the LCROSS lunar impacting probe: &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/main/LCROSS_crater.html"&gt;the crater Cabeus A&lt;/a&gt;, near the Moon’s south pole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is NASA smacking a probe into the Moon at high speed, and why there? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that over millions and billions of years, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of comets have hit the Moon. The water from these comets hits the surface and sublimates away… but if any settles at the bottoms of deep craters near the Moon’s poles, these permanently shadowed regions can act as a refrigerator, keeping the water from disappearing. It can stay there, locked up as ice, for a long, long time. Some estimates indicate there could be billions of tons of ice near the Moon’s south pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detecting that water is tough. Radar results have been inconclusive, with some people saying there’s lots of water, and others saying there’s none at all. By impacting a probe there, any ice located at the impact site will be shot up above the lunar surface, where sunlight will break it up into O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; molecules, which can be detected. Thus, LCROSS. I have a more detailed description of all this &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/04/10/lcross-to-impact-the-moon-look-for-water/"&gt;in an earlier blog post about LCROSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of Cabeus A for the impact site is a good one. It’s near the south pole, it’s a likely spot for there to be ice under the surface, it’s on the near side of the Moon, so people back here on Earth can observe it, but close enough to the limb that any ejected water can be seen. &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/385735main_NMSU_LCROSS_medium-1.jpg"&gt;Here’s a map of the area&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LCROSS is planned to impact the crater at 11:30 GMT on October 9, which is early morning for the U.S. (in fact, there will be two impacts; one from the spacecraft and another by the Centaur booster) The plume from the impact should stretch up many kilometers. It will almost certainly be too thin to be seen by amateur instruments, but the impact itself should make a bright enough flash to be seen if you have a telescope. The crater itself will be in shadow, making the light flash easier to spot. It’ll only last a second or two, so if you want to observe it, be prepared! &lt;a href="http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/observation.htm"&gt;NASA has a nice webpage&lt;/a&gt; with all the info you need to watch this historic event for yourself. I hope everyone gets a chance to see this!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252935080798"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1581">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4a64c82bcd8618e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Dragon*con"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="Podcasting"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Psychology"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Science fiction"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="skeptic zone"/><category term="travel"/><category term="aliens"/><category term="Children"/><category term="Leonard Nimoy"/><category term="No Child Left Behind"/><category term="panels"/><category term="Patrick Stewart"/><category term="skeptic track"/><category term="Skepticality"/><category term="Star Trek"/><category term="William Shatner"/><title type="html">Memorable Dragon*Con 2009</title><published>2009-09-14T13:24:56Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T13:24:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/LLXOBtLfUyQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/?p=1581"/><summary xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">I would say that Dragon*Con 2009 featured several memorable events for me.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I joined my friend Dendro-Åke, his cousin and their charming wives to check out an example of an old exotic building technique near my home. On Skutudden Point near Baggensstäket (an area I keep writing about, it's just full of history) are a number of little 19th century buildings along the shore, and at least one of them is a &lt;a href="http://cybis.se/forfun/kubbhus/index.htm"&gt;cordwood house&lt;/a&gt;, Sw. &lt;i&gt;kubbhus&lt;/i&gt;. This building method enjoyed some popularity in Sweden (and a much greater one in Norway) in the 19th century and until the end of WW1. It's a bit like brick masonry, only you use cordwood instead of bricks and clay daub instead of mortar. And you always orientate the wood perpendicular to the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/09/cordwood_house/DSCN9035lores.JPG" width="263" height="350" alt="DSCN9035lores.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cordwood house on Skutudden is severely damaged from neglect, being an outhouse to a deserted building owned by the council which has neither a road to it nor a jetty. The roof has long since been penetrated by rot, and when that happens a house is doomed unless you do something quickly. Getting it into shape would be costly and involve changing a lot of the structural timber immediately. It would also, I'm afraid, be pretty pointless. Unused buildings rarely survive for long. So the cordwood house won't be there much longer. But we got some photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2005/12/burnt-daub-and-ghost-of-wattle.html"&gt;dug &amp;amp; cleaned&lt;/a&gt; a lot of burnt Iron Age wall daub, I can see that when one of these cordwood structures burns, it must produce great numbers of highly characteristic daub fragments.

Blog that shit!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was about to, when the hospital called with a minor crisis, and then I realized it was the probably one of the last nice days of they year, so I went to the pool with the family, then my wife made a yummy dinner...you get the idea.  Anyway, here's the deal.  I was reading &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/opinion/13kristof.html?ref=opinion"&gt;this piece in the Times&lt;/a&gt; about a woman with a complex disease who died at least in part because of our Byzantine health care system. It was a familiar story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's not just a compelling anecdote---this is every day. I'm just one physician and I regularly see horrors like this. The conservative/libertarian philosophy that encourages this sort of system is sick---immoral, unjust, and sick. It's hard for me to understand how otherwise moral-appearing people cannot see that medical care, like air, food, water, roads, and schools is not "just another commodity". I admit I just don't get it.  This ultra-libertarian view of health care is a form of social insanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no justification for failing to create a just system--none. The cost is trivial compared to the cost of doing nothing. Ours current system is rife with irrational rationing and wasteful spending on profit-driven middle-men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health care is not just another industry where unfettered competition and "red in tooth and claw" capitalism benefits all. The profit motive kills. It kills trust, it kills people.&lt;br&gt;
Ultimately, all the bluster and hot air expended defending the &lt;i&gt;status quo&lt;/i&gt; because of cost, ideology, or whatever is immoral bullshit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/health_care---an_obvious_moral.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/UGEzFMwBS9E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252929886482"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=4372">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07d3516cf501c7ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="skepticism"/><category term="conferences"/><category term="NECSS"/><title type="html">NECSS</title><published>2009-09-14T11:57:21Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T11:57:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/09/14/necss/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past weekend the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/"&gt;New England Skeptical Society&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.nycskeptics.org/"&gt;Ne w York City Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; held the first &lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org/about.htm"&gt;Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism&lt;/a&gt; (NECSS – pronounced nexus). It was, by all accounts, a success. We sold out our 400 seat auditorium, the line-up was fantastic, the lectures and panels were interesting and well-received, and the feedback so far has been glowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plan to make this an annual event – which means that currently there are three annual skeptical conferences. The biggest and oldest is The Amazing Meeting (TAM) held by the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/"&gt;JREF&lt;/a&gt;and in July in Las Vegas held it’s 7th iteration (actually 8th if you count TAM 5.5). About 1000 people showed up to this conference, which has evolved over the years into the de facto official meeting of the skeptical movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend in Atlanta was DragonCon 2009 which now includes a podcasting, a science, and a &lt;a href="http://www.skeptrack.org/"&gt;skeptics track&lt;/a&gt;. The skeptic track, organized by Derek Colanduno of &lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com/"&gt;Skepticality&lt;/a&gt; fame, in its second year this year filled a room with over 260 skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;So now it seems to me we have three annual skeptical meetings geographically spread out nicely in Las Vegas, Atlanta, and New York. Even more exciting is that the skeptical movement can clearly support these three meetings. We do need to space them out throughout the year better, and we are considering moving NECSS to March for that reason (stay tuned – we will announce dates as soon as we have them).  This is a very healthy sign for skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NECSS attracted a very high caliber of speaker, including John Rennie, Carl Zimmer, and Paul Offit – scientists and science journalists who have mainstream fame and appeal. In addition we have a great deal of talent familiar to the skeptical community – Richard Wiseman, Massimo Pigliucci, George Hrab, Jamy Ian Swiss, the cast of &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt; (which includes, of course, me), and Rachel Dunlop from the Australian podcast, the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv/"&gt;Skeptics Zone&lt;/a&gt;. James Randi could not appear due to his health, but took the time to send us a video to show, wishing us success.  And there were some new faces perhaps not as well known from prior skeptical meetings but extremely talented and enthusiastic, including Howard Schneider, Michael DeDora, John Snyder, and Kaja Perina. It was literally an international lineup of science and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I take away most from these meetings is the energy and excitement of the skeptical movement. We had a few attendees who flew in from other countries (including the UK and Sweden) to attend the conference. The room remained packed through an entire day of lectures and panels – something rarely seen at science meetings. And we are already looking toward the future – how to make the conference bigger and better for next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful skeptical meetings are not limited to the US. &lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org/"&gt;TAM London&lt;/a&gt;, which will be held October 3-4, sold out its 500 seats within an hour of opening registration. And there are plans for a large Australian skeptical meeting in November 2010 (which the SGU will attend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the internet has allowed the skeptical movement to explode, but people are still people and there is an aspect to live meetings which just cannot be matched, in my opinion, in the virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the challenge is to make these meetings not only a way to serve and energize the skeptical movement, but to grow and expand it. While we are thinking about how to do that, we could also use your feedback. What can we be doing differently and better. We don’t want the three meetings to be repetitious, so where would you like to see us take these meetings – what can we do that’s new? The advantage of a smallish movement is that your feedback really counts, so tell us what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, US distributors have resolutely passed on a film which will prove hugely divisive in a country where, according to a Gallup poll conducted in February, only 39 per cent of Americans believe in the theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Thomas, the Oscar-winning producer of &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt;, said he was astonished that such attitudes exist 150 years after &lt;em&gt;On The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s what we’re up against. In 2009. It’s amazing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The film has no distributor in America. It has got a deal everywhere else in the world but in the US, and it’s because of what the film is about. People have been saying this is the best film they’ve seen all year, yet nobody in the US has picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is unbelievable to us that this is still a really hot potato in America. There’s still a great belief that He made the world in six days. It’s quite difficult for we in the UK to imagine religion in America. We live in a country which is no longer so religious. But in the US, outside of New York and LA, religion rules.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s embarrassing… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one potential upside to this.  A few years ago, I remember hearing about how &lt;strong&gt;Michael Moore&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_9/11#Financing.2C_pre-release_and_distribution"&gt;had trouble distributing his movie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fahrenheit 9/11&lt;/em&gt;.  When the movie was finally released, the story had become so huge and so many people were eager to see it, that it became the highest-grossing documentary movie of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe this harmless movie can ride the waves of fake controversy, find a distributor eager to capitalize on it as well, and it’ll do even better at the box office than it otherwise would.&lt;/p&gt;

But do you ever use Wikipedia to look up scientific or medical information? Probably everyone does so once in a while. Dave Munger (Researchblogging) concluded a discussion on Twitter as [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

(My point about the spelling is not a prescriptive one; I'm merely pointing out that the first syllable sounds like Standard English &lt;i&gt;bot&lt;/i&gt;, not &lt;i&gt;bat&lt;/i&gt;.)  The literal meaning of the phrase into American English would be "butt man" or "ass man", and the free translation is "homosexual" (trading, of course, on the juvenile assumption that all gays are ever interested in is bottoms).  The phrase appeared in a note near the naked corpse of John Terry, found at his home in Montego Bay last week.  It saddened me to see, in a week when one country atoned just a little for its homophobic past with &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1733"&gt;a genuine apology from its government&lt;/a&gt;, another country continuing to forge a place for itself in the annals of intolerance and moral backwardness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
John Terry was a British citizen with three children who had been separated from his wife for three years.  He had lived for forty years in Jamaica, where he was an Honorary Consul to the British High Commission in the western town of Montego Bay — he was an unpaid assistant diplomat helping tourists solve their travel problems.  The Queen had honored him with an MBE for this work.  One night last week a young man who had gone home with him repeatedly hit him with a bedside lamp base until the sheets of his bed were spattered with his blood, and then asphyxiated him with a drawstring pulled tight around his neck.  He left a note calling Terry a &amp;quot;batty man&amp;quot; and threatening all gays with a similar fate. (See &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/11/homophobia-jamaica-consul-murder"&gt;this news story&lt;/a&gt; for a newspaper account.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaican culture is famously and murderously homophobic. In 2006 &lt;i&gt;TIME&lt;/i&gt; called Jamaica &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1182991,00.html"&gt;the most homophobic place on earth&lt;/a&gt;.  The murder rate for the country as a whole is the highest in the world, but for gays things are much worse.  As recently as 2007 there was a Google-hosted Jamaican blog (gone now) called "Kill Batty Man", devoted to such themes as documenting gay-bashing on camera.  Jamaican Creole has no obligatory inflectional marking of plurality on nouns, so &lt;i&gt;kill batty man&lt;/i&gt; should probably be translated "kill homosexuals". And the proposal is not just humorous hyperbole, it seems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many ordinary Jamaicans actually seem proud of their attitude to gays. The &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVq3TRYAXiw"&gt;YouTube video here&lt;/a&gt; about a crowd that gathered to beat up an inoffensive cross-dresser is neutral in its attitude, but the hostile comments below it are not.  Nor are the sentiments of some of the gay-hating reggae songs by Jamaican recording artists like Buju Banton, Elephant Man, and Bounty Killer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poet Matt Harvey, on Radio 4 on Saturday morning, returned to the earlier story about Turing, commenting more eloquently than I could on homophobia and the prime ministerial apology to Turing (the poem was &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mj4g1#synopsis"&gt;published here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bad week for science-based medicine. It was a good week (sort of) for science-based medcine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a development that anyone who supports science in medicine and opposes quackery will likely find disturbing. Do you remember Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA)? We’ve written about him extensively over the last several months on this blog. First of all, he is the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=36"&gt;man most responsible&lt;/a&gt; for the creation of that government-sanctioned, government-funded bastion of pseudoscience, the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/"&gt;National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. He’s also one of the men most responsible for the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, which has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=567"&gt;done more to protect the supplement industry&lt;/a&gt; from making dubious health claims than any other piece of federal legislation. More recently, Harkin has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=397"&gt;made a nam&lt;/a&gt;e for himself in the health care reform debate currently ongoing by &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=396"&gt;inviting advocate&lt;/a&gt;s of “integrative” medicine (IM), which in essence integrates quackery and the pseudoscientific with scientific medicine, to Capitol Hill as a means of trying to persuade his fellow legislators to include a CAM/IM version of “wellness” care as part of any bill that might pass this fall. In essence, he is trying to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=369"&gt;hijack any health care&lt;/a&gt; reform bill to include government sanction of unscientific medicine. Meanwhile, he has been &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=394"&gt;chastising NCCAM&lt;/a&gt; because it hasn’t “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=399"&gt;validated&lt;/a&gt;” enough “alternative medicine” for his taste. (Actually, it’s validated none, because virtually none of it is likely to be valid.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the man who, according to reports, will &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE5884WG20090909"&gt;almost certainly be taking over the chair&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/"&gt;Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions&lt;/a&gt; (HELP) after the death of its former chair, Senator Edward Kennedy. This committee is among the most important for government health policy and will be in the thick of the final negotiations and battles over any health care reform that may arise from Congress this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of powerful supporters of pseudoscience in the highest eschelons of government has real consequences. As I’ve described before, NCCAM, being based entirely on studying highly–even ridiculously implausible–notions about disease and how to treat it, has resulted in the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=28"&gt;infiltration of quackery into academia&lt;/a&gt;, where ideas once rightly dismissed as quackery are respectfully given deference and studied as though they were anything other than &lt;a href="http://skepticstoolbox.org/hall/"&gt;Tooth Fairy science&lt;/a&gt;, a process that Dr. R. W. Donnell has amusingly termed “&lt;a href="http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html"&gt;quackademic medicine&lt;/a&gt;.” One result was the expenditure of $30 million on an unethical, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=132"&gt;poorly designed, and corrupt trial of chelation therapy&lt;/a&gt; for cardiovascular disease. Another result was an even more unethical trial of an even more scientifically implausible remedy for a deadly cancer. Although the fact that the trial was even done is a horror, at least last week we finally found out the results, which had been suppressed for nearly four years, namely that this protocol is not just useless, but worse than useless. It’s a Pyrrhic victory for science-based medicine and cold comfort to patients with pancreatic cancer who may have continued to use this protocol during those four years, but at least we finally know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the study. But first, a little background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PANCREATIC CANCER AND THE GONZALEZ PROTOCOL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no other way to put it. It’s one of the most lethal, if not the most lethal, cancer there is. There are several reasons for this. &lt;a href="http://cancer.emedtv.com/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-survival-rates.html"&gt;Less than 5%&lt;/a&gt; of all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are alive five years after diagnosis. To put it another way, pancreatic cancer is the tenth most commonly diagnosed cancer but number four in the list of cancer killers. That’s because most (at least 80%) are diagnosed with unresectable and/or metastatic disease, for whom surgery cannot be performed. Given that the only currently known possible chance of long term survival in pancreatic cancer comes from a complete surgical resection of the cancer with negative surgical margins (i.e., no tumor at the margins of the surgical specimens and a rim of normal tissue between the margin and the tumor), any pancreatic cancer patient who is not a candidate for surgery has incurable disease. Of the minority of patients who do have their cancer completely resected surgically, the five year survival rate is better, perhaps in the &lt;a href="http://cancer.emedtv.com/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-survival-rates.html"&gt;range of 15-20% or so&lt;/a&gt;, but still the vast majority will be dead within five years, usually much less. Moreover, known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple procedure, the surgery necessary to remove a pancreatic cancer in the head of the pancreas (the most common location) is a huge operation that involves removing the head of the pancreas and the duodenum and then reconstructing the connections between the bile and pancreatic ducts and the GI tract and establishing continuity between the stomach and small intestine. It’s a tour de force operation that often takes 8 hours or more and is fraught with the potential for complications, both short term and long term. However, for someone with a potentially resectable pancreatic cancer in the head of the pancreas, it is the patient’s only hope. Even so, after surgery, median survival times still only range from 12 to 19 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the outlook for pancreatic cancer, particularly unresectable pancreatic cancer is so grim (the median survival has barely budged from less than six months for decades. Median survival for untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer is on the order of 3-4 months, although gemcitabine chemotherapy regimens combined with radiation) can result in median survivals of six months or more. For locally advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be resected but has not metastasized, the median survival is on the order of 6-12 months depending on the study. Thus, we can rightly say that pancreatic cancer is one of those cancers for which science-based medicine has frustratingly little to offer that can cure it. That’s not to say that science-based medicine doesn’t have a lot to offer for palliation, but no one wants just palliation. We all want to live to a ripe old age, not just have our pain and nausea palliated for a few months before cancer claims us. Even scarier is that pancreatic cancer usually produces few or no symptoms until it is fairly advanced. Usual symptoms include vague upper abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite, and post-prandial nausea from intermittent gastric outlet obstruction, you know, the sorts of symptoms that nearly of us have from time to time and that primary care doctors see in their practice every day. By the time a pancreatic cancer causes severe pain or obstructs the bile duct leading to jaunice, it’s usually unresectable or metastatic. (Often the reason it causes such severe pain is because it invades a plexus of nerves just posterior to the pancreas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the very deadliness of pancreatic cancer and the lack of effective life-saving or life-prolonging treatments for it that make pancreatic cancer a ripe condition for quackery. Rising above most other quackeries to attract a lot of attention about a decade ago is a quackery known as the Gonzalez protocol. It is described on &lt;a href="http://www.dr-gonzalez.com/treatment.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez’s website&lt;/a&gt; as involving dietary changes, supplements, the replenishment of pancreatic proteolytic enzymes, and “detoxification,” including coffee enemas. It is not an easy therapy to undergo. For example, Dr. Gonzalez states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, cancer patients will consume 130-175 capsules a day, including nutrients as well as enzymes. Non-cancer patients might consume in the range of 80-100 capsules a day, the exact number depending on their health status and medical problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know of no science-based cancer protocol that requires a patient to consume 150 pills a day. There are also the dietary alterations that can be quite hard to follow, as well as the frequent coffee enemas. All in all, the Gonzalez protocol is an arduous regimen for a debilitated pancreatic cancer patient to follow. Still, for some reason, it gained some popularity in the “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM) community, so much so that, based on poorly designed case series of eleven patients, Dr. Gonzalez managed to get a clinical trial funded by the NIH to study his method versus standard chemotherapy, a sordid story that Dr. Atwood has chronicled in detail in a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1430"&gt;long series of blog posts&lt;/a&gt;. That trial ended in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is it 2009 before we have the results of this trial, which show that the Gonzalez protocol is worse than useless? The trial, begun in 1999, is known formally as &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/CPMC-IRB-8544"&gt;Prospective Cohort Study of Gemcitabine Versus Intensive Pancreatic Proteolytic Enzyme Therapy With Ancillary Nutritional Support (Gonzalez Regimen) in Patients With Stage II, III, or IV Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas&lt;/a&gt;. The results were finally reported in an E-pub ahead of print manuscript for the flagship journal of the &lt;a href="http://www.asco.org"&gt;American Society of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org"&gt;Journal of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt;, and entitled &lt;a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/JCO.2009.22.8429v1"&gt;Pancreatic Proteolytic Enzyme Therapy Compared With Gemcitabine-Based Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, written by John A. Chabot, Wei-Yann Tsai, Robert L. Fine, Chunxia Chen, Carolyn K. Kumah, Karen A. Antman, and Victor R. Grann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A CLINICAL TRIAL STUDYING FAIRY DUST VERSUS CHEMOTHERAPY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why we &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=55"&gt;emphasize prior probability&lt;/a&gt; so much here at SBM is because it matters. Nowhere have I seen it matter quite as much as in the genesis of a trial of the Gonzalez protocol for pancreatic cancer. The reason is that the “scientific” rationale behind these megadoses of supplements and pancreatic enzymes plus “detoxification” by coffee enemas is what Harriet Hall terms “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1548"&gt;Tooth Fairy science&lt;/a&gt;.” The Gonzalez treatment is basically a modification of a protocol known as the Kelley Treatment, which in turn was very similar to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=291"&gt;Gerson protocol&lt;/a&gt;.  Chabot writes in the introduction to this study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scottish embryologist John Beard first proposed pancreatic proteolytic enzyme treatment in 1906 and soon after published a monograph, entitled The Enzyme Therapy of Cancer. In 1981, Nicholas Gonzalez began to evaluate the use of proteolytic enzyme therapy. Twelve years later, in 1993, he was invited to present a series of cases at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which led him to undertake a case series of alternative medical therapy that included proteolytic enzymes, diet, nutritional supplements, and detoxification procedures. Among 11 patients with inoperable, biopsy-proven, stages II to IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma, he reported 81% survival at 1 year and 45% at 2 years. Four of the 11 patients survived for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the very example of an implausible hypothesis. True, it’s not as implausible as homeopathy (few hypotheses are), but it goes against everything we know about cancer in general and pancreatic cancer in particular. There is no evidence that pancreatic enzyme deficiency has anything to do with pancreatic cancer, for example. Nor is there any evidence that this discription of the rationale behind the Gonzalez protocol, cribbed straight from the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/gonzalez/HealthProfessional/page3"&gt;NCI website&lt;/a&gt;, has any relationship to reality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two major concepts underlie use of the Gonzalez regimen in cancer treatment. The first concept is that the pancreas, like the liver, is an organ that performs a detoxification function and that pancreatic enzymes help the body eliminate toxins and help normal cells repair damaged cells.[2] The second concept is that cancer and most other human illness are related to physiological imbalances created by environmental toxins either consumed in food or contacted in the environment.[2,3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the Gonzalez regimen believe that toxins from sources such as processed foods and environmental pollution are responsible for human cancers. These toxins are thought to accumulate in tissues and over time create imbalances in the autonomic nervous system, diminish the normal immune response, and give rise to cellular damage that can lead to cancer.[2,3] If these toxins could be neutralized and eliminated from the body, proponents believe, both early and established cancers would be halted, and general health would be restored.[2,3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem. These “toxins” are never identified, nor is there any evidence that the Gonzalez regimen actually removes them. It’s not that environmental exposures don’t have an effect on cancer susceptibility. Smoking can cause lung cancer and, ironically enough, &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/64868.php"&gt;increase the risk of pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; as well. “Detoxification” quackery like the Gonzalez protocol takes science and turns it into Tooth Fairy science by giving near magical characteristics to these “toxins.” In any case, cancer is primarily a genetic disease. Even heavy smokers who smoke for 50 years “only” have about a 25% lifetime risk of developing lung cancer, which means more smokers don’t get lung cancer than do. In any case, think about it: Let’s say there is this host of unnamed, undefined “toxins” that give you pancreatic cancer. Remember, the toxins from tobacco smoke that predispose to lung cancer are largely known and quantifiable. Why would one think that coffee enemas would remove those “toxins”? Certainly there is no scientific basis to think that the special diet, the dozens of capsules of supplements and pancreatic enzymes, or the other aspects of the regimen would “detoxify” anything. Basically, the Gonzalez protocol appears to derive from a prescientific notion of disease that is almost religious in its nature blaming “contamination” as the cause of all disease and that one must “purge oneself” of this “contamination” to cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, say Gonzalez supporters, what about the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10368805"&gt;case series of 11 patients&lt;/a&gt; with stage II to IV pancreatic cancer from the 1990s reporting 81% survival at 1 year and 45% at 2 years, with 4 of the 11 patients surviving for 3 years? As &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=78"&gt;Dr. Atwood pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, this was a nonconsecutive case series, a so-called “best case” series. Basically, it’s a cherry-picked series, and I’ve &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=188"&gt;criticized “best case” series before&lt;/a&gt; because they in essence intentionally look at outliers for whom the therapy may or may not have made a difference. Some patients with pancreatic cancer do survive longer than a year. Indeed, actor &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/abusing_celebrities_with_cancer_to_sell.php"&gt;Patrick Swayze&lt;/a&gt; is one such patient, who has now been alive over a year and a half since being diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer with liver metastases. Without knowing the denominator (i.e., how many patients Gonzalez treated to produce those 11 patients with significantly better than average survival for pancreatic cancer), his case series is meaningless. Indeed, back in my old Usenet days in the late 1990s and early 2000s, I would frequently comment that if I were to apply for a grant at the NIH to fund a clinical trial based on such a thin gruel of preliminary data, my application would have found its way to the cylindrical file. The trial for the Gonzalez protocol did not. &lt;a href="http://www.users.on.net/~pmoran/cancer/Alternative_studies.htm"&gt;Selection bias is a wonderful thing if you’re peddling unscientific cancer therapies&lt;/a&gt;, where patients who actually could undergo the rigorous Gonzalez protocol would be more likely to be doing better and thus more likely to continue to do better than average, therapy aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what was this &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/CPMC-IRB-8544#StudyIdInfo_CDR0000067012"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;? These were the objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the survival of patients with stage II, III, or IV adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine versus intensive proteolytic enzyme therapy and adjunctive dietary and nutritional support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two arms of the study were described thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to stage (II or III vs IV), performance status (0-1 vs 2) and nutritional status (well nourished or moderately malnourished vs severely malnourished). Patients are entered into 1 of 2 treatment arms at their choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arm I (Nutritional Arm):&lt;/strong&gt; Patients receive pancreatic enzymes orally every 4 hours and at meals daily on days 1-16, followed by 5 days of rest. Patients receive magnesium citrate and Papaya Plus with the pancreatic enzymes. Additionally, patients receive nutritional supplementation with vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and animal glandular products 4 times per day on days 1-16, followed by 5 days of rest. Courses repeat every 21 days until death despite relapse. Patients consume a moderate vegetarian metabolizer diet during the course of therapy, which excludes red meat, poultry, and white sugar. Coffee enemas are performed twice a day, along with skin brushing daily, skin cleansing once a week with castor oil during the first 6 months of therapy, and a salt and soda bath each week. Patients also undergo a complete liver flush and a clean sweep and purge on a rotating basis each month during the 5 days of rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arm II (Chemotherapy Arm):&lt;/strong&gt; Patients receive gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality of life is assessed at 0, 2, 6, and 12 months and then yearly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients are followed at 1, 3, 7, and 12 months and then yearly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arm I is the very epitome of Tooth Fairy science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word needs to be said about the design of this study. It is not randomized, and it is not double-blinded. It was originally designed as a randomized but not blinded study, given the difficulty in blinding which group is getting coffee enemas, for example, and which were not. (I can see how placebo enemas would be a problem.) Even so, because placebo effects would not be evident in the objective outcome, namely survival, this would not be a major problem in a study of this sort, although the lack of blinding could conceivably affect the quality of life measurements. Unfortunately, investigators could only accrue three patients between 1999 and 2001; so in 2001, the trial protocol was converted from a randomized phase III design to an open label observational design. Basically, patients picked which therapy they wanted, and the investigators prospectively studied how they did. The figure below shows the ultimate flow of patients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Pancreatic-Proteolytic-Enzyme-Therapy-Compared-With-Gemcitabine-Based-Chemotherapy-3.jpg" alt="Gonzalez Design"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One serious problem with a nonrandomized design like this is the likelihood of selection bias. In this case, it would be “self-selection” bias in that investigators would have to worry whether patients who were either worse off or better off might opt preferentially for one arm of the trial over the other. I will address that point after we look at the results, which are quite striking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Survivalgraph.jpg" alt="Survival graph"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At enrollment, the treatment groups had no statistically significant differences in patient characteristics, pathology, quality of life, or clinically meaningful laboratory values. Kaplan-Meier analysis found a 9.7-month difference in median survival between the chemotherapy group (median survival, 14 months) and enzyme treatment groups (median survival, 4.3 months) and found an adjusted-mortality hazard ratio of the enzyme group compared with the chemotherapy group of 6.96 (P &amp;lt;.001). At 1 year, 56% of chemotherapy-group patients were alive, and 16% of enzyme-therapy patients were alive. The quality of life ratings were better in the chemotherapy group than in the enzyme-treated group (P  &amp;lt;.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the quality of life, as measured by standardized surveys, was actually worse for the Gonzalez therapy group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients in the two groups responded similarly to the questionnaires on quality of life before initiation of therapy, but the overall FACT-PA scores during 12 months decreased more in the enzyme group than in the gemcitabine group (Fig 3). Twenty-four percent of total measurements were missing. Quality of life scores of both groups were significantly different (P .01). During the first 6 months of the study, pain scores increased in the enzyme group, but they decreased in the chemotherapy group (P .05); however, few patients reported on use of analgesics. (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all my years in medicine, surgery, and surgical oncology, I have never seen a study with such a striking difference in outcome between the two groups. No wonder the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) issued a &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/YR08/jun08a.pdf"&gt;determination letter&lt;/a&gt; stating that it was appropriate to terminate the study before the full 72 patients were enrolled due to the study having reached its “predetermined stopping point.” These days, clinical trials are designed with periodic assessment of results and predetermined stopping points. These stopping points are invoked to shut down the trial in the event that one group is doing so significantly better than the other that enrolling the remaining patients could not possibly change the result. The purpose of such a stopping point is to protect clinical trial subjects from being enrolled in a study that no longer has clinical equipoise; &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, the groups can no longer be predicted to have roughly equivalent outcomes based on what we know. Usually, it’s the experimental group that does better than the control group. At least that’s the intent. Sometimes, however, as in the case of the Gonzalez protocol, it’s the experimental group that did much worse, so much so that the study was halted before reaching its full accrual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s even worse than that. Not only was the median survival of patients in the Gonzalez therapy group worse than it was for the standard chemotherapy group, it was three times worse. At one year, 56% of the chemotherapy patients were alive; only 16% of the Gonzalez protocol patients were. But it’s still even worse than that for the Gonzalez therapy. Not only did Gonzalez therapy patients do worse than those receiving standard therapy, but they did worse than the “average” pancreatic cancer patient as determined by the survival curve derived from data from the SEER Database. The most likely reason to explain such a result is that the Gonzalez therapy is not just inferior to gemcitabine but is probably completely biologically inactive against pancreatic cancer. What we are looking when we examine the survival curve for the Gonzalez protocol group is, most likely, indistinguishable from a survival curve of untreated pancreatic cancer versus treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this study a slam dunk? Is the Gonzalez therapy, for all intents and purposes, dead? For the most part, yes, but there are a few problems. Of course, the nonrandomized nature of the trial makes it possible that biases crept in. As I mentioned before, that is always a potential problem with a nonrandomized study design. Fortunately, the patients in each group ended up being reasonably well matched in age, gender, and other demographics. There was, however, at least one relevant difference that no one discussed. Indeed, I’m surprised that the investigators didn’t mention it, as it could have at least partially suggested a reason why the Gonzalez group might have done so poorly early on. It’s unlikely to have made a difference big enough to have explained the huge difference between patient groups, but it would at least have been a straw to grasp at. Specifically, the serum albumin levels in the Gonzalez group were statistically significantly lower than they were in the control group. Albumin is a rough estimate of nutrition (although there are better parameters) and we surgeons know that lower albumin levels are associated with &lt;a href="http://www.ajsfulltextonline.com/article/S0002-9610(07)00211-5/abstract"&gt;increased early mortality&lt;/a&gt; in pancreatic cancer. I doubt that this is anywhere near enough to explain such a huge difference in mortality between the two groups, especially since the difference between the albumin levels in the two groups was relatively small (4.3 g/dL versus 4.0 g/dL), with the Gonzalez group still having albumin levels within the normal range, but it is one difference that caught my eye. It is also likely (but not well explained) that there were differences in supportive care, such as the rate of inserting biliary stents to relieve bile duct obstruction or aggressively treating infections such as ascending cholangitis, which is one of the most common causes of death in pancreatic cancer patients. The obstructed bile duct causes bile to back up; the bile gets infected; and the patient develops a life-threatening infection. The primary treatment is biliary drainage, either through a tube inserted endoscopically into the bile duct or inserted through percutaneously into the bile ducts in the liver. Antibiotics are necessary, too, of course, but they don’t do much good without biliary drainage. Also, if there was a difference in palliative care between the two groups, that, too, would be yet another example of the unethical nature of this trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing that surprised me about this study was not so much that the Gonzalez group had the same mortality and median survival as, in essence, untreated pancreatic cancer patients (which they are), but rather that the survival in the gemcitabine group was so long (14 months). This is better than most studies of gemcitabine-based regimens from the time period during which patients accrued to this study (although results of more recent trials have been better). This suggests a possibility of some unexpected selection bias. Alternatively, it could be that this is simply an outlier group. However, it’s highly unlikely that it invalidates the study. Given the striking difference between the two groups and the fact that the Gonzalez group did more poorly than historical controls, from this study we can confidently say that the Gonzalez protocol is almost certainly no better than no treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s probably worse. Go back to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=97"&gt;Dr. Atwood’s post&lt;/a&gt; on this issue and consider the story of an unfortunate 40 year old man who enrolled in the trial and chose the Gonzalez protocol arm. This man was told to have his fillings removed and afterward tried as hard as he could to continue the regimen to the letter and suffered horribly as he did. At one point he was even told that increasing pain might be an indication that his tumors were “dissolving.” Although it may be that the Gonzalez protocol didn’t make his pain worse, it’s quite clear that the man’s pursuing the therapy kept him from persuing effective palliative care that might have made his last few months on this earth a lot less unpleasant. Indeed, this makes me wonder what the investigators did after the trial was closed. From an ethics standpoint, every patient in the Gonzalez arm should immediately have been informed of these results and been strongly encouraged to give up the Gonzalez protocol and undergo standard gemcitabine chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the most disturbing issue that this trial raises is the question of why it took nearly four years after the trial was stopped to publish the results. Dr. Atwood has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=298"&gt;speculated why this might be the case&lt;/a&gt;, namely to cover up the results that were unfavorable to Gonzalez. There is now no doubt that this trial was completely unethical right from the very beginning, but that lack of ethics was compounded by not having the results reported right away. In this, after having had a few days to think about it, I am going to have to strongly disagree with my co-blogger Dr. Atwood when he &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1430"&gt;asserted&lt;/a&gt;, “A compelling argument can even be made that the JCO should not have published the report—as paradoxical as that sounds.” I can understand where he’s coming from. This study clearly violates the Helsinki Declaration, to which &lt;a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/ifc/requirements.dtl"&gt;JCO requires&lt;/a&gt; the clinical trials that it publishes to adhere. However, I find an it equally, if not more, compelling to take the view that the patients who suffered in the Gonzalez group will have suffered in vain if the results of this trial were not published. I also tend to take the view that shining a light on such a trial, in the form of publication, is a good thing in this particular case because it eliminates the uncertainty over whether the results were as bad as we know them to be. Let’s put it this way: If the results were not published in a peer-reviewed journal but rather announced or mentioned in a report, they would seem less credible to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shruggies&lt;/a&gt;. It is these people who need these bad results rubbed in their noses, the better to let the stench waft into their nasal passages and make them retch. When they ask, “What’s the harm,” we can tell them in no uncertain terms what the harm is. The same would apply if they were simply announced on ClinicalTrials.gov or mentioned in a report. It’s just not the same as a peer-reviewed publication in one of the highest impact oncology journals there is. This is truly a case where the greater good can be served by disseminating this data far and wide as soon as possible by the most scientifically credible means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that is most remarkable is that this study was released without any fanfare whatsoever. You can bet that, had the results been positive, it would have been trumpeted with press releases. I bet that even if the results had shown that the Gonzalez protocol was no worse than “conventional” therapy, it would have been trumpeted as “Gonzalez therapy as good as conventional chemotherapy!” to the press. Yet, here we have exceedingly striking results, and what do we hear? Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TOM HARKIN, NCCAM, AND HEALTH CARE REFORM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now return to the issue of Tom Harkin’s likely taking over Senator Kennedy’s old chair and why it matters. The reason it matters is because Tom Harkin is not a science-based man. He is the man most responsible for the creation of NCCAM and has in 2009 been doing his best to infiltrate coverage for CAM in any government health care reform legislation that may come. Yet that doesn’t stop organizations like &lt;a href="http://www.fnih.org"&gt;The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.researchamerica.org"&gt;Research!America&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.laskerfoundation.org"&gt;Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation&lt;/a&gt; from awarding Harkin &lt;a href="http://admin.virtualpressoffice.com/contentAccess?option=clickhere&amp;amp;deliveryid=1249573140274"&gt;a “Champions of Research” award&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s true that Harkin seems a strong supporter of the NIH on the surface, at the same time he is a corrosive influence, inserting his belief in CAM/IM into the NIH and pushing to promote it. Without NCCAM, Tom Harkin, and Dan Burton, the latter of whom in particular &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=92"&gt;pushed the NIH to fund the Gonzalez protocol&lt;/a&gt;, this pseudoscientific and highly unethical study is highly unlikely ever to have been funded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Tom Harkin, who has “distinguished” himself by trying to hijack health care reform to give undeserved legitimacy to therapies like the Gonzalez protocol and even to have the government pay for such quackery, is now in charge of one of the key committees involved with government health policy. I fear he’ll do for health care reform what he did for the NIH through NCCAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be afraid. Be very afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Blair doesn’t need facts, or even a valid argument.  See how he starts by invoking something he thinks we can all agree on - the recent financial crisis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The limits to individualism are in one sense plain. We only need to contemplate the financial crisis to understand that the pursuit of maximum short-term profit, without proper regard to the communal good, is a mistake and leads to neither profit nor good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reasonable point to make.  Arguments could be made for this point or against it, and we could certainly compare their merits and decide if the pursuit of maximum short-term profit was to blame or not.  But Blair isn’t going this route.  Instead, the waffle starts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yet, at a deeper level, the case against a purely individualistic or materialistic philosophy has to be made. Young people today have access to technology, to opportunity, to experiences good and bad on a scale my generation never knew and my father&amp;#39;s generation would find fantastical, like something out of science fiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yet, at a deeper level…”?  What does that even mean?  What “level” is he talking about?  Deeper than what?  Measured how?  Why does this case &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be made?  What does modern technology have to do with it?  Will Blair tell us?  Of course not.  His argument has no explanation (nor logic or evidence), just assertion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The danger is clear: that pursuit of pleasure becomes an end in itself. It is here that faith can step in, can show us a proper sense of duty to others, responsibility for the world around us, and can lead us to, as the Holy Father calls it, caritas in veritate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course – this is where faith can step in.  Obviously.  Because what we need &lt;em&gt;is obviously&lt;/em&gt; to believe in &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; things that are not backed by evidence. That’s the ticket.  Accepting more things without a shred of evidence, or even in the teeth of evidence, is just what we need now.  After all, it worked so well in the past.  Note that Blair has shown &lt;em&gt;absolutely no connection&lt;/em&gt; between this and the financial crisis he started his article with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;After the experience of fascism, Soviet Communism or viewing life in North Korea or the cultural revolution in China, it is easier for us to grasp the dangers of a too-powerful state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreed.  Also, religiously controlled Iran, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3321637.ece"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, The Taliban, &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/sudanese-woman-guilty-of-daring-to-wear-trousers-1783402.html"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;...  And don’t forget, &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/03/hitler-evolutio.html"&gt;Hitler was religiously inspired&lt;/a&gt;.  No dangers of a too-powerful state there, no siree.  Phew, good job that faith “stepped in” to prevent the dangers of a too-powerful state.  Caritas in Veritate (Charity in Truth) my ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the regimes of Soviet Communism, China or North Korea were/are not exactly bastions of rationality and critical thinking either.  They were/are quasi religious regimes based largely on faith (no evidence their systems worked). They just required faith in something else, not the things Tony Blair has faith in, so that was the bad faith, not the good faith, right Tony?  Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;But I would argue that even the concept of community has its limitations. We use the word in two senses: one to distinguish it from government, to emphasise civic society if you like; the other sense is just to describe the general community of public opinion. In politics, of course, especially in a democracy, &amp;quot;the people&amp;quot; are the boss; public opinion is to be courted and if not surrendered to, as (sic) least managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The people&amp;quot; are the boss”?  Funny, I didn’t think the people of Britain supported the war in Iraq.  In what sense were the people “the boss” when that decision was being made?  But at least Blair admits that the only thing politicians have to do is &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; public opinion, not actually, you know, listen to it in any way.  Otherwise known as spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Blair is saving up for his big finish, where faith and belief in god is the only thing that can save us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It is here that Faith enlarges and enriches the idea of community. The recent Papal Encyclical is a remarkable document in many respects. It repays reading and re-reading. But one strand throughout it is a strong rejoinder to the notion of relativism, to the description of the human condition in society as just some amoral negotiation or set of compromises with modernity; or even just obedience to the majority opinion. Not that it is anti-technology or anti-modern; or indeed anti-democratic. But it widens and deepens the relationship between individuals and the community in which they live. It puts God&amp;#39;s Truth at the centre of it. In one passage, it describes humanism devoid of faith as &amp;quot;inhuman humanism&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Without God, man neither knows which way to go, nor even understands who he is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blair’s catholic church had such a strong moral compass that it allowed &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/"&gt;multiple serial pedophiles to prey on innocent children in church&lt;/a&gt; while protecting the predators from the law, and the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/20/irish-catholic-schools-child-abuse-claims"&gt;rape and molestation of thousands of children&lt;/a&gt; in over 250 catholic schools for decades.  Hey Tony, do those articles I just linked repay reading and re-reading too?  Caritas in Veritate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith is such a good moral guidance that &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/09/AR2009090901724.html?wprssrss_nation"&gt;one in every 33 women who attend worship services regularly has been the target of sexual advances by a religious leader&lt;/a&gt;.  In what sense did faith enlarge and enrich the idea of community for those women?  Do tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I see it now.  The 9/11 hijackers were motivated only by “a purely individualistic or materialistic philosophy” and “pursuit of pleasure.”  If only they had had some religious faith instead, all that horror could have been avoided.  Yeah, what we need is more faith in the world.  How could I possibly have missed this obvious conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;

They can be taken care of by animal loving atheists.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are a group of dedicated animal lovers, and atheists. Each Eternal Earth-Bound Pet representative is a confirmed atheist, and as such will still be here on Earth after you've received your reward.  Our network of animal activists are committed to step in when you step up to Jesus.

&lt;p&gt;... Our representatives have been screened to ensure that they are atheists, animal lovers, are moral / ethical with no criminal background, have the ability and desire to  rescue your pet and the means to retrieve them and ensure their care for your pet's natural life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think this is a joke, but just look at the FAQ's.  Question one is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q: Is this a Joke?
A:  No. This is a serious offer to our Christian friends who believe in the Second Coming and honestly care about the future of their pets after the Rapture occurs. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, therefore it is not a joke.  The big problem, of course, is what happens if the represetnatitve who is supposed to take care of your pet gets Raptured?  Well, they've got that figured out too, and it's in the FAQs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Q: How do you ensure your representatives won't be Raptured.&lt;br&gt;
A: Actually, we don't ensure it, they do.  Each of our representatives has stated to us in writing that they are atheists, do not believe in God / Jesus, and that they have blasphemed in accordance with Mark 3:29, negating any chance of salvation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/when_the_rapture_comes_whats_t.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/when_the_rapture_comes_whats_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/wJ-DKLLv7GI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252909046281"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/porn_superstore_wins_conservat.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dbf235b0e1fae6df</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Republicans"/><title type="html">Porn Superstore Wins Conservative ASWF Award, CEO asked to Dine with New Gingrich</title><published>2009-09-14T05:18:15Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T05:18:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/J2WxZkAsY-0/porn_superstore_wins_conservat.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/porn_superstore_wins_conservat.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;This week, Allison Vivas of Pink Visual received a fax from Newt Gingrich's American Solutions for Winning the Future (ASWF) group, informing her that she's been chosen for a 2009 Entrepreneur of the Year award by his Business Defense and Advisory Council&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Norman Borlaug was 95 when he died in Dallas this Sunday. Not familiar with that name? I'll admit that I wasn't either. But I was familiar with the man who developed plants that saved an estimated 1,000,000,000 lives. No, that's not a typo - that is one billion (American usage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borlaug's passing gives us time to reflect on a man who used science and technology to improve the world. In fact, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203917304574410701828211352.html"&gt;Wall Street Journal article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; claims that because of his advances, all hunger in the world today is the result of political disasters, not natural ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borlaug's dwarf wheat crop, known as triticale, was responsible for a mutli-fold yield increase. Star Trek fans will recognize the name "triticale" from an episode featuring "tribbles" - it's what they were feeding on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borlaug also helped create so-called "Golden Rice" which contained beta carotene, - an essential nutrient often lacking in the diets of the impoverished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we have a man that used science to do incredible things. He won the Nobel prize, and demonstrated once again that a thoughtful man can do more than all the prayer in the world. I dare say that no one else in the history of mankind has ever saved as many lives. I would call him a super hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;And yet I'm a bit bothered by something I saw on Twitter.</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252905827526"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/09/13/whither-nasa-the-moon-mars-science/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2e6024e24bd001f8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Politics"/><category term="Science and Society"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Whither NASA: the Moon?

This “Augustine” report (named after chairman Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed, not St. Augustine, which might have made for more entertaining reading) discusses the future of US manned space exploration. The full report should arrive within the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary makes one critical point: NASA is woefully underfunded to accomplish its stated goals (Let’s go to the Moon and Mars and beyond!).&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/09/13/whither-nasa-the-moon-mars-science/mars-geologist/" rel="attachment wp-att-2531" title="mars geologist studying a rock"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/09/mars_scientist.jpg" alt="mars geologist studying a rock" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The committee’s basic message is that, under the current funding profile, NASA can barely retire the space shuttles and the International Space Station. Any ambitious manned space exploration plans will have to be delayed by a minimum of 15-20 years (Bush wanted us to be playing soccer on the Moon by 2020). The committee says an additional $3 billion/year for ten years is required to have a viable manned exploration program, on top of the roughly $10 billion/year currently being spent (for reference, NASA &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; programs weigh in at under $5 billion/year). As far as space exploration is concerned, the current trajectory isn’t going to get us anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting aspect of this report is the absence of science. Out of 12 pages, science is mentioned twice. In the third line of the report, we are advised that spaceflight “really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; rocket science”. Cute. Towards the end of the introduction, we are told “Human exploration &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; contribute appropriately to the expansion of scientific knowledge”. The emphasis is theirs, not mine. Perhaps they’re feeling a little defensive? As well they should. From what I can tell, nobody has articulated a compelling scientific case for human beings to go beyond low-Earth orbit. Or even leave Earth, for that matter. From a scientific perspective, the International Space Station has been an unbelievably colossal waste of money. As &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14401165"&gt;the Economist tells us&lt;/a&gt;, “the useful science that has been done on board could be written up on the back of a postage stamp.” (Sam Ting’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Magnetic_Spectrometer"&gt;AMS&lt;/a&gt; would be an exception. But this is unlikely to have been the most cost-effective way to go about this experiment.) The space shuttle program, on the other hand, has been instrumental in producing amazing science, epitomized by the launching and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/09/09/its-baaaaaaaack/trackback/"&gt;servicing&lt;/a&gt; of the Hubble Space Telescope. Given the immense cost of the shuttle program, however, the science return on investment remains fairly slim. How many space telescopes could have been built and launched by conventional rockets, for the cost of all that shuttle development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that the manned space program is not about science at all. It’s about slipping the surly bonds of Earth and fulfilling our “natural destiny”. There is certainly something compelling about this, although I would argue that the current plans are ludicrously expensive and overly ambitious. My main concern is that the public misses the distinction: NASA sometimes appears to conflate human exploration and basic research. When we talk about sending humans to the Moon or Mars, we’re not talking about scientific exploration. If science is your goal, you send unmanned probes and satellites, at a tiny fraction of the cost. These missions carry no risk to human life, and considerably larger scientific payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any science fiction fan, I’m intrigued by the idea of human colonies on the Moon and Mars and beyond. But if these long-term aspirations suck the oxygen out of the room for basic science, humanity on the whole loses out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>daniel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252905785805"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3051">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3a0a29997839dd81</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The National Autism Association’s embarrassing spitefulness</title><published>2009-09-14T05:00:26Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T05:00:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/6sd6ZBKG564/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252905382163"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16036">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d5047aa84e28f336</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Veggie Tales</title><published>2009-09-14T04:39:37Z</published><updated>2009-09-14T04:39:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/13/veggie-tales/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I blame PETA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The film was chosen to open the Toronto Film Festival and has its British premiere on Sunday. It has been sold in almost every territory around the world, from Australia to Scandinavia. However, US distributors have resolutely passed on a film which will prove hugely divisive in a country where, according to a Gallup poll conducted in February, only 39 % of Americans believe in the theory of evolution." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="edmund-woo-meter" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/edmund-woo-meter.jpg?w=250&amp;amp;h=250" alt="edmund-woo-meter" width="250" height="250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are these products that Edmund (Pseudo)Scientific is now selling on their website?  They are…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scientificsonline.com/product.asp?pn=3151281&amp;amp;bhcd2=1252886270"&gt;EMF Ghost Meter&lt;/a&gt; – This is nothing more than a standard EMF (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"&gt;electromagnetic field&lt;/a&gt;) detector, which usually detects EMFs that are low frequency, such as radio &amp;amp; microwaves.  I have no beef with Edmund selling EMF detectors (I even have one in my classroom), but what galls me is the manner in which they are marketing this device.  They are actually calling it a &lt;em&gt;ghost detector – &lt;/em&gt;and by doing so they are giving credence to the &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Pseudoscience"&gt;pseudoscientific&lt;/a&gt; flummery of the paranormal woo-meisters!  As they say on their website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detect Paranormal Presences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preferred unit of paranormal investigators, this Ghost Meter can be used by laymen with professional results. The unit responds instantaneously to EMF fluctuations and spikes in energy with a detecting range of 50 to 1,000 Hz. The VLF range is 1,000 to 20,000 Hz. An easy-to-read LED display and silent on/off push switch make for seamless, simple operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such devices are often used by so-called &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Ghost_Hunting"&gt;ghost hunters&lt;/a&gt; as they bumble around in the dark, freaking themselves out at every cool draft of wind &amp;amp; creaky sound they hear.  In reality, &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Ghost_Hunting#Electro-Magnetic_Fields"&gt;there is absolutely no reason to think that EMF meters are detecting &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kind of “ghostly entities”&lt;/a&gt;, as a simple application of Occam’s Razor often shows that what the meters are actually detecting is the low-frequency EM-waves given off by nearby lighting fixtures, electrical lines, or even the other equipment carried by the ghost hunters themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you thought that was bad, it gets worse.  Here are some other gems that Edmund (Pseudo)Scientific is now selling…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scientificsonline.com/product.asp?pn=3151280&amp;amp;cmss=H31512-80"&gt;3-in-1 Paranormal Research Instrument&lt;/a&gt; – Edmund (Pseudo)Scientific claims that this device serves three uses: it is an EMF meter, a temperature sensor, and it’s also a flashlight.  Of course, they market it as much more than that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essential Ghost-Hunting Tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measure EMF, measure ambient temperature, and provide a source of light all with one advanced instrument. Designed exclusively for paranormal investigators, this incredible tool has everything you need to track and detect the presence of ghosts. It features a green-lit screen, custom dual display for EMF and ambient temperature, and night view backlit display. The EMF burst mode detects EMF movement rapidly, and the record feature allows you to capture minimum and maximum values from your adventures and investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how they pitch the “EMFs = ghosts” idiocy again, but this time they add something else: &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Ghost_Hunting#Infrared"&gt;the “temperature fluctuations = ghosts” idiocy&lt;/a&gt;!  Ghost hunters often take any kind of temperature anomaly as evidence of a ghost when it is not surprising that more likely, and perfectly plausible &amp;amp; reasonable, explanations abound for any such temperature fluctuations.  It’s almost as if these folks think that simply because they have a piece of cool technology in their hands that it somehow magically makes their paranormal claims more sound.  It doesn’t, because their reasoning is off base, and no amount of technology can fix that, only proper reasoning.  As the old computer adage goes: “Garbage In, Garbage Out”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now for the coup de gras of Edmund (Pseudo)Scientific’s woo-woo…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scientificsonline.com/product.asp?pn=3151874&amp;amp;cmss=H31518-74&amp;amp;bhcd2=1250900090"&gt;Remote Viewing DVD&lt;/a&gt; – I don’t even know where to begin on this one.  Let’s just look at the claims advertised on the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn the Intuitive Science of ESP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the CIA admitted to sponsoring a highly classified government program called STARGATE where “psychic spies” to remotely view people, places, and events. Similar to clairvoyance or ESP, remote viewing is a natural ability everyone posesses. Since the RV program is no longer classified, Lyn Buchanan now shares the techniques he independently developed for remote influencing and reveals the secrets of his research for the first time. Learn the history and latest applications of this amazing field of “intuitive science” and discover for yourself how to devleop and use your own RV-ESP skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn the basics from the best and progress into advanced remote viewing all with one DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, this is the ultimate in a &lt;strong&gt;*facepalm*&lt;/strong&gt; moment… Edmund (Pseudo)Scientific is marketing a DVD they claim will &lt;em&gt;make you psychic!&lt;/em&gt; Aaarrrrgh!  &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Remote_Viewing"&gt;Remote viewing&lt;/a&gt; is a branch of &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/ESP"&gt;ESP&lt;/a&gt; which, like &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; ESP, was thoroughly debunked years ago, yet here we see a respected scientific &amp;amp; educational outlet actively promoting it.  I think I’m going to throw up…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it absolutely appalling that a company dedicated to selling &amp;amp; distributing equipment to scientific classrooms around the world is wasting its time selling this nonsense!  What’s next: fairy dust, leprechaun hats, and unicorn horns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, as a physics teacher, this is the equivalent of opening up their catalog to the biology section and finding products for sale that promote &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Creationist_Arguments"&gt;creationism.&lt;/a&gt; It is outlandish &amp;amp; unacceptable that Edmund Scientific is even involved in this.  And until they correct this situation by removing these misleading advertisements &amp;amp; products from their website, I will no longer purchase any of their products.  I will also do all that I can to encourage others to boycott and protest against these actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re as incensed as I am about this stupidity on the part of Edmund (Pseudo)Scientific, let them know by emailing  them at &lt;a href="mailto:scientifics@edsci.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;scientifics@edsci.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In addition, there is a comment section at the bottom of each product page where you can leave feedback.  Perhaps if enough people voice their displeasure, the company will do the right thing and kick this pseudoscientific crap to the curb.&lt;/p&gt;

Preliminary research, at Australia-based Flinders University, studied the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;behavior of infants who have an increased risk of developing autism from as young as 10 days, and preliminary results show children in an at-risk group (with an older sibling with an ASD, including Asperger’s) were developing different behavioral patterns from children from families with no history of autism. Autism affects up to 16 children per 10,000 in Australia. More is &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26068823-2702,00.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;•   •   •&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Central Florida’s College Internship Program in Melbourne, Fla., is yet another campus nationwide helping students with ASDs prepare for college. Students live in two-bedroom apartments and attend classes at nearby Brevard Community College. They also take classes at the program in social skills, organizing their time and schedules. The program was created eight years ago by a psychologist after he himself was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome.&lt;br&gt;
The Program also has campuses in Massachusetts, Indiana, and California. Another, the College Living Experience, has five locations around the country. The 14 students in the Melbourne program now hail from around the country; 13 are male. “Typically,” says organizers, “when a student comes in, they’ve gone to college somewhere else and failed.” Costs range from $30,000 to $40,000 a year. Some scholarship money is available. More is &lt;a href="http://www.collegeinternshipprogram.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The Orlando Sentinel has also compiled a &lt;a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/home/orl-autism-box-091209,0,6215639.story"&gt;list of colleges&lt;/a&gt; good for students with Asperger’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior ministers of Parliament in the U.K. were slated to meet with the British home secretary late last week to ask for a blocking of the U.S. extradition of a 43-year-old London Asperger’s sufferer who faces trial over alledged hacking of U.S. military computers. Opponents to extradition are citing human rights concerns and a potential threat to the defendant’s health.

Vernon Board of Education voting on a resolution to terminate John Freshwater’s employment as a middle school science teacher, I described a conversation with one of Freshwater’s supporters at the special meeting of the BOE.  I wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also spoke with one of Freshwater’s adult supporters. The No True Scotsman fallacy was alive and well in that conversation. There was an enlightening moment when I recommended that he read Francis Collins’ &lt;em&gt;The Language of God&lt;/em&gt; to get an idea of how an evangelical Christian who is a scientist tries to deal with the conflict. The man asked if Collins accepts Genesis. I replied that Collins is an evangelical Christian, but that he doesn’t read Genesis literally and believes that evolution is the means by which God created the diversity of biological life. The man then refused to consider reading it, saying “I don’t need to look at beliefs I don’t agree with.” That level of willful ignorance pretty much says it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening I happened onto the perfect phrase to describe that mindset.  In &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgUJdsliEM" rel="external "&gt;a March 2009 talk (video)&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.humanism.org.uk/home" rel="external "&gt;British Humanist Association&lt;/a&gt;, Daniel Dennett outlined his approach to the roots of religion.  A questioner in the Q&amp;amp;A period asked why people (his relatives, actually!) hang onto religion so tenaciously, “so locked in until they die.”  Dennett answered, in part (around 1:13:30&lt;em&gt;ff&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the really powerful ideas [in religions] is the idea of sacred truths.  And a sacred truth is one that even &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; about it is evil.  &lt;strong&gt;Don’t even think about it!&lt;/strong&gt;  And when you can establish that about anything, when you can build that taboo against thinking and internalize it – and people internalize it – then they become their own jailers.  They become very effective protectors of their own incarceration. (Emphases in Dennett’s intonation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is exactly the right phrase: “they become their own jailers.”  It perfectly describes my fellow’s mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

This review discusses another possible determinant of aging that is 'epigenetics'. We have seen in the earlier post that epigenetics refers to changes in the DNA and histones which are heritable through cell divisions, but do not involve any change in the sequence of the DNA. Chromatin is broadly divided into two types, euchromatin and heterochromatin. Euchromatin is decondensed during interphase and is relatively transcriptionally active. Heterochromatin on the other hand remains compact and condensed and is transcriptionally inactive. It is further divided into constitutive and facultative. Constitutive heterochromatin is present in the telomer and centromere and appears to be fixed or irreversible throughout the life time of an organism. Facultative heterochromatin on the other hand, is made as a part of regulated cell differentiation process or other changes in cell phenotype. For example, a single X chromosome is silenced in female mammalian cells for dosage compensation.However, despite this apparent clear distinction between euchromatin and heterochromatin, it is now being understood that chromatin structure is highly dynamic and stochastic. Essential processes, such as DNA replication, transcription and repair all involve disruption of the very compact structure of  DNA. The proteins bound to the chromatin are also not static but exhibit relatively high 'on' and 'off' binding states even in the 'fixed' heterochromatin. It has also been showed that, formation of heterochromatin depends on a degree of transcription, which contributes to heterochromatinization through the RNAi pathway. Thus the telomeric heterochromatin is also shown to be transcribed. Thus heterochromatin is not a static entity.Is aging associated with epigenetic changes?The enzymes Histone acetyl teransferases (HATs) and Histone deacetylases (HDACs) respectively determine the steady-state level of histone acetylation. In S.cerevisiae, inactivation of a HDAC, Sir2, decreases replicative lifespan while activation extends it. The anti aging effects of Sir2 in yeast are due to translocation of a Sir2 containing protein complex from telomeres to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats. These repeats are prone to recombination to form extrachromosomal rDNa circles (ERCs), which curtail yeast lifespan. However, Sir2 mediated histone deactylation and heterochromatization, prevents formation of ERCs and thus extends lifespan of yeast. Thus, this epigenetic redistribution counteracts organismal aging. Orthologs of Sir2 have  been found in many species like nematodes, flies and even mice. Thus its anti aging role seems to have been conserved throughout evolution.In mammals, it has been seen that there is a reduction in genomic DNA methylation, with age. It occurs mostly at repetitive DNA sequences, predominantly in regions of constitutive heterochromatin. Since methylation induces silencing of genes, this change will promote deheterochromatinization of these regions. However DNA methylation increases at specific sites called the CpG islands. These are CG rich sequences, some of them present in the promoter regions, which can get methylated. Methylation also increases in the histone 4 on the lysine 20 residue (H4K20) in rat liver and kidney, with age. Like DNA methylation H4K20 methylation is also linked to gene repression, supporting the notion that heterochromatin accumulates in some sites atleast with aging.One of the histone chaperones, HIRA, shows increased levels of expression in aging baboon skin. This is shown to have a evolutionary conserved role in formation of heterochromatin.These observations suggest that mammalian aging is associated with chromatin remodelling. In particular, there is a global decrease in DNA methylation, but an increase at specific sites on the genome.Cellular senescence, is characterized by irreversible proliferation arrest. This may arise due to excessive cell divisions and shortening of the telomere length. Due to this, most human cells have a finite proliferative lifespan. Senescent cells or molecular markers of senescent phenotype increase during aging. Cellular senescence is also well established tumor suppression process, because it can prevent proliferation and neoplastic progression of cells harboring neoplastic lesions. Senescent cells also show chromatin remodeling. Many senescent cells form domains of facultative heterochromatin, called Senescence Associated Heterochromatin Foci (SAHF), which are visibly more condensed that interphase chromatin. These foci have been proposed to silence proliferation promoting genes. Accumulation of SAHF has been associated with  aging. Formation of SAHF requires presence of HIRA, which has been shown to be upregulated in aging baboon skin. Also it seems that in cellular senescence too, the constitutive heterochromatin regions are deheterochromatinized. Thus like tissue aging, cellular senescence also is accompanied by redistribution of heterochromatin, from constitutive heterochromatin to other normally euchromatic sites....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

"He blurted out what many other Republicans probably were thinking,"  one &lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.hu/2009/POLITICS/09/10/feehery.heckle.obama/index.html"&gt;commentator&lt;/a&gt; put it, while &lt;a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_091009/content/01125106.guest.html"&gt;Rush Limbaugh &lt;/a&gt;said: "I was shouting, "You're lying," throughout the speech at the television.  You're lying!  It's a lie!  Joe Wilson simply articulated what millions of Americans were saying." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not quite. However many Americans were moved to tax the President with dishonesty as they listend to the speech, it&amp;#39;s a safe bet they expressed themselves the way Limbaugh did, in the present progressive — &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re lying.&amp;quot; Whereas what Wilson said was &amp;quot;you lie,&amp;quot; revisting a use of the simple present that parted ways with ordinary conversational English a couple of centuries ago. &amp;quot;You lie&amp;quot; — it&amp;#39;s a sentence you expect to hear finished with &amp;quot;sirrah,&amp;quot; and not the sort of thing that anyone says in a moment of spontaneous anger. (–&amp;quot;I really meant to put the money back.&amp;quot; –&amp;quot;You lie!&amp;quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I don't mean to suggest that Wilson's effusion was planned, but it's hard to believe it was unrehearsed: it has the sound of something he had imagined himself saying to the President in numerous idle reveries, maybe as he struck a heroic pose drawn from his recreational reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You lie!" Jim did not draw. He stared at Hurlburt, his eyes unwavering. Louis L'Amour, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CLORcDypik8C&amp;amp;q=%22you+lie%22+%22Zane+Gray%22+OR+%22louis+l%27amour%22&amp;amp;dq=%22you+lie%22+%22Zane+Gray%22+OR+%22louis+l%27amour%22&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;amp;as_miny_is=&amp;amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;amp;num=50&amp;amp;as_brr=0"&gt;Riding for the Brand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You lie! Ben Ide is no horse thief," flashed Ina, hotly. Zane Grey, &lt;em&gt;Forlorn River&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a postmodern age, most of us associate that use of the simple present less with earnest melodrama or romance than with pastiches and send-ups of the genres. Which is why, quite independent of the generic impertinence of Wilson's remark, it sounded such a (Rocket J.) squirrely note. Limbaugh is just one of any number of people who are ready to excuse or even sympathize with Wilson's issues with impulse control, but my guess is that a lot fewer of them would want to share that particular aspect of his inner life. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoff Nunberg</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252877306366"><id gr:original-id="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/?p=357">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/43a795cca2e748a1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Strontium Supplements</title><published>2009-09-13T19:20:25Z</published><updated>2009-09-13T19:20:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/strontium-supplements/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">[BPSDB]The pill-pushers over at naturalnews are now telling us how wonderful strontium supplements are.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe it to be a thoughtful, well-made film that will change many views of Darwin held by the public - for the good. The acting is strong, the visuals are wonderful, and it treats with loving care the Victorian details of the furnishings at Down house and other sites (such as Malvern), and the local church.

&lt;p&gt;The movie takes place after Darwin has returned from the Beagle voyage, and has settled down with his wife, Emma. It concentrates on their relationship, on the growth of their family, and of course, on the production of his most famous scientific work, On the Origin of Species. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes place at &lt;a href="http://www.howlatthemoon.com/locations/location-chicago"&gt;Howl at the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, a dueling piano bar, on Friday, September 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.  I’ve been to this place before, and it’s awesome.  If you haven’t been there, you’re in for a good time.  Hopefully, you can bring along some of your friends with you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the deal if you can make it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free cover if you get in before 7:00 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your first two drinks cost $1 each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Exclusive” drink specials till 10:00 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A complimentary (non-vegetarian-friendly) buffet before 7:00 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$5 validated parking for the entire evening (after 5PM) at the State and Kinzie garage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can invite a date (or three, if you swing that way). As long as he is not prettier than me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you have to be 21.  All you have to do is give them my name when you enter the door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be very helpful to get an accurate count of how many people are coming, so please &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=122676552695"&gt;invite yourself on the Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; (or if you don’t do Facebook, leave a comment here letting me know you’re coming and if you’re bringing a guest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope we can get a good crowd there &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crispian Jago is a skeptic with one of the better senses of humor I’ve run across. He delights in tweaking believers of nonsense, and he’s done it again &lt;a href="http://crispian-jago.blogspot.com/2009/09/if-homeopathy-works-ill-drink-my-own.html"&gt;with this short video&lt;/a&gt; taking the, uh, well, y’know, out of homeopathy. Because I try to keep at least a modicum of decorum here on the BA blog, I’ll just link to the video and not embed it; when you click the link you’ll see why. But man, that’s a great demo. And home brewed, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beatlemania has reared its head again this week, with the release of the remastered catalog and &lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Rock Band&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I visited Liverpool. Standing outside Strawberry Fields I had the strange experience of being interviewed by a Japanese TV host. Asked to name my favorite Beatles’ song, and I answered “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIV7jwLXt8"&gt;Penny Lane&lt;/a&gt;“. I love the charmingly nostalgic yet dirty lyrics (”fish and finger pie”) and the pretty piccolo trumpet pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your favorite Beatles’ song?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community. Look for it to appear daily at 3pm ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The email was cc'ed to me, but meant of PZ Myers, and it says:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hey PZ Myers, you little fool...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to let you know this has been posted on every forum of the internet. Some good came out of you after all. They will remember your ugly blaspheming head forever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good riddance....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you comment on this post, I recommend you do not include a link-back because Dave will mine it for your email address and from now on you will get an obnoxious emails like this too.  The emails will come in temporal clusters of several emails in a few days, then trail off.  I assume this has something to do with his meds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sends these threatening and obnoxious emails to PZ's family, employers, friends, and he sends emails like this to all of the "letters to the editors" and "comments" emial boxes of every major news outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he got something wrong.  It is not true that this video is posted all over the internet. It was not posted, for instance, on my site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now.  Now it's finally on my blog too, and I think that was the last one. So yo're done, finally.

The theme of the workshop was scientific method. The title of my talk is “Tooth Fairy Science and Other Pitfalls: Applying Rigorous Science to Messy Medicine.” Click &lt;a href="http://skepticstoolbox.org/hall/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the link. It covers a lot of things that are pertinent to the subjects we discuss on this blog, and I thought some of our readers might enjoy it. I put in a lot of information and some good cartoons. Note: this was a talk to the general public, not an academic presentation, and it does not include citations or references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the content of his post is not what you might think… it is his account of how he met his current wife, Susan, and how he – a hardened skeptic – and she – a believer – gradually grew to love each other to the point of getting married.  In the process, Robert showed how his patience &amp;amp; understanding and willingness to carefully &amp;amp; thoughtfully express his skepticism to one who did not share it eventually won her over.  I think there are lessons here from which many of us can learn…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="HPIM3880" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/hpim3880.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=226" alt="HPIM3880" width="300" height="226"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=152491"&gt;I Married a Woo!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2002, I was going through a divorce with my first wife, and decided to use some of the online find-a-date services in my search for a lady to spend some time with. I settled on match.com, and dated a few women I found there. the third woman I met there was Susan, who ***SPOILER*** I married in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came close to not even seeing her profile, because, in the match.com search engine, I had almost selected “religious preferences must match.” I had stated a religious preference of “none”, and Susan had selected “Christian”. I thought long and hard before telling the search engine that a match on religious preference was not a must. I was in the middle of a divorce from a Catholic-turned Wiccan, and my Agnosticism had been a thorn in her side for some time. But I figured that, if I could deal with a Catholic/Wiccan, I could deal with an ordinary “Christian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan and I started chatting online, the talking by phone, and, eventually, started dating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of our first dates, I was driving, and we were waiting at a red light when Susan said “Hey, there’s that guy I like so much!” I turned to face her, and saw she was pointing out the car window. I looked in the direction she was pointing, and saw a poster of … John Edward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few seconds later, Susan said “Why are you banging your head on the steering wheel?” We drove onward, starting a long conversation about cold reading, and my thoughts on “psychics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the first time I visited Susan’s home, I found a book by … Sylvia Browne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, many here would have cut and run at that point, if not earlier.  Had I done so, I would have missed out on so much…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often watched John Edward’s show, as well as that of James VanPraagh. I found myself answering lots of questions Susan would ask (”See, now how did he know that?”), and we discussed cold and hot reading in some detail.&lt;br&gt;
Susan started having her doubts about “psychics”, but it wasn’t until she caught a show titled “Secrets of the Psychics” that she finally came to the conclusion that a lot of it was fraudulent. I’d like to think that some of our conversations on the topic got her somewhat “on the fence”, and that tv show was the last straw that tipped her to the skeptical side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years later, it was Susan who insisted that I talk to my Mom about this “Kaz” character who had spoken at her (my Mom’s) church. A few years after that, Forumites were saying “You’ve stopped Kaz – who’s next?” When I talked to Susan about it, she said “If you think that these “psychics are really hurting people, stop complaining about it, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; about it!  Stop Sylvia Browne was the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after that, we married in a non-religious ceremony, on the happiest day of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan has been my proofreader, my second set of eyes, and my most enthusiastic supporter throughout the SSB project. combine this with the tons of hours I’ve spent away from her and working on articles, and you’ll start to understand how crucial she has been to the site’s growth and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to all of this the fact that she has stood by me through the whole stroke business, and quite likely saved my life at least once during it, as well as being instrumental in getting the SSB site back up after it was hijacked, and you should see that, if you have appreciated any of what I have done with my Stop sites, you owe a big “thank you” to my Better Half, a former “woo”, for being instrumental in their creation and continuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I owe her so much more than thanks, and am more happy than I can say that I didn’t “cut and run” because we differed on some important things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, my love, for being all this and so much more to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2008 I wrote an editorial in the New Zealand Medical Journal (NZMJ), at the request of its editor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title was  &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=241"&gt;Dr Who? deception  by chiropractors.&lt;/a&gt;  It was not very flattering and it resulted in a letter from lawyers representing the New Zealand Chiropractic Association.  Luckily the editor of the NZMJ, Frank Frizelle,  is a man of principle, and the legal action was averted. It also resulted in some &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?s=NZMJ"&gt;interesting discussions &lt;/a&gt;with disillusioned chiropractors that confirmed one’s worst fears.  Not to mention revealing the internecine warfare between one chiropractor and another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all occurred before the  British Chiropractic Association &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1630"&gt;sued Simon Singh for defamation&lt;/a&gt;.  The strength of the reaction to that foolhardy action now has chiropractors wondering if they can survive at all.  The baselessness of most of their claims has been exposed as never before.  No wonder they are running scared.  The whole basis of their business is imploding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say chiropractors were very cross indeed.  Then in February 2009 I had a polite email from a New Zealand chiropractor, David Owen, asking for help to find one of the references in the editorial.  I’d quoted Preston Long as saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Long (2004)&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; said “&lt;em&gt;the public should be informed that chiropractic manipulation is the number one reason for people suffering stroke under the age of 45.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’d given the reference as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Long PH. Stroke and spinal manipulation. &lt;em&gt;J Quality Health Care&lt;/em&gt;. 2004;3:8–10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d found the quotation, and the reference, in Ernst’s 2005 article, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/journals/fact/current/fact1002a02t01.htm"&gt;The value of Chiropractic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,  but at the time I couldn’t find the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Quality Healthcare&lt;/em&gt;.  I did find the same article &lt;a href="http://skepticreport.com/sr/?p=88"&gt;on the web&lt;/a&gt;. At least the article had the same title, the same author and the same quotation.  But after finding, and reading, the article, I neglected to change the reference from &lt;em&gt;J Quality Health Care&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="http://skepticreport.com/sr/?p=88"&gt;http://skepticreport.com/sr/?p=88&lt;/a&gt;.  I should have done so and for that I apologise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked Ernst about the  &lt;em&gt;Journal of Quality Healthcare&lt;/em&gt;, he couldn’t find his copy of the Journal either, but he and his secretary embarked on a hunt for it, and eventually it was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/jqhc_title.jpg" alt="JQHC title"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/jqhc_ref.jpg" alt="JQHC reference" width="500" height="28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It turns out that &lt;em&gt;Journal of Quality Healthcare&lt;/em&gt; shut down in 2004, without leaving a trace on the web, or even in the British Library.  It was replaced by a different journal, &lt;em&gt;Patient Safety and Quality Healthcare&lt;/em&gt; (PSQH)  A reprint was obtained from them.   It is indeed the same as the web version that I’d read, and it highlighted  the quotation in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reprint of the original article, which proved so hard to find, can be &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Long_2004_JQHC.pdf"&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/jqhc-quote.jpg" alt="JQHC quotation"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full quotation is this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sixty-two clinical neurologists from across Canada, all certified members of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, issued a warning to the Canadian public, which was reported by Brad Stewart, MD. The warning was entitled Canadian Neurologists Warn Against Neck Manipulation. The final conclusion was that endless non-scientific claims are being made as to the uses of neck manipulation(Stewart, 2003). They need to be stopped. The public should be informed that chiropractic manipulation is the number one reason for people suffering stroke under the age of 45.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often condemned the practice of citing papers without reading them (it is, of course, distressingly common), so I feel bad about this, though I had in fact read the paper in question in its web version. I’m writing about it because I feel one should be open about mistakes, even small ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also writing about it because one small section of the magic medicine community seems to think they have nailed me because of it.  David Owen, the New Zealand chiropractor, wrote to the editor of the NZMJ, thus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote [in question] is &lt;em&gt;the public should be informed that chiropractic manipulation is the number one reason for people suffering stroke under the age of 45.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Long PH. Stroke and Manipulation. J Quality Health Care. 2004:3:8-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote actually comes from the following blog article http://www.skepticreport.com/medicalquackery/strokespinal.htm [DC the URL is now &lt;a href="http://skepticreport.com/sr/?p=88"&gt;http://skepticreport.com/sr/?p=88&lt;/a&gt;]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have attached all my personal communications with Colquhoun. They demonstrate this is not a citation error. Prof Colquhoun believes the origin of the quote doesn’t matter because Long was quoting from a Canadian Neurologists’ report (this is also incorrect). As you can see he fails to provide any evidence at all to support the existance [sic] of the “J Quality Health Care.”&lt;br&gt;
  This would not be an issue at all if he had admitted it came from a blog site— but I guess the link would have eroded the credibility of the quote.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colquhoun ’s belief that my forwarding this complaint is me “resorting to threats” is the final nail in the coffin. If he had any leg to stand on where is the threat?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem pedantic but it surely reflects a serious ethical breach. Is it acceptable to make up a reference to try and slip any unsupported statement  into a “scientific” argument and thereby give it some degree of credibility? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, at the end of the article, conflicts of interest are listed as none. As Colquhoun is a Professor of Pharmacology and much of his research funding no doubt comes from the pharmaceutical industry how can he have no conflict of interest with therapies that do not advocate the use of drugs and compete directly against the billions spent on pain medications each year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If I may quote Colquhoun himself in his defence of his article (Journal of the New Zealand Medical Association, 05-September-2008, Vol 121 No 1281) I’ll admit, though, that perhaps ‘intellect’ is not what’s deficient in this case, but rather honesty.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Owen &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Financial interests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here is a threat: I’m exposed as a shill of Big Pharma.  &amp;quot;. . . much of his funding no doubt comes from the pharmaceutical industry&amp;quot;.  I can’t count how many times this accusation has been thrown at me by advocates of &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733"&gt;magic  medicine.&lt;/a&gt;  Oddly enough none of them has actually taken the trouble to find out where my research funding has come from.  None of them even knows enough about the business to realise the extreme improbability that the Pharmaceutical Industry would be interested in funding basic work on the stochastic properties of single molecules.  They fund only clinicians who can help to improve their profits,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter of funding is already on record, but I’ll repeat it now.   The media ‘nutritional therapist’, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Patrick+Holford%22"&gt;Patrick Holford&lt;/a&gt;, said, in the &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/334/7588/292#163089"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I notice that Professor David Colquhoun has so far not felt it relevant to mention his own competing interests and financial involvements with the pharmaceutical industry “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which my reply was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;” Oh dear, Patrick Holford really should check before saying things like “I notice that Professor David Colquhoun has so far not felt it relevant to mention his own competing interests and financial involvements with the pharmaceutical industry”. Unlike Holford, when I said “no competing interests”, I meant it. My research has never been funded by the drug industry, but always by the Medical Research Council or by the Wellcome Trust. Neither have I accepted hospitality or travel to conferences from them. That is because I would never want to run the risk of judgements being clouded by money. The only time I have ever taken money from industry is in the form of modest fees that I got for giving a series of lectures on the basic mathematical principles of drug-receptor  interaction, a few years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of my spare time, and a bit of my own money, in an attempt to bring some sense into the arguments. The alternative medicine gurus make their livings (in some cases large fortunes) out of their wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who has the vested interest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Does chiropractic actually &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; stroke?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the case of drugs &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1435"&gt;and diet&lt;/a&gt;, it is remarkably difficult to be sure about causality.  A patient suffers a vertebral artery dissection shortly after visiting a chiropractor, but did the neck manipulation &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; the stroke? Or did it precipitate the stroke in somebody predisposed to one? Or is the timing just coincidence and the stroke would have happened anyway? There has been a lot of discussion about this and a forthcoming analysis will tackle the problem of causality head-on, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My assessment at the moment, for what it’s worth, is that there are some&lt;a href="http://www.healthwatcher.net/chirowatch.com/"&gt; pretty good reasons&lt;/a&gt; to suspect that neck manipulation can be dangerous, but it seems that serious damage is rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In a sense, it really doesn’t matter much anyway, because it is now apparent that chiropractic is pretty well discredited without having to resort to arguments about rare  (though serious) effects. There is real doubt about whether it is even any good for back pain&lt;a href="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab000447.html"&gt; (see Cochrane review)&lt;/a&gt;, and good reason to think that the very common claims of chiropractors to be able to cure infant colic, asthma and so on &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775"&gt;are entirely, ahem, bogus&lt;/a&gt;.  (See also &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=538"&gt;Steven Novella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ebm-first.com/"&gt;ebm-first&lt;/a&gt;,  and innumerable other recent analyses.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiropractic is entirely discredited, whether or not it may occasionally kill people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Complaint sent to UCL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an enquiry about this problem also from my old friend &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=131"&gt;George Lewith&lt;/a&gt;.  I told him what had happened.  Soon after this, a complaint was sent to Tim Perry and Jason Clarke, UCL’s Director and Deputy Director of Academic Services. The letter came not from Lewith or Owen, but from Lionel Milgom.   Milgrom is well known in the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733"&gt;magic medicine&lt;/a&gt; community for writing papers about how homeopathy can be “explained” by quantum entanglement.   Unfortunately for him, his papers have been read by some real physicists and they are no more than rather pretentious metaphors.  See, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/ecam/chrastina.pdf"&gt;Danny Chrastina’s analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://shpalman.livejournal.com/3264.html"&gt;shpalman, here&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/07/new-fundamentalism-why-lionel-milgrom.html"&gt;Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://apgaylard.wordpress.com/2009/09/06/a-homeopathic-refutation-part-one/"&gt;AP Gaylard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/a_homeopathic_journal_club.php"&gt;Orac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Perry and Mr Clark,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to bring to your attention an editorial (below) that appeared in the most recent issue of the New Zealand Medical Journal. In it, one of your Emeritus Professors, David Colquhoun, is accused of a serious ethical breach, and I quote – “Is it acceptable to make up a reference to try and slip any unsupported statement into a “scientific” argument and thereby give it some degree of credibility?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Colquhoun is well-known for writing extensively and publicly excoriating many forms of complementary and alternative medicine, particularly with regard to the alleged unscientific nature and unethical behaviour of its practitioners. Professor Colquhoun is also a voluble champion for keeping the libel laws out of science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such activities are doubtlessly in accord with the venerable Benthamite liberal traditions of UCL, I am quite certain hypocrisy is not. And though Professor Colquhoun has owned up to his error, as the NZMJ’s editor implies, it leaves a question mark over his credibility. As custodians of the college’s academic quality therefore, you might care to consider the possible damage to UCL’s reputation of perceived professorial cant; emeritus or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours Sincerely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Lionel R Milgrom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as we have seen, the quotation was correct, the reference was correct, and I’d read the article from which it came   I made a mistake in citing the original paper rather than the web version of the same paper..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave it to the reader to judge whether this constitutes a &amp;quot;serious ethical breach&amp;quot;, whether I’d slipped in an &amp;quot;unsupported statement&amp;quot;, and whether it constitutes &amp;quot;hypocrisy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It so happens that no sooner was this posted than there appeared Part 2 of the devastating &lt;a href="http://apgaylard.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/a-homeopathic-refutation-%E2%80%93-part-two/"&gt;refutation of Lionel Milgrom’s&lt;/a&gt; attempt to defend homeopathy, written by AP Gaylard.

He's known for &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;NaturalNews.com&lt;/a&gt;, a repository of quackery, anti-vaccine craziness, and conspiracy theories that rivals Whale.to but in a much slicker fashion. Now, unfortunately, I learn that he's going multimedia. Worse, Mike Rangers, who is about as white bread and un-hip-hop a guy as I can imagine, thinks he can rap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/EiXmw5a9kiM%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song is called "&lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/Dont_Inject_Me_The_Swine_Flu_Vaccine_Song.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Don't Inject Me (The Swine Flu Vaccine Song)&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common lies about the swine flu are all there: The claim that flu vaccines don't work; the paranoid delusion that the "drug companies made this flu" and "the swine flu was made by man; it's all part of a pharmaceutical scam"; that it's all a plot by big pharma to make money and destroy your immunity. Seeing this rap video, I have to admit that the production values are fairly high, but there remains a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's Mike Adams rapping. I don't know if this shows that Adams is down with the youth of America or risibly silly, much like those clueless adults mocked in 1960s sitcoms as they try to "rap" with the kids, using terms like "groovy." I don't know if this will actually spread Adams' lies or result in little more than laughter at someone like Adams trying to go all gangsta on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_Space"&gt;Dr. Zachary Smith&lt;/a&gt; would say, "Oh, the pain, the pain." If you watch this, I echo Mr. T's prediction below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I made a short mushrooming excursion to Lake Lundsjön after lunch. Little more than half an hour in the woods garnered us only four species, but huge amounts of one: velvet bolete. We went home early simply because we didn't need more mushrooms. I'm stewing them with cream. Never had shingled hedgehog before.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Velvet bolete, &lt;em&gt;Sandsopp, Suillus variegatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Peter Nichols, "&lt;a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/spring09/body_of_evidence.pdf"&gt;Body of Evidence: Neurocriminologist Probes the Biology of Crime&lt;/a&gt;", recently published in &lt;a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/home/news/nwsltr_index.html"&gt;Penn Arts &amp;amp; Sciences magazine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In the mid-19th century, Italian physician Cesare Lombroso was doing an autopsy on Giuseppe Villella, a notorious brigand who’d spent years in the prisons of Pavia. Peering into the dead criminal’s skull case, Lombroso thought it resembled the crania of “inferior animals,” particularly rodents. “At the sight of that skull,” he wrote, “I seemed to see all of a sudden, lighted up as a vast plain under a flaming sky, the problem of the nature of the criminal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Often credited as the father of criminology, Lombroso hypothesized that violent behavior could be explained by cranial, skeletal or neurological deformities. Some people were just “born criminal,” he reasoned. Biological malformations—“stigmata” he called them — suggested that lawbreakers were throwbacks to an earlier, more brutish stage in human evolution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“He was fascinated by the idea that there was a biological brain difference between criminals and the rest of us,” notes neurocriminologist Adrian Raine. From that day on, Lombroso took careful measurements of faces, jaws, heights, weights and other physical traits to gather data in support of what he called his “revelation.” […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“Lombroso’s theories sound a bit ridiculous to us,” Raine comments, “but in a way he was right.” With the emergence of new and powerful imaging technologies, scientists can see detailed pictures of the brain and trace activity along its neural networks. “The brain was forgotten until neuroscience techniques evolved to a level where we could, for the first time, really look at brain structure and function,” he says. “And from then on, we found that there’s certainly a brain basis to crime—that the brains of violent criminals are physically and functionally different from the rest of us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're a long way from thinking-of-parking tickets.  But if it's really true that "the brains of violent criminals are physically and functionally different from the rest of us", it's logical to ask whether some sort of diagnosis and mandatory treatment is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, the American legal system doesn't in general permit us to directly criminalize a mere statistical disposition towards criminal behavior.   However, there seem to be several cases where something very much like this has happened in matters of public health (like &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22mandatory+treatment%22+tuberculosis&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;mandatory treatment of tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; or the involuntary commitment of lepers) and in sentencing for certain types of crime (like "Megan's Law" registration and tracking of sex offenders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know much about this, and would appreciate historical, legal and philosophical instruction from those who do.  But the topic of this blog is linguistics, not legal theory or moral philosophy, and so my point is a linguistic one.  I propose a voluntary ban on the use of generic plurals to express statistical differences, especially in talking to the general public about scientific results in areas with  public policy implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, when we're looking at some property P of two groups X and Y, and a study shows that the distribution of P in X is different from the distribution of P in Y to an extent that is unlikely to be entirely the result of chance, we should avoid explaining this to the general public by saying  "X's have more P than Y's", or "X's and Y's differ in P", or any other form of expression that uses generic plurals to describe a generic difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would lead us to avoid statements like "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004965.html"&gt;men are happier than women&lt;/a&gt;", or "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1713"&gt;boys don't respond to sounds as rapidly as do girls&lt;/a&gt;", or "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=478"&gt;Asians have a more collectivist mentality than Europeans do"&lt;/a&gt; — or &amp;quot;the brains of violent criminals are physically and functionally different from the rest of us&amp;quot;.  At least, we should avoid this way of talking about the results of scientific investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason? Most members of the general public &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004992.html"&gt;don't understand statistical-distribution talk&lt;/a&gt;, and instead tend to  interpret such statements as expressing general (and essential) properties of the groups involved. This is especially true when the statements express the conclusions of an apparently authoritative scientific study, rather than merely someone's personal opinion, which is easy to discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are obviously cases where group differences rise to the level where generic plurals are appropriate. Is one of those cases the distribution of anatomical and physiological differences in the brains of criminals? I invite you to read Adrian Raine, "&lt;a href="http://cooley.libarts.wsu.edu/soc3611/soc%20361%20summer%202008/BiologicalBasisCrime.pdf"&gt;The biological basis of crime&lt;/a&gt;" (in Wilson and Petersilia (Eds), &lt;em&gt;Crime: Public Policies for Crime Control&lt;/em&gt;, 2002) and decide for yourself. I'll give you my opinion in another post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252850993198"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4762827614191702843.post-6509831327408739248">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d4b09e90260c0b3d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="tim minchin" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Simon Singh" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="British Chiropractic Association" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Ben Goldacre" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Crap Libel Cases" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="richard dawkins" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="The Discredited BCA" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">That Bogus Quote</title><published>2009-09-13T13:49:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-13T13:49:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/09/that-bogus-quote.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="html">Simon Singh's now immortal quotation about the British Chiropractic Association has been repeated on a number of places on the internet; however, my favourite so far is &lt;a href="http://crispian-jago.blogspot.com/2009/09/skeptic-park.html"&gt; here by Crispian Jago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other chaps featured are, of course, Tim Minchin, Richard Dawkins, and Ben Goldacre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brilliant stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Postscript: also posted today is astonishing footage of Crispian's (brave) experiment on homeopathy, &lt;a href="http://crispian-jago.blogspot.com/2009/09/if-homeopathy-works-ill-drink-my-own.html"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-6509831327408739248?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252850246793"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/is-it-just-me-or-is-kimi-start/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8714eaa8b610c56c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">is it just me or is kimi start…</title><published>2009-09-13T13:29:15Z</published><updated>2009-09-13T13:29:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/is-it-just-me-or-is-kimi-start/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;is it just me or is kimi starting to look like James May?

&lt;p&gt;We recently received the following letter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi SGU team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following may interest you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in a pharmaceutical laboratory and we pride ourselves on using logic, careful experimental design and hypothesis testing to solve testing issues.  We recently came across a problem that was eventually only solved by identifying that we had inadvertently made a “Selection Bias” logical fallacy and we (I) only worked this out because I listen to your show and absorbed at least some of the brain training you guys so kindly give out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently the commonly accepted wisdom in our lab was that we were experiencing a long-standing and ongoing instrument issue which somehow caused the first standard of an analysis to generally read lower results than subsequent standards.  This was reported by most analysts and was accepted as a real issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a good deal of time trying to problem solve the issue by investigating the instruments, the sample matrix, the vials, the analyst technique, environmental conditions, etc (the list goes on) but to no avail - the problem seemed to continue despite our best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally my brain kicked in and I suggested to my colleagues that we may be experiencing “Selection Bias” - what if there is nothing wrong with the first standard and there is in fact no issue?  Dismissed out of hand I went ahead anyway and statistically sampled a good random selection of result sets and normalized them.  Low and behold the first standard, on average, agrees with the nominal mean - ie &lt;em&gt;there was no statistically significant issue to begin with!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short we were accepting anecdotal evidence as a true and real phenomenon and went straight to looking for the cause instead of first verifying that an actual, statistically significant, issue existed in the first place.  Doh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every subsequent statistical analysis reconfirms the first one I did yet there are still die-hard’s who are sure that we are seeing a real phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I am reasonably intelligent but this experience shows how easy it is for anyone to fall victim to fallacious thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the heads-up - thought you would like to know you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; making a difference - in my world at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry Thomas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melbourne&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share this as an excellent example of how knowledge is fungible - in other words, you never can tell how knowledge in one area will apply to another. Often we are asked what the utility is in examining and “debunking” silly claims like Bigfoot, UFOs, and crop circles. This is why - because you can learn a great deal from a careful examination of any claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the letter, Barry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think everyone knows the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle"&gt;Volkswagen Beetle&lt;/a&gt;–the iconic &lt;a href="http://tolweb.org/Coleoptera"&gt;Coleopteran&lt;/a&gt; car. But how many of you have heard of the 1935 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stout_Scarab"&gt;Stout Scarab&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The &lt;strong&gt;Stout Scarab&lt;/strong&gt; was a 1930s U.S automobile produced in small numbers by Stout Engineering Laboratories of Detroit, Michigan. Among a host of novelties and innovations, the Stout Scarab is credited by many as the world’s first production minivan.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a chance to see one of these lately, and it is both astonishing and ADORABLE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 9 of these were ever built–the idea was that it would function as a hotel on wheels. The back seat is about 6 feet wide, and folds down into a bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this cute mega-beetle in action here:&lt;/p&gt;

Any time this phrase is used, it should be possible to be more precise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This precision should both in terms of (1) what law (libel, copyright, contempt of court, and so on) and (2) what legal instrument (statute, contractual obligation, court order, and so on).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any person who mentions &lt;em&gt;legal reasons&lt;/em&gt; who cannot also state what law and what legal instrument is either ill-informed or misleading you and others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the law does have this mystique. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mystique is well portrayed in literature. In Kafka's &lt;em&gt;The Trial&lt;/em&gt;, poor Josef K never finds out what is going on; and in &lt;em&gt;Bleak House&lt;/em&gt;, Charles Dickens depicts &lt;em&gt;Jarndyce v Jarndyce&lt;/em&gt; as an essentially incomprehensible case. In both cases (literally), the application of law has drastic personal consequences, but it cannot be understood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When many hear the phrase &lt;em&gt;for legal reasons&lt;/em&gt; they just nod and defer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was prompted into thinking about this by Derren Brown's seeming prediction of the National Lottery results last week. See it &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnwIYsM5cmk&amp;amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpoeljames%2Egooglepages%2Ecom%2FHowDerrenDidIt%2Ehtml&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/SqzW6xvhuZI/AAAAAAAAAMk/h5V8qE2EBDA/s1600-h/Derren1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:385px;height:185px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/SqzW6xvhuZI/AAAAAAAAAMk/h5V8qE2EBDA/s400/Derren1.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insofar as this daft exercise really needs a rational explanation - and as the forecast was not independently verified before the prize draw, almost any explanation is more sensible than the one eventually offered by Brown - see the fine analysis by Poel James &lt;a href="http://poeljames.googlepages.com/HowDerrenDidIt.html"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, what interested me is how Brown used law and &lt;em&gt;legal reasons&lt;/em&gt; as part of the various misdirections to throw the audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I set some of these out below in order with a comment on each one; my timings are against the YouTube video &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnwIYsM5cmk&amp;amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpoeljames%2Egooglepages%2Ecom%2FHowDerrenDidIt%2Ehtml&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(In doing this, I am not saying I am an expert in current national lottery law, but I am aware of the general statutory/licence/contract regime in which the broadcasts take place.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0:38 &lt;em&gt;"I've done nothing illegal..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This sows the legality seed. We are all sure it is correct, and so we begin to accept what he says about law to be correct. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0:46 &lt;em&gt;"...and for security reasons..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which are of course unspecified; there is no reason why security reasons dictate that only him and two cameramen are present. (Indeed, there is the question of who put the balls there in the first place...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this is so far plausible and our trust is still in place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0:59 &lt;em&gt;"We can't show more than a couple of minutes of the BBC, for legal reasons..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is legally plausible; not least that broadcasting BBC on Channel 4 would probably be a copyright infringement unless there was a licence. It could also be a tortious interference of the contractual relationship between the BBC and Camelot allowing BBC exclusive rights to broadcast the result (in other words, a third party can be sued if he/she stops two others performing a contract between them).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:15 &lt;em&gt;"We've spoken to Camelot, we've had a meeting with Camelot..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is all plausible detail; and note the use of the inclusive &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:23 &lt;em&gt;"..the BBC have a legal right to announce the lottery numbers first, before anybody else does..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is undoubtedly correct, in that the contract between BBC and Camelot would have such an exclusivity provision. However, this contract would not bind Brown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:27 &lt;em&gt;"...so, um, because of that I can't show you the numbers until just after the lottery has been announced, if that makes sense."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is, in my view, completely wrong. But this is the statement which all the plausible mentions of law have led up to. And so the viewer is ready to accept it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is actually no legal restriction on him whatsoever broadcasting a forecast (just as there is no legal restriction on anyone playing the lottery making a forecast).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brown is simply not announcing the numbers, unless of course he knew the numbers in advance (ie, that the lottery was rigged).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;There was no simply legal reason for Brown not to provide his lottery forecast before the draw.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note here how Brown's hesitancy &lt;em&gt;("...um...if that makes sense&lt;/em&gt;") cloaks this legally incorrect statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;3:22 &lt;em&gt;"Again, I've done nothing illegal..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, this is surely correct and so provides our final reassurance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without the "legal" explanation for the lack of prior forecast, Brown's exercise would have been even less convincing; indeed it would have missed its essential premise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has of course resorted to &lt;em&gt;legal reasons&lt;/em&gt; before in his misdirections; in the famous Russian Roulette routine he made out that British gun laws meant he had to go to Jersey (where it was, er, also &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/jersey/have_your_say/derren_brown.shtml"&gt; unlawful&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/SqzV5w69KzI/AAAAAAAAAMc/0MZTNAZVpQk/s1600-h/Derren2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:203px;height:152px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/SqzV5w69KzI/AAAAAAAAAMc/0MZTNAZVpQk/s400/Derren2.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Derren Brown is a master of misdirection; but he is also a graduate of law - he read Law and German at Bristol University. More than anyone - perhaps other than the great jury advocates at the criminal and libel bar - he knows how law and misdirection can be effectively mixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would say that Derren Brown is thereby a great loss to the legal profession; but I cannot (for legal reasons).&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-6186806743277769828?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252842615441"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16003">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e409d916e5425ba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><title type="html">Update on Tulsa Mayorial Candidate Anna Falling</title><published>2009-09-13T11:00:32Z</published><updated>2009-09-13T11:00:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/13/update-on-tulsa-mayorial-candidate-anna-falling/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/13/tulsa-mayorial-candidate-anna-falling-runs-on-platform-of-church-state-merging/"&gt;Anna Falling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was the woman running for mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma on a platform of getting the Tulsa Zoo to &lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=262&amp;amp;articleid=20090812_11_A11_Republ227159"&gt;include an exhibit on Creationism&lt;/a&gt;.  And she wanted to do away with any sort of church/state separation… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had her Republican primary the other day… and &lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=262&amp;amp;articleid=20090909_11_A1_Rpbiaa983428"&gt;earned a whopping 10% of the vote&lt;/a&gt;.  The two candidates who beat her got 54% and 32% of the votes, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in other words, even Oklahoma Republicans didn’t want a Christian fundamentalist in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s hope for Oklahoma yet!&lt;br&gt;

My answer is that I don't have the expertise to do so. I can only do what I know best and I know best about Christianity. For a debunking of Islam I recommend the books of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_0_8?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;amp;field-keywords=ibn+warraq&amp;amp;sprefix=ibn+warr"&gt;Ibn Warraq&lt;/a&gt;, who I heard give a talk yesterday. While I lack the expertise to properly evaluate his case, it seems that it doesn't get any better than this. See also the story told by Ayaan Hirsi Ali in her amazing book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Infidel-Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali/dp/0743289692/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1252837233&amp;amp;sr=1-2"&gt;Infidel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5184005533659637364?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

That landmark cartoon series from Hanna-Barbera, &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/09/12/scooby_doo_turns_40_and_cartoon_network_celebrates_with_a_telefilm/"&gt;which celebrates its 40th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, featured myth-busting every week as the gang at Mystery Inc. would uncover clues that would consistently debunk the supernatural time after time. And you always knew those meddling kids, Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and their Great Dane Scooby-Doo were about to expose a charlatan or charlatans upon hearing Velma utter those two unforgettable syllables:  “Jinkies!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series, which took the name of its title character from the “doo-be-doo-be-doo’’ riff in Frank Sinatra’s “Strangers in the Night,’’ was more than just a silly kids’ show and even the late Carl Sagan recognized that the Scooby Gang represented positive role models for critical thinking and scientific inquiry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sagan, who became a TV icon in his own right, saw the Scooby-Doo gang as role models for a credulous and scientifically illiterate country he spent a career trying to educate. In his book “The Demon-Haunted World,’’ he bemoaned the popularity of “The X-Files,’’ with its paranormal beings and aliens. “Much closer to reality, as well as a much greater public service, would be an adult series (‘Scooby-Doo’ does it for children) in which paranormal claims are systematically investigated and every case is found to be explicable in prosaic terms,’’ Sagan wrote. Scooby-Doo, public servant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, later incarnations of the series didn’t always live up to the standards of the original. There was of course the unfortunate dark period in the show’s history,  known to viewers far and wide as “The Scrappy-Doo Years.” But also in the later years, there occasionally would be supernatural elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I did always have a bit of a soft spot for the short-lived 80’s  reinvention of the franchise called, &lt;em&gt;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo,&lt;/em&gt; which featured even younger versions of the Scooby Gang, now as small children at about the age of 10 . In addition to preserving the rule of no supernatural elements, I always loved how in this version, little Fred would always immediately accuse his arch nemesis, the appropriately named bully name Red Herring, a seemingly less than subtle nod to the show’s skeptical roots. Of course, Red Herring almost never ended up being the true culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, as the show became beloved by popular culture, many jokes, parodies, and myths have emerged about the series. And some of the &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063950/trivia"&gt;facts and myths of the show have been addressed on the Internet Movie Database&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-doo"&gt;Wikipedia also has an extensive entry on the franchise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the two attempts so far to bring the gang at Mystery Inc. to the big screen in live action have been mostly panned by critics and audiences alike but I still hold out hope that new attempts will me made, preferably with a completely realistic-looking CG Scooby-Doo and, of course, a return to the franchise’s skeptical roots. I could almost picture a few brief appearances by James Randi as himself showing up to aid the Scooby gang like so many animated versions of celebrities like Sonny and Cher and the Harlem Globetrotters did in the old days of the original series. But though the future of this beloved franchise is not certain, in these times when conspiracy theorists, pseudo-scientists, self-proclaimed psychic mediums and ghosthunters, and all other perveyors of woo are growing increasingly more prominent, we could use more of those meddling kids and their Scooby-snack-loving dog.&lt;/p&gt;

It has been argued that Christianity borrowed heavily from Hinduism.  Lord Krishna was the physical manifestation of one of the Gods of the Hindu Trinity who is named Vishnu. Vishnu came to earth as a Human 5000 years ago to battle evil and show people the right way to live. This is an introduction to Lord Krishna, the human manifestation of the God Vishnu.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Folklore Typologies: Similarities between Krishna and Biblical Characters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are striking similarities between the stories in the Christian Bible and the Stories that make up the Scriptures of Hinduism. Here is a link to ReligiousTolerance.org where they discuss &lt;a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_jckr1.htm"&gt;Similarities between Jesus and Krishna&lt;/a&gt;.  I will explore this topic in a follow on article done in parallel with this one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hare, Hare, Hare! Step right up and hear about Lord Krishna!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was exposed to the Hindu Scriptures as a Christian pre-teen living in Europe.  At that time, I supposed that since Hinduism was so much older, and Israel was so far away from India, that Christianity must be a result of a misunderstanding of Hindu Scriptures and Ideas carried over from India by visitors. I was almost converted.  I realized that the Jews didn't think Jesus was the messiah because he didn't qualify and it was uncharacteristic for Yahweh to diminish himself to become a human.  No-where in Christian scripture does Jesus unambiguously declare that he is Yahweh in human form, however, it is a characteristic of Vishnu to appear in human form periodically.  In my young mind I thought, Jesus was a strikingly different "person" than the Yahweh of the old Testament, Jesus was similar to Krishna and the teachings of Jesus were similar to Hinduism.  Therefore, Christianity should be an extension of Hinduism rather than Judaism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, since everyone I knew, especially every adult I knew, was a Christian, I was persuaded that Hinduism was mythology, Christianity was "A Religion", Jesus was the one and only God in Human Form.  As a Christian adult, I revisited the Hindu Scriptures to see what was so compelling about them, but I didn't feel the same pull towards Hinduism as I did as a child.  Maybe our Psychologist Contributors Valerie or Marlene can elaborate on that phenomena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Bhagavata Canto 10, The Story of Lord Krishna, and The Birth of Lord Krishna&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Primary reference I used was &lt;a href="http://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto10/chapter1.html"&gt;Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 10, (Bhagavata Purana)&lt;/a&gt; but since then they have begun improvements to the site and the links are no longer available.  They do provide an alternate site which you can reach from site above or from the links I provided below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://theorderoftime.org/personal/BhagavataWiki/"&gt;The Bhagavata Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://theorderoftime.org/personal/BhagavataWiki/index.php/Eng/Canto10-1"&gt;The Bhagavata Wiki, Canto 10-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be patient, it takes a while to load.  Also there is a link on that page to a &lt;a href="http://theorderoftime.org/personal/vedic.html"&gt;site that claims that Jesus Christ was an Incarnation of Vishnu.&lt;/a&gt;  Good luck disproving that, evangelical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The links above are a little hard to follow since it is a translation, so the references below are a little more "Layman Friendly".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simplified Story of the Life of Lord Krishna from YouTube&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Short Video&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.radhekrishn.com/lordkrishna.php"&gt;Radhekrishn.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid%3D-5059328100016245118%26hl%3Den%26fs%3Dtrue&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=150" width="300" height="150"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Longer Video of the birth of Lord Krishna&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/kQBH1UoyyLI%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article on the historicity of Lord Krishna&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is an article on the Historical Krishna where the following summary is derived in part. &lt;a href="http://veda.harekrsna.cz/encyclopedia/historical-krsna.htm"&gt;"Search for the Historical Krishna", Prof. N.S. Rajaram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary taken from the article&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"In summary, we may safely conclude that technical and literary evidence from several independent sources point to the traditional Kali date of 3102 BC as being close to the actual date of the Mahabharata War. We have therefore overwhelming evidence showing that Krishna was a historical figure who must have lived within a century on either side of that date, i.e., in the 3200-3000 BC period."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of the story of Lord Krishna&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Krishna is regarded by Hindus and the incarnation of the God Vishnu.  They believe that Vishnu is one of the Gods that make up the Hindu Trinity and is believed to be the lord of the universe who takes human form and is the lord of all creation, all things, all time.  Through him people will know what is real, meaning comes only from god. Whenever there is too much evil in the world he takes human form to  deal with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you watched the video above, and you know your bible, you probably noted quite a few similarties to the stories in the Christian Bible.  Here is an abbreviated list of some of the ones I noticed.  The simplest explanation of how the stories can be so similar is if they are Folklore, in other words, the same story structure with the details changed to suit the audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;- Evil king will be overthrown by a savior (The Messiah)&lt;br&gt;- The Birth of God on Earth prophesied (Various Biblical Prophesies)&lt;br&gt;- Virgin birth [depending on the Hindu "denomination"] (Mary)&lt;br&gt;- Devaki was the mother of Krishna and therefore all divinity (Mary)&lt;br&gt;- The Kings killing of the sons to attempt to kill the God-Child (Herods action)&lt;br&gt;- Escape of the central characters with the help of God (Acts 5 and 12)&lt;br&gt;- Receding of the waters during an escape (Red Sea)&lt;br&gt;- Talking Snake (Adam and Eve)&lt;br&gt;- Baby was raised by foster mother (Moses)&lt;br&gt;- Baby raised by peasants (Moses and Jesus)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other Similarities outside the scope of the Video that are part of the Krishna Story&lt;br&gt;- Mischevious boy (Similar to Jesus going to temple as a boy and non-canonical stories of Jesus as a child)&lt;br&gt;- River associated with Holiness and cleanliness (Baptism in the river)&lt;br&gt;- Krishna wrestled a snake by the river and won (by the river Jacob wrestled an angel, God or his brother depending on how its interpreted)&lt;br&gt;- Sacrifice out of love (similar to teaching of Christ)&lt;br&gt;- Picking up a mountain (to hold over his followers as shelter to protect them from heavy rains caused by another angry God, Faith can move mountains)&lt;br&gt;- Killing a Giant Serpent (Yahweh slaying the Leviathan)&lt;br&gt;- Krishna would return when things got bad (Second Coming)&lt;br&gt;- Krishna was Pierced, killed, and taken up to Heaven (Jesus Stabbed by soldier, body disappearing, later taken up to heaven)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Any form of an argument a Christian can use to defend Christianity can be used interchangeably to defend Hinduism and Lord Krishna.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it is more likely that since the stories about Krishna predate Judeo-Christian scripture, then it seems that the similarities in the stories about Moses, Jesus and in Acts are pre-existing folklore structures with the details changed to suit the audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Below is an incomplete list of events in Lord Krishnas life with my notes as to the Chapter and verse in the Bhagavata Canto 10.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I only noted enough to make my case and leave the rest as an exercise for those interested in comparative religion studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 1, verses are listed above the line&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1:29&lt;br&gt;- Princess Devaki got married to Vasudeva&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1:30&lt;br&gt;- Her Evil Brother Prince Kamsa drove the coach on thier wedding day&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1:34&lt;br&gt;- While driving the coach, a spiritual voice told Prince Kamsa that "Devaki will have eight sons and the eighth son will kill him"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1:65-66&lt;br&gt;- He put his sister Devaki and her husband Vasudeva in prison&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- They had sons in jail and each one was killed by Kamsa to prevent Lord Krishna from being born.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1:69&lt;br&gt;- Prince Kamsa overthrew his father put him in prison and took the throne,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 2:8-9&lt;br&gt;- Vishnu says he will put himself in the womb of Devaki to be born.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 3:31&lt;br&gt;- One evening during thunder and lightning, the eighth child was born and they saw that it was the lord Vishnu as vishnu said he would do in Chapter 2:8-9&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3:48&lt;br&gt;- Since the child was in danger of being killed, Vishnu put the guards to sleep and freed the father&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3:49&lt;br&gt;- The father took the baby out into the stormy night and the great serpent accompanied them spreading its hood over them to protect the child&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3:50&lt;br&gt;- As the father approached the river Jumna, it parted to let the father cross,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3:51&lt;br&gt;- The father went to a house where a woman had just given birth, and the father switched the babies, and Vishnu was raised by the family never knowing the difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[MISCHEVIOUS BOY: Similar to Jesus leaving his parents to go the temple]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The boy was mischievous, he stole sweet milk and distributed it to the other people and animals in the town&lt;br&gt;[MISCHEVIOUS BOY]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[HEROD: Event similar to and event related to Herod]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- But Kamsa summoned and demons and spirits to search for the child&lt;br&gt;[HEROD]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[LEVIATHAN, HOLY RIVER:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Similar to an event related to a story about Yahweh slaying Leviathan in Job, similar to the event where Jacob wrestled an Angel, God or his brother (depending on the interpretation) and similar to Jesus going into the river to be Baptized, similar to the tradition to the belief that baptism is a sort of rebirth, cleansing, new beginning or relinquishing the bad and accepting the good]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;- One day, wrestling and playing by the river, they saw that the river was poisoned, so Krishna jumped in to kill the Giant Serpent that was poisoning the river.&lt;br&gt;- He danced on the serpents head and set if free, cleaning up the river making the river Holy once again.&lt;br&gt;- Kamsa saw the giant serpent and its children in the river and knew that it had been defeated by Krishna,&lt;br&gt;[LEVIATHAN, HOLY RIVER]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[HOLY RIVER]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Krishna made the land around the Holy River beautiful.  Krishna went down by the river and danced with all the women that were there.&lt;br&gt;[HOLY RIVER]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[SACRIFICE OUT OF LOVE]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- One day Krishnas surrogate father was preparing a sacrifice to Indra the rain god in order to bring rain. The people were afraid that Indra was angry at them.  Krishna said that people should sacrifice out of love not fear, so the sacrifice was not appropriate and would be better spent if it were directed to worship the things they love and to sacrifice to the cows and mountains&lt;br&gt;[SACRIFICE OUT OF LOVE]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[MOVING THE MOUNTAIN]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- So they did and Indra got angry and sent a terrible storm, so Krishna lifted the mountain and used it as an umbrella for the town.&lt;br&gt;[MOVING THE MOUNTAIN]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- After the storm Krishna got the invitation and he went with his friend Bellarama.&lt;br&gt;- Krishna and Bellarama killed the combatants and ordered the guards to kill them, so Krishna killed the evil king and returned the real king to power. &lt;br&gt;- Krishna battled many evils during his lifetime&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[VISHNU WOULD RETURN WHEN THINGS GOT BAD]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Krishna vowed to return to fight evil whenever it occurs.&lt;br&gt;[HE WOULD RETURN WHEN THINGS GOT BAD]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;[PIERCED, KILLED AND TAKEN UP TO HEAVEN]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- There were many other events in the life of Krishna but the last thing Krishna did was to meditate under a tree in the forest, before being shot by mistakenly by a hunter and taken up to heaven.&lt;br&gt;[PIERCED, KILLED AND TAKEN UP TO HEAVEN]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other references, related links&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=lord+krishna+story&amp;amp;www_google_domain=www.google.com&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;emb=0&amp;amp;aq=2&amp;amp;oq=lord+krishna#"&gt;Google Videos Search for the story of Lord Krishna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://video.google.it/videosearch?hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rlz=1R1MOZA_en___IT336&amp;amp;hs=OtB&amp;amp;q=lord%20krishna&amp;amp;revid=1396741006&amp;amp;ei=1zKASuhskLaaA8bBtekB&amp;amp;resnum=0&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wv#"&gt;List of Videos about Krishna on Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Information about the Hindu Trinity, &lt;a href="http://www.hindunet.org/god/trinity/index.htm"&gt;Hindu Trinity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KkDMBhrAD4"&gt;Video about Dwarka, City of Krishna.&lt;/a&gt; Hindu pilgrims go there to worship.

A key realisation of this work for me has been that earthquake-triggered slides cause  a very substantial proportional (probably in fact the majority) of fatalities is mass movement events.  Unfortunately our understanding of seismically-driven landslides, and their impacts, remains poor, certainly in comparison with rainfall induced slides.  For that reason, work to re-examine past seismically-driven events is very welcome, helping us to get a much better understanding of the range of processes and impacts in these events.One significant but until now slightly elusive such event has been the 1949 Khait earthquake.  This was a Mw=7.4 event on 10th July 1949 in the Tien Shan mountains of what is now Tajikistan, but was then the Soviet Union.  The timing and location of this event, soon after the war in an area about which the Soviet Union was very secretive, has meant that it has been very difficult to determine any details about the landslides that were triggered in the earthquake.  However, some rather speculative reports have suggested that the impacts were very large - for example this article in Mountain Research and Development reported a huge landslide at a site that it termed Borgulchak Rock.  This slide was reported to have travelled 12 km.  Some reports, such as the Wikipedia article on this landslide, have suggested a death toll as high as 28,000 people, although to be fair this may well be something of a misinterpretation of the original source.An article in press in the journal Engineering Geology, by Steve Evans and colleagues (Evans et al. 2009 in press) seeks to re-examine the landslides triggered by this earthquake.  Unusually for a science paper the article is a ripping-good read.  The paper re-evaluates the Khait landslide, and the other large slide that was triggered in the earthquake, providing a rational analysis of the likely impacts of the mass movements.First, they look at the Khait landslide (termed in the paper as a rockslide / loess flow), which is still clearly visible in the landscape, even on the low resolution Google Earth imagery available for this area:For the Khait landslide they conclude that the volume was probably rather lower than earlier estimates have suggested.  The other landslide considered is a very large and complex flowslide that swept down the Yasman Valley, covering about 20 km.  This slide had multiple source areas on the southern side of the valley:They conclude that this is a rather destructive loess flow slide with a volume of about 245 million cubic metres.  Remarkably it travelled over a slope with an angle of just two degrees!Evans et al. (2009) then consider the fatalities caused by the landslides.  By looking at contempory reports of the population of the Khait area and census data on settlement size and population density they reject earlier estimates of the loss of life.  For the Khait landslide itself they conclude that about 800 fatalities is probably a reasonable estimate - note that this very considerably less than earlier estimates.  For the Yasman Valley flowslide they estimate about 4,000 fatalities, and they determine that there were probably a further 2,400 deaths.  This gives a total fatality count of about 7,200 - far lower than previous counts, but still substantial of course.In conclusion, this is a very important contribution, filling in another gap in our understanding of previous landslide impacts.  Steve and his colleagues have also just published a similar paper (Evans et al. 2009) re-examining the 1960 Huascaran rock avalanche in Peru.  This will be the topic of an upcoming post.ReferenceEvans, S., Roberts, N., Ischuk, A., Delaney, K., Morozova, G., &amp;amp; Tutubalina, O. (2009 in press).

That&amp;#39;s actually very sad when there is a sizable body of chronically afflicted, growth hormone deficient adults. Hypopitiutarism and panhypopituitarism due to pituitary adenomas, surgery as treatment, and/or infarction leaves most Cushing&amp;#39;s Disease survivors with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).According to recent research, quoted here at Stanford and reiterated by Dr. Theodore Friedman, &amp;quot;GH appears to be one of the first hormones to be lost in patients with pituitary tumors and nearly all patients with two or more other pituitary deficiencies also lack GH.&amp;quot; In a recent issue of Pituitary, a study titled &amp;quot;Effects of 5 years of growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy of cardiac parameters and physical performance in adults with GH deficiency&amp;quot; caught my eye. Although not really news to me, it was nice to see some more validation. The research is outlined exceptionally well, with concise but thorough discussion and analysis.The bottom line: There may be a slight increase in blood pressure and left ventricular mass with treatment, but this is greatly offset by &amp;quot;positive effects on exercise capacity and maximum oxygen uptake&amp;quot;. Another study states:...there is no doubt that adult patients with hypopituitarism and GH deficiency have an increased CV risk (odds ratio of 2 for men and 3.5 to 4 for women). &amp;quot; Improvement of systolic and diastolic pressures, lipid profiles, and plaque formation are also documented. A significant decrease in IMT and CRP were favorable outcomes of GH replacement therapy.GHD has also been linked to apathy, fatigue, lack of motivation and more. Thus, it becomes not only an issue of mortality, but also an issue of quality of life. I hope the medical community will educate themselves about GHD. The authors of the Pituitarystudy elaborated well: GHD is associated with hypercoagulability, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, unfavorable lipid profile, atherosclerosis, increased blood pressure (BP), decreased exercise performance and with reduced pulmonary capacity, left ventricular (LV) mass and LV systolic performance...

I prefer to call them flagella, out of habit, but there&amp;#39;s some who argue &amp;#39;flagellum&amp;#39; should be reserved for bacteria, who have a fundamentally different system from us; while we have &amp;#39;cilia&amp;#39;. Another note: &amp;#39;flagella&amp;#39; is spelled with two l&amp;#39;s, &amp;#39;cilia&amp;#39; with one. Took me about two months of protistology to learn that. (also, I consistently spelled &amp;#39;axopodia&amp;#39; as &amp;#39;auxopodia&amp;#39;, thanks to a plant biology research background. Curse you, auxin!)Interestingly the flagellar structures seem to be fairly conserved in evolution, and are often used in taxonomy. Most eukaryotes are fundamentally biflagellate, meaning their flagellar systems, whatever they are, are likely derived from modifications of an ancestral biflagellate form, and retaining the double basal bodies. Flagella can be lost, but the basal bodies that anchor them tend to remain behind. Conversely, basal bodies can be duplicated, as they have, for example, in parabasalia, which are tetraflagellate; entire basal body units (kinetids) can also be multiplied, up to extremes such as in ciliates. (the developmental organisation of ciliate flagella is an endlessly fascinating subject, and if all goes well, would be my research focus after BSc. =D *knocks on her head wood)In contrast, a few eukaryotes have what is fundamentally a single flagellum - those are unikonts, which include amoebozoa (eg. cellular slime moulds) and opisthokonts (ass-tails, eg. fungi, choanoflagellates...and us). It is intuitive to think of flagella as propelling the organism forward. But not everything is about sperm: most eukaryotic organisms actually pull themselves by flagellar motion, thereby defining the location of the flagellum as the anterior end, rather than posterior. Another distinction is between isokonts (equal flagella) and heterokonts (unequal flagella) - in the former, the two flagella are structurally identical, whereas in the latter they differ, often with little protrusions (mastigonemes) lining one of them.Actually, scratch everything I just said about opisthokonts and amoebozoa being unikonts together. Missed a memo... there&amp;#39;s this amitochondriate amoeba Breviata (TCoO post here and picture here), previously of uncertain placement or classified as an archamoeba. Despite having a single flagellum, it seems to have a double basal body, one of them unflagellated (Walker et al. 2006 JEM). Turns out that evidence suggests it&amp;#39;s a basal amoebozoan, which would kill TC-S&amp;#39; unikont/bikont division (indicated in grey below):(Roger &amp;amp; Simpson 2009 Curr Biol; numbers indicate ancestral number of basal bodies/flagellar unit, asterisk indicates one basal body is unflagellated, and the 2+ in Breviata indicates there may have been more that two basal bodies/unit.)So to summarise:kinetid - unit of basal bodies + flagella; not all basal bodies must have a flagellum (but the flagella must be anchored to a basal body each)opisthokont - organisms with posterior flagellation; most eukaryotes have flagella at the front of their movement.heterokont - both (or more) flagella structurally differentisokont - both (or more) flagella are the sameunikont - organisms with single basal body/flagellum per kinetidbikont - organisms with double (or more) basal body per kinetidmastigonemes - little protrusions regularly lining a flagellum; for increasing a flagellum&amp;#39;s surface area.centriole/basal body - generally interchangeablecilium/flagellum - generally interchangeable(kont means tail, by the way)I noticed I throw those terms a lot in other posts without really explaining them; so hopefully this post can be some sort of reference, just in case!There&amp;#39;s more to it, but someone has some protist-oriented microscopy for me to do.

Sounds like a tagline from the 2004 Oscar-winning film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn&amp;#39;t it? Published in this month&amp;#39;s issue of Learning &amp;amp; Memory, a study by Winters, Tucci, and DaCosta-Furtado over at the University of Guelph, Canada have managed to bring us one step closer to making this seeminly far-fetched idea a reality. They had rats explore sample objects and some time later injected them with either an NMDA receptor antagonist known as MK-801 or a control saline solution before reactivating the object memory. The authors found that the reconsolidation of young or weakly encoded memories were disrupted by MK-801 regardless of the reactivation conditions. However, when they increased the amount of sample object exploration or the time between sample phase and reactivation (older and stronger memories) the effect of MK-801 was abolished during reconsolidation unless (now this is the interesting part) salient novel contextual information was present during memory reactivation. Their findings support the hypothesis that the reconsolidation process enables modification of existing memories.Could this be a future treatment option for patients suffering from PTSD? How about for less severe cases like those who just can&amp;#39;t get over that one ex.

He'd been doing some consulting work for the entertainment industry, and wasn't very happy with their attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that movie people know how to present this stuff, because they are entertainment-wise and the scientists aren't is wrong. They have no experience in explaining ideas, witness all movies, and I do. I am a successful lecturer in physics for popular audiences. The real entertainment gimmick is the excitement, drama and mystery of the subject matter. People love to learn something, they are "entertained" enormously by being allowed to understand a little bit of something they never understood before. One must have faith in the subject and in people's interest in it. Otherwise just use a Western to sell telephones! The faith in the value of the subject matter must be sincere and show through clearly. All gimmicks, etc. should be subservient to this. They should help in explaining and describing the subject, and not in entertaining. Entertainment will be an automatic byproduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't &lt;i&gt;entirely&lt;/i&gt; agree with him — most entertainment isn&amp;#39;t at all didactic — but he&amp;#39;s right that when you are trying to get an informative message across, the gimmicks have to be the garnish, not the main course, and the work you do in developing the medium has to focus on making &lt;i&gt;the message itself&lt;/i&gt; interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells"&gt;Book of Kells&lt;/a&gt; is an artistic wonder, an illuminated manuscript that anyone could spend hours and days staring at, enjoying the script and the little illustrations all over the pages. But those are geegaws that don&amp;#39;t make the content clearer or more palatable — they allow one to appreciate it while ignoring the message (and a good thing, too — it&amp;#39;s just the dull old gospels turned into art). In communicating science, the goal is not to load it up with bells and whistles, but to make the story you&amp;#39;re telling clear and accessible. You don&amp;#39;t want the listener or reader to overlook the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The skeptical pursuits of those of us who have seen the light of reason shine into the dark world of woo and on their many adherents are now seeing a few phony-baloney media mediums running scared and more than a tad threatened.  The pinch is starting to take hold. Personally, I can only take small comfort in what is going on all over the Internet, but I would like to think that FORCE ONE&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and undercover people I may have inspired and who are fed up with the latest mediumistic crop are directly responsible for many of the spook crooks beginning to see cracks in their crystal balls. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A certain mediumistic entity of some renown I’ll refer to now as Mr. “Psychic Guy” (you can plug in any number of phonies in that space) has now taken it upon himself to put out on-line threats against anyone he feels is using “libel and defamation of character” to besmirch his dubious character. Oh boo hoo. Sane rationally thinking people with critcal minds are now being tagged as ”nameless faceless thugs” by a guy who &lt;strong&gt;TALKS TO DEAD PEOPLE.&lt;/strong&gt; This spook chaser even goes so far as to,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“…predict bloggers and message board trolls will begin to think about what they post on the WWW.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;What a predcition! &lt;img title="XW6CA2FR79ECAAJXJE5CAM9I3HECAC8M9SCCAJI6UWMCA81K309CAH8UUTGCA993DPQCABL4ZRACA6E0BJ5CAVOMET5CAMBM3X4CA6KP76LCAUP52OLCATHDR8QCAT2EQW6CA4N9QWVCA29ZCGUCAL6EG71" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/XW6CA2FR79ECAAJXJE5CAM9I3HECAC8M9SCCAJI6UWMCA81K309CAH8UUTGCA993DPQCABL4ZRACA6E0BJ5CAVOMET5CAMBM3X4CA6KP76LCAUP52OLCATHDR8QCAT2EQW6CA4N9QWVCA29ZCGUCAL6EG71.jpg" alt="XW6CA2FR79ECAAJXJE5CAM9I3HECAC8M9SCCAJI6UWMCA81K309CAH8UUTGCA993DPQCABL4ZRACA6E0BJ5CAVOMET5CAMBM3X4CA6KP76LCAUP52OLCATHDR8QCAT2EQW6CA4N9QWVCA29ZCGUCAL6EG71" width="150" height="113"&gt;           &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to hear about exactly who he’s referring to, but I will venture a guess it won’t be any one of the thousands of people who abhor the exploitation and possible deleterious mental effects of inculcating false beliefs about ghosts in children.&lt;img title="48265" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/48265.jpg" alt="48265" width="112" height="170"&gt; The Pied Piper of Hamlin comes to mind, but in today’s world of exploitation, it’s not so much a fairy tale as a nightmare. This cruelty is more like a network santioned child abuse and intentionally induced traumatic stress program fitted into a money making contrivance worthy of Cagliostro himself…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        Chips off the old blocks I guess…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Us “trolls” and “Internet Bashers” will stick together as long as there are so many idiotic claimants who still have no scientific or rational evidence that ghosts are real and continue to pretend that speaking to them is anything other than self delusion. What else is new? Does Mr. Psychic Guy think he is any different than Eusapia Palladino, Henry Slade or the Fox Sisters? If he does it’s quite simple; prove it dude. I’m waiting. I’ll come to you and I’ll even buy dinner. Otherwise ranting legal threats just underscore a frightened fellow who knows his days as a media medium are drawing to a close like so many before him. Talk about setting legal precedents; Psychic Guy’s consultation time with a lawyer for any perceived defamation issues might better be spent covering his own ass from lawsuits coming down the pike from parents who will one day have to seek out professional help for their messed-up kids when those poor adolescents start wielding fire-axes against bogey men they are likely to imagine in their tainted futures. How could  anyone dare mention such abusers! That could be slanderous! A top notch trial lawyer like, say Robert Kardashian from O.J. Simpson fame would jump out of his grave to get a case like this, which is pretty remarkable since he isn’t dead yet. Hold on. I just Googled his name. Robert Kardashian &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;dead after all. His head exploded when he was asked to prosecute people for challenging the veracity of a guy who &lt;strong&gt;TALKS TO DEAD PEOPLE.&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps a dead lawyer could be summoned in court by the medium to argue his case?  Now &lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt;would be a media exploit that would put the Scopes Monkey Trials to shame and worth its weight in primetime gold. Hey Psychic Guy:  Do that and I’ll quit this blog and start working for you. You have my word on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:137px"&gt;&lt;img title="2A3CAA7ZEI7CA4Z06HHCADYRTD2CAN57S7CCAQ4ZWFOCA8RU4YTCAS4XFYECA2PZ0WUCAL2XA2XCADOUQFLCAGH7KW9CA00CENLCA1SOWPQCACLR5O9CA50EB0XCAH4TA1DCAN6RX8BCATNJHXBCAPF4PLK" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2A3CAA7ZEI7CA4Z06HHCADYRTD2CAN57S7CCAQ4ZWFOCA8RU4YTCAS4XFYECA2PZ0WUCAL2XA2XCADOUQFLCAGH7KW9CA00CENLCA1SOWPQCACLR5O9CA50EB0XCAH4TA1DCAN6RX8BCATNJHXBCAPF4PLK2.jpg" alt="Paradolia in a cup of ..." width="127" height="112"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradolia in a cup of ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The fact that Psychic Guy is so frustratingly afraid of his own approaching shadow is made even more amusing by the frequent use of other “open-minded” people apparently covering for him in blogs, chatrooms and on message boards. His charges that on-line bloggers will be prosecuted is hilarious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; ”…judges have ordered ISPs to reveal the identities of individuals who may be guilty of libel and defamation of character.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Oh boy. I’m shaking in my boots now. Allegations about using pseudonyms and fake monickers to hide behind is absurd when the accuser is himself well-known by many in the cyber world for using this cowardly tactic. If true, this is yet another wildly hypocrtical slant to add to his denials and excuses.  Lately, he has been telling the world that he won’t work as a “psychic detective” for any law enforcement groups because he fears for his own safety. Nice dodge there. Methinks he’s watched one too many episodes of “&lt;em&gt;The Mentalist” &lt;/em&gt;where in the pilot, one-time pro psychic pretender Patrick Jane quits the biz after his wife and child are murdered by a serial killer named Red John. This ruse is a convenient out for anyone to borrow and I have to hand it to Psychic Guy for putting it to trendy good use. But in his case, he’s never done anything to solve any real crimes, so what’s he so worried about? Maybe he already has seen a Red John in his own future. It wouldn’t be too hard to see trouble of some sort in your crystal ball if you had dealt with as many seriously disturbed nut cases as the average medium ”helps out”  in a few years time. The medium’s world of guilt, deception and denial is frightening enough without having  to deal with those pesky people writing about you on the Internet who might actually question &lt;strong&gt;TALKING TO DEAD PEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt; .  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Poor fellow. He’s like a spider caught in a corner who must strike out at whoever and however he can. Skeptics are poking the pointed stick of common sense and reason at him and he doesn’t like it. Any sane person must conclude that if such powers to &lt;strong&gt;TALK TO DEAD PEOPLE &lt;/strong&gt;and communicate with spirits had validity of any kind, a person in possession of those powers would be virtually untouchable by mere mortals like myself and other naysayers. Please supply me with the logic here Mr. Psychic Guy. There would be no need for any legal recourse!  Think about it for a moment. Why on earth would you need a lawyer if you could summon up spirits, obtain spirit voices from beyond the grave and possibly even send a convincing ghostie my way?  I’d love that! Or will you at least invoke one up for me around Halloween or maybe Christmas? So far, I haven’t suffered a single lost night of sleep, much less a Scrooge type visitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I advise you to exert extreme caution with naming names and making further comments that you may regret.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Extreme caution? Okay. But I don’t need to “name names.” Everybody knows who you are.  Just is case, I’ll play along for the sake of that game as the generic “Psychic Guy.” There now, …does that make you feel better? You psychic guys and gals are all interchangeable anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I have read the recent court records. They are available on-line to anyone who wishes to see for themselves how the United States court system works. Any libelous statements made on-line &lt;em&gt;have to be proved false in court &lt;/em&gt;to be punishable by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Well okay then! So, let’s have it:  You have to prove&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you have the ability to &lt;strong&gt;SPEAK TO DEAD PEOPLE,&lt;/strong&gt; otherwise any statements made here or anywhere else on-line concerning you or any of the other scam artists who parade their fake supernatural skills as the real McCoy are shit out of luck. Show us your supernal powers Psychic Guy. Make that big splash history has been waiting for! Or in lieu of any actual divine intervention, give us your best legal shot. Uri tried that once or twice too. It didn’t come to much. He wanted 15 million and he got nothing, remember? &lt;em&gt;In fact, the judge ruled against him.&lt;/em&gt; If you’re not up on your court rulings, I understand. You’re too busy &lt;strong&gt;TALKING TO DEAD PEOPLE. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Here’s the dope on Uri’s deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Amherst, NY: Self-proclaimed psychic spoon-bender Uri Geller has paid to the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), the first $40,000 of up to $120,000 as part of a settlement agreement to a court-described “frivolous complaint” made by Geller against CSICOP.”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:160px"&gt;&lt;img title="YFVCA4YOERTCAE8HEA3CASF2D93CAHWNU57CA3F25EVCAF113YYCATJ5319CAS0VDGCCAU5YQ8WCAEO6363CA1VJV98CAV5234ZCAEX1Y2MCAZWQTJ7CART64FNCA34GE02CAHWAOZ1CAQW9IECCAZ0OPR9" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/YFVCA4YOERTCAE8HEA3CASF2D93CAHWNU57CA3F25EVCAF113YYCATJ5319CAS0VDGCCAU5YQ8WCAEO6363CA1VJV98CAV5234ZCAEX1Y2MCAZWQTJ7CART64FNCA34GE02CAHWAOZ1CAQW9IECCAZ0OPR91.jpg" alt="Wake up and smell the _______" width="150" height="94"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wake up and smell the _______&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;When it comes to false claims and charaltanism, it still remains a free speech world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Since the aforementioned phony ISP identities have been bandied about on-line and people to afraid to come out in the light of day continue to play hide and seek, I’m not sure who put the following grandiose one-liners into the cybermix, but it reads like the same sad character to me: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If, in any manner, you damage an individuals reputation or income by something spoken or written — and malice can be proven — there are grounds for legal action.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;and, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…Maligning the reputation or character of individuals by spoken or written words. And if you don’t think that a greedy lawyer would take the case, you’re mistaken.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Oh yeah! No problem Mr. Psychic Guy. I’m believing that for sure! There are dozens of  lawyers who might line up in a que to attempt to protect a sterling reputation like yours, but like the famous King Henry IV Shakespearean quote that goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLENDOWER: I can call forth the spirits of the vasty deep!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To which &lt;strong&gt;HOTSPUR&lt;/strong&gt; replies:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="TEXT-ALIGN:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why, so can I or so can any man. But will they come when you do call to them?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;That, Mr. Psychic Guy is what Shakespeare called “the rub.” Anyone can say they &lt;strong&gt;TALK TO DEAD PEOPLE. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s the easy part. The way we see it in the real world tells us your big problem is threefold:  1) Getting dead people to come when you call them, 2) Presenting that ghost (or whatever it is that talks to you) to someone other than yourself or your believers, and lastly, 3) Get a dead person to talk back with authority that’s verifiable under reasonable test conditions and not on edited television. Can you do that Psychic Guy? It would be great if you could. Otherwise it’s just talk, talk, talk. Shamefully, it’s only in our so-called “enlightened age” that such ridiculous sham behavior can substitute  for spirituality or qualified grief counseling. Back in Shakespeare’s time, claiming such a dishonorable ability would have probably got your ass burned at the stake – and your lawyer too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The whole question of whether a lawyer could prove damages or the maligning of any mediums reputation hinges on the bold fact that anyone claiming the ability to &lt;strong&gt;TALK TO THE DEAD PEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt; is literally banking on an unprovable and heretofore false claim and anyone who says he or she can do so breaks the law themselves by obtaining money under false pretenses.  You do get paid for your work don’t you Psychic Guy? Show undeniably that &lt;strong&gt;TALKING TO DEAD PEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt; is real, and you walk away the winner and not a criminal. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;And it &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;income &lt;/strong&gt;isn’t it, Psychic Guy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Like Asimov’s &lt;em&gt;“Unicorn Wings” &lt;/em&gt;theory, proponents of woo coming after skeptics will first have to prove in court that spirit communication is real in order to go to the next level of being maligned for such rubbish. Can you do that Psychic Guy? If so, like I said many times before: I’m willing to meet you anywhere, anytime to clear up any misunderstandings. This summit would bring much needed publicity for everyone concerned by being the single most important discovery in the history of mankind.  Put me down for that one, okay? It might even save the sagging careers of Sylvia Browne (… right now getting ready for her “Farewell Tour”) and get you your own global television network. Lawyers and libel suits are very small potatoes when you measure up this kind of monumental gift to humanity against my puny “thug” challenge. Prove me wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I’ m eager to hear from you …or your lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

The judge said he probably would rule next week on whether the young man will stand trial and, if not, whether to send him to a treatment facility; less than two weeks after the mental evaluations were completed in March, the man was moved from jail to a state-run center in Toledo. The defense had argued that Walker cannot carry on a conversation and would be unable to assist in his defense. He was disruptive at his first court appearance and was kept in a restraint chair and had a mask to keep him from spitting at deputies. Prior to the attack at the center of the case, the man’s 60-year-old mother had mentioned increased aggression from her son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search and rescue personnel from throughout the region will train beginning this weekend at Crater Lake National Park, near the area where an 8-year-old boy, who had a form of autism that gave him a fear of loud noises and bright lights, was sightseeing with his father when he was lost in mid-October. The park is hosting the exercise that will focus on search techniques such as high angle rope operations, ground searching and working with search dogs. Authorities hope the exercise may turn up clues to the missing boy’s whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Conroe, Texas, man has received 50 years in prison for the murder of a 3-year-old autistic child. Chase Cannon, 29, pleaded guilty Thursday to the killing, which took place last August when EMTs found the child unresponsive, having seizures and vomiting uncontrollably. An autopsy revealed the child had numerous injuries, including 79 bruises, cigarette burns to his feet, a broken arm and a fatal blow to his head.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts in Columbia, Ill., have ruled that a 5-year-old autistic boy may take his specially trained dog to school, denying a request by the local school district to suppress a preliminary order that required the school district to accommodate the boy and his dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was raised as a full-on, tongue-speaking, fundy Christian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting married, having a couple of kids, and generally settling into life, I started to question my Christianity.  Over a period of a few years, I became an atheist.  My children were very young at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first husband and I divorced while I was still a Christian.  After the divorce, he continued to take them to church on his weekends. After I became an atheist, I no longer went to church but I never came out as an atheist as my entire family were (are) tongue-speaking, Bible-believing, spirit-filled, fire-breathing Christians. It would completely devastate them to think I wouldn’t be sharing heavenly bliss with them.  So for now, they just think I’m back-slidden. They don’t know I no longer believe at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My spirit-filled sister recently preached at her church.  Before her sermon she got everyone to come out the front and renounce their sicknesses.  She said god was a healing god and they shouldn’t be sick.  She said they shouldn’t accept sickness as it’s not part of god’s plan.  So she said a loud prayer and there was lots of shouting and crying out to god during the whole experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this because she gave me a copy of her preaching CD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after her preaching, she was sick!  My current husband and I were having a little chuckle over this fact.&lt;br&gt;
My daughter suddenly turned to me and said, “Why don’t you just let people believe what they want to believe?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said they can believe whatever they’d like!  But if someone says something silly in public, then I have the right to comment on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter came back with the same statement and no matter what I couldn’t make her understand my point of view.  She then started crying because she said I was attacking her religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, although I don’t believe, I have never told my kids what to believe.  I’ve just told them to examine everything and not simply believe something just because someone else said it was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s told me she believes in god, but doesn’t believe in parts of the Bible… My daughter is still angry and feels like I attacked her.  I can’t make her understand that I haven’t attacked her or even her religion, just something that someone from oher religion said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could I have handled this better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, although I know this is probably wrong, I must admit that I am a little disappointed that she is just going along believing it all when I feel she should know better!  She has the tools, she knows where the religion came from, and yet still she chooses to believe it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions or comments for the reader?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is she being too harsh with her comments about religion?  Should she refrain from making comments about religion at all in front of her daughter?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This series of chats with different scientists, entertainers and more is being held over the next day to raise awareness and money for the group, so if you tune in and you’re able, please give whatever you can.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252779396830"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/filefieldfilefield_insertima/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dd459b2432b0798b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">filefield+filefield_insert+ima…</title><published>2009-09-12T18:16:02Z</published><updated>2009-09-12T18:16:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/filefieldfilefield_insertima/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;filefield+filefield_insert+imagefield+imagecache+wysiwyg+better_formats = magic !drupal combo&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252778877501"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-6a00d83451df0c69e20120a5be8152970c">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/614485a20855a644</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Skeptic Park</title><published>2009-09-12T17:22:38Z</published><updated>2009-09-12T17:23:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/09/skeptic-park.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/09/skeptic-park.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This actually made me LOL:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://crispian-jago.blogspot.com/2009/09/skeptic-park.html" style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Skeptic Park" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20120a567ea05970b-800wi" style="margin:3px" title="Skeptic Park"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might recognize those four characters.  The opening section gives you an idea - &lt;a href="http://crispian-jago.blogspot.com/2009/09/skeptic-park.html"&gt;Crispian Jago’s blog&lt;/a&gt; has the full thing.  Brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252778378542"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9239">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55d58308d1a89744</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Meet-Ups"/><category term="Psychics"/><title type="html">Challenging Claims of the Paranormal in Houston</title><published>2009-09-12T17:05:02Z</published><updated>2009-09-12T17:05:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/challenging-claims-of-the-paranormal-in-houston/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, Houston area Skepchickers, put this on your calendar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Wagg, the Communication and Outreach Manager of the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/"&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, will be in Houston to address the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/HoustonSkeptics/calendar/11258354/"&gt;Greater Houston Skeptics Society&lt;/a&gt; on the evening of September 22, 2009, at the &lt;a href="http://www.hpl.lib.tx.us/central-library"&gt;Central branch &lt;/a&gt;of the &lt;a href="http://www.hpl.lib.tx.us/"&gt;Houston Public Library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His talk will explore the pros and cons of offering monetary “challenges” to those who claim to have paranormal or supernatural abilities. He will regale attendees with stories of his experiences with the JREF’s $1,000,000 Psychic Challenge, and will touch upon the many other challenges out there, as well, including the pseudo-challenges sometimes offered by paranormal groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff’s presentation will start at 7:00 p.m., but the room, which is on the 4th floor of the library, will be available from 6:00 p.m. They tell me you are allowed to bring outside food and drinks, though only of the non-alcoholic variety. Don’t despair, however, as there’s been talk of post-presentation cocktails (location TBD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So scrub your pits, put on a clean shirt, and come out and hang with Jeff Wagg and the Houston area skeptics for a night.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252776054114"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/im_not_surprised.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/85140641433db563</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment"/><title type="html">I'm not surprised</title><published>2009-09-12T17:56:34Z</published><updated>2009-09-12T17:56:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Z54rrGBqG_M/im_not_surprised.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/im_not_surprised.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;That new Darwin film, &lt;i&gt;Creation&lt;/i&gt; (reviews &lt;a href="http://hoopyfrood.org/movies/notes-from-the-toronto-international-film-festival-2009-day-two/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/09/eugenie-scott-r.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) doesn&amp;#39;t look like it will get to my neighborhood theater — &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/us-snubs-film-on-theory-of-evolution-20090912-flkx.html"&gt;it hasn't got a US distributor&lt;/a&gt;, for familiar reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A British film about Charles Darwin has failed to find a US distributor because his theory of evolution is too controversial for American audiences, according to its producer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Creation, starring Briton Paul Bettany, details the naturalist's "struggle between faith and reason" as he wrote On the Origin of Species.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It depicts him as a man who loses faith in God after the death of his daughter, Annie, 10.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The film was chosen to open the Toronto Film Festival and has its British premiere today. It has been sold in almost every territory around the world, from Australia to Scandinavia.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, US distributors turned down the film that will prove divisive in a country where, according to a Gallup poll taken in February, only 39 per cent of people believe in the theory of evolution.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Movieguide.org, an influential site that reviews films from a Christian perspective, described Darwin as the father of eugenics and denounced him as "a racist, a bigot and an 1800s naturalist whose legacy is mass murder". His "half-baked theory" influenced Adolf Hitler and led to "atrocities, crimes against humanity, cloning and genetic engineering", the site stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, to be fair, this is only part of the story. One reason it probably isn&amp;#39;t getting picked up is that it isn&amp;#39;t a blockbuster story — it&amp;#39;s a small film with a personal story. That&amp;#39;s not to say it&amp;#39;s a bad movie, but it&amp;#39;s not a Michael Bay noisemaker with car chases and explosions, or giant robots, or a remake of a 1970s cheesy TV show. That makes it a tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, while it's going to generate a little controversy from the know-nothing brigades, it's not a movie that embraces the controversy and makes a lot of PR waves. I suspect it's falling into the valley of the dead movies, where it's got just enough negative vibe to turn away a segment (a small, stupid segment, of course, but theaters don't care about the IQ of the people buying popcorn) of the population, but not enough shock value to make it a must-see movie for the controversy alone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/im_not_surprised.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Z54rrGBqG_M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252776054114"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/curse_of_the_revenge_of_the_so.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/92b3cba0dc946af2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Open Thread"/><title type="html">Curse of the Revenge of the Son of the Bride of the Thread That Will Not Die!</title><published>2009-09-12T17:43:28Z</published><updated>2009-09-12T17:43:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/L9X7E-u4Jc4/curse_of_the_revenge_of_the_so.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/curse_of_the_revenge_of_the_so.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aaaaiaiaiaiieeeeeeeeeaaaah! &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/revenge_of_the_son_of_the_brid.php"&gt;Make it stop, mommy, make it stop!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/curse_of_the_revenge_of_the_so.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/L9X7E-u4Jc4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252775920382"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/quackery_at_the_university_of_toronto_re.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2adbe85e0f734f92</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Quackery at the University of Toronto, redux</title><published>2009-09-12T15:30:55Z</published><updated>2009-09-12T15:30:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/GkpB6K3zMhU/quackery_at_the_university_of_toronto_re.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/quackery_at_the_university_of_toronto_re.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago or so, I expressed dismay at what I perceived as an autism &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/autism_quackery_at_the_university_of_tor.php"&gt;quackfest being held at the University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. Worse, that quackfest had been partially funded by a grant from a very prestigious children's charity, The SickKids Foundation, which in response to complaints about its sponsoring the autism quackfest known as &lt;a href="http://www.autismcanada.org/calendar.htm"&gt;AutismOne/Autism Canada 2009 Conference&lt;/a&gt;, wrote a limp and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/sickkids_foundation_supports_woo.php"&gt;pusillanimous form e-mail&lt;/a&gt; that it sent to everyone who complained. It was truly disappointing to see that an organization that should be supporting science-based research into the treatment of children's cancer and other serious diseases that primarily affect children would be lending its money, name, and prestige to autism quackery, including &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/autism_quackery_at_the_university_of_tor.php"&gt;anti-vaccine loons, homeopaths, and "energy medicine" practitioners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One salutary effect of my posts was that the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health. which had been previously listed on the early advertisements as a co-sponsor of this event, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/autism_quackery_at_the_university_of_tor.php#comment-1897133"&gt;apparently told AutismOne to stop using its name&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly, more recent iterations of the Autism Canada website and advertisements show no such affiliation anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, lest you doubt that this quackfest will go ahead regardless, check this out. A reader kindly scanned an actual pamphlet advertising this "conference" and sent them to me. Here is the cover:&lt;/p&gt;

Douglas Bremner’s blog &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com"&gt;Before You Take That Pill&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Bremner was not pleased, and posted a rebuttal entitled &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/09/10/response-to-peter-lipson-md-of-science-based-blogs-my-blog-does-not-suck-yours-does/"&gt;Response to Peter Lipson MD of “Science” Based Blogs, My Blog Does Not Suck, Yours Does&lt;/a&gt;. Given the kerfuffle and my role as managing editor of SBM, I felt the need to put my two cents in, which is why I’m posting this open letter to Dr. Bremner. This letter started as a much briefer response that I was going to e-mail to Dr. Bremner, but as I wrote it grew and grew to the point where I decided that, given the public nature of the disagreement between Dr. Lipson and Dr. Bremner, I might as well make my commentary public too. Consider it a bonus post from me. I still plan a post for my usual slot on Monday. In the meantime, here’s my open letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Bremner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read your harsh rebuttal (&lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/09/10/response-to-peter-lipson-md-of-science-based-blogs-my-blog-does-not-suck-yours-does/#comments"&gt;Response to Peter Lipson MD of “Science” Based Blogs, My Blog Does Not Suck, Yours Does&lt;/a&gt;) to a post by one of our bloggers (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1307"&gt;Before You Trust That Blog…&lt;/a&gt;) that criticized some of your stands on flu vaccines, angioplasty, and mammographic screening for breast cancer. After rereading Peter’s post and reading yours, quite frankly I actually do see Peter’s point and find your rebuttal unconvincing, or, as you so charmingly put, it “lame-O.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me describe to you the genesis of Dr. Lipson’s post. A reader sent in your flu vaccine post (&lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/01/28/flu-shots-are-still-for-idiots-2/"&gt;Flu Shots Are [Still] For Idiots&lt;/a&gt;), asking me what I thought about it. I was appalled. So I circulated it among our bloggers to see if anyone wanted to comment on it, and Peter stepped up to the plate. As a blogger who regularly combats the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9"&gt;lies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;anti-vaccine movement&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt;, especially the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=393"&gt;myth that vaccines cause autism&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=503"&gt;outrageous quackery&lt;/a&gt; that results from the lie that vaccines cause autism, I have in the past found your posts on vaccines (and now especially the one Peter took issue with) to be bordering on being anti-vaccine themselves and at the very least to reveal anti-vaccine sympathies in both content and tone. Really, saying that the flu vaccine is for idiots and telling people they shouldn’t get it, as you did? That I cannot countenance or leave unanswered, and, quite frankly, you richly deserved a blog beat down for it. Indeed, I had been contemplating doing a rebuttal or two to some of your more–shall we say?–hyperbolic posts myself, but Peter beat me to it. If he is too “blunt” for you, check out these posts by other SBM bloggers, which directly and indirectly demolish your points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1229"&gt;An Influenza Primer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=479"&gt;Swine Flu Update and Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1296"&gt;Swine Flu Vaccine Fearmongering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to dismiss &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; as not being “science-based,” if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s not enough, peruse the posts on the flu, the swine flu, and the flu vaccine by an acquaintance of mine “revere” at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure"&gt;Effect Measure&lt;/a&gt;, a senior and well-respected epidemiologist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/influenza_treatment/"&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/influenza_treatment/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/swine_flu/"&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/swine_flu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/pandemic_preparedness/"&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/pandemic_preparedness/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/05/how_do_we_know_how_many_people.php"&gt;How do we know how many people die from flu each year?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/09/the_depressing_math_of_swine_f.php"&gt;The depressing math of swine flu, ICUs and ventilators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/09/this_week_in_swine_flu_vaccine.php"&gt;This week in swine flu vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/03/flu_deaths_in_children.php"&gt;Flu deaths in children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by reading these posts, especially &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=320"&gt;Influenza Deaths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/05/how_do_we_know_how_many_people.php"&gt;How do we know how many people die from flu each year?&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll see (I hope) that your complaint that the 30,000/year flu death figure is an exaggeration is, well, an exaggeration. You take a complex issue and simplify it beyond recognition, &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/01/28/flu-shots-are-still-for-idiots-2/"&gt;concluding&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians that fell asleep in science class in high school are getting a lot of money from vaccine manufacturers. Through a combination of greasing the wheels and the fact that they are too stupid to know better, they actually think that they are helping us out by using government resources to try and ‘educate’ us that we need to get a flu shot that actually will do nothing for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you object to Peter referring to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; as “stupid”? Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; think flu vaccines are “for idiots”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as a breast cancer surgeon, I find a couple of the posts I’ve seen on your blog about cancer (readers have actually forwarded them to me) and in particular on breast cancer so painfully simplistic and distorted that my teeth would grind reading them. I’ve even shown up at least once in your comments to take you to task for at least one grossly incorrect statement I’ve seen you make regarding cancer. (I did it under my other, pseudonymous persona, though; so don’t go looking for Gorski anywhere. Guess for yourself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you dismiss me as a pharma shill or a physician hopelessly in the thrall of the Dark Lords of Pharma, peruse &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?author=8"&gt;my posts on SBM&lt;/a&gt;. Any fair reading of my output will show I am no such thing. Quite frankly, although Peter may have been a bit more–shall we say?–vociferous in how he expressed himself than I might have been (at least on SBM; on my other blog is a different story), I tend to agree with most, if not all, of what he wrote. From my reading, you appear to have lost all perspective. To you, if it’s pharma, it can’t be right; &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/category/vaccines/"&gt;flu vaccines are useless&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/category/cancer/"&gt;mammography is useless; chemotherapy is pointless and doesn’t save lives&lt;/a&gt;; and it’s all a plot by the medical-industrial-pharma-government complex to milk the sheeple of their hard-earned cash. Certainly that’s the impression I leave your blog with, as well as the question of what, if anything, from modern scientific medicine you actually do consider worthwhile and not a huge pharma-enriching scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I think Peter nailed it. You &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; devolved from reasonable skepticism to cynicism and beyond to conspiracy mongering. Worse, you overgeneralize and oversimplify complex medical and scientific issues to support that cynicism and conspiracy mongering. Moreover, you are hardly one to take affront at harsh language, when a recent perusal of your blog reveals posts entitled, &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/08/31/pimps-whores-and-the-european-society-of-cardiology-meeting/"&gt;Pimps, Whores, and the European Society of Cardiology Meeting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/03/18/should-i-take-aspirin-or-put-a-gun-to-my-head/"&gt;Should I Take Aspirin or Put a Gun To My Head?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/09/10/response-to-peter-lipson-md-of-science-based-blogs-my-blog-does-not-suck-yours-does/"&gt;Response to Peter Lipson MD of “Science” Based Blogs, My Blog Does Not Suck, Yours Does&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, your post that started it all, ” “Flu Shots are [Still] For Idiots.” A lovely example comes to mind from a &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/03/24/dsm-v-shadow-team-strikes-back-at-psychiatric-establishment-on-ptsd/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; to which you linked in trying to rebut Dr. Lipson, in which you criticized those who argue that PTSD may be overdiagnosed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTSD, as presently diagnosed, described, and treated, has failed to improve on what had been standard teaching. It has redefined and overextended the reach of a long-recognized natural human reaction of fear, anxiety, and conditioned emotional reactions to shocks and traumas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, nothing like the old days, when guys killed Japs and enjoyed it, and gals got raped and if they didn’t stop sniveling you could just give them a good wack to help them get over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that your “&lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/09/10/response-to-peter-lipson-md-of-science-based-blogs-my-blog-does-not-suck-yours-does/"&gt;flu shots are for idiots&lt;/a&gt;” post means you must think &lt;em&gt;I’m&lt;/em&gt; an idiot, as I plan on getting my flu shots this year, be it one, two, or three. Be that as it may, it’s very easy to dismiss criticisms because they are harsh. It’s a lot harder to look a bit more closely and ask yourself if there’s anything to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it for a moment. Try. Try real hard. Not every criticism of you is because the minions of big pharma are ganging up on you or because the person criticizing you or with whom you disagree is hopelessly deluded, biased, or stupid. You can be wrong, and in several cases that I’ve seen just from perusing your blog over the last couple of days, you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fine line between severe criticism and conspiracy-mongering or taking complex issues and simplistically (and in a knee-jerk fashion) taking the side that most fits with your biases, the latter two of which are what you appear to do more often than I am comfortable with. I can’t speak for my co-bloggers, but I will be with you when you are correct and against you when I think you are wrong, as in here. You may have thought that doing a post saying that flu vaccines are still “for idiots,” complete with photos of of a pidgeon reading a book about pooping on people and a tasteless photo of “cretins” proclaiming, “Even these guys think your an idiot” was funny. I do not. I think it’s extremely irresponsible. The issue of flu vaccines and the the potential swine flu pandemic deserve better than your sophomoric attempt at humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, hey, what do I know? I’m just one of those “stupid” people you dismiss who has concluded, on the basis of the scientific evidence, that flu vaccines are worthwhile, chemotherapy can save lives, and that mammography, when properly used as a screening tool, benefits women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Gorski, MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Perhaps while you’re at it, you could answer me one question: Do you think that vaccines cause autism?&lt;/p&gt;

The topic: “&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574405030643556324.html"&gt;Evolution, Science, and Where God Fits In&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins will be arguing the pro-common-sense side, which leaves Armstrong having to defend, well, read for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Darwin made it clear once again that—as Maimonides, Avicenna, Aquinas and Eckhart had already pointed out—we cannot regard God simply as a divine personality, who single-handedly created the world. This could direct our attention away from the idols of certainty and back to the “God beyond God.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure that “divine personality” is an oblique way of calling someone “ugly.”  I am not sure what this has to do with the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dawkins points out, most religious people do indeed think that god single-handedly created the world.  (Although it’s true that some ultra-liberal protestants think he had help from the unions, most neo-Hellenists believe that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theogony#First_generation"&gt;Chaos arose spontaneously&lt;/a&gt;, and Scientologists are confident that &lt;a href="http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/collection/Scientology/point25.htm"&gt;thetans brought the world into being&lt;/a&gt; for their own pleasure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also pretty sure that “god beyond god” is one of those nonsense terms that is used to confuse small-minded people.  (”That sounds &lt;i&gt;deep&lt;/i&gt;, so it must &lt;i&gt;mean&lt;/i&gt; something!”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The best theology is a spiritual exercise, akin to poetry. Religion is not an exact science but a kind of art form that, like music or painting, introduces us to a mode of knowledge that is different from the purely rational and which cannot easily be put into words.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, except that music and painting don’t tell you things like “use contraception and you’ll go to hell” or “draw a picture of Mohammed and we’ll kill you” or “god hates fags.”  (Speed metal band Gød Hätes Fägs being, of course, a notable exception.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also appreciate her “cannot easily be put into words” cop-out, as it’s useful in many other contexts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
BOSS&lt;br&gt;
Why weren't you at work yesterday?&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JOEL&lt;br&gt;
There's a reason why, but it's different from the purely rational, and it can't easily be put into words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOSS&lt;br&gt;
Were you sick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JOEL&lt;br&gt;
No, that's kind of an idol of certainty.  I'd say I was the "sick beyond sick."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOSS&lt;br&gt;
What the hell does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JOEL&lt;br&gt;
It's a kind of art form, akin to poetry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOSS&lt;br&gt;
I hate poetry.  You're fired.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, maybe it’s not that useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think we can all agree that Armstrong’s defense of the “nonsense” position is valiant.  Is there any way we can reward her, say with a TED Prize?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252770886063"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/deluded_but_with_good_intent.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d9696ce1e338dd45</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Deluded, but with good intent</title><published>2009-09-12T16:29:38Z</published><updated>2009-09-12T16:29:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/snaarbWwi-0/deluded_but_with_good_intent.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/deluded_but_with_good_intent.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The video below is of a devout Mormon (I'm so sorry for him) speaking out against the church policies of discrimination that led to all that money being sunk into Proposition 8 in California.

A paradigmatic example is Ken Ham's bizarre Creation "Museum", which on the one hand repeatedly rejects the power of human reason, while on the other constantly throws up pseudo-scientific displays that mimic those of real museums, trying to illustrate the apocalyptic fever dreams of a world-destroying flood with mechanistic explanations, from floating islands of logs that carried the koalas to Australia to faux-authentic maps of the path of the tidal wave that killed everyone; the literature of creationism is also thick with &lt;a href="http://www.rae.org/noah.html"&gt;'feasibility studies'&lt;/a&gt; of the engineering of the Ark, estimates of how many species could have fit aboard, peculiar adoptions of physics software that, by diddling certain inputs, they use to justify such nonsense as &lt;a href="http://mypage.direct.ca/w/writer/hydro.html"&gt;hydroplate theory&lt;/a&gt;, explanations of the distribution of fossils by &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH561_2.html"&gt;hydrologic sorting&lt;/a&gt;, etc., etc., etc. Witness also the recent small surge of creationists maneuvering to get Ph.D.s from prestigious institutions, from Berkeley to Harvard, not with the intent of doing actual scientific research, but because it adds an illusion of authority to their apologetics and denial of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we are witnessing is the obvious bankruptcy of spiritual thought. We know it, and they know it; it is not sufficient to declare the Noachian Flood to be a miracle, a catastrophe conjured up in an instant with a snap of God's omnipotent fingers, with all of its traces magically erased or juggled by God for God's ineffable purposes. It is not enough to say that God willed that trilobites would come to rest in certain layers of Flood sediments, and the bones of mammals would be buried in yet another graveyard of stone; no, they must invent &lt;i&gt;natural processes&lt;/i&gt; that assist their enfeebled deity, that sound more plausible than that their god placed each dead clam in its final resting place, one by one, with loving attention to its stratigraphic layer and accompanying fauna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their work is an admission of failure. They are struggling to embed their deity in the natural universe of Newton and Darwin, steadily stripping him of powers in order to accommodate themselves to a very human success story, the power of rational, scientific thought, while somehow, they hope, not losing god among the protons and black holes and mitochondria and ion fluxes across neuronal membranes. It's not working. They dream of shackling dinosaurs to help them popularize creationist apologetics, but it only works if the people don't look too closely, don't get so enthralled with the gimmick that they look more deeply at the evidence than at the faith message, and discover that the creationists are lying to them. They are lost because they are praising the evidence of the natural world rather than the unfounded revelations of spiritual guesswork, and at some point, some people are going to notice the bait-and-switch of using dinosaurs to sell god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least some people are noticing, though. The Wall Street Journal commissioned Karen Armstrong and Richard Dawkins to answer the same question: &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,4293,Karen-Armstrong-says-we-need-God-to-grasp-the-wonder-of-our-existence,Wall-Street-Journal"&gt;Where does evolution leave God?&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574405030643556324.html#U10156404922R1E"&gt;Richard Dawkins slams that one out of the park&lt;/a&gt;. Evolution leaves the gods nowhere, with nothing to do. The world trundles along on the laws of physics, with never a violation in sight, and god has become a cosmic irrelevancy, and worse, a boojum that defies reason and evidence. We have no need of that hypothesis, and it is nothing more than an obstacle to comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574405030643556324.html"&gt;Karen Armstrong takes a different tack&lt;/a&gt;. She has noticed that religion has been busily undermining itself by coupling faith to fact. When theologians accept the explanations of science and try to absorb them into their religious understanding, they are binding their notion of god to a rather more limited body of abilities; now God's actions are suddenly constrained by E=MC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Not that they would say such a thing, of course; God is omnipotent, so he can break all the speed limits if he wanted to, he just chooses not to. She admits that Darwin has created a crisis for religious thought because "Christians [had] become so dependent upon their scientific religion that they had lost the older habits of thought and were left without other resource."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For once, I agree with Armstrong. She&amp;#39;s precisely correct — rational thinking, evidence-based reasoning, and science in general are inimical to the spiritual state of mind, and draw us away from superstition and other failed modes of thinking. What has occurred over the course of the last few centuries is a growing (but by no means universal or certain) recognition that science gets the job done, while religion makes excuses. Sometimes they are very pretty excuses that capture the imagination of the public, but ultimately, when you want to win a war or heal a dying child or get rich from a discovery or explore Antarctica, you turn to science and reason, or you fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're one of these New Atheists, the lesson is obvious: ditch the useless faith, and follow science. But then, we're the results-oriented children of the Enlightenment, so &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; we prefer to do what actually works. If you're a die-hard faith-head like Karen Armstrong, though, you instead turn to that religious style of thinking, and make &lt;i&gt;excuses&lt;/i&gt; for happily following the path of failure and nebulous, airy-fairy know-nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Darwin may have done religion--and God--a favor by revealing a flaw in modern Western faith. Despite our scientific and technological brilliance, our understanding of God is often remarkably undeveloped--even primitive. In the past, many of the most influential Jewish, Christian and Muslim thinkers understood that what we call "God" is merely a symbol that points beyond itself to an indescribable transcendence, whose existence cannot be proved but is only intuited by means of spiritual exercises and a compassionate lifestyle that enable us to cultivate new capacities of mind and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neat trick, that; she takes the notion of a worldly god, one tied to the operation of the world, and calls that "primitive", while suggesting that a god that is a symbol, a transcendence, a spiritual (whatever that word means) intuition, is somehow the more sophisticated god. As &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574405030643556324.html#U10156404922R1E"&gt;Dawkins explains&lt;/a&gt;, mere existence and effect are trifles with which a truly awesome god does not trouble himself. Armstrong carries it even further: her god is a sublime state which we can only appreciate by contemplating the pain and suffering of life and distancing ourselves from it — god seems to be that which we get when we reject the universe. She even asserts that religion explains nothing, as if this were a positive attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religion was not supposed to provide explanations that lay within the competence of reason but to help us live creatively with realities for which there are no easy solutions and find an interior haven of peace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorter Karen Armstrong: Ignorance is bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want to live peacefully with difficult realities, and I see no virtue in savoring excuses for avoiding a search for real answers. I am the product of millions of generations of individuals who each fought against a hostile universe and won, and I aim to maintain the tradition. I want my children to do the same, and I want all of my fellow human beings to struggle to wrest a better world from the rocks and gasses and radiation of this universe we find ourselves in. There are no easy solutions. Each of us can think of a thousand thorny problems, from the personal to the global, and we all know this: we will not solve them by going to church and kneeling down and praising an immaterial god whose primary attribute in the sloganeering of theologians like Armstrong is that he is a symbol of that which doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my conversation last night, my friend reminded me of a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche that is appropriate here: "Mystical explanations are thought to be deep; the truth is that they are not even shallow." Let's work to spare humankind from further further religious 'thought', that shallow pretentiousness with delusions of profundity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on Monday I take the plunge: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/08/my-secret-nefarious-inky-plan-revealed/"&gt;I’ll be getting my tattoo&lt;/a&gt;. The design is pretty much set, the body part has been prepped, and my appointment is on the docket. The terror and panic I felt yesterday has mostly subsided, and I’m ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except… I’m not sure what to do beforehand. I’ll be in a hotel the night before. I’ll get up, have a normal breakfast, get coffee, the usual. But I wonder. Should I go to the hotel exercise room and do a few bicep blasts so that my arms will look good in pictures? Or will that stretch the skin too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And do I need any special food? Orange juice, ginger ale, water? What about acetaminophen or ibuprofen? I know aspirin is a bad idea, but FSM, who uses aspirin anymore? Being a wuss, I worry a bit about how much this will hurt — it’s on my upper arm, which I’m told isn’t too bad, but the whole thing will be about 5×8 cm, an alarming amount of surface area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of BABloggees have tats. What’s your advice? Warning: anyone suggesting anything alt-med will be forced to take 100,000 doses of 30C gingko. And acupuncture jokes? Too obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome: Armstrong handily k.o.’ed  But that’s nothing new.  If you want a good take (and a good laugh) on “sophisticated” modern theology — and on its contrast with clear, empirically-based thinking — have a look.  You’ll be emboldened in your rationalism, but also curious about why Armstrong keeps finding places that will publish her repetitive nonsense. If this is the best that accommodationism can produce, WE WIN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religion was not supposed to provide explanations that lay within the competence of reason but to help us live creatively with realities for which there are no easy solutions and find an interior haven of peace; today, however, many have opted for unsustainable certainty instead. But can we respond religiously to evolutionary theory? Can we use it to recover a more authentic notion of God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin made it clear once again that—as Maimonides, Avicenna, Aquinas and Eckhart had already pointed out—we cannot regard God simply as a divine personality, who single-handedly created the world. This could direct our attention away from the idols of certainty and back to the “God beyond God.” The best theology is a spiritual exercise, akin to poetry. Religion is not an exact science but a kind of art form that, like music or painting, introduces us to a mode of knowledge that is different from the purely rational and which cannot easily be put into words. At its best, it holds us in an attitude of wonder, which is, perhaps, not unlike the awe that Mr. Dawkins experiences—and has helped me to appreciate —when he contemplates the marvels of natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what of the pain and waste that Darwin unveiled? All the major traditions insist that the faithful meditate on the ubiquitous suffering that is an inescapable part of life; because, if we do not acknowledge this uncomfortable fact, the compassion that lies at the heart of faith is impossible. The almost unbearable spectacle of the myriad species passing painfully into oblivion is not unlike some classic Buddhist meditations on the First Noble Truth (”Existence is suffering”), the indispensable prerequisite for the transcendent enlightenment that some call Nirvana—and others call God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwinian evolution is the only process we know that is ultimately capable of generating anything as complicated as creative intelligences. Once it has done so, of course, those intelligences can create other complex things: works of art and music, advanced technology, computers, the Internet and who knows what in the future? Darwinian evolution may not be the only such generative process in the universe. There may be other “cranes” (Daniel Dennett’s term, which he opposes to “skyhooks”) that we have not yet discovered or imagined. But, however wonderful and however different from Darwinian evolution those putative cranes may be, they cannot be magic. They will share with Darwinian evolution the facility to raise up complexity, as an emergent property, out of simplicity, while never violating natural law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does that leave God? The kindest thing to say is that it leaves him with nothing to do, and no achievements that might attract our praise, our worship or our fear. Evolution is God’s redundancy notice, his pink slip. But we have to go further. A complex creative intelligence with nothing to do is not just redundant. A divine designer is all but ruled out by the consideration that he must at least as complex as the entities he was wheeled out to explain. God is not dead. He was never alive in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is a certain class of sophisticated modern theologian who will say something like this: “Good heavens, of course we are not so naive or simplistic as to care whether God exists. Existence is such a 19th-century preoccupation! It doesn’t matter whether God exists in a scientific sense. What matters is whether he exists for you or for me. If God is real for you, who cares whether science has made him redundant? Such arrogance! Such elitism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if that’s what floats your canoe, you’ll be paddling it up a very lonely creek. The mainstream belief of the world’s peoples is very clear. They believe in God, and that means they believe he exists in objective reality, just as surely as the Rock of Gibraltar exists. If sophisticated theologians or postmodern relativists think they are rescuing God from the redundancy scrap-heap by downplaying the importance of existence, they should think again. Tell the congregation of a church or mosque that existence is too vulgar an attribute to fasten onto their God, and they will brand you an atheist. They’ll be right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the juicy takedown of Armstrong in Dawkins’s last two paragraphs!  No matter how sophisticated modern theologians like Armstrong, Eagleton, and Haught consider themselves, they are always too removed from the world to understand what “religion” means to most people.

&lt;p&gt;The Cat of the Week, Mr. Darcy, belongs to one of our posters, Matthew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Darcy was a stray who lived in our back yard. We left food out for him and he eventually took to staring patiently in at us from the back door. After a very cold winter we arranged to have him snipped so that we could take him to a rehoming shelter. One of the landlords didn’t want a third cat in the house, but after a week indoors recovering from his operation, much to my delight, he became a full member of the household. I think he was very appreciative of his improved living arrangements (as you can see, we fed him well). Unfortunately, as a stray he must have got into some fights and, after two years with us, he became ill and succumbed to FIV. He was a very gentle cat and extremely loyal. He is much missed, but I’m very glad we got the chance to give him a good life for those two years and a much more peaceful end than he would have found outdoors. He certainly left his mark on those of us who loved him. I think this should serve as encouragement to those lookng for a cat to check their local shelters first. A genuine cat lover should find the thought of a homeless cat heart-breaking and knowing a cat is a rescue can add something special to the bond between owner and human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for his name, well, it’s not from D’Arcy Thompson.  Think &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was called Mr. Darcy for two reasons. He used to stare at Peanut, a chocolate Burmese and one of the female cats in the house, but held off on courting her aggressively. There was a veneer of disdain on her part, but we suspected she was interested. Secondly, we always thought he looked very gentlemanly, especially with his impressive jowls and chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="Mr. Darcy0" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/mr-darcy01.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="Mr. Darcy0" width="500" height="666"&gt;Fig. 1.  The late Mr. Darcy.  Un matou formidable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="Darcy and Perrin25" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/darcy-and-perrin25.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="Darcy and Perrin25" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Fig. 2.  Darcy and his friend Perrin, “a troublesome&lt;br&gt;
Tonkinese who Mr. Darcy helped calm down somewhat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Up second is an unknown marbled tabby who visited reader Aaron this week.  It has one of the prettiest coats I’ve seen.  Aaron notes, “I don’t know much about it except that it was friendly and well taken care of.  (If it had been a stray we probably would have adopted it, which might not have gone over well with our current cat.)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;img title="tabby" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/tabby.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=353" alt="tabby" width="500" height="353"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Fig. 3.  Unknown but elegant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Finally, from substitute-blogger Greg Mayer, an article from &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/realestate/13habi.html?hpw"&gt;yesterday’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Meow Spoken Here,” about New Yorker Tammy Cross and her kitten-rescuing operation, which she runs out of her apartment on the West Side. Cross is decidedly not a crazy cat lady, and it’s a nice read.  If you’re an ailurophile, you’ll want to watch the audio slide show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mac.com/arnold_zwicky/ZippyWhatever.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://web.mac.com/arnold_zwicky/ZippyWhatever.gif" alt="" width="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Valley in question is the San Fernando Valley of southern California, home of Valspeak, a sociolect made famous by the 1982 Frank Zappa song "Valley Girl" (as performed by his daughter Moon Unit Zappa) and the 1983 movie based on it. The song is packed with linguistic features that are (or have become) stereotypes of the variety (especially as used by affluent upper-middle-class young women), but &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; isn't in the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In fact, &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; has come to be seen as a mark of disaffected young people all over the U.S., conveying apathy, dismissiveness, and a variety of related attitudes (lack of commitment, refusal to make discriminations, and so on) that draw scorn from all sorts of sources. Predictably, some of these sources grossly exaggerate the prevalence of &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt;, as in this Urban Dictionary entry from 2003:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word all too often used by Americans to connotate a feeling of apathy. The fact that it's used in almost every sentence is not as alarming to many as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language Log has looked at &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; as a symptom of what&amp;#39;s wrong with young people — &amp;quot;whateverist nomads&amp;quot; — these days: first in a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=44"&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt; by Geoff Pullum of Naomi Baron's alarmist outcries about the dire effects of cellphones, texting, and the like; then in light-hearted follow-ups by &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=56"&gt;Roger Shuy&lt;/a&gt; (it's not electronic media that are at fault, but crossword puzzles) and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=75"&gt;Mark Liberman&lt;/a&gt; (in the comics: is youth slang the death of us?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Ben Zimmer notes an earlier Language Log &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004781.html"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; — Mark Liberman on &lt;em&gt;wev&lt;/em&gt; as a short version of it.]&lt;/p&gt;

Cell phones are a classic example where electrical engineers and designers are constantly working to put a whole lot more into ever smaller spaces. And now that cameras are almost as standard a feature in these devices as the ring tone, optical engineers must also devise increasingly clever ways to shrink the optics while improving their performance.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From the next room, I heard Delaney (7) sharing a conversation she had with a friend at school. “I told her I didn’t really believe in God, but I was still thinking about it. She said she didn’t know anybody else who…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lane…” Connor said, then sighed with exaggerated patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stopped. “What?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Lane, you really shouldn’t talk about religion at school.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why not? It’s interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You shouldn’t talk about it because you gain nothing and it gets all your friends to hate you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nuh uhh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes. It does, Lane.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took every bit of my strength to stay in my chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had at least three reasons to be concerned about this…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dale talked to his children about this to get more information and it turns out there is a bit more to this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral is clear, though: Children should be open to discussing their religious beliefs.  The more they do that, the more comfortable they become about the subject.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more children did this, maybe we’d see a future in which criticism of religion isn’t such a problem.  Religion needs to become like politics in this way — a topic we don’t shy away from debating and discussing with friends, family, and even colleagues.  The less taboo around the subject, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

The circumstances pointed to suicide (though some disputed this). He was found dead with a part-eaten apple, laced it seems with cyanide. The choice of an apple may be significant, as it has been claimed that his favourite fairy-tale was Snow White.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alan Turing's death in turn has become significant. In essence: he died because he was a homosexual; he died because of the vile laws against male homosexuality which were then in force; and he died because of the misconceived "treatment" which was then deemed appropriate (by some scientists and medical doctors, sadly) for the "illness" of homosexuality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1952 Turing reported a burglary. In the investigation and case which followed the police became aware that Alan Turing had homosexual relationships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technically, homosexuality was not directly a crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buggery was a crime, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act (which is still actually in force for Grievous Bodily Harm, Actual Bodily Harm and - oddly - Bigamy, which the law also regards as an offence against the person). But few men were actually tried for or convicted of the crime of buggery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And "gross indecency" was a crime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turing was prosecuted under the notorious &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labouchere_Amendment"&gt; section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885&lt;/a&gt;. This was the same offence under which Oscar Wilde was tried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under section 11, an offence of "gross indecency" could be committed by two &lt;em&gt;male&lt;/em&gt; persons, either in public &lt;em&gt;or in private&lt;/em&gt;. This was taken to mean by the police and the courts to mean all consensual intimate sexual behaviour between men. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Section 11 was not a deeply considered piece of legislation; indeed its enactment was almost an accident. In one late parliamentary sitting, a (so-called radical) MP proposed an amendment which was accepted almost on the nod by the frontbench. There was no debate, either in parliament or otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, section 11 would criminalise all meaningful male homosexual intimacy for eighty years. Rather than the remote threat of a prosecution under the buggery offence, any evidence or admission of physical closeness - even in private - would lead to prosecution, a sentence, and a criminal record. It was regarded as the "blackmailer's charter".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alan Turing was charged; he admitted his guilt and was convicted. Instead of imprisonment, he was able to opt for "treatment". He was given hormones to suppress his libido; the side effects were breast development and depression. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In effect, Alan Turing was chemically castrated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alan Turing was a hero and a genius, but this "treatment" was also inflicted on many other gay men prosecuted under this legislation. Turing's awesome achievements do not by themselves warrant him receiving an apology for this shameful official conduct; there should be an apology for every gay man who was prosecuted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of them deserved better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was good that the person who wrote Gordon Brown's &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/gordon-brown/6170112/Gordon-Brown-Im-proud-to-say-sorry-to-a-real-war-hero.html"&gt; apology&lt;/a&gt; noted this, though only in passing: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time, and we can't put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair, and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him. Alan and &lt;strong&gt;the many thousands of other gay men who were convicted&lt;/strong&gt;, as he was convicted, under homophobic laws, were treated terribly. Over the years, millions more lived in fear in conviction."&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;[Emphasis added - and note how &lt;em&gt;Turing&lt;/em&gt; becomes &lt;em&gt;Alan&lt;/em&gt; in two sentences!]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, a posthumous apology or pardon is always a mere gesture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, the greatness of Turing - and the undeniable sheer importance of his work in the war and in computers and the appalling injustice done to him - must force anyone to reconsider using the law to criminalise homosexuality, or to regard homosexuality as to be treated as an illness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Such people still exist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Prime Minister's apology - an official acknowledgement of official wrongdoing - makes it just that more difficult for such bigots to prevail again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The apology also reminds us just how recent "modern" times are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-3974483131105228654?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252749607689"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/clock_quotes_411.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6ef5576a25503f08</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-09-12T08:54:50Z</published><updated>2009-09-12T08:54:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/n-eameaiH_c/clock_quotes_411.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/clock_quotes_411.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a matter of principle, I never attend the first annual anything. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The last two paragraphs of the last post are quoteworthy.  Referring to children with their families he saw in the museum, Dan writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of those kids will be stuck in that world for their entire lives. They’ll be raised that way and protected from any alternate viewpoints or ideas. They’ll be shuttered away from any kind of real, intellectually challenging science. They’ll be constantly given misleading or incorrect information about our world. Their parents will steep them in dogma, ritual, and ancient scripture for as long as they can manage… and the Creation Museum will be right there to back them up with pretty lights, bells, and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum is loathsome and its creators should be very, very ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they aren’t, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, maybe 30% for the headline -- this is also just freaky natural history. A paper in Biology Letters reports that great tits (Parus major -- basically big chickadees) will hunt and eat hibernating bats [$-a] if they can&amp;#39;t find other food sources.

The paper reports on ten years of recorded bat-eating by a population of great tits in Hungary, capped by two years of systematic observations and a couple simple experiments. Are the tits hunting bats because other food is scarce? The authors put out birdseed and bacon near the bat cave, and observed that the birds killed many fewer bats. Do the tits use audio cues to find their prey? The authors played a tape recording of bats calling, and watched as the birds oriented to the sound and approached the speaker. There are also a number of grisly photos of tit-killed bats.

This is really the kind of work that attracts most field biologists to science in the first place -- a wild, interesting observation that provides an excuse to do some really unusual (and thorough) birdwatching. More complicated science will follow, I hope, like an estimate of the selective advantage this new food source provides to the birds. But it all starts with an incredible story.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/09/08/parasitesradiolab/"&gt;Monday&lt;/a&gt; brought Radio Lab’s great take on parasites, which I was thrilled to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/09/08/faust-and-the-dandelion/"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; was newspaper day, with a story in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; on the evolution of flowers. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/09/10/desire-in-slow-motion/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/09/10/desire-in-slow-motion/"&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; it was the sexual brain, the subject of my latest column in &lt;em&gt;Discover&lt;/em&gt; complete with a safe-for-work video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/09/10/your-dog-yourself/"&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt; brought the new issue of &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; to the newsstands, with an article of mine on the minds of dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at the close of the week, let me lure you into a different dimension of the media: &lt;a href="http://microbeworld.org/mts"&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Society of Microbiology has asked me to take over a biweekly podcast of theirs called “Meet the Scientist.” In each episode I’ll be talking with one of the many scientists who explore biology’s vast invisible world.  For my first podcast, I spoke to Michael Cunliffe, one of the scientists I wrote about recently who studies &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/27/the-oceans-skin-of-jelly/"&gt;the ocean’s skin of jelly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that new generations have no idea who he was, or what a "mystifier" is. Actually, I don't think anyone knows what a "mystifier" is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while Uri's star may be setting below the horizon, it's actually important to remember him because his story teaches us lessons. One man can fool millions into believing he has supernatural powers, unless he's tested under controlled conditions. And when a man refuses to be tested under proper conditions, well, that can tell us something too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006941" title=""&gt;Major Role of Microbes in Carbon Fluxes during Austral Winter in the Southern Drake Passage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Carbon cycling in Southern Ocean is a major issue in climate change, hence the need to understand the role of biota in the regulation of carbon fixation and cycling. Southern Ocean is a heterogeneous system, characterized by a strong seasonality, due to long dark winter. Yet, currently little is known about biogeochemical dynamics during this season, particularly in the deeper part of the ocean. We studied bacterial communities and processes in summer and winter cruises in the southern Drake Passage. Here we show that in winter, when the primary production is greatly reduced, Bacteria and Archaea become the major producers of biogenic particles, at the expense of dissolved organic carbon drawdown. Heterotrophic production and chemoautotrophic CO2 fixation rates were substantial, also in deep water, and bacterial populations were controlled by protists and viruses. A dynamic food web is also consistent with the observed temporal and spatial variations in archaeal and bacterial communities that might exploit various niches. Thus, Southern Ocean microbial loop may substantially maintain a wintertime food web and system respiration at the expense of summer produced DOC as well as regenerate nutrients and iron. Our findings have important implications for Southern Ocean ecosystem functioning and carbon cycle and its manipulation by iron enrichment to achieve net sequestration of atmospheric CO2.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007005" title=""&gt;Does the Order of Invasive Species Removal Matter? The Case of the Eagle and the Pig&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Invasive species are recognized as a primary driver of native species endangerment and their removal is often a key component of a conservation strategy. Removing invasive species is not always a straightforward task, however, especially when they interact with other species in complex ways to negatively influence native species. Because unintended consequences may arise if all invasive species cannot be removed simultaneously, the order of their removal is of paramount importance to ecological restoration. In the mid-1990s, three subspecies of the island fox Urocyon littoralis were driven to near extinction on the northern California Channel Islands owing to heightened predation by golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos. Eagles were lured to the islands by an abundant supply of feral pigs Sus scrofa and through the process of apparent competition pigs indirectly facilitated the decline in foxes. As a consequence, both pigs and eagles had to be removed to recover the critically endangered fox. Complete removal of pigs was problematic: removing pigs first could force eagles to concentrate on the remaining foxes, increasing their probability of extinction. Removing eagles first was difficult: eagles are not easily captured and lethal removal was politically distasteful. Using prey remains collected from eagle nests both before and after the eradication of pigs, we show that one pair of eagles that eluded capture did indeed focus more on foxes. These results support the premise that if the threat of eagle predation had not been mitigated prior to pig removal, fox extinction would have been a more likely outcome. If complete eradication of all interacting invasive species is not possible, the order in which they are removed requires careful consideration. If overlooked, unexpected consequences may result that could impede restoration.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_193.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/g6_r_6e0ZIY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252714484388"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25805659.post-4144455376766307561">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5a7d6da57ea48bec</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="homeopathy" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="World Health organisation" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="WHO" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Homeopathy: A Warning from Africa</title><published>2009-09-11T23:46:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T23:46:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/09/homeopathy-warning-from-africa.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Le Canard Noir)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/rss.xml</id><title type="html">the quackometer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252713376302"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=15968">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/accf1adafbfe67cd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">The Great Atheist Cookie Recipe Search</title><published>2009-09-11T23:00:51Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T23:00:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/11/the-great-atheist-cookie-recipe-search/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’d never heard of Resurrection Cookies… but Christians are supposed to make them with their children, explaining the Bible along the way:&lt;/p&gt;

1.  Preheat oven to 300 F. Place pecans in zipper baggie and let children beat them with the wooden spoon to break into small pieces. Explain that after Jesus was arrested he was beaten by the Roman soldiers. Read &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+19%3A1-3&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;John 19:1-3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Chambers told BBC Jersey: "When we emptied the fish bag out there at the bottom was this incredibly ugly looking isopod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn't really go extinct, because in 1984 one was caught on Gua, photographed, and set free.  Subsequently, possible Fiji petrel sightings have occurred now and then, mostly of disoriented or lost immature birds that showed up in one village or another.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as you can see, calling this bird truly extinct was never really appropriate, but it was listed as one of nearly 200 birds that may or may not have been extinct at any given moment, with a very small hope returning every now and then wiht a possible or confirmed sighting.  But then scientists went out and got serious bout finding some Fiji petrels and assessing their status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did this by setting up a lure consisting of 10 kilogram blocks of fish guts mixed with concentrated fish oil.  This substance can be smelled by a petrel from half way around the planet.  Well, not really but from very far away.  Sure enough, on day two of the experiment, a Fiji petrel showed up to inspect one of the blocks which was floating around int he water.  Over the next eleven days eight different individuals were observed.  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/Entertainment/2009/07/14/creation250.jpg" alt="" style="float:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;  The new movie &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://creationthemovie.com" rel="external "&gt;movie website, Adobe Flash 10 required&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974014/" rel="external "&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1205717/#" rel="external "&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;), a British drama about of key moments in Darwin’s professional and personal life, &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE58A10K20090911" rel="external "&gt;just opened at the Toronto Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; and will soon be released in the UK.  NCSE staff were invited to a pre-screening of the movie. Genie Scott’s review and commentary are below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Roger Ebert has &lt;a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/09/tiff_4_darwin_walks_out_on_gen.html" rel="external "&gt;posted some comments on his online journal&lt;/a&gt; (and I guess he’s quite the Darwin fan!).  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I and NCSE staff were invited to view the new Jon Amiel movie, &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt;, starring Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connolly. I believe it to be a thoughtful, well-made film that will change many views of Darwin held by the public—for the good. The acting is strong, the visuals are wonderful, and it treats with loving care the Victorian details of the furnishings at Down house and other sites (such as Malvern), and the local church. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie takes place after Darwin has returned from the &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; voyage, and has settled down with his wife, Emma. It concentrates on their relationship, on the growth of their family, and of course, on the production of his most famous scientific work, &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;. It looks hard at Darwin’s growing disenchantment with Christianity, especially the concept of Providence, and how poorly it fits Darwin the naturalist’s knowledge of a very unpeaceable kingdom. Darwin’s frequent illness is portrayed with brutal honesty. Sometimes pale, nauseated, unable even to eat dinner with his family, much less work on his science, Darwin is shown suffering from vague symptoms which he attempts to cure with what we would recognize as quack treatments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A centerpiece of the movie is the death of Annie, the Darwins’ beloved 10 year old daughter, and how it affected the relationship of Charles and Emma. Much of the movie takes place as flashbacks to when Annie was alive; much takes place after her death, when her father imagines conversations with her. In some reviews the later Annie is described as a ghost. Not really. &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; is not a ghost story. Rather, the filmmakers are taking dramatic license to make Darwin’s thoughts about her visible to us.  Also given much attention is Darwin’s reluctance to set down his scientific ideas on evolution and natural selection for fear of upsetting the devout Emma, and society in general. Huxley and Hooker encourage him to publish, but Darwin procrastinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone with a stake in how the public understands evolution and it’s most famous proponent, the bottom line for me was that the science be presented accurately. The second was that the story of Darwin’s life be presented accurately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no problems with the former: natural selection and evolution (common descent, expressed in the movie by the tree of life metaphor) are both presented accurately, and although the movie does not dwell a great deal on the actual science, the importance of science to Darwin was apparent. Darwin was accurately presented as a curious naturalist (engaging his kids in natural history—geology, beetles, nature walks—even scientifically studying his baby! etc). Darwin is seen as a careful scientist—lots of microscope work, lots of careful record-keeping of pigeons, barnacles, etc. It is also clear—which is historically accurate—that Darwin was held in high regard as a scientist by his colleagues. The scientific part was fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about the historical part? I have just read &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Annies-Box-Charles-Daughter-Evolution/dp/1841150606/" rel="external "&gt;Randal Keynes’s &lt;em&gt;Annie’s Box&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the book upon which the movie is based, refreshing my memory on the details of the period of Darwin’s life covered by the movie. Plus I already know a bit about Darwin’s time, given my odd line of work, and my former career as a university professor teaching evolution. I am satisfied with the historical presentation, though not fully in agreement with all of it. But that’s OK. This isn’t a documentary about Darwin, it’s a movie about Darwin. And there’s a difference. With the latter, you don’t expect absolute fealty to the historical record—though you don’t have to—and shouldn’t—accept wholesale violations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could nitpick on historical details (Annie was not the eldest child; Darwin’s visits to Malvern are not in correct sequence; &lt;em&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; was his 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; book, not his first; historians legitimately debate how important Annie’s death was to Darwin’s rejection of Christianity) but it’s a movie, not a documentary. A movie, as opposed to a documentary, goes for the spirit, not the letter: you can’t get bent out of shape because timelines are changed. Movies operate on emotions—as Randy Olson says, movies aren’t about the head, but the heart, the gut, and the crotch. If you want a historical documentary, don’t go to movies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet much of &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt;‘s dialogue is taken directly from Darwin’s correspondence or that of his contemporaries.  There is a TON of real history here: I loved the depiction of the quack water cures at Malvern, and Darwin did indeed have his servants build a water tower for him at Down so that he could “take the cure” between visits to the spa. The presentation of his relationship with Hooker, Darwin’s closest friend, who was adored by the Darwin children, was accurate and excellent. BTW, the actor playing Hooker was superb, and the physical likeness is startling. The physical likeness of the actor playing Huxley—less so, but the Bulldog’s pugnacious spirit certainly is well-done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all but a tiny percentage of the people who will watch this movie will know far less about Darwin than I know—or that most of the PT readers know. Most of the people watching the movie think of Darwin as a cardboard figure—especially the stern, elderly Victorian guy with a long white beard in the black coat. They aren’t going to think about Darwin as a tall and vigorous man very much devoted to his pretty wife, with a houseful of noisy children who adored him.  In my experience, much of the public, following the &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt;ists, thinks he wrote one not-very-good book, and is unaware that Darwin devoted his life to science, conducting experiments and making observations and being held in high regard by his contemporaries. In particular, Darwin as a passionate, loving human being is far from how most Americans picture him. And that’s too bad, because cardboard cutouts aren’t real—and the real is so much more interesting. I like to think that someone seeing this movie will be stimulated to read one of the many biographies found on the movie’s excellent website (&lt;a href="http://www.creationthemovie.com" rel="external "&gt;www.creationthemovie.com&lt;/a&gt;), or otherwise easily accessible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; is first and foremost a movie about the relationship between Charles and Emma. The actors, married in real life, and themselves parents, do an excellent job portraying the range of emotions that must have been part of the Darwins’ life together—from tenderness as they hold their baby Annie, through their shared grief over her death, to the tension over their different attitudes towards religion, and other aspects of their relationship. Darwin wrote several times about his concern that the death(s) of his children (two died in addition to Annie, alas) was the result of the close familial relationship shared by him and his cousin, Emma. As a breeder of pigeons and livestock, he knew that close inbreeding could bring out “weaknesses”, even if he didn’t understand particulate inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles feared that Annie’s painful, lingering illness and death was his fault—that she had inherited what he considered a disposition to bad digestion. In one especially poignant scene in a tavern, Darwin is told about the successes of a pigeon breeder who can produce new traits “in four generations!” He does it, of course, through close inbreeding, noting that, of course, there is higher mortality. When the cheerful tradesman comments with a hearty laugh, “A wealthy gentleman like yourself, sir, can certainly afford to lose a couple of chicks!” It’s understandable that Darwin struggles to maintain composure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene where Charles years later sobs as he visits the room where Annie died should touch anyone watching the movie. Keynes talks about Darwin sometimes feeling he was neglecting his other children during Annie’s sickness and after her death, and his “return” to them as their loving father is handled in the movie with great tenderness. And indeed, Annie’s death did strain the marriage of Emma and Charles, though it also brought them closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By telling an interesting story, and making Darwin human, &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; will I think encourage some viewers to find out more about the historical Darwin and his ideas. From my standpoint as director of NCSE, that’s useful, indeed. The more people know about evolution and its most famous proponent, the less they will fear it. I’d like to see this movie get distributed in the US. Unfortunately, although Canadians and British will see it, there is not yet a US distributor. We can only speculate why, but the well-known American nervousness about evolution is probably and unfortunately part of the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie deserves to be seen in movies, not relegated merely to Netflix on DVD. I hope the reviews following the North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10 are good, and also the reviews following the British premiere October 25. If a bomb like &lt;em&gt;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&lt;/em&gt; can get a distributor, a well-made movie with an excellent script, actors, direction, and cinematography like &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; surely should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe people who care about science should do what the promoters of &lt;em&gt;Expelled&lt;/em&gt; did: get lots of people to show up on opening weekend to give the movie a big ratings boost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it has to get a distributor first, and there isn’t a lot we can do about that. If anyone has contacts with someone associated with movie distribution, send them to &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more bizarre and unpleasant “CAM” claims, but one taken very seriously at the NIH, at Columbia University, and on Capitol Hill, is the cancer “detoxification” &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/CPMC-IRB-8544#Outline_CDR0000067012"&gt;regimen&lt;/a&gt; advocated by Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients receive pancreatic enzymes orally every 4 hours and at meals daily on days 1-16, followed by 5 days of rest. Patients receive magnesium citrate and Papaya Plus with the pancreatic enzymes. Additionally, patients receive nutritional supplementation with vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and animal glandular products 4 times per day on days 1-16, followed by 5 days of rest. Courses repeat every 21 days until death despite relapse. Patients consume a moderate vegetarian metabolizer diet during the course of therapy, which excludes red meat, poultry, and white sugar. Coffee enemas are performed twice a day, along with skin brushing daily, skin cleansing once a week with castor oil during the first 6 months of therapy, and a salt and soda bath each week. Patients also undergo a complete liver flush and a clean sweep and purge on a rotating basis each month during the 5 days of rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veteran SBM readers will recall that in the spring of 2008 I posted a series of essays* about this regimen and about the trial that compared it to standard treatment for subjects with cancer of the pancreas. The NIH had funded the trial, to be conducted under the auspices of Columbia, after &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=92"&gt;arm-twisting&lt;/a&gt; by Rep. Dan Burton [R-IN], a powerful champion of quackery, and much to the delight of the “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=86"&gt;Harkinites&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2008 I posted an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=298"&gt;addendum &lt;/a&gt;based on a little-known &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/YR08/jun08a.pdf"&gt;determination letter&lt;/a&gt; that the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) had sent to Columbia during the previous June. The letter revealed that the trial had been terminated in October, 2005, due to “pre-determined stopping criteria.” This demonstrated that Gonzalez’s regimen must have been found to be substantially worse than the current standard of care for cancer of the pancreas, as ineffective as that standard may be. I urge readers who require a review or an introduction to the topic to read that posting, which also considered why no formal report of the trial had yet been made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, finally, the formal report has been published online by the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Oncology &lt;/em&gt;(JCO):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pancreatic Proteolytic Enzyme Therapy Compared With Gemcitabine-Based Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John A. Chabot, Wei-Yann Tsai, Robert L. Fine, Chunxia Chen, Carolyn K. Kumah, Karen A. Antman, and Victor R. Grann&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JCO Early Release, published online ahead of print Aug. 17, 2009. Journal of Clinical Oncology, 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.8429&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Results of the Gonzalez Trial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract can be read &lt;a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/JCO.2009.22.8429v1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. First, the punch line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Among patients who have pancreatic cancer, those who chose gemcitabine-based chemotherapy survived more than three times as long (14.0 v 4.3 months) and had better quality of life than those who chose proteolytic enzyme [Gonzalez's] treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the article proper,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Twelve months after enrollment, 56% of chemotherapy-group patients were alive; 16% of the enzyme-group patients were alive. The longest survivors were one chemotherapy-group patient who died at 39.5 months and one chemotherapy-group patient who was censored at 37.5 months (ie, the closing date of the data analysis) and, at the time of manuscript submission, was still alive at 40 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The Gonzalez regimen was not only much worse than standard treatment in this study; it was also substantially worse than the experience of more than 20,000 comparable patients in the US between 1988 and 2001, as &lt;a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/publications/survival/surv_pancreas.pdf"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (&lt;a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/index.html"&gt;SEER&lt;/a&gt;) Program of the National Cancer Institute. This is illustrated in a self-explanatory figure from the &lt;em&gt;JCO&lt;/em&gt; paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="Snapshot 2009-09-11 16-16-15" src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Snapshot-2009-09-11-16-16-153.jpg" alt="Snapshot 2009-09-11 16-16-15" width="382" height="329"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The Columbia trial also looked at ’quality of life’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;In this study, patients in the enzyme-treatment and chemotherapy groups had similar scores in quality of life at enrollment, but the enzyme group fared much worse than the gemcitabine group in the subsequent year…Pain levels appeared to diverge during the initial 6 months of the study and were more severe among the enzyme group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a slam-dunk condemnation of the Gonzalez regimen. For more than 20 years, Gonzalez &lt;a href="http://www.alternative-therapies.com/at/web_pdfs/gonzalez1.pdf"&gt;has claimed&lt;/a&gt; near-miraculous survival times—measured in years-to-decades, rather than in months—for patients with life-threatening cancer, including pancreatic cancer. His “&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10368805?ordinalpos=13&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;case series&lt;/a&gt;,” upon which the NIH’s decision to fund a large trial was purportedly based, had included 11 patients. According to the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/gonzalez/HealthProfessional/page6"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NCI):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators reported a median survival time of 17 months and a mean survival time of 25.2 months for these patients. Nine patients (82%) survived 1 year, five patients (45%) survived 2 years, and four patients (36%) survived 3 years. At the time the study was reported, two patients were alive: one who had survived 3 years, and one who had survived 4 years. The researchers concluded that the 1-year and 2-year survival percentages for this group of patients were superior to those observed for other U.S. patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (1-year survival, all stages = 25%; 2-year survival, all stages = 10%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have previously explained (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=78"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=92"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), as has Dr. Peter Moran (&lt;a href="http://www.users.on.net/~pmoran/cancer/Alternative_studies.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), why that case series was unreliable and was not a worthy basis for conducting a larger trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gonzalez has also &lt;a href="http://www.dr-gonzalez.com/clinical_pearls.htm"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that patients who use coffee enemas “report an increased sense of well being.” He reportedly told at least &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=97"&gt;one subject&lt;/a&gt; in the Columbia trial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;that pain might be an indication that the tumors were being dissolved, and that he could expect weight loss as he was detoxifying his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;JCO&lt;/em&gt; report soundly refutes Gonzalez’s claims. The treatment does not prolong the lives of patients with cancer of the pancreas; it substantially shortens their lives. It does not increase patients’ sense of well being; rather, it makes their quality of life “much worse.” The fate of the typical subject in the “enzyme” group appears to have been similar to that of a young man whose tragic story was told by his friend, Susan Gurney, and recounted &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=97"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this the last word on the Gonzalez regimen? Are there weaknesses in the study that might save it, at least for now? I raise this question for completeness’ sake only, for in my opinion there was never a justification for performing the trial. Nevertheless, I’ll mention the only obvious methodologic flaw: As &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=97"&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt;, the trial was not randomized because at its outset too few prospective subjects were willing to take a chance on not being in the “Gonzalez” group. Thus allocation to that group was chosen by the subjects themselves. They were compared to a cohort of patients who chose standard treatment. Although not randomly allocated, the subjects in the two groups were reported to be well matched:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-ﬁve patients, 23 on the control arm and 32 on the experimental arm, enrolled on the study and were available for analysis… The patients in both the control and experimental arms were carefully enrolled according to identical entry criteria. There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences at the time of enrollment in age, sex, weight, ECOG performance status, stage of disease, pathology, quality of life, or CA19-9. Bilirubin and albumen were signiﬁcantly higher in the chemotherapy group, but all values were clinically within normal limits and met eligibility criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All but two subjects in each group, moreover, were judged Grade 0 (”Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction”) or Grade 1 (”Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work”) by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group &lt;a href="http://ecog.dfci.harvard.edu/general/perf_stat.html"&gt;(&lt;/a&gt;ECOG) &lt;a href="http://ecog.dfci.harvard.edu/general/perf_stat.html"&gt;Performance Status&lt;/a&gt; assessment. This is important because, as I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=298"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last year, someone (probably Gonzalez or a surrogate) had complained to the OHRP that several subjects who would not be capable of adhering to the “enzyme” regimen had been enrolled in the trial (see points 5-7 in the &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/YR08/jun08a.pdf"&gt;OHRP letter)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of randomization (and blinding), then, seems insufficient to cast doubt on such a definitive outcome. It is likely, moreover, that any bias resulting from self-selection of subjects to the Gonzalez group would have skewed the results in favor of that regimen—the opposite of what was ultimately found. Gonzalez himself seemed to &lt;a href="http://www.cmbm.org/mind_body_medicine_RESEARCH/2000-Transcripts/12-NCI-Best-Case.pdf"&gt;realize this&lt;/a&gt; back in 2000, when the trial had barely begun:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DR. GONZALEZ: Interesting question. I didn’t have time to go into the details of how it was going. Initially, it was set up as a randomized trial about a year ago, and Jeff and I kind of struggled with that and I always knew there would be problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And—–going back to this gentleman’s question, I’m the first person on Earth to say that the belief system of the patient is really important in how they do. Randomized trial patients have no choice and the study was set up when my therapy was being compared to the best available chemotherapy for inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, patients know in this day and age chemotherapy is a death sentence for inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and our first study had already been published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a period of several months, Columbia got 200 phone calls. A hundred and ninety-seven patients, who would have been perhaps appropriate for the study, refused to enter unless they could be guaranteed my arm of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a randomized study is considered the gold standard and I felt we had to at least try. Dr. Klausner thought we had to try. Dr. White thought we had to try. After a year of trying that we all realized it wasn’t going to work that way, so we set it up as a case control where patients have choice. If they want chemo, they get chemo; if they want me, they get me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, their belief in chemo will be as strong as the patients’ belief in my therapy. We’re going to try and match them evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in terms of technical methodology it’s maybe a little less rigorous than a randomized study, but it’s raised all kinds of issues about how you test an alternative therapy where belief is important and a patient who doesn’t care whether they get chemo or my therapy for pancreatic cancer is going to be a very unusual patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who come to me usually believe in this. They would seek alternatives. By definition, they’re seeking something different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same conference, Gonzalez opined that in order to validate his regimen, the trial would eventually need to demonstrate outcomes virtually the inverse of what have now been reported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DR. GONZALEZ: It’s set up as a survival study. We’re looking at survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPEAKER: Do you have an idea of what you’re looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DR. GONZALEZ: Well, Jeff and I were just talking a couple weeks ago. You know, to get any kind of data that would be beyond criticism is—-always be criticism, but at least three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would want in the successful group to be three times — the median to be three times out from the lesser successful groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, if the average survival with chemo, which we suspect will be 5 months, you would want my therapy to be at least — the median survival to be at least 15, 16, 17 months, as it was in the pilot study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a median survival three times out from the chemo group to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save you the trouble of scrolling upward, let me repeat the &lt;em&gt;JCO&lt;/em&gt; report’s conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among patients who have pancreatic cancer, those who chose gemcitabine-based chemotherapy survived more than three times as long (14.0 v 4.3 months) and had better quality of life than those who chose proteolytic enzyme treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;There is More to This Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy that the results of the Gonzalez trial, such as they are, have finally been made public. Nevertheless, the report is full of troubling information, both stated and unstated. There is substantial evidence of ethical breaches, including some that might elude readers who are not familiar with the topic. A compelling argument can even be made that the &lt;em&gt;JCO&lt;/em&gt; should not have published the report—as paradoxical as that sounds. I’ve &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=97"&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt; several of these issues (also &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=104"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but the &lt;em&gt;JCO&lt;/em&gt; report demands that they be revisited. I’ll do that next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfian Sa'at's insights on the close relationships between what he correctly terms Southern Chinese languages (such as Hokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese) and Malay are very interesting. His observations on how there are almost no similar connections between Mandarin Chinese and Malay are quite thought provoking.  In other words, Alfian Sa'at is saying that Mandarin is a Johnny-Come-Lately to the region and that the inhabitants of Southeast Asia do not have any deep affinity for it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one example of the intricate linguistic interactions discussed by Alfian Sa'at, let us take the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian"&gt;durian&lt;/a&gt;.  (The first time I smelled the stench of this foul fruit permeating an entire, huge Hong Kong supermarket, I nearly vomited.  Never mind that some people consider the durian&amp;#39;s powerful odor to be fragrant, I find it to be overpoweringly repulsive and sickening — akin to a fetid, putrid petroleum sump full of dead rats.)  The name durian comes from the Malay word DURI (&amp;quot;thorn&amp;quot;) followed by the nominal suffix -AN.  This is a tropical plant, so the Chinese in their homeland would never have had a chance to see it before emigrating to Southeast Asia.  Hokkien speakers who encountered the fruit borrowed the name durian as LOOLIAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, European travellers brought the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soursop"&gt;soursop&lt;/a&gt; (a fruit indigenous to South America) with them to Southeast Asia.  Since it looked a bit like the durian (green with spiky exterior and custard yellow flesh), Hokkien speakers called it ANGMO LOOLIAN ("foreign durian").  Alfian Sa'at doesn't explain how ANGMO (also spelled ANGMOH) came to mean foreign, but I surmise that it is the same word as that pronounced HONG2MAO2 紅毛 in Mandarin, viz., "red hair."  This was an old word for the Dutch, who were among the first Europeans to engage extensively in trade in the Far East.  Later, ANGMO / HONG2MAO2 was used to refer to all Europeans and, by extension, anything novel or foreign that came from the West or was brought by Westerners (e.g., ANGMO KIO ["'Dutch' eggplant," i.e., "tomato"]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malay speakers, on the other hand, called this new fruit the DURIAN BELANDA (again, the "foreign durian").  It is noteworthy that the Malays, like the Hokkien, used a word referring to the Dutch (BELANDA = Holland) to signify things that were foreign (e.g., AYAM BELANDA ["'Dutch' chicken," i.e., "turkey"]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfian Sa'at provides numerous examples of the interpenetration of Malay on the one hand and the Southern Chinese languages on the other hand.  He laments the imposition of the locally deracinated Mandarin as the official standard for Chinese in Singapore (English is the main working language of the nation, while Malay and Tamil are spoken widely).   And I love it when Alfian Sa'at, in his ardent defense of the "Southern Chinese languages" spoken in Singapore declares:  "I refuse to call them 'dialects'."  That's telling it like it is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252699887334"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/11/starry-starry-fashion/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b64b8352bbad1fa6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Starry starry fashion</title><published>2009-09-11T20:00:07Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T20:00:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/11/starry-starry-fashion/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very excited to attend &lt;a href="http://necsscon.org/"&gt;NECSS&lt;/a&gt;, and I hope to see a lot of you there. The fun starts tonight at Drinking Skeptically, which I’m hoping to join as soon as my bus gets in around 10pm. The conference will go on all day tomorrow, and then you’ll all be able to go and get a bite to eat, and then start the partying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I’m having dinner in Hell’s Kitchen, I’d like to continue to drink around there. So, how about &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pony-bar-new-york"&gt;The Pony Bar&lt;/a&gt;? I’m amenable to moving around, and so if you want to hang out with me at any point but can’t find me, check my &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/rebeccawatson"&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll try to keep it up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday afternoon, there’s a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=137057507240"&gt;brunch hosted by the Jolly Thirteen Club&lt;/a&gt;! I’m going to try to make it there, and so you should, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things going on this weekend? Post in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, onto Comment o’ the Week! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to certain Dragon*Connery happening last week, I was sadly unable to post a Comment o’ the Week. The tragedy! I apologize profusely (but I’d do it again in a heartbeat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, then, I’m faced with an overwhelming amount of quality nominations.* Plus, there was an entire thread that really deserves it. That thread is under Sam’s post about the Chupacabras: &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/so-sad-when-superstars-get-old"&gt;So Sad When Superstars Get Old&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there were so many worthy posts, including (as Briarking noted), the first four, I’m going to reach into my hat and choose one at random. The winner is…&lt;/p&gt;

They are whining about a "government takeover" that will lead to rationing and death panels, but also about runaway costs.  Guess what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't have it both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just got off the phone with a Major Private Insurance Company.  In order to save costs, certain tests must  be pre-approved.  In this case, I spent about twenty minutes on the phone, first with a clerk, then with a nurse (interspersed with a number of long hold periods).  In the end, the study was approved.  (I've never made such a call for a Medicare patient.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of prior authorization is a bureaucratic nightmare---I could have seen two patients in the time it took to get this done.  On the other hand, unnecessary tests are a big waste of money, so the private insurance company would be crazy not to throw up a speed bump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already ration care.  The question is not whether to ration care, but how.  Currently it's done by the faceless bureaucrats so feared by the right----they just happen to be &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; faceless bureaucrats.  &lt;/p&gt;

Moieties of those proteins, like the LOV2 domain from the Avena sativa Phototropin1 can be used to introduce light-operated switches onto other functional proteins. In a recent letter to Nature, Yi Wu and colleagues (Carolina University) poked at the Stratagene Quickchange kit to obtain a constitutive active Rac protein that was coupled to the vegetable LOV2 light switch using an overlapping PCR approach. The result of such a cut and paste was genetically encoded into HeLa, HEK93 and MEF/3T3 cell lines. Then, by irradiating whole cells or even localized micro-spot on the cell surface, PA-Rac1 was sufficiently photo-activated to generate polarized cell movements. In other words, light was controlling the motility of living cells via photoactivable Rac. Structural studies indicate that the Rac-LOV2 interface can be engineered to cage other proteins. Engineering and Biology are getting married. If you are a kick ass engineer, consider hacking biology at Ginkgo BioWorks, they are hiring.Wu, Y., Frey, D., Lungu, O., Jaehrig, A., Schlichting, I., Kuhlman, B., &amp;amp; Hahn, K. (2009).

Many people take offense at the fact that it is blatantly incorrect (&lt;a href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/02/15/lactase/"&gt;lactase persistence?&lt;/a&gt; No, what about &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/2/l_012_02.html"&gt;sickle trait&lt;/a&gt;? No, how about human diversification and radiation &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626343.900-modern-times-causing-human-evolution-to-accelerate.html"&gt;is actually happening FASTER&lt;/a&gt;?) while I take offense at the notion that evolution, in living, reproducing, and dying organisms can stop at all. The principle is simple: every single human has numerous mutations not present in either parent. In turn, each parent has numerous novel mutations as well which are passed along to the offspring. Evolution is not dependent upon selection of traits, completely silent genes will have mutations which will drift in frequency among a given population. Different parts of the DNA structure are more likely to undergo mutation than others, resulting in even more variation. In regards to actively transcribed genes, this too can be subject to selection even if not obviously apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun tangent. If women had narrower hips, prior to the introduction of medically safe c-sections, they would often experience more complications during childbirth and frequently died as a result either of the childbirth or the unsafe c-section. It would be interesting (and has possibly already been studied) whether or not female hip morphology is changing due to the rise in prevalence and survival rate from this procedure as compared to archaeological specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the falsehood. The appearance of novel new traits is a function of population size. The larger the population size, the more likely a given randomly appearing mutation will occur. This where evolution would actually SPEED UP in humans. The falsehood arises from the notion that in large populations, the novel mutations are “outvoted” by the more prevalent alleles. This, however, assumes no selection, and even so, it is still possible (but unlikely) that an allele will become more prevalent in the population. It is made more likely if the mutation arises on multiple occasions or has a selective pressure in favor of it, even if only for a brief duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to hear anyone state other species have “stopped evolving” other than the “living fossils.” This would be to ignore the mountains of evidence that blatantly demonstrates evolution is, in fact, still occurring in these lineages. The only way for evolution to stop for a species is when that species has become extinct. Even in the obligate parthenogenetic lizards, they do still evolve. They raise interesting questions for how we define a “species,” but the allelic frequency within a population changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution happens, like it or not. Even if we were to ACTIVELY try to prevent allelic shift within a human population, the ONLY way to do so would be to completely synthesize clones (not just through stem cells as these have replication fidelity issues). Even then, we are limited by the fidelity of the synthesis equipment we would use and these will, undoubtedly, have mutations of some kind. Before we can do that, we must understand many more aspects of genetics and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next post will be a few days away as it is a book review and I must finish the book first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve enjoyed my falsehoods, a new page will be located at the top linking to all of my falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s human nature to look back on big anniversaries, both happy and otherwise, and recollect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also natural to seek meaning in such acts, try to make sense of them, fit them into our view of how the world works and how it should work. Sometimes the pieces fit. Sometimes they don’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I saw once again a picture that’s been floating around the web for a few years now. It shows the Twin Towers, and the caption reads, &amp;quot;Science flies people to the Moon. Religion flies people into buildings.&amp;quot; It’s an interesting quotation. It’ll guarantee enraging religious folks, while self-satisfying people who are antireligious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it accurate? After all, it was science that created the airplanes, science that built those buildings, science that developed the technology to bring the two together at high velocity. You might then say yes, but religion was the &lt;em&gt;pilot&lt;/em&gt;; it was the fundamentalist jihadic brand of Islam that guided those men to do what they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I say, &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;. Exactly. In this case, &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; science and religion were tools, used for nefarious ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining science can be difficult. It’s a method, a way of looking at things. It’s a compendium of facts, knowledge, data. It’s a tool, used to investigate the world and to make sure we don’t let our biases, egos, and wishes get in the way of finding what’s real. Science (and skepticism) boil off the dross and leave the pure nugget of reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion, to those who are religious, is similar in that they believe it is a way of &lt;em&gt;making sense&lt;/em&gt; of the world. It is of course entirely different than science in its methodology, but it holds no less thrall over the way people see reality. To someone who is very religious, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; no other way to perceive life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, religion and science are different because to a scientist science is a tool used to help understand the world, but to the religious religion &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the way to see the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, religion can be a tool as well. It was used to brainwash 19 young men, to convince them to do something that countless generations of evolution have almost completely bred out of our systems: commit suicide. With fantasies of an afterlife and admonitions of the greater good, those men flew multiton jets into buildings, and changed our lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not hard to imagine things being a little different. Had those men not been subjected to that fringe religion, had they instead grown up in a more open environment, exposed to things like diversity, open-mindedness to other people’s ways of life, and the realization that they may be wrong and that all knowledge is tentative… we might not be spending this day in remembrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still. They &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; immersed in their beliefs, told what to think, how to think. In this case, religion was a tool for abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not difficult to create a list of both good and bad things both science and religion have brought us. Such lists have been debated and used as bludgeons for years, so I won’t belabor them here. The point is, as tools, science and religion are neither good nor evil. They can be used either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not saying any particular religion is right, or even that any of them accurately portrays the Universe for what it is — it should be clear by now I don’t think that at all. As a tool to seek truth in the Universe, I don’t think religion works very well. But as a framework for many people, and as tool to inspire them, its motivational abilities are without question. For good or for ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not necessarily trying to make any grand point here. All I’m doing is making an aside, if you will, a mumbled comment amidst all the rhetoric that will no doubt fly today about moderate versus fundamentalist religion, about atheism versus religion, about us versus them, and this versus that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hand of a carpenter a hammer can build a house, and in the hand of a madman it can stave in a skull. &lt;/p&gt;

Rozumiem, że okładkowy tytuł musi być chwytliwy, ale takie spłycenie problemu jest poniżej pewnego poziomu. W środku pisma artykuł Bronisława Tumiłowicza. W zasadzie podręcznikowy przykład &lt;span&gt;he-said-she-said journalism&lt;/span&gt; czyli mamy dwie strony sporu, obie dostają głos, raczej wystrzegamy się komentowania czy krytycznej analizy informacji podawanych przez rozmówców. A ja na przykład jestem ciekaw, co koledzy po fachu myślą o wykładzie prof. Andrzeja Molskiego, który na 64. Kongresie Międzynarodowej Medycznej Ligi Homeopatycznej "starał się udowodnić, że w procesie rozcieńczania substancja rozcieńczana transferuje swoje właściwości na rozpuszczalnik (np. wodę), który koduje (zapamiętuje) właściwości substancji wyjściowej." Za artykułem:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Efekt ten zaś przypomina znaną m.in. z teorii Alberta Einsteina teleportację kwantową, gdy stan (polaryzacja) fotonu przenosi się na inny odległy nawet o wiele kilometrów foton. A ponieważ Einstein takie specyficzne oddziaływania pomiędzy skorelowanymi obiektami kwantowymi nazwał „nadprzyrodzonym działaniem na odległość”, profesor przyjął, że coś takiego dzieje się w znacznie większej skali w działaniu leków homeopatycznych, które choć szalenie rozcieńczone, posiadają tzw. pamięć wody.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jestem autentycznie, bez cienia złośliwości ciekawy, co o tym myślą inni biochemicy i fizycy. Może warto było to z kimś skonsultować? Autorowi bardziej niż tajemniczo brzmiące hipotezy profesora przeszkadza momentami równie enigmatyczna krytyka homeopatii niektórych katolickich i prawicowych publicystów. Zgoda, teologiczna krytyka homeopatii często może być równie godna politowania jak sama homeopatia, ale nie powinno to odwrócić naszej uwagi od zastrzeżeń czysto empirycznych. Ponad 200 lat po pojawieniu się homeopatia nadal nie jest w stanie zweryfikować swoich podstawowych założeń, a wyniki badań nad jej skutecznością można zaliczyć do żałosnych (szczególnie jeśli porównamy je z obietnicami samych homeopatów).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Albo spójrzmy na ten fragment, w którym autor artykułu odpiera zarzut, że homeopatia to placebo:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Niestety argument o placebo nie pasuje do przypadków, kiedy lek homeopatyczny pomagał małym dzieciom lub zwierzętom, w których trudno wyrobić przekonanie, że pastylka lub kropelki są do czegokolwiek potrzebne, ale takim rozumowaniem przeciwnicy homeopatii się nie zajmują.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Czy mi się wydaje czy Bronisław Tumiłowicz zakłada coś, co dopiero należałoby udowodnić? Leki homeopatyczne pomagają małym dzieciom i zwierzętom? Jakieś papiery na te wyjątkowo mocne twierdzenie? Najlepiej z takimi bajerami jak randomizacja i podwójnie ślepa próba? W tekście nie ma żadnej wzmianki o tym czy takie badania w ogóle istnieją. Na jakiej podstawie więc mamy uznać twierdzenie, że homeopatia leczy małe dzieci czy zwierzęta? Wiem, wiem, póki co musimy uwierzyć homeopatom na słowo!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;W ostateczności można zawsze odwołać się do wolności wyboru:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;Najnowsze doniesienia z rynku medykamentów mówią, że konflikt o homeopatię między lekarzami może przenieść się też na apteki. Do tej pory leki homeopatyczne można było kupować nie tylko w wyspecjalizowanych aptekach homeopatycznych, ale także we wszystkich innych, które takie specyfiki sprowadzały np. na specjalne zamówienie pacjentów, te najpopularniejsze jak syrop drosetux czy oscillococcinum miały zawsze w magazynie. Dziś aptekarze są poddawani przez media praniu mózgów. Wspomina się o negatywnym stanowisku WHO w sprawie homeopatii, co, jak sądzą niektórzy, będzie skutkowało wycofywaniem takich specyfików z handlu. Na razie, póki burza nie ucichnie, lekarstwa tego typu sprzedaje się „aż do wyczerpania”. Zdanie pacjentów (i niektórych lekarzy), którzy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nie chcą się leczyć silnie działającymi i pozostawiającymi różne skutki uboczne środkami chemicznymi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, w ogóle nie jest brane pod uwagę.

The attacks of that day have caused a lot of pain and lead to a great deal of disagreement over the cause and the response and the things done in the name of security and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I'd like to consider another aspect that is rarely discussed: the events were never in any way predicted by any of the self-proclaimed psychics or future-seers out there.  While some have claimed that the vague words of Nostradamus or some other cryptic phrase contains clues, the fact is that nobody, no professional nor amateur psychic gave any indication that there would be a major terrorist attack in New York City or Washington in September 2001.  None said that the year 2001 would see commercial aircraft turned into weapons to bring down skyscrapers.  None stated that the World Trade Center would be destroyed.   Nothing like that has ever been verified.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Stephen Packard)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252689608394"><id gr:original-id="http://www.obesitypanacea.com/2009/09/american-heart-association-says-verdict.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af1ffab641088ce8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">American Heart Association says the verdict is in - sugar is bad</title><published>2009-09-11T11:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T11:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/vf2QOGYR3uA/american-heart-association-says-verdict.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.obesitypanacea.com/2009/09/american-heart-association-says-verdict.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">In the past, I have written several posts about sugar (mainly fructose and high fructose corn syrup, aka HFCS), and how it is a driving force behind the current obesity epidemic.  The evidence is compelling - the intake of added sugars (especially HFCS) has dramatically increased over the past 30 years, an increase which is mirrored by the increased prevalence of obesity.  Further, these added sugars are &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; calories, which tend to displace other foods that contain more nutrients.  Then there are the many ways that sugar (again, especially HFCS) disrupts both metabolism and the hormones that signal satiety, resulting in increased health risk as well as increased food intake (outlined wonderfully in this powerpoint presentation by Dr Robert Lustig of the University of California at San Fransisco).  That&amp;#39;s right - sugar can actually make you more hungry!  The insulin response to sugar and resulting lethargy may result in decreased energy expenditure as well.  In short, sugar does many bad things to the human body, and it should be limited to a very small portion of our daily diet.

It turns out to be surprisingly hard to rule such a proposal out on the basis of known astrophysical data, although I suspect that it could be tightly constrained if people did high-precision simulations of the evolution of structure in such a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact our original idea wasn’t merely the idea of dark photons, it was dark atoms — having dark matter bear a close family resemblance to ordinary matter, all the way to having most of its mass be in the form of composite objects consisting of one positively-charged dark particle (a “dark proton”) and one negatively-charged dark particle (a “dark electron”).  We thought about it a very tiny bit, but didn’t pursue the idea and only mentioned it in passing at the very end of our paper.  There is an informal rule in theoretical physics that you should only invoke the tooth fairy (propose an extremely speculative idea or hope for some possible but unprovable result) once per paper, so we stuck with only a single kind of charged dark particle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once someone invokes the tooth fairy in their paper, anyone who writes another paper gets to invoke the tooth fairy for themselves.  (That’s just how the rule works.)  And the good news is that it’s now been done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0753"&gt;Atomic Dark Matter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Authors: David E. Kaplan, Gordan Z. Krnjaic, Keith R. Rehermann, Christopher M. Wells&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Abstract: We propose that dark matter is dominantly comprised of atomic bound states. We build a simple model and map the parameter space that results in the early universe formation of hydrogen-like dark atoms. We find that atomic dark matter has interesting implications for cosmology as well as direct detection: Protohalo formation can be suppressed below $M_{proto} \sim 10^3 – 10^6 M_{\odot}$ for weak scale dark matter due to Ion-Radiation interactions in the dark sector. Moreover, weak-scale dark atoms can accommodate hyperfine splittings of order $100 \kev$, consistent with the inelastic dark matter interpretation of the DAMA data while naturally evading direct detection bounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that one of the authors has been a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/09/07/guest-post-david-e-kaplan-on-the-lhc-on-the-history-channel/"&gt;guest-blogger&lt;/a&gt; here at CV.)  It looks like a great paper, and they seem to have done a careful job at chasing down some of the interesting implications of dark atoms.  In fact the idea might be more robust than that of the one in our paper; the fact that dark atoms are neutral lets you slip loose of some of the more inconvenient observational bounds.  And the last sentence of the abstract points to an intriguing consequence:  by giving the dark matter particles some structure, you might be able to explain the intriguing &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/04/21/guest-post-juan-collar-on-dark-matter-detection/"&gt;DAMA&lt;/a&gt; results while remaining consistent with other (thus far negative) direct searches for dark matter.  Stay tuned; that dark sector may turn out to be a pretty exciting place after all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252688792596"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=15959">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55ba9fc1f56dade9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="GLBT"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">A Petition to Ban Divorce: It Protects Traditional Marriage!</title><published>2009-09-11T17:00:26Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T17:00:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/11/a-petition-to-ban-divorce-it-protects-traditional-marriage/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m sure Focus on the Family, the Mormons, and anyone else who supported Proposition 8 (banning gay marriage in California) will be thrilled about &lt;strong&gt;John Marcotte&lt;/strong&gt;’s amusing petition to get the 2010 California Marriage Protection Act on the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act would &lt;a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/divorce/divorce.php"&gt;ban divorce in the state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
People who supported Prop 8 weren’t trying to take rights away from gays, they just wanted to protect traditional marriage. That’s why I’m confident that they will support this initiative, even though this time it will be their rights that are diminished. To not support it would be hypocritical.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's so stunning that it was chosen as today's &lt;a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090911.html"&gt;Astronomy Picture of the Day&lt;/a&gt;.  But yesterday, I got a very interesting question to go along with it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These galaxies are far away, and so we're looking at them in the past.  What do they look like today, and are there still five of them?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is a &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; question.  First off, looking at the image, some of you will count only &lt;b&gt;four&lt;/b&gt; galaxies.  That's because there are two galaxies that are &lt;i&gt;in the process&lt;/i&gt; of merging.  You can see both galactic nuclei still, and some intense star formation (the white and pink areas) on the outskirts.  Most galaxies have their own designation; the three isolated ones are known as NGC 7317, 7319, and 7320.  However, these two merging ones are NGC 7318A and NGC 7318B.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the galaxy in the upper left, NGC 7320, is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; grouped with the other four.  It's simply in the line-of-sight, and is roughly 40 million light-years away.  However, the other four are 300 million light-years away, meaning that we're looking at the light that was emitted 300 million years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do these things look like &lt;b&gt;today&lt;/b&gt;?  In other words, if we could magically transport ourselves over there, how many galaxies would there be?  Four?  Three?  Two?  Just one?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, for typical galaxies, it takes &lt;i&gt;over a billion years&lt;/i&gt; for two of them to merge completely.  But these four have already started merging.  Two of them are really close to having merged completely, and in the 300 million years that light has been on its way to us, those two galaxies "caught in the act" are certainly one by now.  The one in the upper right will certainly merge eventually, but 300 million years is simply too short a time to see that happen.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the pretty elliptical one in the lower left?  Well, that will certainly take longer than 300 million years to merge, but it's highly likely that numerous galaxies &lt;b&gt;have already merged&lt;/b&gt; to form it.  Most isolated galaxies are spirals, and most galaxies that undergo mergers become ellipticals.  So when we look back on the quintet in &lt;i&gt;two billion&lt;/i&gt; years, you'll simply have the foreground galaxy and one large, background, elliptical galaxy.  But right now?  Over there?  There are probably three.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't just take my word for it.  Check out this video of merging spiral galaxies made by &lt;a href="http://patrik.familjenjonsson.org//sunrise/coolstuff.html"&gt;Patrik at UC Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/agqLEbOFT2A%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, check out the first 90 seconds or so.  Because that is three billion years condensed into less than two minutes, and you can totally see for yourself how close to a completed merger some of these actually are!  Enjoy the view, and have a great weekend!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/how_many_in_the_quintet_today.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252684001992"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7638/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/08cce2945212d1be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Rocket Test in   Northern Utah Goes Off Problem-Free</title><published>2009-09-11T15:57:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T15:57:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7638/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;PROMONTORY, Utah (Associated Press) --

I've never been a huge fan of the show. It bores me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what I found out today is that the Discovery Company has a website that's similarly named: &lt;a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/"&gt;How Stuff Works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh cool! That can't be bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's check out the science section. What's their "featured science"?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/ghost-buster.htm"&gt;How Ghostbusters Work&lt;/a&gt;. Looking through the article, it does a fair job of giving examples of how many events that are claimed ghost sightings have been bogus and even drops in a line about how ghosts have never been shown to exist. But at the same time, the entire article runs under the bent that they do exist.... we just haven't found them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other featured articles? &lt;a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/grim-reaper.htm"&gt;How the Grim Reaper Works&lt;/a&gt;. Again, this is more of an analysis of the history of various cultures belief in the dead. There's absolutely no science here. So why is it in the "Science section"?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, both of these were in an oxymoronic sub-section: &lt;a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/supernatural-science-channel.htm"&gt;Supernatural Science&lt;/a&gt;. My mind is boggled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I better look at some good science to calm my nerves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/evolution/evolution.htm"&gt;Evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Evolution is fascinating because it attempts to answer one of the most basic human questions: Where did life, and human beings, come from?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;*Blink*&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;We will also examine several important areas that show holes in the current theory....The holes are considered by many to be proof that the theory of evolution should be overthrown.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;*Twitch*&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Most people agree that bacteria evolve in small ways (microevolution), but there is some controversy around the idea of speciation (macroevolution).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;...&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;The theory of evolution is just that -- a theory....Many theories are works in progress, and evolution is one of them.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;*headdesk*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what source do they cite? &lt;a href="http://trueorigin.org/"&gt;True.Origin.org&lt;/a&gt;. Fail. Massive fail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Discovery Company should be ashamed to host this site.

&lt;p&gt;The first day of school came &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-city-school-bus-11-sep11,0,1975465.story"&gt;two days late&lt;/a&gt; for Chicago student Lily Edelstein, 14, whose individualized education plan included busing plans. But the bus never came for Lily, who has autism, due to a communication glitch. Apparently, the school district didn’t submit the transportation request to the city’s Bureau of Student Transportation until Sept. 4, the Friday before the Labor Day weekend, and it usually takes five days to process a request. People whose kids are typically developing may not understand why Lily’s family didn’t simply take her to school themselves. Lily is 5′9″ and often impulsive and hard to handle, which is why transportation is part of her IEP. The Chicago Tribune contacted Chicago Public Schools on Wednesday, and the next morning the bus arrived to take Lily to her first day of school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do people do the things they do? What’s a common response? A lot of things are mysteries to Alex. Last year, his teacher used social stories to help acquaint Alex with various social situations, and she recommended using them to help Alex understand certain behaviors (like running away) and why we don’t do these things (”that’s &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt;“). Alex still bolts quite often, but I think this combination of pictures and text to show Alex an event or setting (”We’re at the park now, and we don’t run away”) is a Good Thing.  Jeff says he certainly remembers his mother using social stories (”Do that, and I’ll kill you”), and come to think of it,  I often explain to both Alex and Ned how I’m going to feel and react if they do certain things (”Mommy is going to be &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;mad &lt;/em&gt;if you break that”). Still, both boys act mystified each time I get mad over some seemingly little thing. I only heard about social stories last year, but I think both Alex and Ned can get something out of them.

I can’t quite imagine the conversations that led up to this paper. “Let’s look at the brain of the biggest fish in the world.” (I suppose the fish start small and have to grow up big. But still.)The brains of sharks are interesting, in part because they much larger than people would think. People tend to think of sharks as primitive (how many shark documentaries have used the phrase, “unchanged for millions of years”?), and primitive means small brains. But compared to body size, shark brains are often as big as birds’ and mammals’.And when thinking about evolution of brains, extremes are often very informative. The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is not only extreme in its size (as noted, they’re bigger than any other fish in the world), but extreme in its diet: it’s a filter feeder, which is not the first thing that comes to mind when people hear the words, “giant shark.”This paper is not only interesting because the species is unusual for neurobiology, it’s interesting because it applies a technique that is used a lot for humans, but quire rarely for other beasties: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Now, this is not fMRI, which is constantly in the science headlines: this is purely anatomical data, not imaging the brain of a live shark.Although the whale shark has a massive brain in absolute terms, it turns out that it isn’t very large relative to its body mass compared to other sharks. In fact, it’s small. In a situation like this, there are two hypotheses that come to mind. The first is that the feature was inherited from a common ancestor, in which case, you6d predict that the whale shark’s relatives also have small brains. The second is that the feature may be an adaptation to the particular ecology of the species, and the prediction there would be that species with the most similar lifestyle would have small brains.In this case, the whale shark has a small brain in common with other large filter feeding sharks, like the basking shark (compared using previously published data). It’s easy to think that filter feeders can afford to have small brains, but the authors caution that social behaviours in sharks and allies is another factor that is often strongly correlated with brain size.When looking at individual regions of the brain, the whale sharks also had something in common with other oceanic, pelagic sharks, but not their relatives: a very large cerebellum. Cerebellum is usually described as being involved in motor coordination. Why would these open ocean sharks need such a large cerebellum? The authors suggest that perhaps the use of that open ocean is more complex than you might expect. The sharks are not just lazing around at the top of the water, but making significant vertical migrations and travel for very long distances. These possibilities seem a bit foggy, however, based on the traditional notions of cerebellar function. Usually, the cerebellum is involved in coordinating fine movements, not long range navigation. There may be some other undiscovered ecological or behavioural force in play shaping the brains of these massive animals.ReferenceYopak, K., &amp;amp; Frank, L. (2009).

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One in every 33 women who attend worship services regularly has been the target of sexual advances by a religious leader, a survey released Wednesday says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, by Baylor University researchers, found that the problem is so pervasive that it almost certainly involves a wide range of denominations, religious traditions and leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It found that more than two-thirds of the offenders were married to someone else at the time of the advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Waterstradt, 42, a graduate student who lives in the Midwest, said she was coerced into a sexual relationship with a married minister in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America for 18 months. He had been her pastor for a decade, she said, and told her the relationship was ordained by God.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m shocked.  Who knew sex scandals in the church involved women?!  (*cue rim shot*)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to take this more seriously…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many of the women who are taken advantage of leave their churches after something like this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many pastors are seriously punished?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What constitutes a “sexual advance” here?  Based on the comments in the article, the Baylor study never defines this and it is all subjective data… I wonder if there is anything included in the category that is just misinterpreted as an advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What goes through the pastors’ minds when they take advantage of these women?  The article says they say the relationship is “ordained by God”… do they really believe that?  Or do they just use that line to prey on the women?  Either way, it’s disturbing as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is a clergy/congregation relationship any different from a boss/employee one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole article makes me queasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Liberty University chaplain is facing drug and burglary charges. Last week, a homeowner caught Scott Ray on surveillance video breaking into a home to steal painkillers. Ray, who is the chaplain for the men's basketball team and the Director of Convocation, is also suspected in other Campbell County break-ins. In 2005 he was arrested and charged with the same thing. Ray has been suspended by the school and it's believed he's checked into a rehab program. Investigators also say Ray has not yet been arrested but additional indictments are pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&amp;#39;m not worried that it will provide comfort to creationists, but I am a little concerned that it may Hollywoodize history a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebert points out that it focuses on the difficulties he had with religion, and how it colored his marriage and work. I don't know how well it represents reality, though. It's a lens we use to look back on the 19th century, but it may not be entirely fair to Darwin's views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fearing to offend his wife, he was shy about extending his belief to the evolution of mankind itself, but it is certainly what he privately thought. He denied being a atheist, but said agnosticism came close to reflecting his views. Apart from his research and ideas about science, that conflict in this marriage and with the conventional religious of his times was the most significant thing about him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have my doubts that the conflict with religion was a major issue with Darwin. He avoided it very effectively, and did not make public pronouncements on religious belief. He differed from his wife's opinion, but here's the thing: there isn't the slightest hint in any of his writings that he was even tempted to disagree with Emma, and the impression I get is that at every step his priority was to accommodate his ideas with his wife's beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I said it: Charles Darwin was an accommodationist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think the most significant thing in his life was the conflict with religion at all — his family and his happy relationship with his wife and children was #1, and I don&amp;#39;t think &amp;#39;conflict&amp;#39; was a word that applied (although, of course, it would have to be emphasized in a movie).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also leaves something out: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/understanding_darwin_the_legac.php"&gt;Darwin himself said that his greatest talent was as a businessman&lt;/a&gt;. Over his lifetime, he invested carefully and wisely and grew a small seed of money given at his marriage into a huge fortune. If anyone wants to sort out what contributed most to his scientific work, I think that fact should loom much larger than a slight tension on matters of religion in which he always deferred to his wife.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/roger_ebert_doesnt_review_crea.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/1uWRQpzqdVM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252678645412"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/protect_the_sanctity_of_hetero.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5f978791814e8499</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Protect the sanctity of heterosexual marriage!</title><published>2009-09-11T13:56:23Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T13:56:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Q-T3Xuq4fyg/protect_the_sanctity_of_hetero.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/protect_the_sanctity_of_hetero.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;California took such a brave leap last year to protect the purity of marriage by denying it to all of those with matching, instead of complementary, genitali; now &lt;a href="http://cockeyed.com/citizen/divorce/divorce.php"&gt;John Marcotte wants to take the next logical step&lt;/a&gt;, and get an initiative on the California ballot to &lt;a href="http://rescuemarriage.org/"&gt;outlaw divorce&lt;/a&gt;. That's an excellent idea; most marriages aren't threatened by homosexuality at all (strangely, though, it's the must fervent fundamentalists who are most tempted by the love that dare not speak its name), but they are at risk from divorce. Nothing would strengthen the institution of marriage more than making a wedding equivalent to a shackling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like this idea because my marriage isn&amp;#39;t at risk for divorce anyway, so it doesn&amp;#39;t affect me at all, but the prospect of being able to meddle in other people&amp;#39;s lives and tell them exactly how they must act gives me a kind of head rush of power. All those women trapped in loveless marriages, or dominated by abusive husbands…nuh-uh, no way out for you, you get to suffer until you are dead! All those philandering men who can&amp;#39;t seem to find satisfaction with one woman, your days are done — we have to crack down on the wretched slugs who cheat on vows mandated by a loving God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, someone needs to get an anti-masturbation law on the slate. Then we need to outlaw birth control. If we meddle enough, I'm sure we can get to the point where every marriage is a perfect and happy one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/protect_the_sanctity_of_hetero.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Q-T3Xuq4fyg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252676824572"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=17947">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f1af54e4dfacc3e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="psychology"/><category term="transit"/><title type="html">Planes, Trains, and PTSD</title><published>2009-09-11T13:44:44Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T13:44:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/planes-trains-and-ptsd/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The first public passenger railroad opened in England in 1825.

It's hard to believe that it's been eight years since that horrible day. On this day, traditionally, I do two things. First, I post the following video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid%3D-5370762387415552903%26hl%3Den%26fs%3Dtrue&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=150" width="300" height="150"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video was shot by Bob and Bri, who in 2001 lived in a high rise a mere 500 yards from the North Tower. On this eighth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, I think it's important to post this again. It is the most prolonged and continuous video of the attack that I have seen, and, as such, It is difficult to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why it's so important to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I either repost or post a link to a post I wrote about 9/11 on its 5th anniversary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/09/september_11_five_years_later.php"&gt;September 11: Five years later&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very likely I will continue to post these two things every year on September 11 while I'm still blogging, so long as I feel the need to do it. Perhaps, if I am still blogging in September 2011, I will make the tenth anniversary of the attacks the last time I post this on a yearly basis. One thing about today that will be especially weird is that I will be chairing an all day program retreat that will start at almost exactly the time the first plane hit. By 9:05 AM we were seeing this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/05/nasa_logo_thumb.jpg" alt="NASA logo"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest: I don’t know what the future of NASA is right now. Worse? NASA doesn’t know either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the situation right now. The Shuttle is planned to fly her last mission in September 2010, the end of the fiscal year. The International Space Station is not budgeted beyond 2016 — that was on purpose; the Bush Administration couldn’t guarantee funds beyond then. NASA is constructing hardware for the Constellation program, the Ares 1 and Ares 5 rockets that are planned to pick up where the Shuttle program leaves off. However, there is no way the Ares rockets can be ready before the Shuttle program ends, and in fact 2015 is the earliest it can be used… and the delay is likely to be longer than that. That means there will be a gap in the U.S. capability to get humans into space, and that gap may be 5 years long or more. More money thrown at Constellation won’t shorten the gap; only extending the Shuttle program will. And there really isn’t any meaningful way to do that for more than a year; hardware like launch facilities are already being converted to use by Constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where we stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May of 2009, the Obama Administration created a group, now called &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/hsf/home/index.html"&gt;the Augustine Commission&lt;/a&gt;, to investigate the current program and look at alternatives for NASA. &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/384767main_SUMMARY%20REPORT%20-%20FINAL.pdf"&gt;They just released their findings yesterday&lt;/a&gt; (PDF). Note that these are not the detailed conclusions of the commission, but a short version with details to be given later in the longer, final report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their conclusions are interesting. First, they say that the goals must be determined (Moon, Mars, near-Earth asteroid landings, and so on) before the hardware is built. Fine; NASA has stated they want to go back to the Moon. However, is Ares the way to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustine says not really. They suggest a new system, an &amp;quot;Ares Lite&amp;quot; that has less capability than the standard Ares configuration but would be cheaper, or possibly a Shuttle-derived launch vehicle using hardware well-tested in over a hundred Shuttle missions. The problem is, I don’t see any way that kind of thing can be done in anywhere near the same time as the actual Ares rockets being built now. The report states that this can extend the ISS to 2020 and even keep the Shuttle going (in the Shuttle-derived version) until 2015, closing the gap. This assumes a successor to the Shuttle can be flying by 2015. The report doesn’t give details, but I see no way to have a new system designed, built, tested, and ready to go &lt;em&gt;in five years&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps the final version of the report will detail that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Griffin, the ex-head of NASA, didn’t care much for this report. In fact, in an email, &lt;a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=32351"&gt;he blasted it pretty viciously&lt;/a&gt; (and by &lt;em&gt;blast&lt;/em&gt; I mean &lt;em&gt;holy cow someone better give him his blood pressure medicine STAT!&lt;/em&gt;). As he points out, the Augustine report doesn’t give much space to simply fully funding Constellation. The actual project has been underfunded, quite seriously, almost since its inception. That has resulted in delays and other woes. Given adequate funding, what we’re already building may be sufficient to do everything we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Griffin has other accusations about the Commission, some of which I assume are fair, though I don’t have expertise in such things as the difference in lunar payload capabilities of Ares Lite versus the Ares 5. I can take his word on it. However, I also think he let his temper run away from him a bit; he lambastes the Commission for talking about de-orbiting the ISS in 2016, but to be fair they are presenting that as a possibility due to the tightly constrained budget environment. They actually say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committee finds that the return on investment of ISS to both the United States and the international partners would be significantly enhanced by an extension of ISS life to 2020. It seems unwise to de-orbit the Station after 25 years of assembly and only five years of operational life. Not to extend its operation would significantly impair U.S. ability to develop and lead future international spaceflight partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read it, their point is that to extend the Shuttle (even a year), develop a new rocket system, and keep the ISS flying may not be possible without a lot more money. They suggest $3 billion a year more starting in 2010. That may sound like a lot, but in fact it’s a tiny amount of the overall national budget. NASA gets roughly $20 billion now, and that’s less than 1% of the total US budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we are. We have a Shuttle winding down, a rocket gearing up but leaving a five-or-more-year gap in our ability to lift people off this mud ball, and a space station that has cost something around $100 billion dollars but which has yet to prove itself worth even a fraction of that amount, and still only fundable until 2020 or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. So what now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. The best thing that could happen would be for the 400+ members of Congress to reverse their cranial-rectal inversion, give NASA the money it needs to do what it needs to do (though from where is a whole ‘nuther story), and then let us go to the Moon. But that still leaves the gap — which will not be filled by commercial space flight, at least not substantively until the gap is almost over anyway — the ISS, and any potential future budget cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama has been fairly slow in dealing with NASA, taking a long time to appoint a new chief. This Commission report — prompted by Obama — basically says we have to do something &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

He is a case study in why we need rigorous science to decide which treatments are safe and effective, of the lure of quack claims, the power of bias, and the inadequacy of our current regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gonzalez has managed to have a thriving practice despite, in my opinion, violating the basic standard of care and medical ethics. He has done so partly by riding the wave of so-called “health care freedom” which confuses (I think deliberately) the public about the nature of standards in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gonzalez treatment, which is based on prior claims made by James Beard and William Kelley, lacks plausibility or basic science support. While you can find studies to show that an individual supplement may have some effect that potentially could have some clinical effect, you have to extrapolate wildly and recklessly from such information to clinical claims. Such information is at best a source of hypotheses – not treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the final analysis Gonzalez’s claims are just recycled CAM propaganda – claiming that supplements will boost the immune system and detoxify the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical ethics also requires that before we subject patients to new treatments we at least test them in animals to have some idea about safety and at least the hope of benefit. There have been animals studies on the pancreatic enzymes, but not the treatment as a whole. The National Cancer Institute reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1999, an animal study tested the effect of different doses of pancreatic enzymes taken by mouth on the growth and &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&amp;amp;version=Patient&amp;amp;language=English"&gt;metastasis&lt;/a&gt; (spread) of &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&amp;amp;version=Patient&amp;amp;language=English"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; in rats. Some of the rats received magnesium citrate in addition to the enzymes. Rats receiving the enzymes were compared to rats that did not receive the enzymes.&lt;a name="Section_57"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name="ListSection"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results showed that the enzyme did not affect growth of the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&amp;amp;version=Patient&amp;amp;language=English"&gt;primary tumor&lt;/a&gt; (where the cancer started).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cancer spread to the most places in the rats that received the highest &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&amp;amp;version=Patient&amp;amp;language=English"&gt;dose&lt;/a&gt; of enzymes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cancer spread to the fewest places in the rats that received the lowest dose of enzymes plus magnesium citrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another animal study looked at the effects of pancreatic enzymes on &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44301&amp;amp;version=Patient&amp;amp;language=English"&gt;survival rates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&amp;amp;version=Patient&amp;amp;language=English"&gt;tumor&lt;/a&gt; growth in rats with pancreatic cancer. Rats receiving the enzyme treatment lived longer, had smaller tumors and fewer signs of disease, and were more active than the rats in the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&amp;amp;version=Patient&amp;amp;language=English"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt;, which did not receive the enzyme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So results are mixed at best, but the study showing a worsening of cancer with the treatment should have been cause for extreme caution before giving the therapy to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gonzalez did publish a case series of his treatment for pancreatic cancer, which is a particularly deadly form of cancer with a 1 year survival of only 2%. &lt;a href="http://www.dr-gonzalez.com/pancreatic.htm"&gt;He reports&lt;/a&gt; that in his case series of 11 patient their average survival with his treatment was 17.5 months.  That is very impressive, if true. Proponents used this data to support the Gonzalez treatment and dismiss critics, while science-based physicians pointed out the fatal weaknesses of case reports – namely they are not controlled, and therefore are subject to a host of biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve the dispute a prospective trial was planned, and the results of this trial have now finally been reported – four years after the trial was complete. Kimball Atwood gives a thorough discussion of the trial itself at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1430"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, so I won’t go into detail about the trial’s history. Suffice it to say it was controversial. There were significant ethical concerns about studying an implausible treatment with inadequate pre-clinical justification in a disease as serious as pancreatic cancer. Most curious and disturbing is, considering the results, the four year delay in making the results public. This is a scandal, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But finally &lt;a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/JCO.2009.22.8429v1"&gt;we have the results &lt;/a&gt;and they show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;At enrollment, the treatment groups had no statistically significant&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;differences in patient characteristics, pathology, quality of&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;life, or clinically meaningful laboratory values. Kaplan-Meier&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;analysis found a 9.7-month difference in median survival between&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;the chemotherapy group (median survival, 14 months) and enzyme&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;treatment groups (median survival, 4.3 months) and found an&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;adjusted-mortality hazard ratio of the enzyme group compared&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;with the chemotherapy group of 6.96 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). At 1 year,&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;56% of chemotherapy-group patients were alive, and 16% of enzyme-therapy&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;patients were alive. The quality of life ratings were better&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;in the chemotherapy group than in the enzyme-treated group (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;&amp;lt; .01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right – standard therapy mean survival was 14 months and on the Gonzalez treatment 4.3 months. That is a dramatic difference, and supports what critics have been saying for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one weakness to the trial that I can detect – it was not randomized. The reason is that too many patients refused to be randomized. They did not say if patients refused to go on the Gonzalez treatment, refused not to go on the treatment, or both. Regardless, this opens the door for the claim that patients who self-selected to go on the Gonzalez treatment were sicker. There is no evidence to support this claim in the study and the researcher tried to compensate for the lack of randomization by making sure the two groups were as comparable as possible. So while this criticism is legitimate it is highly unlikely to explain the dramatic difference in  survival between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is this – that Gonzalez treatment is not only worthless it is harmful and reduces quality of life. This is an important cautionary tale. But first this raises an interesting question – how did Gonzalez get his impressive 17.5 month survival in his case series when a prospective study shows a 4.3 month survival? We will never know for sure – the possibilities include that some of the patients did not have pancreatic cancer (he says they were biopsy proven), but most likely is that he simply cherry-picked the cases that did well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any cases, this shows the relatively low value of case series. They are useful for detecting new phenomena and for generating hypotheses – but not for testing hypotheses, not for telling if a treatment works. This is a dramatic example of why we don’t rely on anecdotal evidence, and why science-based practitioners are appropriately dismissive of anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But further, the Gonzalez case taken as a whole shows us that you can promote a treatment that actually causes harm and yet still create a faithful following, bamboozle regulators, charm the media, and delay (sometimes indefinitely) definitive testing of your claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further justifies why many science-based physicians believe such trials are themselves unethical. The 32 patients in this study that selected the Gonzalez treatment were victims – they lost quality of life and on average 10 months of life. Was their sacrifice justified? I and others say no – before the Gonzalez treatment was given to a single person far more basic science and animal testing should have been done. Then, if the treatment looked promising and safe (at least equivalent to current standard treatment) small pilot studies in humans would be next, and then definitive clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use this sequence for a reason – because most new ideas in medicine are wrong. Because in order to “first do no harm” we need to proceed carefully with experimental treatments and only give them to people when there is sufficient plausibility and pre-clinical data to justify it. This is the ethical standard in medicine, but the public has fallen victim to the successful creation of a double standard with clever marketing of terms like “alternative,” “holistic,” “natural,” and “detoxify.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to know where the media attention is on this issue. I only heard about it because of my involvement as a proponent of science-based medicine. This study was published online on August 17th and I have seen no mainstream coverage of it. (I’m sure it’s out there, but it certainly did not grab my attention.) The National Cancer Institute needs to update their website with this information yesterday. And I would really like to hear why there was a four year delay in the results being published at all – four years during which Gonzalez continued to use his therapy. He still is, and his website gives no hint that his claims have just been blown out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have to wait and see what the response will be from Gonzalez and regulators. The true test of an ethical science-based practitioner is what they do in the face of evidence against a treatment they currently favor. The Gonzalez treatment, in my opinion, was never ethical and now it is outrageously unethical. It needs to stop immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

As I settle here in Cambridge, I hope that will change. As we will be continuing to do media and talks about the book–I’m doing one next Wednesday right here in my new town, &lt;a href="http://www.portersquarebooks.com/event/chris-mooney-unscientific-america-how-scientific-illiteracy-threatens-our-future"&gt;at Porter Square Books&lt;/a&gt;–there should be plenty of time for all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my sense is this: Some people hate &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt; with a passion. Others really, really like it. The reviews show as much; we have some extremely negative ones, but also some extremely positive ones, and then everything in between. What other book gets reactions like this, that so completely and evenly run the gamut? I’m sure that there are some, but I don’t know them off hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PZ Myers is now asking, “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/is_this_book_dead_yet.php"&gt;Is this book dead yet?&lt;/a&gt;“; as &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/27/some-more-words-to-the-new-atheist-blogosphere-on-unscientific-america/"&gt;noted before&lt;/a&gt;, he apparently doesn’t even want you to read this work that criticizes him. But the reviews themselves suggest a fascinating array of reactions, far more diverse than the now predictable New Atheist dismissal. Going forward–and, I hope, starting next week–we’ll continue to provided some replies to critics, as well as making our case in talks and media. There will be a lot more to say, and as Sheril finishes her manuscript, and I learn the ropes here in Cambridge, we look forward to saying it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252670796898"><id gr:original-id="http://blog.biodata.com/2009/9/11/science-news-september-6">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3bf98879defca806</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Science News: Week of September 6, 2009</title><published>2009-09-11T06:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T06:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/btNQcPMTQ2A/science-news-september-6" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.biodata.com/2009/9/11/science-news-september-6"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Our weekly compilation of science news for the week of September 6, 2009....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Chester Cook&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112679029"&gt;not too bad of a guy&lt;/a&gt;.  I actually wouldn’t mind his services every now and then…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By some definitions, Cook has the largest church in the country. As the full-time chaplain of Atlanta’s international airport, his flock includes the 56,000 employees and a quarter of a million travelers who pass through each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Cook recalls the time he found an elderly woman stranded in the airport. She wasn’t supposed to fly out for three days, and the airline wouldn’t change her ticket. So Cook confronted an airline manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘This is a dilemma, because if that was your 81-year-old grandmother sitting out there, you would be fit to be tied,’ ” Cook says. “And I said, ‘I’m sure the news channels would love this story if I gave them a phone call.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman was put on the next flight.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an awesome story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to me that mention of a god is fairly minimal in the story.  Sure, Cook can talk about religion, but he sounds like he’d rather act in an ethical way rather than spend (waste?) time convincing you of a god’s existence.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially with an 8am class coming up so soon...Anyway, apparently Ceratium ranipes, a photosynthetic dinoflagellate, decided to grow plastid-stuffed &amp;#39;fingers&amp;#39; during daylight:(Pizay et al. 2009 Protist, in press; light period)And retracts them back in for the night:(Pizay et al. 2009 Protist, in press; dark period)In case you&amp;#39;re not convinced these are the same organism:(Pizay et al. 2009 Protist, in press; sequence from a single individual removed from light, T measures minutes of darkness) (a video of that would be so awesome...!)Chloroplasts fluoresce red when hit by UV light (see my own example with a diatom); take a look at those fingers:(Pizay et al. 2009 Protist, in press. Left: formalin-preserved C.ranipes with a daytime morphology; the inset shows UV autofluorescense of the plastids: note their concentration in the &amp;#39;fingers&amp;#39;. The bluish/whitish subinset shows Calcofluor White staining, which indicates the presence of thecal plates on the fingers. Right: transitional morphology at the end of the day: note how the plastids migrated inwards away from the fingers.)This raises some cell biology-related questions: how is plastid movement coordinated and regulated? What does the genetic developmental pathway look like for those fingers, and how does it interact with whatever immediately respond to light? More importantly, why does this thing seemingly waste its time growing and retracting fingers, when it could have just kept them protruded during dark hours?Could be just a low cost glitch in the system, or perhaps there is something to it. After all, perhaps it wouldn&amp;#39;t take much to lose the finger retraction ability - so is there some cost when that happens, thereby keeping this process going? Sinking may have something to do with it - many planktonic algae sink for the night and float back up during the day. Fingers may drastically slow down the sinking speed. However, there&amp;#39;s no data yet showing any vertical migration in C.ranipes (Pizay et al. 2009 Protist). Could be a relic from an ancestor that did sink, but then why hasn&amp;#39;t this behaviour been found earlier, and in more dinos?Another idea in the same paper is that the fingers get in the way of directed swimming; during daylight hours, you sacrifice your swimming ability for a larger photosynthetic capacity, but it may be advantageous to put away the tackle in the absense of light.This reminds me of two things: 1) plant leaves - increasing the surface area exposed to surroundings for gas exchange, as well as the area exposed to light. Sort of a convergence. 2) Many &amp;#39;radiolaria&amp;#39; have algal symbionts they use for photosynthesis, and they too spread them out towards the tips of the host&amp;#39;s filopodia during daytime, and retract them inwards for the night. So whatever you do, don&amp;#39;t dangle your plastids in plain view when they&amp;#39;re not in use.---Pizay, M., Lemée, R., Simon, N., Cras, A., Laugier, J., &amp;amp; Dolan, J. (2009).

The UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, has &lt;a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20571"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; regarding the treatment of Alan Turing in the early 1950s, and the operative words are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how to say it (ignoring the punctuation error — the missing comma after &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt;): not a bunch of evasive mumbling about how unfortunate it all was, but a simple "We're &lt;b&gt;sorry&lt;/b&gt;."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turing did indeed deserve so much better.  He created modern theoretical computer science; opened fundamental new areas of mathematical logic; made very important contributions to other areas of mathematics (e.g., the technique known as Good-Turing frequency estimation in statistics); and most importantly, he gave up his academic work during the Second World War to work at Bletchley Park on the extremely difficult task of decrypting German communications encrypted with the Enigma machine.  The Bletchley Park team did succeed, and thus the Royal Navy became able to read the content of all the Nazis' messages to U-boats in the North Atlantic.  It was a crucial turning point in the war.  But a mere seven years later, a young man shared Turing's bed for the night in Manchester, and later helped someone burgle the house, and Turing naively reported the theft to the police.  The police reaction was to arrest Turing, because they guessed what had been going on.  "Gross indecency" was the charge (it is the British legal euphemism for cocksucking).  Turing had a choice between serving prison time or agreeing to chemical castration, a medicalized "cure" for his presumed abnormality.  He bore the latter for two years and then took cyanide.  The way British mid-20th-century sex law drove him to suicide was genuinely something for the country to be ashamed of.  It was good to see the official apology (which hundreds of eminent scientists had asked the Prime Minister to express).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;Flu season is upon us (it kind of never left us this year), and there is a new strain of flu, the H1N1, aka Swine flu that adds a wrinkle or two to the usual potential for influenza related morbidity and mortality.  And with the new flu is the new woo. I know that others have addressed flu in this forum and some of this may be redundant.  Still, we each have our different styles and interests, so I hope the various posts are additive rather than redundant.  I am going to wander through some odds and ends about flu in general and H1N1 specifically and compare some of the woo with the reality. At least my reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza and Vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/026921_Vitamin_D_influenza_swine_flu.html"&gt;Influenza can be prevented or treated with Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t tell that to Dr. Marshall. The Natural News, the source for all things over hyped and under understood (Ick.  That parallel form didn’t work.), is a nice example of the hype of  Vitamin D as a preventative an treatment of influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is an interesting molecule.  Besides its long known effects on bone metabolism, Vitamin D has many  immunomodulatory effects and is an important vitamin for immune function. Vitamin D even has effects on nitric oxide regulation.  Its effects on infection risks are just beginning to be elucidated but deficiency states (note &lt;strong&gt;deficiency&lt;/strong&gt; states) are associated with an increased risk of viral respiratory infections and worsening of pulmonary tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, deficiency states.  If you are replete in your Vitamin D, there is apparently no immunologic advantage in taking extra, as seems to be the case with all vitamins. Metaphorically, if the tank is full of gas, you can’t go further by pumping more gas into the tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is not uncommon in the Northern Latitudes especially in the winter and in populations who have little sun exposure (nursing home patients).  So like all deficiency states, it is reasonable to fill the tank, with extra Vitamin D.  It will probably decrease the chance of getting a viral respiratory infection. In general, supporting data is limited and the effect small,  as a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19491064?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;review points out&lt;/a&gt; (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about Vitamin D specifically for influenza?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, the data is &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18298852"&gt;limited and mostly epidemiologic&lt;/a&gt;, but interesting none the less. The natural news, which states “In the realm of peer-reviewed medical literature, searching Google Scholar for “influenza” and “vitamin D” returns tens of thousands of results (http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q…).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, using influenza and dental floss for search terms on Google scholar results in over 1500 articles; it is hardly the source for the peer reviewed literature. If you use Pubmed, the source for peer reviewed literature, there are 30 references, not tens of thousands, and less than a half dozen specifically concerning vitamin D and influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning goes like this: flu increases in the winter.  In the winter people get less sunshine and their vitamin d levels drop.  Therefore it is the vitamin d deficiency in the winter that predisposes to influenza. Of course, people crowd together inside in the winter, increasing ease of transmission and flu occurs in the tropics where it is always sunny, so it is probably not the only reason flu increases in the winter.  But it may well be a small component,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is biologically plausible that vitamin deficiency increases your risk for infection, there is reasonable epidemiologic data to support the association, and it is not unreasonable to be replete in you vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is neither reasonable nor supported is to take supratherapeutic amounts of vitamin D as a replacement for either the vaccine or, if you should get flu, oseltamivir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is not ” is perhaps the single most powerful nutrient in the known universe for preventing influenza, ” despite the Natural News hysterics. Yet another alternative mountain made from a scientific molehill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of the vaccine is counterproductive.  Use of the vaccine will lead to a superbug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found this on the webs and from a letter to  SBM, and I can only speculate where this idea originates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics can breed resistant bacteria and resistant organisms are often referred to a superbugs.  The resistant organisms may not necessarily be more virulent. Just because the bacteria may be harder to kill with antibiotics doesn’t necessarily mean it is more invasive.  Sometimes, like current strain of methicillin resistant staphylococcus, may also has a high incidence of  carrying genes that increase its virulence.  However, as best I can tell, the increased virulence genes of the USA 300 strain are independent of its antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting report in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090407105259.htm"&gt;Clinical Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt; that suggests that as a result of anti retrovirals, perhaps HIV is becoming more virulent.  It can happen as a result of antibiotics, but it is unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly if you markedly decrease a pathogen in the community, those who would have died in the past are more likely to survive and pass on their susceptibility to their offspring, increasing the vulnerability of the population to the severe disease.  Put’ toll’, ‘infection’ and ‘polymorphism’ into Pubmed to find a growing literature on the genetic susceptibility for getting and dying from various infections.  &lt;a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/524064?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;Historical epidemiology &lt;/a&gt; out of Utah suggests that the risk of death from influenza is inheritable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what you might expect is after long term vaccine use allows for the accumulation of susceptible hosts in a population and if there is a decline in vaccine use that there will be an increase in morbidity and mortality when the disease returns to a more susceptible population.  So it may not be due to a superbug, but a susceptible population; increase in death due less to the organism and more to the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can vaccine induced immunity lead to a superbug?  It has not yet happened, but it does have some plausibility and it depends on the virus.  Widespread use of smallpox vaccine did not lead to a super-small pox, it lead to the eradication of small pox.  But,  some viruses, due to sloppy reproduction, as occurs in influenza, can alter their surface proteins (where antibodies bind) to escape the immune system. So widespread use of the vaccine could (and should?) lead to new strains of influenza that avoid the antibody.  But, and here is the key thing, that happens with normal infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the flu season progresses the organism slowly changes its surface proteins (aka genetic shift) so that the strain at the end of the season is different than the strain at the beginning of the season, part of why we need a new vaccine every year.  However, these mutations as a rule do not make the organism more virulent.  That usually requires both a genetic shift (new genes) and bad luck (the organism getting the ‘right’ new genes) and this process is not affected by immunity.  So it seems unlikely that widespread use of the vaccine would lead to a superbug.  So you can potentially put immunologic pressure on influenza to change two ways: my getting the vaccine or by getting the flu.  Both will lead to antibody against the organism, but only one will make you sick and potentially pass the infection on to others. But the end result will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A NEW WORLD ORDER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this weird paranoid thread running through the internet that the government simultaneously wants widespread use of the vaccine to line the pockets of doctors and big pharma, and to control health care costs by releasing a laboratory derived influenza culling the ill who cost society the most, and to cause widespread panic so that the UN can take over the US and install a new world order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H1N1 is not going to be a very good way to either decrease costs or to cull the most susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, H1N1 is highly infectious but not particularly virulent.  While the 1919 H1N1 killed maybe 5% of the population, the current H1N1 has a &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/updates/us/#totalcases"&gt;mortality rate of 0.6%&lt;/a&gt;. Since this is based on hospitalized cases, the true death rate is probably much less.  The groups most at risk of dying from H1N1 are those less than 60 and healthy.  So if you were trying control costs by killing the most at risk, this is wrong strain of flu.  Not only is it relatively non fatal, it kills off those who have little impact on health costs and causes widespread morbidity, only increasing costs.  Of course, the government is incompetent, so leave it to them to do it all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Chair of our Infection Control committee, the hospital bylaws give me, in case of emergency, the powers to do anything I damn well please to control infection,  including isolating patients, shutting down hospital wings, and sending people home. And I have had the opportunity to do all the above, but never by myself.  At least in the hospital we work with consensus.  You don’t close a hospital wing lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States have also long had the power to compel people in infectious disease emergencies. I remember, and I am sure some of you will be appalled, as a resident we had a person with cavitary (read very infectious) tuberculosis who refused medications and was homeless (and crazy).  As a public health risk she was basically incarcerated in the hospital and forced to take Tb medications. It was not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting question to what extent the state will compel patients in the case of widespread contagion.  Hopefully they will not respond like the Italians to bubonic plague and brick people up in their houses, presumably with a cask of amontillado. It is also the case that our legislators, generally being ignorant of things medical and scientific, will pass stupid laws. Don’t get me started in mandatory MRSA screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do see the need for these laws as the history of plagues demonstrates that people do not necessarily exhibit their best behavior nor act rationally in an epidemic.  Fortunately, as this strain of flu is not usually fatal, calmness will probably prevail and we will not be turning our government over to the UN, although just how this is supposed to occur logistically is never stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLU WILL MELT MY IMMUNE SYSTEM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I do not want to call it the swine flu, besides the fact it is not really from swine, is that it hearkens back to 1976 when we last had a ’swine’ flu.  (I want to call it the rotting genitals flu, it may make the vaccine more desirable). With that vaccine was a bump in the incidence of &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=784"&gt;Guillain- Barre syndrome (GBS)&lt;/a&gt;, as disease where the insulation of your nerves falls off, leading to paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a good disease. Now as I write this on 9/8/9 there have been 598 deaths from H1N1. How many cases of Guillain- Barre syndrome were there in 1978 ?&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/463869?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=2&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt; 532 cases&lt;/a&gt; that occurred within 5 to 10 weeks of the vaccine in over 40 million vaccinations.  Why? No one knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As of 1976, &amp;gt;50 “antecedent events” had been identified in temporal relationship to GBS, events that were considered as possible factors in its cause. The list included viral infections, injections, and “being struck by lightning.” Whether or not any of the antecedents had a causal relationship to GBS was, and remains, unclear. When cases of GBS were identified among recipients of the swine flu vaccines, they were, of course, well covered by the press. Because GBS cases are always present in the population, the necessary public health questions concerning the cases among vaccine recipients were “Is the number of cases of GBS among vaccine recipients higher than would be expected? And if so, are the increased cases the result of increased surveillance or a true increase?” Leading epidemiologists debated these points, but the consensus, based on the intensified surveillance for GBS (and other conditions) in recipients of the vaccines, was that the number of cases of GBS appeared to be an excess. (&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol12no01/05-1007.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ref&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it the strain of flu? Was it the preparation?  Subsequent flu seasons have not seen an increase in GBS.  The current H1N1 is genetically distinct from the 1976 strain (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dd%20www.sciencemag.org/cgi/rapidpdf/1176225v1.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ref&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and there is no cross protection from the 1976 vaccine.  Given the strain difference and the improved production of vaccines, there is probably no reason to worry about increased risk of GBS with this vaccine.  Unfortunately we will know for sure until we have given 40 million doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t you love the uncertainty.  That’s the problem. I have to deal with uncertainties and probabilities of complex systems.  I know the estimates are that for every 1000 people who get H1N1, 40 may end up in the hospital and 1 may die.  With 300,000,000 Americans, that’s 30,000 deaths (standard for flu) and 120,000 in the hospital. Compare to 598 cases of GBS and 25 deaths in 1976. About as many as are &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5829a2.htm"&gt;trampled by cattle&lt;/a&gt; each year, but no one is getting rid of steak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s always a problem. Maybe 800 lives are saved by airbags a year; they kill maybe 20 people a year. Numbers vary.  So the greater risk is not having air bags,  and like many aspects of life, it is not all or nothing.  People expect vaccines to be all or nothing.  100% effective, zero risk. Humans are not good at  trying to decide what relative risk is.  Odds are far greater that you will get and die from H1N1 than the odds you will die from vaccine related GBS, assuming that the vaccine has the same risk as 1976, about the same risk as being killed by your airbags.   But we will not know with certainty until this time 2010.  People do not deal well with this kind of uncertainty. As Ed said, “Doctors say that Nordberg has a 50/50 chance of getting the flu, though there’s only a 10 percent chance of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health and influenza vaccines target populations by treating individuals, trying to do the most good for the most number of people. But real effects of influenza vaccination are on populations, and the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18959473?ordinalpos=17&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;more of a population is vaccinated, the better the population does. &lt;/a&gt; People miss part of the point when they look at sub groups and say, well, the vaccine only helps the elderly or pregnancy women.  It’s the old adage of the rising tide lifting all boats.  But my sense is that people are more selfish now than they were back in the last century, being unwilling to have 2 days of a sore arm to potentially prevent spread of a disease that may kill a stranger. Besides, they were old and going to die anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A NEW AND UNTESTED VACCINE IS BEING TESTED ON THE AMERICAN PUBLIC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is new, and it is untested. As the flu vaccine is every year. Or, more appropriately, it’s the same old flu with the same old vaccine.  Keeping with the car metaphor used above, we are not seeing a new form of transportation, just a new model of the same old car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes about 9 month to make a flu vaccine.  The first three months or so are spent deciding on what strains are to be included and if there are representative strains that grow well for vaccine production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the strains are chosen, it takes about 6 months to grow up large quantities of vaccine in chicken eggs.  Each dose of vaccine comes from one egg. And there is only one chicken that can make all those eggs and she gets tired. Then the vaccine is purified to just the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin  proteins that are in the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fast track we have now is due to a lucky confluence of factors. First, industry had just finished making this years seasonal flu vaccine so they had the unexpected capacity to churn out vaccine.  But more importantly they had a jump on picking the strain.  They did not have to guess which strains to include, they knew it was H1N1, so that gave them a three month head start.  That is the main reason we have the H1N1 vaccine in record time.  The process of growing  the influenza and purifying it is preceding at the usual pace.  We we just lucky that we were able to know the exact strain and it occurred when we had the capacity to make extra vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while it is being produced at a faster rate, it is not because they are skimping on the steps in the production, it is because we got lucky.  As an aside, I am told that the strain they are using for the vaccine is not the best at growing in chicken eggs and is a reason the vaccine will not be ready until mid October. Evidently it does not grow as robustly in chicken eggs as they would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as anyone can tell, they is nothing special about the H1N1 strain (and they have looked at it closely) to suggest there is anything  unique about it except that it is immunologically new (at least since 1950’s, when the H1N1 progenitors were last seen in humans).  This H1N1 in part can be traced back to the 1918 strain and explains why those over 60 have a decreased death rate rather than the usual increased mortality from influenza: old people have cross reacting antibodies to the strain that is protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strain is only new to people born since about 1950, which is billions of people at risk with no immunity. But as far as virulence and antigenicity, it is the same old influenza, re-assorting its RNA to come up with new strains as it has always done  and will continue to do as long as there are people pigs and birds around to get influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H1N1 is fundamentally the same as any other flu that we have been making vaccine against for as long was he have been making vaccine. It is undergoing the same testing we have used every year and there is no reason to suspect that we should be doing otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am nervous. Fall is coming.  If  H1N1 comes again (and pandemics have swept through the world several times in one year, the 1919 flu may have had three peaks) before the vaccine, we could be in a world of hurt.  Not a lot of deaths by US standards (we lose that 30,000 or so to guns or car accidents every year, just like flu).   I have spent a career watching people suffer and occasionally die of potentially preventable illnesses.  I am not a fan of death by infection.  I hope the vaccine is widely available and widely used so that people live to die at a later date by  “a parachute not opening… that’s a way to die. Getting caught in the gears of a combine… having your nuts bit off by a Laplander, that’s the way I wanna go!” But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

Luckily for me, there isn&amp;#39;t much (1a, 1b).Well that&amp;#39;s not entirely true. I did come across this study titled, &amp;quot;公司已在美国启动供给N0的前列腺素&amp;quot; (2), and this one, &amp;quot;使用静脉注射免疫球蛋白&amp;quot; (3). At least, I think those are research articles..., I&amp;#39;m not quite sure.Anyway, the great news is that there are plenty of press releases (4, 5) to extol the virtues of this drug prior to it being reviewed by the FDA and the psychiatric community (I just made myself laugh, that never happens 6).Here are some quotes from this press releases:&amp;quot;lurasidone was well-tolerated and had a relatively low discontinuation rate.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Lurasidone&amp;#39;s effect on weight was similar to placebo (median change 0.3 kg for overall lurasidone group vs. 0 kg for placebo) as was its effect on lipid and glucose measures. Lurasidone was also well tolerated with a lower overall discontinuation rate (31%) compared to placebo (43%) and few adverse event-related discontinuations (6% and 2% for the overall lurasidone group and placebo, respectively).&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Adverse events seen in the trial were generally mild. The most commonly reported adverse events for lurasidone (greater than 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were akathisia (17.6% vs. 3.1% placebo), somnolence (11.7% vs. 5.5%), parkinsonism (6.8% vs. 0), and increased weight (5.1% vs. 2.4%).&amp;quot;&amp;quot;The development program for lurasidone is intended to establish efficacy for the core symptoms of schizophrenia, characterize its safety profile and explore its effects in the treatment of cognitive impairment and other areas not adequately addressed by current therapies&amp;quot;&amp;quot;If you look at the weight gain, the lipid changes, it&amp;#39;s among the most benign of any antipsychotic drugs, clearly better than olanzapine, clozapine and Seroquel&amp;quot;&amp;quot;From the point of view of efficacy and side effect profile, once a day administration, the fact that the lower dose works as well as the higher dose, I think this is going to have a very good chance of major acceptance among my colleagues&amp;quot;Douche bag.That last quote is from this press release (5), and that lower dose he is referring to is 40mg. I guess he didn&amp;#39;t read this press release (4), which reported this, &amp;quot;also evaluated two other fixed doses of lurasidone, 40 mg/day and 120 mg/day, which did not demonstrate separation from placebo on the PANSS or CGI-S at study endpoint.&amp;quot;Here are the reported adverse events from this article (1):From the press releases, &amp;quot;The most commonly reported adverse events for lurasidone (greater than 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were akathisia (17.6% vs. 3.1% placebo), somnolence (11.7% vs. 5.5%), parkinsonism (6.8% vs. 0), and increased weight (5.1% vs. 2.4%).&amp;quot;&amp;quot;The most common adverse events reported at a frequency of at least 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo among the combined lurasidone doses in these trials were akathisia (11.6% vs. 4.7% placebo), somnolence (14.3% vs. 7.1%) and nausea (14.8% vs. 6.1%).&amp;quot;Then there is this beauty, &amp;quot;the adverse events were generally mild, such as restlessness and sleepiness.&amp;quot; That last statement just made my third testicle descend.All side effects are from the 80mg dose.The above-referenced study had a relatively small sample size (n=90), which I think downplays the akathisia (8.9%), while the summarized studies in the press releases are larger (n=500 &amp;amp; n=392) and have the high rates of akathisia.Important Point: Akathisia is not a MILD side effect. Just asked anyone who has ever experienced it.&amp;quot;These data showed that lurasidone was well tolerated with a low propensity for EPS.&amp;quot;More Important Point: Akathisia and parkinsonism ARE extrapyramidal symptoms.Here are the side effect profiles from two other antipsychotic drugs:asenapine &amp;amp; risperidoneiloperidone &amp;amp; haloperidolWow, lurasidone has a higher report rate of akathisia than haloperidol! (17.6% versus 13.6%). Correction, that&amp;#39;s high (really high) dose haloperidol (15mg) . Taken together, lurasidone does not look any different, just more of the same.&amp;quot;Zyprexa and similar drugs can cause significant weight gain and have been linked to increased risk of diabetes...Lurasidone was well tolerated with a discontinuation rate nearly identical to placebo -- 40 percent versus 39 percent.&amp;quot; Have they forgotten that there already is a class of drugs that do not cause those severe metabolic changes? They&amp;#39;re the first generation antipsychotics.&amp;quot;...but this class of drugs as a whole is so superior to the first generation drugs said Meltzer.&amp;quot; In what way is that Dr. Meltzer? Efficacy? No. Side effects? Nope. Patient tolerance? No again.I&amp;#39;m feeling the need to be sued for defamation: Dr. Meltzer is a flabby bag of douche!There&amp;#39;s no point in reviewing the efficacy results here. Just read any random antipsychotic clinical trial. The numbers are all the same. No new psychiatric drug, antidepresant, antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, whatever, has been shown to be more effective than its predecessors in a clinically meaningful way.Key points to remember:1. This drug is being pushed as safer. So is asenapine and iloperidone. So will any new drug on the horizon. It&amp;#39;s marketing. You don&amp;#39;t manipulate the identical set of brain receptors and get less side effects. You only get different side effects.2. The majority of the authors on these study are employees of the pharma company sponsoring the trial. The same is true for the asenapine and iloperidone studies. That&amp;#39;s called bias. Double blind does not mean a damn thing.3. The remainder of the second generation antipsychotics are becoming generic. That means they will be prescribed less. That means there will be a void, which can be filled by newer more expensive drugs. Si...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Wilson responded to a recent Obama address to Congress on health care by shouting out in the middle of it, "&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/10/obama.heckled.speech/index.html"&gt;You lie&lt;/a&gt;!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial thinking is that I am disappointed that the biggest criticism of Wilson's comment is that he was uncivil or disrespectful.  I think the bigger issue is not whether Wilson was rude, but whether he was correct.  A recent opinion piece on CNN contends that &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/10/feehery.heckle.obama/index.html"&gt;we shouldn't heckle&lt;/a&gt; to president because of the respect the office demands.  The article's writer John Feehery goes as far to equate respect afforded to the office of president with that of monarch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;While Congress is the first branch named in the Constitution, the president is the commander-in-chief, the leader of the country, and in many unspoken ways treated as a king.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We stand when the president enters the room, no matter who the president is. He has his own tune when he goes anywhere. When he gives a speech, his seal is on the lectern. The president is treated with royal respect, even though he is overtly not a royal. Ever since George Washington declined to become a king, we have established traditions that give the president all the kingly trappings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the queen addresses the British Parliament, she is accorded ritualized decorum and respect, firmly rooted in history and precedent. It is not so different here in America. In our nation's rituals, we treat the president with the respect befitting the office, no matter who the current occupant might be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what our founding fathers would think of this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, as I continue to percolate on issues of civility and decorum, I invite you to participate in a brief activity.  Below are two images from Obama's address.  I invite you to fill in the speech/thought bubbles..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of the captions I find most endearing will win my undying respect and admiration.  Or, at least a promise to not be called an assclown for at least a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What more can you ask of me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/09/the_presidency_and_the_call_to/Obama%20v%20Wilson.jpg" alt="Obama v Wilson.jpg" height="193" width="515"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, it just bugs me that the Circle I took over four years ago is now counted as "venerable." Oh, well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, this time around, it's at Cubik's Rube (great name for a blog, BTW), and it's a rip-roaring tale in which our host conjures a god. I kid you not. He really does. But he ends up...well, you'll just have to check out the &lt;a href="http://cubiksrube.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/the-119th-skeptics-circle/"&gt;119th Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt; to find out what happens. I will say no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don't forget that a mere two weeks hence, on September 24, the 120th Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle will appear at an old stalwart favorite, &lt;a href="http://kriswager.blogspot.com"&gt;Pro-Science&lt;/a&gt;. Get your skeptical fingers a'tappin' on your keyboard and lay down some more fantastic skeptical blogging for Kristjan Wager to use as raw material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, if you ever want to host one of these puppies, peruse the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/07/skeptics-circle-reloaded.html"&gt;guidelines for hosts&lt;/a&gt; and then drop me a line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/reading_the_entrails_the_119th_meeting_o.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/dYH1v69Idu0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252642668392"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/you_knew_it_was_coming.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa7ea7e4c3d4f7d8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment/culture"/><title type="html">You knew it was coming...</title><published>2009-09-11T03:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T03:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/6-2Uww0r5lY/you_knew_it_was_coming.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/you_knew_it_was_coming.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;...Hitler is most displeased with President Obama and what he did earlier this week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;PLoS Medicine turns 5 years old on October 19th, 2009. To highlight the crucial importance of open access in medical publishing we're holding a competition to find the best medical paper published under an open-access license anywhere (not just in PLoS) since our launch.

&lt;p&gt;Vote for your choice from the 6 competing papers, detailed below -- nominated and then shortlisted by our editorial board.  Winners will be announced during Open-Access week (19-23rd October 2009).  If you're interested in how we came up with this shortlist of top-quality open-access medicine papers, please read on below the poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Hare spends a lot of time in Africa studying chimpanzees and bonobos, he also studies dogs. The social intelligence of dogs is not just interesting in itself, but also for the clues it offers about how we evolved. It’s possible that wolves became dogs in much the same way our chimp-like ancestors became human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the newest issue of &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve written a feature about canine cognition, and scientists like Hare who are trying to plumb its depths. &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1921614-1,00.html"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The English media is full of articles about the Dmanisi fossils, based on a talk by David Lordkipanidze at the British Science Festival. The articles mention the discovery of five or six specimens, with some giving the impression that these are new discoveries. The &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/09/did-early-humans-evolve-in-eur.html" rel="external "&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt; commented that “it’s not clear whether Lordkipanidze was presenting new data, or simply wrapping up the story so far for a more lay audience at the festival.”  However some of the other newspapers such as the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/sep/08/fossils-georgia-dmanisi-early-humans" rel="external "&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; clarified that most of these fossils were discovered early this decade, along with another recent discovery that is not yet published. According to &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,548541,00.html" rel="external "&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;, this recent find is “a fifth well-preserved skull, the most complete yet”, which will make it a spectacular fossil. This is probably the specimen shown a photo in many of the articles, still half-embedded in rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is usual, a number of newspapers somewhat overstated the significance of the find, especially the &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1212060/Ancient-skeletons-discovered-Georgia-threaten-overturn-theory-human-evolution.html?ITO=1490" rel="external "&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; with its headline “Ancient skeletons discovered in Georgia threaten to overturn the theory of human evolution”. This is highly misleading. The Dmanisi fossils are a tremendous discovery, and may well change our ideas about some details of where, when, and how we evolved, but they’re certainly not going to overturn the idea of human evolution. They are actually superb evidence &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dmanisi hominids are from the country of Georgia (&lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/d2700.html" rel="external "&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/d2700.html" rel="external "&gt;http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/d2700.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  A number of skulls have been found so far, ranging from about 850 cc (the lower end of the &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; range) down to 600 cc (well into the &lt;em&gt;H. habilis&lt;/em&gt; range).  In 2007, details of some skeletal material was published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain sizes of these skulls straddle the gap that creationists like to claim exists between humans and australopithecines. The skulls are also intermediate anatomically, looking like primitive &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; skulls with some &lt;em&gt;habilis&lt;/em&gt; features. The same is true of the skeletal material: the creatures were indisputably bipedal, but have a number of primitive features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, creationists don’t have a clue what these fossils are. Some of them think they’re humans, some think they’re apes, and, as I blogged last year, they’re both wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/11/dmanisi-postcranial.html" rel=""&gt;Dmanisi fossils - more transitional than ever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/12/dmanisi-and-aig.html" rel=""&gt;Dmanisi and Answers in Genesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; In the initial version of this post, I thought the articles were referring to new fossil discoveries, which turned out to be (mostly) not the case, so the post has been corrected accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

Here is the full statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2009 has been a year of deep reflection - a chance for Britain, as a nation, to commemorate the profound debts we owe to those who came before. A unique combination of anniversaries and events have stirred in us that sense of pride and gratitude which characterise the British experience. Earlier this year I stood with Presidents Sarkozy and Obama to honour the service and the sacrifice of the heroes who stormed the beaches of Normandy 65 years ago. And just last week, we marked the 70 years which have passed since the British government declared its willingness to take up arms against Fascism and declared the outbreak of World War Two. So I am both pleased and proud that, thanks to a coalition of computer scientists, historians and LGBT activists, we have this year a chance to mark and celebrate another contribution to Britain's fight against the darkness of dictatorship; that of code-breaker Alan Turing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Turing was a quite brilliant mathematician, most famous for his work on breaking the German Enigma codes. It is no exaggeration to say that, without his outstanding contribution, the history of World War Two could well have been very different. He truly was one of those individuals we can point to whose unique contribution helped to turn the tide of war. The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying, therefore, that he was treated so inhumanely. In 1952, he was convicted of 'gross indecency' - in effect, tried for being gay. His sentence - and he was faced with the miserable choice of this or prison - was chemical castration by a series of injections of female hormones. He took his own life just two years later.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated. While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him. Alan and the many thousands of other gay men who were convicted as he was convicted under homophobic laws were treated terribly. Over the years millions more lived in fear of conviction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am proud that those days are gone and that in the last 12 years this government has done so much to make life fairer and more equal for our LGBT community. This recognition of Alan's status as one of Britain's most famous victims of homophobia is another step towards equality and long overdue.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But even more than that, Alan deserves recognition for his contribution to humankind. For those of us born after 1945, into a Europe which is united, democratic and at peace, it is hard to imagine that our continent was once the theatre of mankind's darkest hour. It is difficult to believe that in living memory, people could become so consumed by hate - by anti-Semitism, by homophobia, by xenophobia and other murderous prejudices - that the gas chambers and crematoria became a piece of the European landscape as surely as the galleries and universities and concert halls which had marked out the European civilisation for hundreds of years. It is thanks to men and women who were totally committed to fighting fascism, people like Alan Turing, that the horrors of the Holocaust and of total war are part of Europe's history and not Europe's present.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/alan_turing_gets_an_apology.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/VeCwpxTq04M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252629009968"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/10/paradox/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/63e392cb95b01c2d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Miscellaneous"/><title type="html">Paradox</title><published>2009-09-10T23:32:08Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T23:32:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/10/paradox/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheKissingBook"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to keep abreast of the ongoing discussions among my former &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/"&gt;sciblings&lt;/a&gt;.

(Friday 13:40 MT): More bad weather in Florida is forcing a landing at Edwards Air Force base in California. De-orbit burn will be at 19:47 EDT (23:47 GMT) and touchdown at 20:53 EDT (00:53 GMT).]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad weather at the Florida Shuttle landing site has forced a delay in the landing of &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; until Friday. The first attempt will be for a touchdown at 17:48 EDT (21:48 GMT), and a second possibility at 19:23 EDT (23:23 GMT). They will have to do a de-orbit burn at 16:45 (20:45 GMT) for the first landing attempt, so I’ll be here around then live tweeting it on &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/BANews"&gt;my BANews Twitter stream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather forecast is no better tomorrow, and may be worse, so NASA may have to call up the landing site at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The Orbiter can only stay up so long with limited supplies, so bad weather in Florida may force them to land on the west coast. We’ll know more as landing time approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252628241231"><id gr:original-id="http://journowl.com/index.php/archives/627">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc5ce06568b79489</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The cheaper sex and extinction…for Imperial Eagles</title><published>2009-09-10T16:19:37Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T16:19:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/H6Nvr0Qievg/627" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://journowl.com/index.php/archives/627"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Manipulating egg quality and brood mates  is a strategy that is not uncommon for birds.  In fact, this is an important tactic in the survival of species when food is scarce and territories are poor.  The idea is that deteriorating environmental conditions will drive parents to invest more resources in the sex that maximizes their [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

And although some of these organs may have a function (the appendix, for example, is now thought to play a small role in the immune system), the fact of functionality doesn’t detract from their vestigiality — or their usefulness as evidence for common ancestry.  The fact that the penguin’s “wings” now serve as flippers doesn’t mean that they say nothing about penguins’ ancestry from birds that could fly.  (My own definition of a vestigial trait is loosely  “a trait that now serves a function completely different from what impelled its initial evolution, and for which traces of its original structure still remain.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, anyway, some vestigial organs appear to have no function at all.  You’d be hard pressed to claim that there was a function for the tiny nub-like wings of the kiwi bird, buried deep within the feathers on its flanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you’d be even harder pressed to argue that dead &lt;em&gt;genes &lt;/em&gt;have a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the predictions of evolution is that if vestigial organs exist, then surely vestigial &lt;em&gt;genes &lt;/em&gt;must exist, for traits that shrink or disappear must surely be based, at least sometimes, on genes that disappear.  But genes aren’t just snipped out of the DNA when they’re no longer needed: natural selection will inactivate them,  usually by favoring a mutation that removes one or a few DNA bases (a deletion), putting in a “stop codon” (a change in the DNA that prematurely terminates the protein being read from that DNA’s code, making a “frameshift” mutation (changing the triplet code so that the entire coding frame of a DNA sequence is thrown off), or changing the regulatory region of a gene so its protein is no longer made.  But the remnants of the gene will remain in the DNA, testifying to its ancestry from a gene that was active in an ancestor. These dead genes are called &lt;em&gt;pseudogenes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that genome sequencing is routine, evolutionists can do large-scale searches for dead genes.  And, as predicted, they’re all over the place — in nearly every species that has been examined. Some of the “dead” genes I discuss in &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt; include human genes that used to make vitamin C or egg yolk in our ancestors, but have now been rendered mute.  It would be hard to argue that these genes still have a “function,” for they produce no protein at all. Their existence is a powerful argument in favor of evolution and against creationism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000634"&gt;new paper in &lt;em&gt;PLoS Genetics&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;continues the search for predicted dead genes — this time for genes that once made tooth enamel — and finds a lot of these wrecks. They’re exactly where you expect to find them — in toothless animals long thought to have descended from animals with teeth.  So the “theory” of evolution is once again confirmed, although we hardly need further confirmation.  But this paper goes beyond a mere redudant proof of common ancestry.  The authors also make models of how the “enamel” genes degenerated, and, by calculating when this degeneration happened, predict what the teeth of common ancestors should look like.  This prediction is in principle testable by finding the relevant fossils and looking at their teeth.,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of mammals that lack tooth enamel: those that are completely toothless (e.g., armadillos, pangolins, aardvarks, baleen whales), and those that have teeth that lack enamel (e.g., dwarf sperm whales, two-toed sloth).   From other evidence, including fossils and comparative morphology, scientists have confidently predicted that every one of these species descended from ancestors that had enameled teeth. The researchers sequenced, in many mammals species, the critical gene enamelin (ENAM), which helps deposit hydroxyapetite into the tooth. If ENAM is knocked out in mice, enamel doesn’t form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, in every species lacking teeth or enameled teeth, ENAM was rendered nonfunctional, either by the accumulation of frameshift mutations or stop codons.  The authors give a very nice graph of how the genes have degenerated in each lineage, which I show below (the caption is at the bottom of this post if you’re a geneticist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Mammal teeth" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/mammal-teeth1.jpg?w=744&amp;amp;h=844" alt="Mammal teeth" width="744" height="844"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;.  Enamelin gene phylogeny for mammal species with no teeth, un-enameled teeth, or fully enameled teeth (tooth type illustrated at right, before species name).  Caption for this figure, showing the various genetic changes that have inactivated ENAM, is at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s evidence for evolution and common ancestry, and it’s neat.  But we hardly need more evidence of this type to support Darwinism, because there are many such reports of pseudobenes. What makes the paper unique is the authors’ model of how and when ENAM was inactivated in several lineages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details are complicated, but in essence the authors modeled a two-step process of gene evolution: before the mutation inactivating ENAM (whose occurrence can be estimated from the gene tree), and thereafter.  Before inactivation the gene was assumed to evolve slowly since gene changes were largely  deleterious.  After inactivation, the gene evolved faster — since it was no longer making a useful product, changes were assumed to accumulate “neutrally” (that is, all changes carried neither selective penalty nor advantage).  This analysis made several predictions. One of them is that ancestral xenarthans (armadillos, sloths, and anteaters), had teeth with enamel, even though living representatives don’t.  This is a testable prediction: find early ‘basal” xenarthans, and look at their teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that after the gene was inactivated, it was assumed to degenerate through the accumulation of random, neutal mutations.  This is a valid assumption for gene inactivation, but not necessarily for the disappearance or shrinkage of entire traits.  If a trait is no longer useful, there are actually three ways it can degnerate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. As posited for genes, the accumulation of inactivating mutations, which carry no penalty since they affect a trait that makes no contribution to reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  Traits can degenerate through positive natural selection.  One way is simply that an animal (or plant) can be seen as an economic compromise among biological materials, and if you don’t need a feature, selection can favor rerouting its building blocks to other features.  The material used to build the wing of a flightless bird, for example, could be diverted to making or strengthening bones in other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Likewise, traits that are no longer useful might be easily injured.  Selection would then favor degeneration of that trait as a way of preventing injury.  This may, for example, explain the reduced  eyes of cave fauna or burrowing animals like moles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t easy to distinguish between these hypotheses.  One way is to find a bunch of genes involved in the trait’s degeneration and, by sequencing them, see if the DNA has changed by natural selection since the trait was no longer useful. (There are statistical tests for this, though they have some problems.)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caption for Fig. 1&lt;/strong&gt; (above), from Meredith et al.: Figure 1. Species tree with frameshift mutations and dN/dS branch coding. Symbols next to taxon names denote taxa having teeth with enamel, taxa having teeth without enamel, and edentulous taxa. Branches are functional (black), pre-mutation (blue), mixed (purple), and pseudogenic (red). Vertical bars on branches represent frameshift mutations (see Table S1). Frameshifts that map unambiguously onto branches are shown in black. Frameshifts shown in white are unique, but occur in regions where sequences are missing for one or more taxa (Figure S7) and were arbitrarily mapped onto the youngest possible branch. Homoplastic frameshifts (deltran optimization) are marked by numbers. Numbers after taxon names indicate the minimum number of stop codons in the sequence (before slashes) and the length of the sequence (after slashes).&lt;/p&gt;

The articles are intended for a broad audience and cover everything from neural coding to computational modeling of pandemic influenza outbreaks.  In the last couple of years, language issues have been appearing fairly regularly (see sample references below).  What I particularly like about the format is that authors are not restricted to x journal pages and are allowed to develop their arguments fully so that hopefully the reader can get an accessible and thorough overview of the issues.

As previously reported by heartwire, journal editors requested a correction from the authors after questions were raised—most notably by one of the original investigators for MIST—about details purportedly missing from the publication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The correction by Dr Andrew Dowson (Kings College Hospital, London, UK) and colleagues appeared online Monday August 31, 2009, and the online version of the article has been updated to reflect the changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MIST was the first randomized, sham-controlled trial to investigate patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure as a treatment for migraine; the study failed to show a benefit of PFO closure. Garnering even more attention than the study results, however, have been questions from physicians both within and outside of the study about the design and conduct of the study and the airing of its results. The study sponsor, NMT Medical, is currently suing one of the original co-PIs for MIST, Dr Peter Wilmshurst (Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, UK), for concerns he raised to heartwire about how MIST data were being managed.&lt;h3&gt;The disputed echo reviews&lt;/h3&gt;Wilmshurst, along with his Shrewsbury Hospital colleague Dr Simon Nightingale, refused to sign off on the manuscript before it was submitted for publication and are not included as authors. Following the publication of MIST in Circulation, Wilmshurst contacted the journal about his concerns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conspicuously absent from the correction is information about an "off-protocol" review of the echocardiographic information that suggested a higher residual shunting rate following PFO closure than that reported by Dowson at the TCT 2007 meeting. Dowson reported a 94% closure rate—derived, as per trial protocol, from the follow-up conducted by the implanting cardiologist. Wilmshurst, however, says he conducted an after-the-fact review of echocardiograms, at NMT's behest, which suggested residual shunting in approximately one-third of patients. A residual shunt can point to either incomplete device closure of the PFO or to the presence of pulmonary shunts not properly identified at baseline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both Dowson and NMT originally denied to heartwire that this echo review had ever taken place (repeatedly insisting that it was not part of the trial protocol) and rejected Wilmshurst's suggestion that NMT had asked investigators to send their echos to him to review. Another trial investigator, however, Dr Michael Mullen (Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK), subsequently confirmed to heartwire that a review had indeed been undertaken but insisted the information did not belong in the MIST paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asked by heartwire why information about the disputed echo review is not mentioned in the correction, Circulation issued a statement saying, "The Circulation editors were unaware of this controversy during the review of the paper; however, they investigated the matter at the same time that they investigated Dr Wilmshurst's other claims, and they decided that this information did not belong in the paper."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also contacted by heartwire, Wilmshurst responded with a written statement:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:#cc0000"&gt;"The correction of the MIST paper states that I did not sign the Copyright Transfer Agreement because of an internal disagreement about the conduct of study. In an email to Dr Dowson in October 2007, I gave two reasons for refusing to sign the Copyright Transfer Agreement. First, that the paper contained errors, which are confirmed by this correction. Second, that I could not in conscience sign the declaration, [which reads] 'The authors had full access to the data and take responsibility for its integrity.' To sign a declaration knowing it to be false would make me guilty of a criminal offence in the United Kingdom. In November 2007, NMT's lawyer wrote to me: 'No investigator is given a full detailed set of all the data.' For 18 months I pressed Circulation for a correction. I sent the editor hundreds of pages of documents, including a copy of my email to Dr Dowson. All of the errors and omissions in the correction are ones that I reported to Circulation, but not all errors and omissions that I reported have been corrected. In addition, the contributions of some who did little in the study, including an 'author' who died in May 2004, before the trial started, are credited, but the contributions of Dr Nightingale and I, who helped design the trial, were members of the steering committee, wrote the early draft of the paper, and did over 600 of the 2000 patient visits in the trial, are not acknowledged."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NMT chief financial officer Richard Davis, also commenting on the correction for heartwire, emphasized that the "clarifications were made on request of the editors of the journal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The correction that appears in the journal Circulation includes a single error in the reference to a histogram contained in the original manuscript. No changes to the results, analysis, or conclusions of the study are made. The remainder of the published correction contains clarifications, many of which were not included in the original manuscript due to the word-count limitations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"To comply with these word-count requirements, the manuscript focused specifically on the critical elements of the trial design and results. All serious adverse events were listed; other information was excluded that was deemed irrelevant to the findings regarding the effect of PFO closure on migraine. One procedural embolization in a cohort of 74 patients is not uncommon for these types of devices, and retrieval of a device due to poor positioning followed by replacement with a second device, as happened in two cases, is also not unusual. It is important to note that these procedural difficulties were not considered serious by the investigator or the safety committee of the study."&lt;h3&gt;Clearing the MIST&lt;/h3&gt;The correction runs over 700 words long, with a four-page data supplement, and addresses what Dowson and colleagues term "a number of errors and omissions," including:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An explanation of why Wilmshurst and Nightingale were not listed as authors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An expanded description of how intracardiac shunts were assessed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clarification on specific adverse events related to failure to find or cross a PFO, two cases of device embolization, and one nondeployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New information on patients who withdrew from the study and why.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A correction to the units used for number of migraine days per month for Figure 3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reiteration of the reasons for excluding two patients from an analysis looking at median total migraine days and the calculations used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clarification that the authors' conflicts of interest information provided in the article was accurate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;To this last point, the correction states: "The authors confirm that they disclosed all relevant relationships and potential conflicts of interest that were present during the two years leading up to manuscript submission, as required by the American Heart Association." The Circulation manuscript itself notes that two study authors—Mullen and Dr David Hildick-Smith (Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, UK) have ownership interests in NMT Medical and that Mullen has received teaching honoraria and has acted as a consultant to NMT, but that the remaining authors report no disclosures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of note, at the time of Dowson's October 2007 TCT presentation, he disclosed that he had received grant/research support from NMT, and Davis estimated in an interview with heartwire shortly after Dowson's presentation that up to 10 study investigators and/or steering committee members had received consulting fees from the company. Wilmshurst once told heartwire that he and Nightingale had turned down offers for "large" consultancy payments from NMT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dowson A, Mullen MJ, Peatfield R, et al.

His seminal work, &lt;i&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt;, revolutionized the biological sciences and led to a tension between science and religion that still exists today. The story is ripe for the biopic treatment, and director Jon Amiel obliges with &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974014"&gt;Creation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, debuting tomorrow at the Toronto International Film Festival.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The film's stellar cast includes Paul Bettany as Darwin and Jennifer Connelly as his wife (and cousin) Emma. It tells the story of "a global revolution played out within the confines of a small English village; a passionate marriage torn apart by the most dangerous idea in history; and a theory saved from extinction by the logic of a child."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The child in question is Darwin's beloved daughter, Annie, who died when she 10, possibly of tuberculosis. &lt;i&gt;Creation&lt;/i&gt; is based on the bestselling biography by Randal Keynes (Darwin's great-great-nephew), &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Annies-Box-Charles-Daughter-Evolution/dp/1841150606"&gt;Annie's Box&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which paints an exquisite picture of Darwin the man, as well as Darwin the scientist. (Annie's box was a writing case made of red moroccan leather, into which treasured mementos from her life were placed after she died.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Indeed, according to Keynes, Darwin's "private life and science were all of a piece." Annie's death affected him deeply; his theory of evolution was well-developed by the time she died, and among other concerns, Darwin worried that he may have passed on genetic weaknesses to his daughter that ultimately led to her death. Although he rarely mentioned Annie for much of his life, in an interview some 35 years later, he could still recall her very first smile when she was just 8 weeks old. Any parent could relate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's a compelling story of a human being who happens to be a scientist, as well as demonstrating what it cost Darwin to be true to his scientific instincts. Among other themes, the film details the inevitable conflict between Darwin's stubborn adherence to natural selection and his wife's religious devotion, not to mention the local community. Science is rife with these wonderful human stories. May &lt;i&gt;Creation&lt;/i&gt; be just one of many more films that tell them.

&lt;p&gt;The message — “It’s official… God does not exist” — was up there for several hours, ironically, next to a Mormon church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the message itself is as big a deal as the news story would have you think, but it is disturbing to know that some atheist could’ve done this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or… if anyone wants to play conspiracy theorist, we can suggest a religious person did this in the hopes that atheists would get blamed.  I’m not so cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the way to get our message across.  It’s not funny and it doesn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know how to get bus ads and billboards and we’ve been doing a great job of putting them up in cities everywhere.  There’s no reason to resort to such lowbrow (and illegal) tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

After that post went up, a reader helpfully hooked me up with a PDF of District Judge Joseph M. Hood's ruling on the case (&lt;em&gt;Chandok v. Klessig&lt;/em&gt;, 5:05-cv-01076).  There is a lot of interesting stuff here, and I'm working on a longer examination of the judge's reasoning in the ruling.  But, in the interim, I thought you might be interested in the statements made by the defendant in the case, Dr. Daniel F. Klessig, that the plaintiff in the case, Dr. Meena Chandok, alleged were defamatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer post I'm working on, I'll dig in to Judge Hood's arguments with respect to what elements a plaintiff must establish to prove defamation, and what particular features of the scientific arena were germane to his ruling in this case.  For the time being, however, I'm interested to hear what you all think about whether the 23 allegedly defamatory claims quoted below tend "to expose the plaintiff to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, or disgrace." (13)  As well, given that one element of defamation is that the defamatory statements are &lt;em&gt;factually false&lt;/em&gt;, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the evidentiary standard a scientist should have to meet before making claims like these to other scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here, quoted from the ruling, are the 23 allegedly defamatory statements:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/do_these_claims_look_defamator.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/do_these_claims_look_defamator.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/8_S3y7vk5OU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252618195425"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/10/canine-cognition/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9456e7d375a916a6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Culture"/><category term="Media and Science"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Canine Cognition</title><published>2009-09-10T20:39:19Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T20:39:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/10/canine-cognition/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1914016_1917154,00.html" title="tassie.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/09/tassie.jpg" alt="tassie.jpg" align="right" height="193" width="204"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Remember little &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2008/11/08/weekend-tasmania/"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;?

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/223385main1_wfc3_classic_570x498.jpg" width="500" title="Can you believe someone installed this in space?" alt="223385main1_wfc3_classic_570x498.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why would you bother to go there?  After all, you know that I'll just show you all the gorgeousness here!  Hubble is an astounding telescope, because it's so good for viewing things that are both incredibly close and incredibly far.  So here are the highlights!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, Hubble can take incredible pictures of our Solar System.  Remember that Jupiter recently got hit by an asteroid?  Take a look at the big black debris spot by the South Pole, and see it as Hubble sees it.  (And click all images for the large -- but not super-large -- versions.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-bb-web_print.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-bb-web_print.jpg" width="500" title="And this, too, will fade away soon!" alt="hs-2009-25-bb-web_print.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second?  Going out a little farther, into the stars nearest us, such as by the Carina nebula, we can see dusty, star-forming regions (thanks to the new infrared camera) along with the visible stars there!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-k-large_web.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-k-large_web.jpg" width="500" title="How amazing is this one?" alt="hs-2009-25-k-large_web.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prefer to look at a star that's recently gone supernova?  Well, supernovae leave remnants behind, known as planetary nebulae.  The dusty debris gets illuminated by all the light and heat from the explosion, and the "butterfly" shape shown here is spectacular.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-f-large_web.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-f-large_web.jpg" width="500" title="If my eyes could only see as well as this new camera..." alt="hs-2009-25-f-large_web.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And moving out of our galaxy just a little bit?  To the globular clusters that surround us?  This collection of a few hundred thousand stars within just a few light years, Omega Centauri, has never been imaged to this accuracy, this quality, or with this resolution.  But check out what Hubble has done!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-d-large_web.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-d-large_web.jpg" width="500" title="It reminds me of New York City at night, during Christmas." alt="hs-2009-25-d-large_web.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure, we can check out other galaxies, like Stephan's Quintet.  And Hubble sends back pictures so convincing that you can &lt;i&gt;immediately&lt;/i&gt; tell which galaxy of these doesn't belong!  (It's actually 7 times closer than other others; can you tell which one it is?)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-x-web_print.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-x-web_print.jpg" width="500" title="The pinkish-white galaxy -- the only undisturbed spiral -- is actually 7 times closer than the remaining members of the quintet." alt="hs-2009-25-x-web_print.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we want to go very far away, even clusters of distant galaxies are no problem for Hubble.  Check out what cluster Abell 370 looks like with the newly repaired Advanced Camera for Surveys!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-ao-web_print.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/the_new_and_improved_hubble_in/hs-2009-25-ao-web_print.jpg" width="500" title="Still just amazing, isn&amp;#39;t it?" alt="hs-2009-25-ao-web_print.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
God Chose Memphis as the place that I will continue my career.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, God wasn’t feeling too confident because Iverson only signed a one-year contract with the team.  The Memphis Grizzlies were &lt;a href="http://myespn.go.com/blogs/truehoop/0-44-29/Allen-Iverson-s-Grizzly-Liaison.html"&gt;ranked among the worst&lt;/a&gt; NBA teams over the past few years, never winning more than 25 games in a season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts are also &lt;a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/chris_mannix/09/09/allen.iverson/"&gt;not very optimistic&lt;/a&gt; about this pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering Iverson is also coming off one of the worst seasons in his career, maybe Iverson should be thanking Memphis instead for taking him at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Hector&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just quit something. Guess what it was? HINT: Starts with a “J” and rhymes with “schmob.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people responded with “Congrats!” and some with “Congrats?,” and some with other various questions. I figured I’d explain myself here to put it all out there. Apologies for the meta-ness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past ten years or so, I’ve worked as a copywriter for various companies in various industries. My most recent position was working for a women’s clothing company, and before that it was a construction company. So yeah, I’m pretty flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current(ly ending) position could have gone on indefinitely, but the fact of the matter is that it is no longer fun. I know it’s a terrible economy and I should be worried about paying bills, but I’m just not. I want to have fun, travel, write things I want to write, and most of all, I want to focus on &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bostonskeptics.com"&gt;Boston Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org"&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide&lt;/a&gt;. I wholeheartedly believe that each of those projects is important and deserving of focus—focus I can’t give while working (and commuting) 12 hours a day, Monday through Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I go hungry? Maybe! I have savings, occasional freelance jobs, and a crafty way about me, so I suspect I’ll survive. What’s important is that I’ll be pursuing the goal I laid out at the beginning of the year: &lt;em&gt;to rock even harder than ever before&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More news is coming soon about my immediate future and the future of my various projects. In the meantime, just know that I’m now going to be a full-time skeptic, so no, &lt;strong&gt;I’m not quitting SGU, I’m not shutting down Skepchick, and Boston Skeptics in the Pub will continue&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252614853159"><id gr:original-id="http://www.imachordata.com/?p=210">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d42728bcd08a4e9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Sea Stars on Acid</title><published>2009-09-10T14:50:27Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T14:50:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/9ukAkLoqn5A/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.imachordata.com/?p=210"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">As an ecologist working in temperate climes, I’ve been following the ocean acidification field with some interest.

&lt;p&gt;I never was much of a game console nut. My video game crazes mostly played out on the PC. But I did play the Atari in the 70s, the C64 in the 80s and the NES and SNES in the early 90s, when I wrote for Nintendo mags and borrowed the hardware from my employers. The SNES was the last console I paid any attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11-y-o Junior loves all kinds of video games, particularly on-line multiplayer ones like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Runescape&lt;/em&gt;. But he's also installed emulator software on the PC and played a lot of old games that originally ran on machines he's never actually seen. He's got a Wii which allows him to download and play old Nintendo games cheaply. In fact, he's so into the old stuff that he subscribes to &lt;i&gt;Retro Gamer&lt;/i&gt; magazine. This is a mag where you'll find long interviews with the people behind &lt;i&gt;Spyhunter&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arkanoid&lt;/i&gt;. So now we've made an agreement to sell his disused Nintendo DS and its cartridges and put some of the money into a certain &lt;i&gt;really old&lt;/i&gt; game console. It arrived today. It's a SNES made in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior can get all the games he likes for this machine for free over the net and play them on the PC with an emulator. But somehow he feels that running real cartridges on a real SNES makes for a better experience. So tonight it's been &lt;i&gt;Super Mario World&lt;/i&gt; for him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/09/retro_gamer.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/pOwOhKF5InY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252612158605"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/09/two_dimensional_pathological_b.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5484728ec34e8806</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="pathological programming"/><title type="html">Two Dimensional Pathological Beauty: SNUSP</title><published>2009-09-10T17:41:21Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T17:41:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/kem6Tev8BnA/two_dimensional_pathological_b.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/09/two_dimensional_pathological_b.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm currently away on a family vacation, and as soon as vacation is over, I'm off on a business trip for a week. And along the way, I've got some deadlines for my book. So to fill in, I'm recycling some old posts. I decided that it's been entirely too long since there was any pathological programming 'round these parts, so I'm going to repost some of my favorites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todays programming language insanity is a real delight - it's one
of my all-time favorites. It's a language
called SNUSP. You can find the language specification &lt;a href="http://www.deepwood.net/~drlion/snusp/snusp-1.0-spec-wd1.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,
a &lt;a href="http://www.baumanfamily.com/john/esoteric.html"&gt;compiler&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="http://www.quirkster.com/snusp/snusp-js.html"&gt;an interpreter embedded
in a web page&lt;/a&gt;. It's sort of like a cross between &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/09/two-dimensional_pathology_befu.php"&gt;Befunge&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/09/the_one_the_only_brainfck.php"&gt;Brainfuck&lt;/a&gt;,
except that it also allows subroutines. (And in a variant, &lt;em&gt;threads&lt;/em&gt;!) The
real beauty of SNUSP is its beauty: that is, programs in SNUSP are actually
really quite pretty, and watching them run can be positively entrancing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/09/two_dimensional_pathological_b.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/09/two_dimensional_pathological_b.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/kem6Tev8BnA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252611819697"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9217">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/62f79932521965f9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Thinking Critically While You Read</title><published>2009-09-10T19:00:39Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T19:00:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/ai-thinking-critically-while-you-rea/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/07/090907fa_fact_grann"&gt;this very compelling story&lt;/a&gt; this morning in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; online, and even though it is quite long, I couldn’t stop reading until I was finished. It’s a story that details the events that sent a man to Death Row in Texas, the circumstances of his incarceration, what took place with his case while he was behind bars, and eventually what ultimately happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read, I was struck by the fact that every aspect of this story triggered my critical thinking skills. As an observer of the events through the narrative, I was not only interested in the details of the story, but I was exercising skepticism the whole way through. Not only that, but the story itself contains wonderful elements of skepticism and demonstrations of the differences between good investigation and sloppy investigation, as well as good science versus no science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this item on so many levels, I thought I’d share the link with you, and urge you to read it as well. As I mentioned, the story is fairly long, so you may have to carve out some time to get all the way through it, but it is well worth it. And afterward, share your thoughts about it in the comments here. Tell us if it stimulated your critical thinking. What did you think of the investigations? Were you cycling through the possibilities yourself as you read, like I was?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we need a question for the AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we’ve discussed punishment for crimes before, but to keep with the theme of this article, I’ll ask you this for today’s Inquisition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is capital punishment a reasonable sentence for those convicted of certain crimes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought when I read this was that it was an orbital maneuver — a rocket firing — or maybe a meteor coincidentally near the same spot in the sky, but it turns out to be neither: it was a waste liquid dump, when the astronauts empty waste tanks before landing the Orbiter. &lt;a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;amp;day=10&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;year=2009"&gt;SpaceWeather.com has the details&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://spaceweather.com/submissions/large_image_popup.php?image_name=Clair-Perry-_MG_4652xSW_1252547311.jpg"&gt;a very cool picture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was out last night twice to see &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; and the ISS, but didn’t see the Orbiter either time (I think the predictions I was using were off due to the imminent landing), so I missed the show. Oh well. I imagine more pictures will turn up pretty soon, though, so keep your eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; has a landing opportunity at 19:05 Eastern time (23:05 GMT) today — they’ll make the de-orbit burn at 17:59 if the weather holds up — and then another opportunity about 90 minutes later at 20:42 (00:42 GMT) if needed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer to the eternal mystery of what makes up a Filet-O-Fish sandwich turns out to involve an ugly creature from the sunless depths of the Pacific, whose bounty, it seems, is not limitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s insatiable appetite for fish, with its disastrous effects on populations of favorites like red snapper, monkfish and tuna, has driven commercial fleets to deeper waters in search of creatures unlikely to star on the Food Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sad, but not &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt; to anyone paying attention. The signs of dramatic ocean decline are &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2008/08/16/empty-oceans/"&gt;crystal clear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the exterior ads, there will also be &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/news/2009/sanfran.php"&gt;200 interior bus signs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the city already has relatively few believers, this almost seems like overkill.  But you never know who may be helped by seeing a message that meshes with their personal beliefs — perhaps the ads will let someone else know they are not alone in their atheism. &lt;/p&gt;

Then my wife and I woke up our daughter, who seeing it was dark did protest loudly.  But we got her out of bed, and a few minutes later she was her usual happy loquacious self at the breakfast table.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got her dressed in a navy dress with white polka dots and black patent leather shoes, straightened her hair, took some pictures, and got in the car.  We parked about a half a block from the school and put her back pack on her.  She wanted me to carry it because it was so heavy (sic).  Then she wanted "uppy"---also a non-starter.  A diminutive safety officer in an orange belt directed us to the Kindergarten rooms. We found a coat hook with her name, and a place at a table, also with her name (although not with the nickname she's used to).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was not too pleased. She was looking around at the other children and parents, and wanted to climb into my arms and go home and cuddle---and I wanted the very same thing.  I'm not OK with this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/upload/2009/09/im_not_ok_with_this/birthday.JPG" width="390" height="530" alt="birthday.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She's my little baby.  She's the one who crawls into my lap in the morning, pushing the paper out of the way so she can pretend to by a kitty cat, mewling and purring and demanding cuddles.  She's the one whom I take for bike rides and then collapse onto the couch with afterward while she begs for another ride and I beg her to let me nap.  She's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a big girl who goes to school by herself, eight hours a day, five days a week, to be bored, excited, scared, amused, comforted, and intrigued.  &lt;i&gt;I'm&lt;/i&gt; the center of her life, not some goddamned brick building with a bunch of strangers in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not OK with this.

For those outside the ivy-covered bubble of academe, "service" usually means "committee work" or something like it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual concern is that, although committees are necessary to accomplish significant bits of the work of a college or university, no one likes serving on them and every faculty member has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; task that would be a better use of his or her time than being on a committee.  And, because "service" is frequently a piece of the faculty member's job performance that is regularly evaluated (for retention, tenure, and promotion decisions, for example), faculty members are on the lookout for "easy" committees with which to pad the service section of their CVs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chad suggests that these easy service options -- and maybe some of the hard ones, too -- could be a consequence of superfluous committees:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/thoughts_on_university_service.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/thoughts_on_university_service.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/mNVm9QuySzE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252605883015"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/10/ghost-hunting-results-in-death/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c6dcf2259d01ac5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><title type="html">Ghost hunting results in death</title><published>2009-09-10T18:00:15Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T18:00:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/10/ghost-hunting-results-in-death/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The skeptic ‘net is buzzing because &lt;a href="http://www.wivb.com/dpp/mobile/Toronto_ghost_hunter_falls_to_her_death_20090910"&gt;it’s been reported&lt;/a&gt; that a young Toronto woman has died apparently investigating a reportedly haunted building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some folks will want to use this to say that belief in the paranormal can kill you, and so on, but we have to resist that thought. For one thing, it’s pretty silly. Of all the paranormal beliefs that do harm in our society, a belief in ghosts is just about the least likely to do physical harm (though &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/ghosts.html"&gt;it can do great harm otherwise&lt;/a&gt;). Plus, the reports are sketchy; perhaps she was a skeptic and investigating the claims critically. Even if that’s not the case, it’s not hard to see something just like that happening, and the results would be the same. If it did, would you now claim that skepticism kills?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irrational beliefs despite a lack of evidence bug me too, but they’re no reason to make false correlations. We have to be skeptical even of our own skepticism, and how we apply it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252605801598"><id gr:original-id="http://amontenegro.blogspot.com/2009/09/multifaceted-p53-human-mutation-rates.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8cc419eeccb5cb29</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The multifaceted p53, human mutation rates and more in my MolBio picks of the week from RB</title><published>2009-09-10T12:30:53Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T12:30:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/-0KiGRe7d5w/multifaceted-p53-human-mutation-rates.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://amontenegro.blogspot.com/2009/09/multifaceted-p53-human-mutation-rates.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Another week has gone by and some very interesting molbio blog posts have been aggregated into Researchblogging.org.

&lt;p&gt;OK, look. I have seen pictures claimed to be of God or gods in everything. A taco. An oil smear. Wood grain. A bun, a cheese sandwich, a tree, clouds, and even a shroud or two. I’m something of an aficionado of it, and I think I do pretty well in recognizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this one baffles me. &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6137442/Has-Jesus-Christ-been-spotted-on-Mars.html"&gt;An article in The Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; says (uncited) that the picture of Mars shown here looks like the cloaked figure of Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? I don’t see it. Maybe the jumbled region at the top is the head, and the three dark hills below are the body and elbows. But wow, I really don’t get it. Do you? Maybe someone can outline the figure and leave it in the comments. Because this looks like just &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_002932_1445"&gt;a crater with eroded gullies to me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life Science Teachers:  Take special note!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not yet an error in the mainstream press, but there is an error afoot, currently represented in the widely read slashdot, which I imagine will propagate.  The purpose of this post is to alert you to this problem and prepare you for the occasion when you run into a wackaloon creationist waving their arms around and screaming "Carbon dating does not work!  It's been proven."  This story also has a Global Warming Denialism component.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm going to do here is give you the basic facts, then the misinterpreted text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new video, but it needs to be brought to our attention once again as it demonstrates that tools are ineffective if they're not used properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video you'll see Glenn Beck interviewing John Edward, and it starts off great. "Could you sleep at night knowing if you weren't on the up and up?" asks Glenn, and we're hopeful as we watch John Edward squrim. And then comes the question - why won't you take the JREF Million Dollar Challenge?&lt;/p&gt;

Witness &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/08/01/boltzmanns-anthropic-brain/"&gt;Boltzmann brains&lt;/a&gt;.  Sure, they’ve already made &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/04/27/boltzmann-in-the-funny-pages/"&gt;a cameo in Dilbert&lt;/a&gt;, but the stakes were pretty low.  Now &lt;a href="http://www.physics.umn.edu/people/kakalios.html"&gt;Jim Kakalios&lt;/a&gt; (author of the excellent &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.physicsofsuperheroes.com/"&gt;The Physics of Superheroes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) sends along sends along a couple of snippets from &lt;a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;amp;id=1339"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Incredible Hercules&lt;/em&gt; #133&lt;/a&gt; — in which our intrepid protagonists are attacked by freak observers fluctuated out of thermal equilibrium!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12619"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/09/herc-002b.jpg" alt="Boltzmann Brains in The Incredible Hercules"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually here they are described as “freaky observers,” rather than the more conventional “freak observers.”  That description brings to mind &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/columnists/view/smoove"&gt;Smoove B&lt;/a&gt; rather than Ludwig Boltzmann, but who knows?  Maybe unlikely thermal fluctuations tend to be pretty kinky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12619"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/09/herc-003b.jpg" alt="Boltzmann Brains in The Incredible Hercules"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, before you all start in:  we know that Boltzmann Brains don’t really make for a credible alien menace, if you insist on being persnickety about what they supposedly really represent.  It’s not that they “perceive” a universe more chaotic than ours — it’s that they would dominate the total number of observers if the universe really were more chaotic than ours.  (Which it isn’t!)  Also, they would tend to dissolve back into the chaos from which they came, rather than staging a coordinated attack on our homeland.  Still!  What a novel challenge for the Allies’ greatest hero.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252598396098"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=17981">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8999d173f1b2444e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Economics"/><category term="science"/><title type="html">Things That Don't Make Sense</title><published>2009-09-10T15:51:46Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T15:51:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/things-that-dont-make-sense/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In a follow-up to its earlier article about things that science can't explain, New Scientist lists 13 More Things That Don't Make Sense.

&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes something which is alive from that which is not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we explain all life to a hypothetical being unfamiliar with our categorization paradigm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions have often bothered me, and I decided I would share them with you. We define life (most of us, anyway) through cell theory. The idea that cells are the basic unit of every living thing. Where, though, does one draw the line between “cell” and “organized collection of molecules.” For example, are mitochondria independent cells? They have their own metabolism, DNA, replicate independently of the cells in which they live, and interact with the cell in a variety of ways. They are categorized as a “part of a cell” rather than an independent cell. Chloroplasts are similar in this sense. Viruses are a particularly nuanced problem as some viruses (Mimivirus comes to mind) can be larger than the smallest bacterial cells (&lt;em&gt;Mycoplasma&lt;/em&gt;). Mimivirus, for example, only requires ribosomes and energy metabolism of the host cell, providing all the necessary DNA  templates for all proteins required for it to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problems arise from the fact that biology rarely fits into neat little categories. Strict logical definitions of “life” or “cell” or “organism” don’t fit neatly. Is a biofilm a single organism or a collection of organisms? What about&lt;em&gt; Myxococcus xanthus&lt;/em&gt; swarms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I do not have an answer to this question. In fact, I think I have more questions than I started out with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is life?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is a cell?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is a bacterial spore a cell?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is the threshold level of cooperation to be considered multicellular?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can we go about organizing a system which removes this ambiguity?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business manager &lt;strong&gt;Scott Ullrich&lt;/strong&gt; even &lt;a href="http://www.uuworld.org/advertising/fall2009freedomfromreligionfoundationad.shtml"&gt;issued an apology&lt;/a&gt; to the magazine’s readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I have come to the conclusion that it was a mistake to run this particular ad. While the stated mission of the Freedom From Religion Foundation is entirely consistent with UU values, this ad seems hostile to all religion. To be more specific, I believe that I failed to help the advertiser match their message to our readers. An ad spotlighting FFRF’s purpose of “working for the separation of state and church” would have been more appropriate than one that for many appears to be condemning religion in general.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess how many complaints they received about the ads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ullrich said as much when he informed FFRF that he had written an apology to readers because of the swift reaction from the UU blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how is the FFRF responding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-President &lt;strong&gt;Annie Laurie Gaylor&lt;/strong&gt; sent the following email to Ullrich:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dear Scott,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess my reaction is: 8 emails doth not a crisis make!  (At FFRF we pay no attention to the nonbonafide blogosphere–I mean personal bloggers who so often engage in personal polemics, as opposed to bonafide news and opinion bloggers, such as Salon.com).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you will let these e-mailers know that we are getting very good reaction from the ad. It’s too early to see whether the ad will pay for itself (always our object) but the response is healthy and we have had no nasty responses to date. We were aware of one blogger going after the ad only because a UU member (who wanted info on FFRF but is not a member) e-mailed to tell us he was responding in our favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reaction is that if UU World or the UU officialdom take any further action to criticize, apologize for or officially distance itself from our ad, that we be refunded our advertising money.  It simply does not seem professional to take our money, then diss our ad, however politely you are putting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what truly concerns me is the lack of open-mindedness reflected. The thoughtful words of great thinkers and artists are too much for your readership? Emily Dickinson’s and Mark Twain’s genius summations about faith can’t be tolerated? The words of actresses Katharine Hepburn — “I’m an atheist, and that’s it. I believe that there’s nothing we can know except that we should be kind to each other and do what we can for other people” — are too hot for the UU? Being kind is controversial if someone also identifies themselves as an atheist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know and we know that the UUA is creedless. That means you have theists, deists — and many agnostics &amp;amp; atheists in your membership, including among your ministers. Two of our founding members, Jo and Charline Kotula, also founded, funded and co-directed one of the UU’s New Jersey chapters for many years; likewise our officer Blanche Fearn in the Daytona area in the 1980s, and those are but 2 examples of many. Countless FFRF members are active UUA members and vice versa. For 30 years we have received invitations to speak at UU congregations or societies around the country by people, and it has always been an amicable relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we might have been glad to work with you on a different ad, FFRF in fact has 2 joint purposes: it acts as a national membership organization for freethinkers (atheists and agnostics) AND it works to keep religion out of government. If we were not upfront about our other purpose, we could rightly be criticized by someone who joined us and felt it was false advertising not to state our clear nontheistic purpose as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There cannot simply be open-minded discussion of everything except atheism if UU is to consider to advise its members to “keep open minds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annie Laurie Gaylor
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing Ullrich’s response.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Book for Our Times: &lt;em&gt;Understanding Jason&lt;/em&gt; (AuthorHouse) is a new book written by Marsha Rae Osborn and illustrated by DeOnna Mills, and it tells the story of a group of typical students who learn from their teacher how to accept and help an autistic student, Jason, fit in with their class. (Osborn is an RN and the mother of twin boys, one&lt;br&gt;
of whom has autism.) Told in rhymes, &lt;em&gt;Jason&lt;/em&gt; seems typical of the kinds of titles we need to see more of. (”We don’t understand,” kids say, “Why does Jason act that way? He is different from us all, He can’t even catch a ball …”). I’ve always held that typically developing children often only benefit from learning about their autistic peers; the eyes of some are opened, at an accepting age, to differences in all people, and others might even discover, as if picking up a hammer or a wrench or a violin for the first time, a budding vocation for later in life. More information on &lt;em&gt;Jason&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.understandingjason.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abercrombie and Fitch has been socked with a $115,264 fine for discrimination, four years after employees at the Mall of America store refused, citing corporate policy (an exact copy of which couldn’t be found at the time of the incident), to allow a family member to accompany a 14-year-old autistic girl into a fitting room. The retailer, which is appealing the decision and terms the fine “excessive,” repeatedly refused to respond to the daughter’s mother’s request for an apology and denied engaging in discriminatory practices. Court documents also claim that the mother was once told, “So, you think our fitting room policy is ridiculous,” and was offered no assistance in filing a complaint. A manager did offer to let the family buy as many clothes as they wanted, try them on at home, and return those that didn’t fit. The policy is designed, of course, to foil theft, but the A&amp;amp;F handbook does in fact reportedly allow for caregivers to accompany those in their care into dressing rooms (employees involved in the incident claimed the girl’s disability wasn’t “visible” – maybe I should take Alex to this store and turn him loose — and the associate manager even later changed his testimony). A&amp;amp;F has been ordered to post signs near the fitting rooms in all Minnesota stores stating the fitting room policy and explaining that disabled customers can request an exception, and must also provide additional disability training to employees, and review and revise policies related to customers with disabilities. Following the incident, incidentally, the girl reportedly told a psychologist, “It’s all my fault. I hate autism. I am a misfit at Abercrombie.” Well, 1) that doesn’t sound like the worst fate in the world, at least right now; and 2) as adult autism gains its sad traction in our culture in the years ahead, corporate retail must revisit “corporate policies” of common politeness and professionalism. Maybe corporations should also start the training by taking the monumental step of actually talking to their employees and discovering, if the epidemic numbers hold true, that several people on their staffs already know somebody with autism or Asperger’s.&lt;/p&gt;

Then, &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/09/10/devout_catholic/"&gt;something unfortunate happened&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He seems to have embraced a stone pillar on which the stone altar was perched and it fell on him, killing him instantly. We have found his fingerprints on the pillar. We are now investigating the case further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you see, if he'd rushed off to thank the elevator repairman, that wouldn't have happened. Given his bad luck, the repairman might have been a demented homicidal maniac who would have clubbed him to death with a spanner, but &lt;i&gt;no altar would have fallen on him&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Looks like an ugly flash artifact of an insect caught in flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some guy in Kentucky had a video camera set up to monitor his backyard, and it caught this &lt;a href="http://www.wlwt.com/news/20788899/detail.html#"&gt;frame of a purported Bigfoot&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

As my springboard let's start with David Hume:&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A deity who knows the secret springs of the universe might easily, by particular volitions, turn all accidents to the good of mankind and render the whole world happy, without discovering himself in any operation. A fleet whose purposes were salutary to society might always meet with a fair wind. Good princes enjoy sound health and long life.  Persons born to power and authority be framed with good tempers and virtuous dispositions. A few such events as these, regularly and wisely conducted, would change the face of the world, and yet would no more seem to disturb the course of nature or confound human conduct than the present economy of things where the causes are secret and variable and compounded. One wave, a little higher than the rest, by burying Caesar and his fortune in the bottom of the ocean, might have restored liberty to a considerable part of mankind.” [&lt;em&gt;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&lt;/em&gt;, Part XI].&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here are some more things God could’ve done: One childhood fatal disease like the Spanish Flu of 1918 could have killed Hitler and prevented WWII. One actual attempt on Hitler’s life by some people, including Dietrich Bonhoeffer, could have ended his reign after the war started. A different police officer could have discovered a naked boy who had briefly escaped Jeffrey Dahlmer’s clutches, and upon investigating further could’ve saved that boy’s life. Timothy McVeigh could have had a fatal vehicle crash while driving to Oklahoma, or a crash that would reveal what was inside his truck.  McVeigh could also have been killed while in combat before coming back to the states.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fatal heart attack could’ve been sent to Saddam Hussein before our war with Iraq, stopping it dead in its tracks.  The poison that Saddam threw on the Kurds a decade ago could have simply “malfunctioned” by being miraculously neutralized. Sure it would puzzle Saddam, and it would not be explainable by science, but there are a great many things that take place in our world that are not explainable, so this wouldn’t necessarily lead him to believe that the laws of nature were suspended, revealing God behind it all. The same thing could have been done to the Zykon-B gas pellets dropped down into the Auschwitz gas chambers.  Even if Nazi's did conclude that God performed a miracle here, what’s the harm done? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why did God allow the earthquake that sent the tsunami that killed a quarter of a million people in Asia? Did he not have the power to restrain that earthquake? No one would know that he kept it from happening. The same goes for the predicted San Andreas Fault and the earthquake that will send Los Angeles into the Pacific Ocean.  No seismic scientist would ever discover God as the reason why it doesn’t do this.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why couldn’t something have happened to all nine hijackers of those planes on that fatal 9/11 day?  One could trip and fall to his death, or a broken limb.  Three others could’ve gotten in a car accident on the way.  One other could’ve had a heart attack. Still another could have been robbed by a New York pair of thugs and killed (there’s utilitarianism at its best!). Another could have been reminded of something by God that would weaken his will, maybe intense doubts like those who walk down the wedding aisle. Another could have been spotted at security by a different officer, while another’s take-on-bag might have spilled open revealing his knife.  And so on. These things would all occur on that morning stopping the terrorist attacks dead on. But none of these things happened, did they? God allowed the destruction of nearly 3500 lives that day even though there were means at his disposal to stop it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And even if by changing these things in the world God would “eradicate the laws of nature,” which I seriously doubt, the Christian would still have to argue that these things are impossible for God to do. Who says that the laws of nature must be fixed and unalterable, anyway? David Hume first questioned this.  The ordering of the world by general laws “seems nowise necessary” to God. If by changing something requires some adjustment that does not accord with any known laws of nature, so what? The Christian claims God can do miracles, then why not a perpetual one that doesn’t affect anything else in his creation?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-4057238297992310674?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The problem is that reports of miracles are not miracles…[they] have to work through a medium which takes away all their force.”   “Or is it invariably the case, that what I read in reputable historians is just as certain for me as what I myself experience?”&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lessing, just like G.W. Leibniz before him, distinguished between the contingent truths of history and the necessary truths of reason and wrote:  Since “no historical truth can be demonstrated, then nothing can be demonstrated by means of historical truths.”  That is, “the accidental truths of history can never become the proof of necessary truths of reason.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He continued: “We all believe that an Alexander lived who in a short time conquered almost all Asia.  But who, on the basis of this belief, would risk anything of great permanent worth, the loss of which would be irreparable?  Who, in consequence of this belief, would forswear forever all knowledge that conflicted with this belief?  Certainly not I.  But it might still be possible that the story was founded on a mere poem of Choerilus just as the ten year siege of Troy depends on no better authority than Homer’s poetry.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone might object that miracles like the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, are “more than historically certain,” because these things are told to us by “inspired historians who cannot make a mistake.”  But Lessing counters that whether or not we have inspired historians is itself a historical claim, and only as certain as history allows.  &lt;strong&gt;This, then, “is the ugly broad ditch which I cannot get across, however often and however earnestly I have tried to make the leap.”  &lt;/strong&gt;“Since the truth of these miracles has completely ceased to be demonstrable by miracles still happening now, since they are no more than reports of miracles, I deny that they should bind me in the least to a faith in the other teachings of Christ.” (“On the Proof of the Spirit and of Power,” [&lt;em&gt;Lessing’s Theological Writings&lt;/em&gt;, (Stanford University Press, 1956, pp. 51-55)].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-113882437322888515?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

These are all very well known findings and more so as they have been included in numerous pop-sci books.

Sceepar et al provide a very sober qualification for the above findings, contrasting how stereotype traits priming (abstract concept priming) do indeed lead to assimilation of stereotype in behavior/self-schema; but exposing to concrete, extreme exemplars belonging to stereotyped category has an opposite and paradoxical effect of leading to social comparison with the exemplar and thus leading to contrast behavior or behavior where the subject tries to distance oneself from the stereotype.  Thus, if primed with the stereotype of professors, and thus the trait intelligence, and then subjected to an intelligence/knowledge test, then the subjects would perform better than baseline condition; but if primed with Einstein (a concrete exemplar of professor/intelligence), then one may lead to compare with Einstein, deduce that one is not so great, but indeed stupid or a bozo in comparison, and thus perform badly in the subsequent test based on this self-comparison.  This is what they theorized and this is what they found.

In the second study they reused the Bargh paradigm of priming with elderly stereotype and replicated the results; the twist they added was adding a condition in which after priming with the elderly stereotype, an elderly exemplar was presented; this condition led to comparison and thus to contrast behavior whereby the subjects walked faster after the experimental manipulation in this exemplar condition.  

Their third study was essentially a study to nail down the mechanism (social comparison) behind the contrast behavior observed.  After priming with Einstein and professor in two separate conditions, the subjects were exposed to a lexical task, that was designed to discover if concepts  like intelligence , stupidity had been primed and if so , was any of them also bound to the self schema. They found that indeed in the Einstein condition the concept of stupidity was bound to the concept of self, thus only exemplars, like Claudia Schiffer or Einstein led to social comparison, but not abstract notions like supermodels or professors. They end with an advice to Mick Jagger which has to be read in original to be savored.

We close with perhaps one of the more trivial of these implications. This concerns advice we might offer celebrities such as Mick Jagger and other stars known for their predilection for supermodels. If these people share the popular stereotype of supermodels found among our participants, they would be wise to restrict themselves to a single such partner (i.e., an exemplar) on intellectual as well as moral grounds.

I now also post some snippets form the excellent article, freely available on the web, which you should read in its entirety. 

Individuals are exemplars in the sense that they are concrete instantiations of a given category (Smith &amp;amp; Zfirate, 1990, 1992). We focus on familiar exemplars that genuinely exemplify their category stereotype rather than deviate from it and thus where impression formation on the level of stereotypes has already occurred (Fiske &amp;amp; Neuberg, 1990). Our argument is thus not that such exemplars suppress stereotypic traits but rather that they make the instantiation of the relevant trait distinct (Stapel &amp;amp; Spears, 1996) by means of an actor-trait link (Stapel, Koomen, &amp;amp; van der Pligt, 1996). This distinction between stereotypes and the traits they activate on the one hand and exemplars that may exemplify these traits on the other is crucial for social perception and resulting automatic behavior. We argue that the activation of an exemplar (such as Einstein) may well lead to different behavioral output than activation of traits (intelligent) primed either directly or by means of a stereotype (professor). As already noted above, priming traits and stereotypes can lead to corresponding behavior in the perceiver. In other words, such priming can result in behavioral assimilation, thereby paralleling findings from the social judgment domain (e.g., Higgins, Rholes, &amp;amp; Jones, 1977; Srull &amp;amp; Wyer, 1979, 1980). Activated traits produce assimilation because they function as an interpretation frame and cause perceptual input to be interpreted in line with this trait construct (Higgins, 1996; Schwarz &amp;amp; Bless, 1992; Stapel et al., 1996). These findings are comparable with those on the effects of perception on behavior, where trait (or stereotype) priming seems to function as a general framework for action. In this case, instead of guiding the interpretation of perceptual input, the trait guides behavioral output. In both cases, highly accessible abstract constructs direct ongoing processes in an assimilative fashion.

A considerable number of social judgment studies demonstrate a different effect, however: Under appropriate conditions, the priming of exemplars has been shown to lead to judgmental contrast (see Herr, 1986; Schwarz &amp;amp; Bless, 1992; Stapel, Koomen, &amp;amp; van der Pligt, 1997). Priming the trait hostility causes a person who is subsequently judged to be seen as more hostile, but priming the exemplar Adolf Hitler causes this person to be seen as less hostile (Herr, 1986). Exemplars exert different effects because they are used as comparison standards (Herr, 1986; Sherif &amp;amp; Hovland, 1961; Stapel et al., 1996, 1997; Stapel &amp;amp; Spears, 1996). Priming Hitler still activates the concept of hostility, thereby eliciting a potential assimilation effect, but the engagement in a comparison induces a contrast effect that overrides the assimilative effect of the activated construct. In the example given above, a person called Donald is compared to Hitler. It is this comparison that evokes the contrast response ( &amp;quot;Well, Donald could not be that hostile&amp;quot; ), whereas the assimilative effects of the activated concept of hostility do not become apparent. However, the exemplar must be sufficiently extreme to override any assimilation evoked by the activated trait. Research by Herr, Manis, Schwarz, Stapel, and their colleagues has repeatedly shown that extreme and specific exemplars exert judgmental contrast effects (see Herr, 1986; Herr, Sherman, &amp;amp; Fazio, 1983; Manis, Nelson, &amp;amp; Shedler, 1988; Schwarz &amp;amp; Bless, 1992; Stapel et al., 1996, 1997). In general, it seems that a comparison (and a resulting contrast effeCt) ~ is rendered more likely if the primed construct constitutes a relevant comparison standard and is sufficiently extreme and concrete (e.g., Hitler). Given that exemplars produce contrasts in judgment by evoking a comparative judgment between exemplar and the target of judgment, the next question is whether such exemplars may evoke in perceivers social comparison with themselves. After all, if primed with Hitler, people may not only make a comparison with Donald--it is also likely that, in a relevant judgment situation, they will compare Hitler with themselves (hopefully with positive results). Recent research indicates that such comparisons with the self are very probable, if not inescapable, especially if they evoke a relevant dimension of comparison. Gilbert, Giesler, and Morris ( 1995 ) showed that social comparison is a spontaneous process: Individuals do not intentionally compare themselves with others but simply do it (see also Festinger, 1954; Wood, 1989), especially when these others are distinctive and extreme (Parducci, 1992; Parducci &amp;amp; Wedell, 1990). Following this analysis, we expect extreme exemplars to evoke a spontaneous comparison with the self.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What's Bugging You? Animals We Love to Hate

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, September 30, 2009&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:00 - 10:00 am  with discussion beginning at 9:00 followed by Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: The Acro Cafe - 4th Floor of the Museum of Natural Sciences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire ants.  Mosquitoes. Flies.  Ticks.  Gnats.  Bed Bugs.  The list goes on and on.&lt;br&gt;
They disturb our sleep, sting us, envenomate us, suck our blood, eat our food, crawl on us...yet at the same time, they pollinate our food and flowers, provide insect control, and increase biodiversity.  So, what is a pest? Are some of these pests invasive species?  What can or should be done about them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the Speaker:&lt;/p&gt;

"Dr. Bob), author of &lt;a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/"&gt;The Vaccine Book: Making the Right Decision for Your Child&lt;/a&gt;, is definitely antivaccine. His mouth may say, "No, I'm not antivaccine," but his actions say, "Yes, yes, yes!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, I finally said it. I've been flirting with saying it that bluntly for some time now, but have been tending to avoid it. I really didn't want to conclude this about "Dr. Bob," but, sadly, he's left me no choice. What else can I conclude from his actions over the last three months, when he's clearly solidly allied himself with the worst elements of the anti-vaccine movement? First, back in June Dr. Bob wrote a truly nonsensical post for the anti-vaccine propaganda blog Age of Autism entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/06/dr-bob-sears-author-of-the-vaccine-book-if-a-vaccineautism-link-is-proven-will-vaccine-policy-change.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;If A Vaccine/Autism Link is Proven, Will Vaccine Policy Change?&lt;/a&gt;, which I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/dr_sears_lets_his_flag_fly.php"&gt;duly eviscerated&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he fantasized that one day a definite link between vaccines and autism will be found and speculated that it wouldn't make any difference in government policy and advocacy of vaccines. In Dr. Bob's view, so entrenched in its ways are scientists and the government that they would conclude that autism is an acceptable risk. Most ridiculously, he betrayed an either ignorant or willful misunderstanding of science by complaining that the burden of proof should be on scientists to demonstrate that vaccines do not cause autism, apparently unaware that science can never absolutely prove a negative, only demonstrate an extremely low likelihood that there is a link, which is what it has already done. At the time, I noted that, while Dr. Bob craves above all else the adulation of his readers, a close second is his craving for his "alternate vaccine schedule" (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=512"&gt;nicely deconstructed by John Snyder&lt;/a&gt;) to be taken seriously by physicians and scientists. That's why I pointed out that one way to virtually guarantee that you will not be taken seriously is to start writing posts for the crank blog Age of Autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing you don't want to do if you want to be taken seriously by the medical and scientific community is to agree to be a speaker at a&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/dr_bob_sears_stealth_anti-vaccinationist.php"&gt; conference of anti-vaccinationists&lt;/a&gt; sponsored by that "venerable" anti-vaccine organization the &lt;a href="http://www.nvic.org/Events/overview.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;National Vaccine Information Center&lt;/a&gt;. Trust me on this one. Getting on stage with "luminaries" of the anti-vaccine movement like Andrew Wakefield, Barbara Loe Fisher, Kim Stagliano, and, to top it all off, that woo-meister supreme, Gary Null sure won't do accomplish that, but Dr. Bob seems to think that it will, given that he's going to be speaking at a conference with the aforementioned anti-vaccine activists, the ever-nutty David Ayoub, plus chiropractors who seem to labor under the delusion that there is any role for chiropractic in treating autism and homeopaths who are, like all homeopaths, just deluded about their preferred remedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's one thing that, above all else, you, really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want to do if you want to be taken seriously by the scientific and medical community. Can you guess what it is? Sure, I knew you could. If you want to be taken seriously by the medical and scientific community, you do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;--under any circumstances--start blogging your "skepticism" about the current vaccine schedule on that repository of quackery and anti-vaccine propaganda, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/who_is_patricia_fitzgerald_and.php"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is exactly what Dr. Bob did yesterday, excreting a turd of logical fallacies and pseudoscience entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-bob-sears/vaccines-and-autism-what_b_279745.html"&gt;Vaccines And Autism: What Can Parents Do During This Controversy?&lt;/a&gt; The stupid in there is so concentrated, under such high pressure, that it's going to turn into diamonds of ignorance, which is undoubtedly why &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/dr-bob-sears-talks-autism-and-vaccines-on-huffpo.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism is promoting it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/after_all_this_time_dr_bob_sears_finally.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/after_all_this_time_dr_bob_sears_finally.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/TXyKscAyAYs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252588333567"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=876">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3b1fdbe084b9a414</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><title type="html">ADHD and Brain Chemistry</title><published>2009-09-10T12:44:43Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T12:44:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=876" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;ADHD (attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder) is somewhat of a beleaguered and misunderstood disorder. The key controversy (and it is mainly a public, not a scientific, controversy) is whether ADHD is an actual brain disorder, a product of environmental factors (bad parenting, too much TV), or a cultural fiction. As is often sadly the case, I find the public debate largely disconnected from the scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no particular bias toward any kind of explanation – whether ADHD is a hardware or software problem, or an observational artifact. I believe all three kinds of entities exist. My only interest is to understand what the science says about ADHD. My reading of the literature is that the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that ADHD is a brain disorder. Of course it is modified by the environment – but at its core, it’s a problem of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study supports this conclusion, but before I get to that let me go over some background. The clinical definition of ADHD, like all behavioral diagnoses, is based upon having a minimum number of a list of characteristic symptoms. This kind of “squishy” diagnosis often fuels the fire of ADHD denial – but in reality many medical diagnoses are made this way. Migraine, which is not a controversial disorder, is diagnosed the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.helpforadd.com/criteria-for-add/"&gt;diagnostic criteria &lt;/a&gt;for inattention includes things like the inability to sustain attention to a task and an unwillingness to engage in a task that requires sustained mental effort. The criteria for hyperactivity include things like being very fidgity, blurting out answers before questions are finished, and difficulty awaiting one’s turn. But in addition, these symptoms must cause demonstrable impairment in school or social function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge in making a diagnosis is that all kids exhibit some of these symptoms to some degree – so some judgment and experience is required in determining if a feature is present to an excessive degree for that child’s age. This subjective aspect to the diagnosis does make it reasonable to ask the question – how do we know this is a real disorder and not just normal variation. Here we get into the difficulty of definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify, no one says that ADHD is a disease, or that there is some pathological process going on. It may be just one end of the Bell curve of typical human variation. But the definition of a disorder only requires that there are identifiable features that deviate significantly from the mean and which cause demonstrable problems. In fact, for practical purposes it is not necessary to obsess about whether an individual meets criteria for the diagnosis (are they fidgity enough) but rather to focus on whether they are having identifiable problems, and then address those problems. The concept of ADHD is useful in understanding why certain kids may be having problems and how to address them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s my practical clinician’s approach to many situation. However, in reality, school systems and other institutions need labels and allocate resources accordingly. So even though labels are imperfect and are not strictly necessary to address a problem, the system often demands them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what kind of disorder is ADHD? The current concept is that it is a disorder primarily of executive function. The neocortex in the frontal lobes – that part of our brains that most recently evolved, is involved with master decision-making. The frontal lobes are at the top of the hierarchy – it is here that we override our desire to eat cheesecake,  we consider the long term consequences of our actions, inhibit our impulses, and focus our attention. And, like all biological functions, there is extensive variation in the degree of executive function in the population. Those with ADHD are at the low end of the Bell curve of executive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 20 years of research has strongly supported this position. Brain activity levels in suspected brain areas are consistently lower in people with clinical symptoms of ADHD. Stimulants that increase brain activity relieve symptoms and improve outcomes. There is evidence for a genetic predisposition and about 10 genes have been linked to ADHD. Low dopamine in particular has been linked to ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the new study – published in this week’s JAMA, a&lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/302/10/1084?home"&gt; study by Nora Volkow et al.&lt;/a&gt; shows that untreated adults (to rule out the effects of medication) had lower dopamine transporter and receptor activity in key brain regions when compared to typical controls. The results seem fairly robust and confirm what we would predict from our current model of ADHD. So yes, Tom Cruise, ADHD is a problem with brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is involved (among other things) with the reward system in the brain. Animals with central nervous systems have a very basic reward system in the brain that makes us feel good when we do something that evolution wants us to do (because it enhances our survival and the spread of our genes). Eating calorie-rich food and having sex feel good and give us a dose of dopamine to our reward centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with ADHD have been observed to have some behaviors, like overeating and drug addiction, that could be explained on the basis of decreased reward response. Therefore, they need to do more to get the same reward as the average person, so they engage more in reward-seeking behavior. This study, showing lower dopamine activity in the reward centers (like the nucleus acumbens) strongly supports that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study adds to our understanding of ADHD and our confidence in the neuroscience models of what ADHD is. But most importantly, the more we understand the disorder the better we will be able to identify and treat it. Perhaps this may lead to treatments that target dopamine more specifically, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a highly emotionally charged diagnosis. The controversy stems partly from the fact that there is much confusion about how such diagnoses are made, the role of treatment trials, and the correlation between clinical criteria and objective measures of brain function. For cost and practical reasons we rely more on clinical criteria and treatment trials than PET scans and function MRIs to make the diagnosis – and the same is true of many entities in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often ADHD is dismissed as an excuse for lazy parenting or schooling, as a quick fix to a complex problem, or the “medicalizing” of normal behavior. In my opinion such dismissive attitudes are not well-informed and largely stem from misconceptions about how diagnoses are made in medicine. I also think that emotions run particularly high when kids are involved, and I understand this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as is often the case, a thorough and sober assessment of the science is our best guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Before reading any further, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/07/15/politics-science-me-and-thee/"&gt;PLEASE read my post on religion and politics&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve had lots of people wondering why an astronomy blog is not only about astronomy. That post will clear things up.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/08/the-mainstreaming-of-evil/"&gt;an empassioned article&lt;/a&gt; about the mainstreaming of ridiculous and frankly crazy rhetoric from extremely fringe groups, people who think Obama is literally like Hitler, yet are being treated as if their opinions are well-reasoned and worthy of debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made myself pretty clear, I thought. My rant was not against Republicans in general, for example. The main thrust of my post was not taking on any political party — yes, I did take a swipe at Bush, but that was not because he was a Republican, it was because he was clearly and provably antiscience, and again that was secondary at best to my main point. I do not say anywhere in that post that if you disagree with Obama, or if you’re opposed to what’s in his speech, then you’re a whackjob (though I do think you’d be wrong). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; saying is that &lt;strong&gt;nutsoid fringe craziness is getting way too much airtime and consideration, and is being presented as a reasonable stance.&lt;/strong&gt; The people making claims that Obama is Hitler and the like are not very different from people who say they have alien babies, or that the Apollo landings were faked. They are way off the path of reality, and most people in this country and this planet know that. Putting people like that on TV and engaging them (except the way Barney Frank did) makes rational discourse nearly impossible, as it lowers the signal to noise ratio to essentially zero. We have &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; trouble in this country, and we need &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; debate. Pandering to the fringe makes that impossible, and many media outlets are simply trying to foment discord and perhaps push their own agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet many of the comments left on my blog, on Twitter, on other blogs, and on Digg are just adding to the noise. They accuse me of being an Obama sycophant, or of denying people’s freedom of speech. These claims are patently false, and obviously wrong to anyone who actually read what I wrote, instead of reading their own blind prejudices into my words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples abound. &lt;a href="http://americandigest.org/mt-archives/enemies_foreign_domestic/more_obama_i_say_more_oba.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;This guy&lt;/a&gt; got what I said &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; wrong, and says I’m claiming we should have more Obama. He seems to think I am rah-rahing Obama (I did in fact support the speech, but — repeat after me — that’s not what the post I wrote was about). &lt;a href="http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous_conservative/2009/09/discover-magazine-discovers-dr-teh-stupid.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;This guy&lt;/a&gt; calls me an idiot, though he never really says why. I assume he thinks it’s obvious, but the irony in his words is not hard to find. &lt;a href="http://powip.com/2009/09/discover-magazine-a-political-organ/"&gt;This guy&lt;/a&gt; accuses me of attacking straw men, then creates a cornfield full of ‘em. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noise, noise, noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could debunk these point-by-point, but it doesn’t matter. I certainly can’t reason with people who don’t want to be reasonable, and for people who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; reasonable the flaws are easy to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear and succinct: my point was not about political parties. It wasn’t about liberals, or conservatives (I have issues with liberal commentators such as Randi Rhodes, for example, as well as with neocons like Rush Limbaugh; opposite ends of the political spectrum and both just as often as far from reality as the other). It wasn’t about other speeches in the past. It wasn’t even really about the content of Obama’s speech, though I agree with it, and the speech’s content was what the craziness was about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My post was about clearly lunatic rhetoric being taken as reasonable discourse, and how that demeans real discussions of real problems. I can’t make it any simpler than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact that so many people chose to ignore this basic premise of what I wrote and to spin, fold, and mutilate it to increase the noise in the conversation ironically &lt;em&gt;proves my point&lt;/em&gt;. And to them I say: Those of us who are reality-based see through you, and you are the very people we won’t let drag us down.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252584403322"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1276">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/57599acd9f0cd37e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Acupuncture"/><category term="Politics and Regulation"/><category term="Public Health"/><category term="TCM"/><title type="html">The Golden State of Pseudo-Science</title><published>2009-09-10T12:00:14Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T12:00:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1276" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The state of California (CA) which is home to the most advanced education and research in biomedical sciences, computational biology, genomics and proteomics, etc, is also home to 19 institutions that have state-approved training programs in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a pseudo-medicine that is based on ideas and practices sourced by ancient cosmology, mythology, astrology, and a range of other pre-scientific beliefs that have been partially “sanitized” during the Maoist era.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emerging out of the recent hype about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), the educational curricula of these institutions include the study of acupuncture’s point-and-meridian system, the health and safety beliefs of ancient and medieval China, humoral pathology, herbalism, Asian massage, and a limited amount of modern biomedical sciences at a level below what is required from vocational nurses. These curricula are supposed to provide the necessary knowledge and skills for the graduates to pass a comprehensive state licensing exam and provide “primary” healthcare in CA. However, pursuant to CA Code of Regulations, Title 16, Section 1399.451(b) it is improper for these “primary” healthcare providers, “to disseminate any advertising which represents in any manner that they can cure any type of disease, condition or symptom!” Nonetheless, both the internet and the local press abound with ads by CA licensed practitioners who claim that acupuncture can cure or mitigate many diseases, ranging from allergies and infertility to stroke and paralysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under the banner of CAM, a handful of these practitioners also advertise that they can communicate with spirits and heal with crystals, colors or sounds; they practice healing touch (reiki) and distance healing (via PayPal!); provide spiritual counseling and ministerial services, and make implausible medical claims such as healing a chronic condition with just one needle!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All 19 programs are approved by the CA Department Affairs’ (DCA) Board of Acupuncture, since CA law requires that the content of an acupuncture training program be assessed and approved by the State.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Baffled by the absurdity of some of the content of these programs and the outrageous claims of some of the graduates, I addressed the DCA’s Board of Acupuncture on June 20, 2008, to request the repeal of state-approved healthcare programs that endorse the teaching of vitalism, metaphysics and snake-oil-science. To clarify the matter, I reminded the Board that vitalism is a doctrine that stipulates that the functions of a living organism are due to a transcendental vital faculty distinct from physicochemical forces, which distinguishes living organisms from non-living matter. Vitalism was the fundamental dogma of natural sciences and medicine in the West until the 19th Century where disease was believed to derive from interruptions to the flow of a vital principle, called &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;pneuma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and imbalances in four humors. Eastern traditions have similar notions such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;qi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in China, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;ki&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Japan and &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;doshas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in India. I also reminded the Board that vitalism was disproved in the 19th Century by Friedrich Wohler who showed that it is possible to synthesize an organic substance in the laboratory. Louis Pasteur disproved a related concept called “spontaneous generation.” More recently, Stanley Miller, during a landmark experiment in 1953, demonstrated that organic substances could be created by very simple physical processes from inorganic substances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The counterargument presented by the former Chair of DCA’s Acupuncture Board, Dr. Adam Burke, is instrumental in understanding the thought process behind the official legitimization of voodoo science and New Age nonsense in the Golden State. Dr. Burke, who is also a Senior Research Advisor to the American Association of Oriental Medicine and the Co-Director of the Institute for Holistic Healing Studies at San Francisco State University (SFSU), stated that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you biomedicalize it all… if we strip the history and the philosophy and the understanding of that, we have shut out millennia of understanding of human illness that could enrich our understanding of healing people. That would be such a historic loss… I don’t think we’ll completely understand these things. The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, also Mary Ann Liebert, hardcore, very big science journal editor – Distant Healing. They don’t know how but some of the people at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, which was founded by an astronaut, up in Marin, they are doing research on distant healing. They principle investigator is a physicist. They are getting their research published in the best physics journals in the United States. They’re trying to show the physical nature of these phenomena. We don’t understand them but it’s not metaphysics. I mean I wish there had been more metaphysics when I was in school and I don’t imagine schools have gone backwards. I imagine they are going more towards integrative medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, does not this sound like the ultimate in anti-rationalism and anti-science coming from the Chair (former) of a State Board with the mandate of protecting the public health, safety and welfare? The entire text is available at the following link:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.acupuncture.ca.gov/about_us/minutes/20080620.pdf"&gt;www.acupuncture.ca.gov/about_us/minutes/20080620.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I got an official letter from the DCA, stating that after careful review, the Board had not found anything objectionable&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in the curricula of state-approved TCM &lt;em&gt;schools&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gather that the dreadful mixture of anti-intellectualism, anti-rationalism and low expectations at the New Age of Unreason is doomed to remain the basis for many public health policies in the Golden State. And as long as Chinese metaphysics and vitalism are perceived as anything but pre-scientific and disproved worldviews, pseudo-doctors and purveyors of TCM woo-woo will continue to provide the community of believers with medical astrology, alchemy, humoral pathology and even dialogue with the dead, heal with incantations, crystals, colors or sounds, remotely or via touch, and make implausible medical claims–all with the full blessing and endorsement of the CA Department of Consumer Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all part of a campaign called &lt;a href="http://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.com/"&gt;Would Jesus Discriminate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say what you will about the accuracy of the citations.  It’s doing a great job of getting soundbytes from religious people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The billboard angered [Christine] Lutz so much, that she fired off a stern e-mail. “I said how dare you take the scriptures and twist it to fit your needs,” she recalled.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My irony meter just exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Pastor Sam Dennis, of Parkway Hills Baptist Church in Plano, says Christians shouldn’t hate gays. He disagrees however with the billboards’ use of scripture to back a pro-gay message. “I’m hard pressed to find that scripture advocates that it’s alright to live in a gay lifestyle. Just like I’m hard pressed to find that scripture advocates that’s it’s alright to live in an adulterous relationship or as a wife abuser or as a murderer.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s ridiculous.  I’m sure commenters can find plenty of examples of the Bible condoning awful things.  I suggest starting at &lt;a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/"&gt;Skeptics Annotated Bible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to see Christians using their faith to &lt;em&gt;defend&lt;/em&gt; homosexuality for once.  These are the discussions they ought to be having in their churches — it’s relevant and it’s divisive.  By just excluding gay people, churches are putting themselves in jeopardy by alienating younger Christians — not that there’s anything wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if change can happen within the church, it has to start from within.  This is a novel, interesting way to get people thinking.&lt;br&gt;

You would be surprised, however, with how much it permeates our language. The notions of “higher” and “lower” organisms or “more evolved” and “less evolved” somehow work their way into the brains and statements of many people without them even thinking it does (myself all too often included). Think of this not as a rebuke, but more drawing attention to what is often so easily overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Great Chain of Being” can be considered as one of those bad tastes which doesn’t seem to go away even after brushing with sandpaper and rinsing with vodka. It just seems to come back, somehow, over and over (that metallic taste may be blood). Organisms are often compared as in terms of “how advanced” their traits are. The legs of a tetrapod are “more advanced” than the fins of lobe-finned fishes. The idea of a trait being “advanced” or “primitive” implies some ultimate directionality in that the “primitive trait” will somehow become the “advanced trait.” My rhetorical question is this: in a system devoid of any developmental teleological conclusion, how can any trait be considered closer to the teleological goal?&lt;/p&gt;

It was supposedly the name of a group of Illuminati who were “in” on the “fact” that UFOs were alien spacecraft, well known to the United States government. A &lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b5/Majic6.jpg"&gt;typed letter&lt;/a&gt; (established up, down, and sideways as a &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/new_bogus_majestic-12_documents/"&gt;hoax&lt;/a&gt;) purportedly written by President Truman, created the Majestic 12 committee by secret Presidential order. Since then, many “classified” government documents have “appeared” acknowledging the government’s full knowledge of alien visitation. The story of Majestic 12 was broken to the world in 1987 by UFOlogist William Moore, which casts immediate suspicion upon him as the perpetrator; but there are other possible suspects as well.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The late Philip Klass, perhaps the best known of the skeptical UFO investigators, once tried to flush out the author. One of the papers, known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MJ_12#The_Cutler.2FTwining_memo_.281985.29"&gt;Cutler/Twining Memo&lt;/a&gt;, was in a certain unusual typeface, and Klass reasoned that whoever wrote it probably had authentic government documents from the same period to use as a style guide. He offered a cash reward for any extant examples. Who sprang forward with handy documents to claim the prize? None other than &lt;a href="http://www.skepticblog.org/2008/12/04/stanton-friedman-doesnt-like-me/"&gt;Stanton Friedman&lt;/a&gt;. Klass paid him $1000 (probably considering it a bargain), and Friedman’s reputation was permanently stained as a result. Tip to paranormal hoaxers hoping to make a career out of it: Don’t take the bait if you don’t want to be hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a theory on who was behind the Majestic 12 hoax? I welcome your nominations.

This definitely isn’t a case of a judge overruling parental rights particularly because one of the parents was calling for it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl’s mother, Brenda Voydatch, has engaged the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian legal group based in Scottsdale, Ariz., to contest the ruling, in which the judge granted a request by the girl’s father, Martin Kurowski, that the girl go to a public school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While other groups are also protesting this decision, I fully support it. I think home schooling should be illegal unless it can be regulated to ensure children get a proper and well-rounded education that isn’t just religious indoctrination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jewsforjesus.org/images/expelled-small.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.jewsforjesus.org/images/expelled-small.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="193"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/godless_spaniard_loses_jobfor.php"&gt;Spanish astrophysicist EXPELLED for criticizing the Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; – Now I admit that I don’t know the full story here. For all I know Javier Armentia deserved to be fired. But it seems as though it merely was the result of his being accused of being an anti-Catholic atheist. But I just love the irony of it, since Ben Stein’s mockumentary made such a big deal out of false claims of people losing their jobs merely because they had the audacity to criticize evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prophet Muhammad was a pedophile and islam revers pedophilia as a religion. Islam is a religion of pedophilia. Pedophilia is Allah’s will.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I happen to agree with every word he said here but, fine, take the guy to court. What I find shocking, however, is that Halla-aho lost the case and has to pay a fine because of nothing other than words. He didn’t hurt anyone. He just said things that offended some people. . .things that happen to also be true. Though even if they weren’t true, why shouldn’t he have the right to say them anyway? Finland, I expected this kind of crap from the U.S. but I thought you were better than this.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course I found the article rather hilarious because it quoted Armstrong as admitting that he believed it was real until being convinced by conspiracy theorist videos on YouTube and of course, because The Onion is not a real newspaper. It’s a satire on mainstream news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, both these facts escaped the Daily Manab Zamin and the New Nation, two Bangladeshi newspapers, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8237558.stm"&gt;who uncritically reported this story without checking it out first&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought it was true so we printed it without checking,” associate editor Hasanuzzuman Khan told the AFP news agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t know the Onion was not a real news site.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both papers have apologized for the embarrassing error.&lt;/p&gt;

We’re not just talking about a rat that’s kinda big but a giant freakin’ rat!!!! And believe it or not, it wasn’t found in New York City, but in a remote rainforest in Papua New Guinea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measuring 82 centimeters (32.2 inches) from nose to tail and weighing around 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds), the species is thought to be one of the largest rats ever to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial examinations of the rat — provisionally named the Bosavi woolly rat — suggest that it belongs to the Mallomys — a genus of rodents in the muridae family which are the largest living species of rodent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, a similar species of giant rat was found in Foja Mountains in Papua New Guinea’s Mamberamo Basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article doesn’t name the rat, so I’ve decided to name the giant rat Kent Hovind.&lt;/p&gt;

Alas, this year that will clearly not be the case.  A wet growing season and commercial stock contaminated with spores has led to an epidemic of late blight, and my tomato plants (as shown, with the night photography accentuating the horror) are being slaughtered.  This weekend I&amp;#39;ll clear the whole mess out &amp;amp; for the next few years plant somewhere else.  Late blight is particularly horrid as it attacks both foliage and fruits -- many tomato diseases simply kill the foliage.  What looked like promising green tomatoes a week ago are now disgusting brown blobs.  Late blight is caused by Phytophora infestans, a fungus-like organism.  An even more devastating historical manifestation of this ogre was the Great Irish Potato Famine and remains a scourge of potato farmers.  Given my current difficulties with it, I was quite excited to see the publication of the Phytophora infestans genome sequence (by Sanger) in Nature today.A sizable chunk of the paper is devoted to the general structure of the genome, which tops out at 240Mb. Two related plant pathogens, P.sojae (soybean root rot) and P.ramorum (sudden oak death) come in only at 95Mb and 65Mb respectively.  What accounts for the increase?  While the genome does not seem to be duplicated as a whole, a number of gene families implicated in plant pathogenesis have been found.Also in great numbers are transposons.  About a third of the genome are Gypsy-type retrotransposons.  Several other classes of transposons are present also.  In the end, just over a quarter (26%) of the genome is non-repetitive.  While these transposons do not themselves appear to contain phytopathological genes, their presence appears to be driving expansion of some key families of such genes.  Comparison of genomic scaffolds with the other two sequenced Phytophora show striking overall conservation of conserved genes, but with local rearrangements and expansion of the zones between conserved genes (Figure 1 plus S18 and S19).  Continuing evolutionary activity in this space is shown by the fact that some of these genes are apparently inactivated but have only small numbers of mutations, suggesting very recent conversion to pseudogenes.  A transposon polymorphism was also found -- an insertion in one haplotype which is absent in another (figure S9)A curious additional effect shown off in two-D plots of 5&amp;#39; vs. 3&amp;#39; intergenic length (Figure 2.  Overall this distribution is a huge blob, but for some of the pathogenesis gene classes are clustered in the quadrant where both intergenic regions are large -- conversely many of the core genes are clustered in the graph in the &amp;quot;both small&amp;quot; quadrant.  Supplemental Figure S2 shows rather strikingly how splayed the distribution is for P.infestans -- other genomes show much tighter distributions but P.infestans seems to have quite a few intergenic regions at about every possible scale.The news item accompanying the paper puts some perspective on all this: P.infestans is armed with lots of anti-plant weapons which enable it to evolve evasions to plant resistance mechanisms.  A quoted plant scientist offers a glum perspectiveAfter taking 15 years to incorporate this resistance in a cultivar, it would take Phytophthora infestans only a couple of years to defeat it..  Chemical control of P.infestans reportedly works only before the infection is apparent and probably involves stuff I&amp;#39;d rather not play with.  A quick side trip to Wikipedia finds that the genus is a pack of blights.  Indeed, Phytophora is coined from the Greek for &amp;quot;plant destruction&amp;quot;.  Other horticultural curses from this genus include alder root rot, rhododendron root rot, cinnamon root rot (not of cinnamon, but rather various woody plants) and fruit rots in a wide variety of useful &amp;amp; yummy fruits including strawberries, cucumbers and coconuts.  What an ugly family tree!The Wikipedia entry also sheds light on why these awfuls are referred to as &amp;quot;fungus-like&amp;quot;.  While they have a life cycle and some morphology similarities to fungi, their cell walls are mostly cellulose and molecular phylogenetics place them closer to plants than to fungi.So, the P.infestans genome sequence sheds light how this pathogen can shift its attacks quickly.  Unfortunately, as with human genomic medicine, it will take a long time to figure out how to outsmart these assaults, particularly in a manner practical and safe for commercial growers and home gardeners alike.BJ Haas et al (2009).

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The big news of the day was President Obama's address to Congress. But we cannot forget the schadenfreudelicious scandal that got the day off to a roaring start. As you'll remember, California state Rep. Michael Duvall (R-Yorba Linda), a married champion of family values and traditional marriage, was picked up on a live mic at a committee hearing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/gop_lawmakers_graphic_sex-bragging_caught_on_tape.php"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;graphically boasting of his sexual encounters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; with not one but two mistresses (one of whom is a lobbyist with business before his committee).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;After first insisting that he thought he was having a "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/duvall_i_thought_it_was_a_private_conversation.php"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;private conversation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;", which one imagines is true, Duvall &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/duvall_resigns_after_sex_bragging.php"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;resigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; his office shortly after noon California time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As Victor Steinbok has pointed out to me, Rep. Duvall's earlier statement was also a classic &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=553"&gt;non-apology&lt;/a&gt; apology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I made a mistake and i sincerely apologize. I deeply regret the comments I made in what I believed to be a private conversation. This is a private matter and I ask that everyone respect the privacy of all involved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;PAX organizers say they have confirmed nearly 100 cases of H1N1 virus infections, or swine flu, in the wake of the Seattle videogame convention, which drew approximately 75,000 gamers to the Washington State Convention and Trade Center between Sept. 4 and 6.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/09/pax-swine-flu-outbreak-soars-to-nearly-100-cases-of-h1nerd1/"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that's about one tenth of one percent of the people reporting likely swine flue (H1N1).  That would be a very mild flu season, but since its a weekend and not a season, it may be a large number. On the other hand, small samples are highly variable.  What you'd need to do is to find ten or twenty conventions of 20 or more thousand people and count the flu cases across that sample, and from that perhaps extrapolate rates. (I'm just estimating these numbers .... my point is that I'm not convinced this is a large number.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, however, the beginning of the season of school and other changes in behavior that enhance flu transmission, and we are hearing reports like this one from Pax as well as various colleges that have started to report large numbers of cases.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, wash your hands, get plenty of bed rest, and I'll see you in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you try and teach them about “the intangible,” why, they think it’s all “fortune-telling and ghosts,” just like they see on the television and the internets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why you &lt;a href="http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=11852"&gt;can’t just assume&lt;/a&gt; they know what “god” is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most students in fact have already formed their own basis for belief or unbelief, and in both instances their implicit “philosophies” are cobbled together from some of the worst God-talk popular culture has to offer. In this sense, there is no question that students are up to the task of philosophical reflection about God. The problem is that this reflection is taking place without the direction and input of the Catholic intellectual tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the scare quotes make clear, it’s not really really a &lt;i&gt;philosophy&lt;/i&gt; unless it incorporates the input of the “Catholic intellectual tradition.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And teacher Brad Rothrock (who wrote the linked essay) knows how to incorporate tradition, which is how his students got so good at correcting those who make the egregious mistake of thinking of god as a “thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Several students then tried to explain to her that God is not a “thing,” but rather the act of existence itself from which all “things” proceed. Though the transfer student remained confused, and I suggested she see me later, this was one of those moments teachers dream about.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, only the hardest-headed empiricist wouldn’t be thrilled with students so adept at parroting “philosophical” nonsense.  I mean, &lt;i&gt;philosophical&lt;/i&gt; nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252553379030"><id gr:original-id="http://thequantumlobechronicles.blogspot.com/2009/09/is-inhibition-measure-of-free-will.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1afdc96a9f7e7755</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Is inhibition a measure of free will?</title><published>2009-09-09T18:45:32Z</published><updated>2009-09-09T18:45:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/IWLKxrgAlkU/is-inhibition-measure-of-free-will.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://thequantumlobechronicles.blogspot.com/2009/09/is-inhibition-measure-of-free-will.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Reading Alwyn Scott&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Stairway to the Mind&amp;quot; I came across an interesting tidbit of information pointing out that human&amp;#39;s have a greater percentage of inhibitory neurons compared to other animals (human 75% rabbit 31%). For some unknown reason this made me think about the tricky construct of free will and whether it could be better measured not by what we chose to do, but by what we chose not to do. In other words, could free will be measured by a capacity to inhibit certain thoughts and behaviors. Upon further research I came across Baer, Kaufman, and Baumeister&amp;#39;s book &amp;quot;Are We Free? Psychology and Free Will&amp;quot;. They also tossed around this question and came to an interesting conclusion. Here is a snippet from their work:We have danced around the issue of whether conscious control is to be equated with free will; in fact, we suspect that at the most basic level, the answer is no...the ability to inhibit responses is powerful and one could reasonable make the argument that without it, free will would not be possible, because we would not be able to stop what some force (external or internal) seemed to impel us to do...If we do assume that free will can be directly observed in inhibition of behavior, then is free will measured by inhibition? The latter question is especially poignant with respect ot those people who show marked inhibition deficits, such as children, the elderly, and certain patient populations. If we agree with Libet (1999) and consider inhibition of an unconsciously determined action to be equivalent to free will, then these populations suffer from impaired free will...we see that this view is already implicitly, if not explicitly, accepted in many fields, as well as (to some degree) enshrined in common wisdom about behavior (Baer, Kaufman, &amp;amp; Baumeister 2008).I reflect on Mischel, Shoda, and Rodriquez&amp;#39;s well known 1989 experiment investigating delayed gratification in children and wonder whether those who decided to wait for the larger reward were not only smarter, but had a greater capacity for free will as well. Can we associate intelligence with free will? What do you think?    Mischel, W., Shoda, Y., &amp;amp; Rodriguez, M. (1989).

Anthracyclines don't require an oncologist with a genial bedside manner to slow the growth of tumors.

...the placebo response has limits. It can ease the discomfort of chemotherapy, but it won't stop the growth of tumors.

Placebo, if it exists as a utile clinical entity (and I'm still not convinced) cannot cure cancer---but chemotherapy can, no matter what hand waving and chanting may or may not accompany it.

It was a normal day in just about every way except I had this amazing ability. When I jumped, I was able to leap great distances and almost fly. No wings were involved - it was almost like I was able to levitate, and slowly drift between places. It was a very calm, serene feeling.Perhaps that&amp;#39;s how the mice in Dr. Liu&amp;#39;s lab felt. Advances in Space Research has published online today an accepted manuscript where researchers levitated mice. And, according to their observations, the mice took to the free-floating existence quite readily. The team first used a magnetic field to suspend large water droplets about 2 inches in diameter. Feeling good about themselves, they decided to try the trick with a mouse of similar size and weight. The little guy, weighing only 10 grams, was placed in a cage-like apparatus that allowed the researchers to film the experiment as well as give the mouse food and water while allowing droppings to fall through the bottom. Then, of course, they turned on the magnet. A static magnetic field with a strength of about 17T and large field gradient of 1.17 T/cm lifted the hapless mouse off the floor.At first, the mouse wasn&amp;#39;t so keen on floating. It tried desperately to grab a hold of anything, and kicked around, causing itself to spin faster and faster. To alleviate some of the stress, researchers sedated the mouse slightly the next time. But before long - about 3-4 hours - even non-sedated mice began acting normally, including eating and drinking in their suspended state. The team saw no observable negative effects of such a strong magnetic field on the animals, though further research will be necessary to determine if prolonged exposure causes health issues. Previous studies have found that a lower level of magnetic field (9.4T) didn&amp;#39;t negatively impact mice, even when they were exposed to it for 10 weeks, but the stronger field used for levitation may have unforeseen, adverse effects after a long time. While the researchers hope to use this technology for better understanding space flight and bone loss in astronauts, I think there are many applications. Carnival rides, for example. Oh come on - like you&amp;#39;ve never wanted to levitate!Liu, Y., Zhu, D., Strayer, D., &amp;amp; Israelsson, U. (2009).

Our current medical system is broken, and needs to be fixed. You can listen to &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/09/05/what-i-did-on-my-summer-vacation-part-1/trackback/"&gt;personal experience&lt;/a&gt;. You can look at &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/09/07/our-health-care-problems-are-more-vivid-when-presented-in-colorful-graphical-video-form/trackback/"&gt;pretty graphics&lt;/a&gt;. You can read &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/08/04/fiscal-sickness/trackback/"&gt;expert discussion&lt;/a&gt;. Health care in the US is in need of Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to the current health care debate is unbelievably depressing. It isn’t really a debate about healthcare at all. Instead, it has devolved into a debate about all the conservative boogeymen: big government, high taxes, Obama personally telling your doctor what to do. The “debate” is fundamentally unmoored from the actual proposals being set forth. This is one of the most important public discussions this nation has had in recent memory. The results will directly impact each and every American. And yet, the entire debate is completely incoherent and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of a “single-payer” healthcare program has fallen off the table. I’m not sure exactly how or when this option became untenable, but it shows how quickly the &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/m/screen?id=8322683"&gt;efforts of pharmaceutical and insurance companies&lt;/a&gt; can reframe a discussion. After all, there are billions upon billions of dollars at stake, which is precisely why it is such a profound issue for our long-term fiscal health. It is not at all surprising that these companies are spending millions to defeat meaningful reform. The essential goal of this reform, after all, is to reduce the amount of money our nation spends on health care (while improving overall care). Which is not at all in the interest of these companies. What is astounding is that they are actually succeeding in derailing the discussion into lunacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it looks as if a “public option” will fall victim as well, and be eliminated from consideration. An (incredibly vocal) minority has become convinced that the public option will destroy capitalism, and that Obama is the second coming of Hitler. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYlZiWK2Iy8"&gt;Really&lt;/a&gt;. These people live in an alternate Universe. Here is a two-minute summary of the public option by Robert Reich:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/9w0brzIsOOQ%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Paul Krugman &lt;a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/why-the-public-option-matters/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “the argument against the public option boils down to the fact that it’s bad because it is, horrors, a government program.” In &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCdlD8xZh3Q"&gt;addition&lt;/a&gt;, “the argument against it is sheer nonsense. It is nothing but the insurance lobby.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few minutes Obama will give a much-anticipated speech on healthcare. We can only hope he is able to change the nature of the discourse. We are at a critical juncture. The whole nation is focused on fixing healthcare. The diagnosis is clear. The patient is in crisis. Prospects for recovery are increasingly slim. Heroic action is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Text of the speech can be read &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.text.html?ref=politics&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Obama made a range of proposals, including a public option. He tells us: “Well the time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action. Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together, and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do. Now is the time to deliver on health care.” I hope he can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if on queue, a Republican from South Carolina interrupted Obama in the middle of his speech, yelling “You lie!”. The irony, of course, is that at that very moment Obama was busy decrying the absurd claims being widely promulgated by those who aren’t interested in civil dialogue, but aim to “kill reform at any cost”. It gives a good sense of the current state of affairs: that a Congressman would actually interrupt the President, and accuse him of lying, to his face, on national TV. And, needless to say, the Congressman was absolutely, unequivocally &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10truth.html?ref=politics"&gt;wrong&lt;/a&gt;. And, “surprise”, he receives lots of money from healthcare industry lobbyists, and is basically a &lt;a href="http://rawstory.com/08/news/2009/09/10/obama-speech-disrupter-a-health-industry-darling/"&gt;nutcase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>daniel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252542281586"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/09/i-could-kiss-andrew-sullivan/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8c31ab52a0ea74c5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Space"/><category term="science of kissing"/><category term="Andrew Sullivan"/><category term="nebula"/><category term="The Science of Kissing"/><title type="html">Why I Could Kiss Andrew Sullivan</title><published>2009-09-10T00:21:57Z</published><updated>2009-09-10T00:21:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/09/i-could-kiss-andrew-sullivan/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the final month composing &lt;em&gt;The Science of Kissing&lt;/em&gt;, it can be challenging to maintain a sense of the manuscript’s ‘&lt;em&gt;big picture&lt;/em&gt;‘ while getting lost editing a single paragraph at a time.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Anthracyclines don't require an oncologist with a genial bedside manner to slow the growth of tumors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
...the placebo response has limits. It can ease the discomfort of chemotherapy, but it won't stop the growth of tumors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placebo, if it exists as a utile clinical entity (and I'm still not convinced) cannot cure cancer---but chemotherapy can, no matter what hand waving and chanting may or may not accompany it.  This goes directly to the concept of "plausibility".

In response, I got a lot of jokes about how 9/9/09 is the sign of the upside down beast, or similar. I didn’t realize at the time that one of the biggest news stories of the day—&lt;a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1053257&amp;amp;lang=eng_news"&gt;a few Bolivians hijacking a commercial plane in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;—was spurred by just such a stupid belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader Daniela just tipped us off to &lt;a href="http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/625455.html"&gt;this article at ElUniversal.com&lt;/a&gt; (here’s &lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;amp;prev=_t&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eluniversal.com.mx%2Fnotas%2F625455.html&amp;amp;sl=es&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;history_state0="&gt;the English translation&lt;/a&gt;), which breaks the news that hijacker Josmar &lt;del&gt;Aeromexico&lt;/del&gt; Flores Pereira is a pastor who believed he received a divine revelation from the Holy Spirit encouraging him to take the plane today because of the upside down significance of the date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, we have a case of a seemingly absurd belief that results in very serious consequences. Thanks to a bit of luck and I imagine a lot of skill of the Mexican police forces, not a single shot was fired and not a single person was injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've ever wondered if you should exercise during pregnancy or how elephants communicate, I'd suggest checking out &lt;a href="http://www.lifelines.tv"&gt;LIfeLines&lt;/a&gt;.  LifeLines is a podcast produced by the &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org"&gt;American Physiological Society&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each month Christine Guilfoy of the APS's communications office and Executive Director Dr. Martin Frank present some of the month's biggest findings in physiology.  They also frequently interview an investigator about a topic of interest.  One of my favorites was last month's program on exercise during pregnancy.  Christine interviewed Dr. Linda May of the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences and Dr. Kathleen Gustafson of the University of Kansas Medical Center.   Marty also presented some new findings about the role of estrogen in stroke.  This month's podcast is about work done by Dr. Caitlin O'Connell-Rodwell of Stanford University describing how elephants are able to pick up communications from other elephants through the ground based on their ability to detect seismic disturbances.

But figuring out just what the role is has proven frustrating. The tiny, airborne particles that fly out of smokestacks, tailpipes and ordinary biomass fires can either help cool the earth by reflecting sunlight, for example. But they can also settle on snow in the form of soot and absorb heat. Now comes a paper that claims to have calculated the net effect. If the researchers are right, they've identified an important piece of the climate change puzzle.

Just as important, however, is their use of observations, rather than computer models, to produce an accurate "heat budget" of the planet. To anyone who hasn't already made up their mind that climatologists are universally misguided, this should help boost confidence in the science behind anthropogenic global warming.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I noticed that there wasn’t a group for non-believers,” she said. “I feel like everyone should have a place to discuss their beliefs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group’s goals will be to talk about what other religions believe, why atheists’ beliefs differ and how to dispel any bad connotations people have about atheism, Rumpler said. She said a lot of people have negative notions about Atheists, such as they are radicals or are out to harm other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want people to realize that atheists are the same kind of people that everyone else is; they just believe differently,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s awesome — I wish the group the best of luck.  The first meeting sounded like it was a blast by location alone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Atheist Society’s first meeting [was] at 5 p.m. Sunday in front of the Naked Lady in Bracken Library.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Lauren, you’re doing it wrong.  You don’t introduce the debauchery until the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; meeting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, there is another issue not mentioned in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Secular Student Alliance’s most recent affiliation survey from last Spring, there is already a group for atheists on campus — the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=29608668749"&gt;Ball State University Freethought Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.  (I confirmed that the group still does exist and will be starting their own meetings shortly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means there are two groups for atheists on this campus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises an interesting dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As atheists become more vocal and public, there may come a time when it’s fairly normal to see more than one atheist group on a given campus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen upwards of 70-80 Christian groups at major universities.  They separate themselves based on worship-style, ethnicity, denomination, etc.  I always thought that was silly, even if their reasons for having certain groups made some sense.  It seems to me they would be more powerful if they were one strong Christian voice on campus instead of so many fragmented groups, only some of which work together on certain issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what should happen with us?  &lt;strong&gt;Should atheists welcome multiple freethought groups on any one campus or should we work on starting/building/maintaining just one strong group at any one school?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Krauss, the director of the Origins Initiative at Arizona State University, is the author of “The Physics of ‘Star Trek.’”  Below is an article he wrote, originally published in The New York Times on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;August, 31, 2009&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/LawrenceM_Krauss%20crop%2075.jpg" style="margin:0pt 5px 5px 0pt" align="left"&gt;Now that the hype surrounding the 40th anniversary of the Moon landings has come and gone, we are faced with the grim reality that if we want to send humans back to the Moon the investment is likely to run in excess of $150 billion. The cost to get to Mars could easily be two to four times that, if it is possible at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dgR8mUEWmaQ/SqgGOcYywII/AAAAAAAAAAc/e2g0nN5KHzY/s1600-h/Apollo-11-moon-landing-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:320px;height:320px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dgR8mUEWmaQ/SqgGOcYywII/AAAAAAAAAAc/e2g0nN5KHzY/s320/Apollo-11-moon-landing-3.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the issue being wrestled with by a NASA panel, convened this year and led by Norman Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin, that will in the coming weeks present President Obama with options for the near-term future of human spaceflight. It is quickly becoming clear that going to the Moon or Mars in the next decade or two will be impossible without a much bigger budget than has so far been allocated. Is it worth it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most challenging impediment to human travel to Mars does not seem to involve the complicated launching, propulsion, guidance or landing technologies but something far more mundane: the radiation emanating from the Sun’s cosmic rays. The shielding necessary to ensure the astronauts do not get a lethal dose of solar radiation on a round trip to Mars may very well make the spacecraft so heavy that the amount of fuel needed becomes prohibitive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is, however, a way to surmount this problem while reducing the cost and technical requirements, but it demands that we ask this vexing question: Why are we so interested in bringing the Mars astronauts home again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the idea of sending astronauts aloft never to return is jarring upon first hearing, the rationale for one-way trips into space has both historical and practical roots. Colonists and pilgrims seldom set off for the New World with the expectation of a return trip, usually because the places they were leaving were pretty intolerable anyway. Give us a century or two and we may turn the whole planet into a place from which many people might be happy to depart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, one of the reasons that is sometimes given for sending humans into space is that we need to move beyond Earth if we are to improve our species’ chances of survival should something terrible happen back home. This requires people to leave, and stay away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are more immediate and pragmatic reasons to consider one-way human space exploration missions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, money. Much of the cost of a voyage to Mars will be spent on coming home again. If the fuel for the return is carried on the ship, this greatly increases the mass of the ship, which in turn requires even more fuel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dgR8mUEWmaQ/SqgG5-oFBTI/AAAAAAAAAAs/W8gyYKsjetk/s1600-h/mars.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:320px;height:320px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dgR8mUEWmaQ/SqgG5-oFBTI/AAAAAAAAAAs/W8gyYKsjetk/s320/mars.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The president of the Mars Society, Robert Zubrin, has offered one possible solution: two ships, sent separately. The first would be sent unmanned and, once there, combine onboard hydrogen with carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere to generate the fuel for the return trip; the second would take the astronauts there, and then be left behind. But once arrival is decoupled from return, one should ask whether the return trip is really necessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surely if the point of sending astronauts is to be able to carry out scientific experiments that robots cannot do (something I am highly skeptical of and one of the reasons I don’t believe we should use science to attempt to justify human space exploration), then the longer they spend on the planet the more experiments they can do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, if the radiation problems cannot be adequately resolved then the longevity of astronauts signing up for a Mars round trip would be severely compromised in any case. As cruel as it may sound, the astronauts would probably best use their remaining time living and working on Mars rather than dying at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it sounds unrealistic to suggest that astronauts would be willing to leave home never to return alive, then consider the results of several informal surveys I and several colleagues have conducted recently. One of my peers in Arizona recently accompanied a group of scientists and engineers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on a geological field trip. During the day, he asked how many would be willing to go on a one-way mission into space. Every member of the group raised his hand. The lure of space travel remains intoxicating for a generation brought up on “Star Trek” and “Star Wars.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We might want to restrict the voyage to older astronauts, whose longevity is limited in any case. Here again, I have found a significant fraction of scientists older than 65 who would be willing to live out their remaining years on the red planet or elsewhere. With older scientists, there would be additional health complications, to be sure, but the necessary medical personnel and equipment would still probably be cheaper than designing a return mission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:left"&gt;Delivering food and supplies to these new pioneers — along with the tools to grow and build &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dgR8mUEWmaQ/SqgGieOUfzI/AAAAAAAAAAk/NWduhtjqwEc/s1600-h/the-physics-of-star-trek.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:213px;height:320px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dgR8mUEWmaQ/SqgGieOUfzI/AAAAAAAAAAk/NWduhtjqwEc/s320/the-physics-of-star-trek.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;whatever they need, for however long they live on the red planet — is likewise more reasonable and may be less expensive than designing a ticket home. Certainly, as in the Zubrin proposal, unmanned spacecraft could provide the crucial supply lines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The largest stumbling block to a consideration of one-way missions is probably political. NASA and Congress are unlikely to do something that could be perceived as signing the death warrants of astronauts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, human space travel is so expensive and so dangerous that we are going to need novel, even extreme solutions if we really want to expand the range of human civilization beyond our own planet. To boldly go where no one has gone before does not require coming home again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/RMINSD7MmT4%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-3837191206688554422?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Mooney and Kirshenbaum have it all wrong.  They favour corporate communications, which are written by people outside science and which easily become mere PR machines for individuals and institutions.   Such blogs are rarely popular and at their worst they threaten the honesty of science.  More and more individual scientists have found that they can write their own blog.  It costs next to nothing and you can say what you think.  A few clicks and the world can read what you have to say.   Forget corporate communications.  Just do it yourself.  It's fun.  And think of the money you'd save for doing science if the PR people were just fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if it's quite 'corporate speak' they want, but they do seem to want to put gatekeepers in place, and filter the voice of science to remove any rough edges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/is_this_book_dead_yet.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/hfUQZ0nQ6zo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252532594274"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/09/headline-writers-need-to-be-poked-with-a-sharp-stick/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1f227132b412740a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Headline writers need to be poked with a sharp stick</title><published>2009-09-09T21:30:48Z</published><updated>2009-09-09T21:30:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/09/headline-writers-need-to-be-poked-with-a-sharp-stick/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, in the news biz, both online and in print, the journalist writes the article, and the editors write the headline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we should not want to shout obscenities at David Derbyshire about the dumb and grossly inaccurate headline for his article, &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1212060/Ancient-skeletons-discovered-Georgia-threaten-overturn-theory-human-evolution.html?ITO=1490"&gt;&amp;quot;Ancient skeletons discovered in Georgia threaten to overturn the theory of human evolution&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Unless he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; write it, whereupon he should then be tied to a chair and forced to read Chick tracts for three hours or until his brain melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is actually interesting, about hominid fossils found in (east European) Georgia indicating that diaspora patterns of our early primate cousins were very different than currently thought. However, this certainly doesn’t &amp;quot;overturn&amp;quot; anything about evolution. Instead, if it pans out, it will be another piece of the vast puzzle that is human prehistory. That’s how science works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s obvious that the headline was written in an attempt to garner attention by hyperbolizing an otherwise already-cool story. Of course, the Daily Mail is well-known for this sort of shenanigans. You’d be better off getting your science news elsewhere. Where, you ask? I want to say one word to you. Just one word. Are you listening?&lt;/p&gt;

We had Data Jack and his lovely wife head-up a mass exodus from Wisconsin (however temporary) to Chicago. Then we had Ubermoogle one up them by traveling here from Canada, bringing in even more people from Wisconsin to meet him. And last weekend, blowing off Dragon*Con for HemantMehtaCon, we got to hang out with some pretty rad-ass Brits! In the middle of all that, there was a regularly scheduled skeptics meet-up and a first ever skeptic parents and preschooler/toddler/baby meet up! We’re getting pretty critical-thinkinged out over here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, actually, we’re not. And I think we need to keep this party going. In fact, I’m thinking we should kick this bitch up a notch. The success of the last few weeks, especially the increase in the number of lady-types, has inspired me to head up the very first ever &lt;strong&gt;Skepchicamp&lt;/strong&gt;! But, I’m going to need your help… because that’s how these things work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepchicamp is bascially just &lt;a href="http://skepticamp.org/"&gt;Skepticamp&lt;/a&gt;, but we’re going to place our focus on women and womeny topics. If you’re completely unfamiliar with the whole Skepticamp/Barcamp concept, let me explain it to you by completely ripping off the &lt;a href="http://skepticamp.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Skepticamp wiki&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is SkeptiCamp? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SkeptiCamps are informal, community-organized events born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. Everyone from casual skeptics to the experienced participate, give talks and get to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a new kind of &lt;a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcamp" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcamp"&gt;BarCamp&lt;/a&gt;, an ‘unconference’ whose content is provided by the attendees themselves. Where BarCamp focuses on technology, SkeptiCamp instead focuses on science advocacy, critical thinking, pseudoscience, paranormal claims, alternative medicine and the &lt;a title="Session Ideas" href="http://skepticamp.org/wiki/Session_Ideas"&gt;hundreds of topics&lt;/a&gt; of interest to skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that, while I’m responsible for coming up with the idea, everyone is responsible for everything that happens at Skepchicamp. And while it’s free to attend, you don’t get in without contributing to the conference. This means you could speak, help organize, donate supplies or manpower or expertise, or make some other contribution… like purchasing beer for the conference. Also, this is not limited to just women… but rather, focused on women. Boys are totally welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So obviously, to get this off the ground, I’m going to need your help. This is a call to action! I want to set a target date for some time in February, and have our first planning meeting some time in the next few weeks. If you’re interested in coming to the first planning meeting, please let me know. I’m hoping to hold it on a Saturday afternoon, in a central-ish location with Wi-Fi. Suggestions for a planning HQ and date are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

Foremost because the nature of substance abuse is always a fun topic for discussion when you are dealing with a compound which the users argue so strenuously is perfectly benign. Even more so because the advocacy position tends to put a finer point on the argument about just how to draw lines between ordered and disordered behavior within what is very likely a continuous distribution.  The paper also shows some of the limitations of trying to fit drugs which have very distinct subjective experience profiles, use patterns and even dependence modes/risks into a single (albeit reasonably flexible) diagnostic strategy. 

In their paper Test-re-test reliability of DSM-IV adopted criteria for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) abuse and dependence: a cross-national study, Cottler and colleagues are primarily focused on whether diagnostic criteria for MDMA abuse and dependence (there are distinct diagnoses for some substances of abuse within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, but not for MDMA which falls under the general abuse criteria) are reliable. As you might imagine, it is a pretty important part of medical diagnosis that a given clinical test gives the same answer when repeated for the same individual in close temporal proximity. It is no great leap of genius to see that reliability is even more important when the diagnostic instrument consists of asking people about their affect and behaviors. Particularly when the behaviors are illegal and socially stigmatized.

She offers a detailed explanation as to why she’s innocent, and you as one viewer among many are left to decide if she’s telling the truth. 

Now let’s say that instead of watching her on broadcast television, you’re watching her live on closed circuit television. Only you can see her being interviewed about the alleged crime – it’s just you, a TV monitor and a woman in a room telling her story.

Finally, imagine that instead of watching her on any sort of television, you are sitting across the table from her, listening to her explain why she’s innocent.

Under which of those three conditions do you think you’d find the woman more believable?

Compare an echidna and a hedgehog, distantly related mammals with very similar lifestyles. This kind of convergence can occur on much smaller scales of time and space, too, as a new paper just released online by Proceedings of the Royal Society shows. Its authors demonstrate that populations of spadefoot toads have independently evolved the same response to competition from another toad species [$-a].

Spea multiplicata, the New Mexico spadefoot toad. Photo by J.N. Stuart.As tadpoles, spadefoot toads (Spea multiplicata) have two feeding strategies: they can be omnivores, feeding on organic debris in the water around them; or carnivores, feeding on aquatic crustaceans and sometimes other tadpoles. The two strategies are linked to a developmental switch -- tadpoles that start eating crustaceans develop larger heads, the better to eat their fellows, presumably. This switch is handy in minimizing competition for food with another, related toad species, S. bombifrons. In ponds where S. multiplicata and S. bombifrons occur together, S. multiplicata tadpoles are much more likely to become omnivores, and S. bombibfrons are more likely to become carnivores, than is the case for either species when they&amp;#39;re the only ones in the pond.

This solution to competition might have evolved two ways: it may have turned up once, in a single population of S. multiplicata, which was then able to colonize other ponds containing the competitor; or it may have emerged independently in multiple populations experiencing similar natural selection from competition. The new study&amp;#39;s authors show that the second scenario is more likely by comparing the genetic similarity of multiple S. multiplicata populations to the frequency of their competitors, and showing that competition strength, not genetic relatedness, is the better predictor of how likely S. multiplicata tadpoles are to become omnivores.

Their results indicated that sex and recombination were generally selected against regardless of the model of interaction given the assumptions of the quasi linkage equilibrium (QLE, in this case, weak selection and strong recombination).  In their numerical simulations that explored parameter space potentially outside the assumptions of the QLE, they found that some cases of the matching-genotypes model (or a strict matching alleles model) of interactions would favor sex and recombination.Kouyos et al (2007) looked at a wide range of matching alleles models (MAM) and found that when selection was strong, some models would favor sex and recombination.  Salathé et al (2008b) also provide evidence of strong selection favoring recombination under the MAM.  However, both did find that the closer these models were to a multiplicative form of the MAM, sex and recombination were selected against.  These multiplicative matching alleles models (MMAM) were described by Otto and Nuismer (2004) as the negative control in their numerical simulations because they never favored recombination.  Their QLE results also indicated that this model of interaction should not generate linkage disequilibrium and therefore neither favor nor select against recombination.  Contrary to this, in a surprising result by Kouyos et al (2007), their simulations found that there was strong selection against recombination (rather than no selection at all) in the parameter space near a MMAM.It was this surprising result that was explained in the paper that we read this past week for Coevolvers (Kouyos et al 2009).  Here the authors investigated why this parameter space shows strong selection again recombination.  In a MMAM, there are no epistatic interactions between the loci involved in the fitness of the interaction between host and parasite.  Despite this, previous observations (Kouyos et al 2007) and the current simulations have shown that strong linkage disequilibrium is built up and maintained.  It turns out that here that an interaction governed by the MMAM can equilibrate to a region of high complementarity.  The importance of this is that this equilibrium is such that any recombination among the loci will generate genotypes that have a lower fitness and recombination should be selected against.I think that this recent paper (Kouyos et al 2009) sheds more light on specific potential microevolutionary mechanisms that drive the maintenance of recombination.  We still need empirical test of some more of these new predictions.  The challenge for empiricists is to find the right kind of systems and a challenge for the theoreticians is to help design the right kinds of experiments.While I have just touched on a couple of recent results testing aspects of the Red Queen Hypothesis, Salathé et al (2008a) produced a wonderful review of many of many recent theoretical results on the evolution of sex and recombination driven by host-parasite interactions.  In addition, this group has another paper on this topic out recently in the American Naturalist (Salathé et al 2009) that I&amp;#39;m looking forward to reading.ReferencesKouyos, R., M.

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, women are supposedly able to walk, read a newspaper, send text messages and help old ladies across the street while simultaneously reciting their children’s birthdays, shoe sizes, favourite sweets, least favourite foods and names of their best friends. On the other hand, men can just about manage to chew gum without falling over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;’I’m concentrating on breathing’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely a sexism thing going on there: women can multitask; men can’t. I guess it’s fair enough, given that misogyny is endemic in our culture. But, you see, it’s actually a well-kept secret. As a man, I can say that we can do things like put up shelves, look after the baby and cook dinner &lt;em&gt;all the while&lt;/em&gt; listening to the cricket. Truth is, we’d much rather sit and watch the cricket and pretend that we’re stretching our limited resources by knowing exactly how much beer remains in the fridge (just don’t ask us to explain &lt;span&gt;LBW&lt;/span&gt;, OK?). We find life a lot easier if we keep people’s expectations low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Jenny twittered today about &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lablit/status/3863633928"&gt;multitasking&lt;/a&gt;. And while I am keen to find out what exactly was going on in her &lt;span&gt;UCL&lt;/span&gt; empire, I am also reminded of something that happened to me when I went to work for a &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2008/12/30/the-year-of-living-dangerously-part-1"&gt;little company you’ve probably never even heard of&lt;/a&gt; (unless you read this blog).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized pretty early on in my graduate career that I couldn’t afford to do just one thing at a time. If I wanted G-actin (prepared from rabbit muscle) purified and labelled and polymerization-competent during the same timeframe that the protein I had to purify from buckets of chicken gizzards (five day prep, ammonium sulphate extraction followed by four columns, all in the coldroom) was going to be stable, I had to do things simultaneously. Especially if I also wanted to make competent cells so that I could clone and express the domain that I was also trying to crystallize before my stipend ran out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multitasking seemed pretty normal to me, as well as sensible. My first post-doc was the same: cloning, expressing, growing cells and chopping off the fingers of students who didn’t know how to use computers all had to happen at the same time if the papers were to be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quite the shock when I got to the company, and was told very early on that I could only work on one project at a time, and shouldn’t interleave experiments. Because, the story went, all the projects would then suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never did understand that. I did, actually, rather well at that company, getting two projects (the first minor, the second pretty major) to launch and realizing the third was utterly doomed, in three years. So well, that when I stormed out they hired two people to replace me and still spiralled into the ground a year or two later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went back to academia I was straight back into multitasking mode: at any one time I’d be trying to crystallize (or solve by &lt;span&gt;NMR&lt;/span&gt;) five different proteins (the chances of any one protein crystallizing are around 10%. But you never know which 10% it’s going to be in advance, and you can never tell when a sodding high throughput structosomic project is going to gazump you. &lt;em&gt;Cock&lt;/em&gt;) as well as growing cells and doing nuclear import assays, teaching students how not to poison themselves or anyone else, helping out other members of the lab and running secret projects on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same in my new job, too. I don’t feel &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt; unless I’m juggling too many eggs. Not only do I find that I finish multiple tasks ahead of the combined schedule, I also get &lt;em&gt;bored&lt;/em&gt; if I have to stick to one thing and one thing only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe being limited to one project does work for normal people. But for the type of person who likes science? Well, I don’t claim to be normative, and I’d love to hear about your experience. As for me, I go stir crazy if I only have one thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the talk was of providing “&lt;em&gt;climate services&lt;/em&gt;” (CS) and coordinating these globally. But what are &lt;em&gt;climate services&lt;/em&gt;, and how much of what was envisaged is scientifically doable?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climate services&lt;/em&gt; is a fairly new term that involves the provision of climate information relevant for adaptation to climate change and climatic swings, long-term planning, and facilitating early warning systems (EW).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS includes both data describing past and future climate, and usually involves &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/05/climate-models-local-climate/"&gt;downscaling&lt;/a&gt; to provide information on regional and local scales. It can be summarised by the contents of&lt;a href="http://www.climateservices.gov/"&gt; http://www.climateservices.gov/&lt;/a&gt; (also see this &lt;a href="http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2009/February/20090209132739lcnirellep0.3980829.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to an article discussing the US National Climate services). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was stressed during WCC-3 that CS must not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; communicate relevant information, but this information must also be ‘translated’ to non-expert in a way that it can be acted upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17742-worlds-climate-could-cool-first-warm-later.html"&gt;concern expressed&lt;/a&gt; during WCC-3 was that global climate models still do not give a sufficiently accurate description of the regional and local aspects of the climate. The models also have serious limitations when they are to be used for &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090902/ap_on_re_eu/un_us_climate_forecasting"&gt;seasonal and decadal forecasting&lt;/a&gt;. Climate models were originally designed to provide the large picture of our climate system, and the fact that ENSO, cyclones, various wave phenomena (observed in the real world) appear in the model output – albeit with differences in details – give us increased confidence that they capture real physical processes. For climate prediction, these details, often caricatured by the models, must be more accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the dynamical aspects and regional scales are important, one must keep in mind that the atmospheric radiative transfer atmospheric models represent the core of the theory behind AGW, and that AGW involves longer time scales. Few scientists seriously doubt these radiative transfer models, which are closely related to the algorithms used in remote sensing, e.g. by satellites, to calculate temperatures. If one interprets the &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17742-worlds-climate-could-cool-first-warm-later.html"&gt;the New Scientist report from the WCC-3&lt;/a&gt; as that the situation is no longer as dire previously thought, then one is in for a big disappointment. The sentiment is rather that climate change is unavoidable, and that we need to establish tools in order to plan and deal with the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some signs, however, that biases and systematic errors in the global climate models (GCMs) can be reduced by increasing the spatial (and temporal) resolution, or by including a realistic representation of the stratosphere. Problems associated with the description of local and regional climates cannot merely be corrected through downscaling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concern was that the bit of code called ‘parametrisation’ (&lt;em&gt;employed in the models to describe the bulk effect of physical processes taking place over a spatial scale too small for the model grid&lt;/em&gt;) may not be sufficiently good for the job of simulating all local climatic aspects. For this reason, there was a call for a globally coordinated effort in providing computer resources and climate simulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some speakers stressed the importance of a truly global set of climate observation. In this context, it’s also crucial to share data without restrictions, in addition to aiding poor countries to make high quality measurements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the focus during the WCC-3 was on adaptation, it was also stressed that mitigation is still a must, if we are to avoid serious climate calamities. It was concluded that we must move from a ‘Catastrophe handling’ strategy to a ‘Risk management’ policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sad example showing that we are not there yet, was the forecasted June-August 2008 floods over the western/central Africa. It was the first time in history when Red Cross/Crescent launched a &lt;a href="http://www.alertnet.org/db/an_art/58388/2009/07/11-133206-1.htm"&gt;pre-emptive appeal&lt;/a&gt; based on a forecast. Unfortunately, there was a lack of willingness to donate funds before a disaster had taken place, and sadly, the forecasts turned out to be fairly accurate. The question is whether we are doing the same mistake when it comes to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webcasts from the conference have been posted on the &lt;a href="http://www.wmo.int/wcc3/rec_videos_en.php"&gt;WMO WCC-3 web site&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the science, a number of speakers discussed politics. There is also a new book – &lt;a href="http://www.wmo.int/wcc3/documents/WCC-3publicationClimateSense.pdf"&gt;Climate Senses&lt;/a&gt; – that has recently been published for the WCC-3, dealing with climate predictions and information for decision making&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>rasmus</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252526065628"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=17911">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3b8d3d731fdf7adf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="ban"/><category term="smoking"/><title type="html">Why Have Smoking Bans Caught On So Easily?</title><published>2009-09-09T19:06:27Z</published><updated>2009-09-09T19:06:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/why-have-smoking-bans-caught-on-so-easily/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Henry Farrell at the Crooked Timber blog argues that smoking bans succeed in large part because prevailing societal norms about smoking - e.g. "That Irish people can smoke in pubs to their hearts' content, and that others will just have to put up with it" - were much weaker than we thought.</summary><author><name>By Freakonomics</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252526065624"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=17927">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/86821bfd6c37e55f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="iPhones"/><category term="theft"/><title type="html">Find My Phone</title><published>2009-09-09T17:39:04Z</published><updated>2009-09-09T17:39:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/find-my-phone/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Corporations like Amazon and Sirius won't help owners recover their lost gadgets, like cell phones or Kindles or the Sirius receiver.

The procedure involves neurosurgery to implant stimulating electrodes aimed at a target region inside the brain. It works using the same sort of pacemaker-like device used for DBS in Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease, which has been remarkably successful at alleviating symptoms. DBS as a treatment for neurological disorders such as Parkinson&amp;#39;s, primary generalised dystonia, atypical tremor syndromes, cluster headache, phantom limb pain, and epilepsy has been mostly unobjectionable.However, the Neurological/Psychiatric Divide makes DBS for mental illnesses such as major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder more ethically problematic. A new paper in the Archives of General Psychiatry (Rabins et al., 2009)1 summarizes a consensus conference held on this and related issues (such as human subjects protection and the design of clinical trials). A list of 16 guidelines was issued, which included the following:2. Deep brain stimulation for disorders of MBT [Mood, Behavior, and Thought] is at an early proof-of-principle stage and must be considered investigational. Currently, no single target has been validated or demonstrated to be superior to others in any disorder of MBT. Therefore, it is premature to rule out the study of new implantation sites that have a good scientific rationale...3. The comparative efficacy and safety of DBS vs other treatments, including ablative surgery, should be studied further. Such studies are ethical and scientifically necessary.4. Given its history, neurosurgical intervention for disorders of MBT is a socially and culturally sensitive area of research and practice. Therefore, DBS for disorders of MBT should be studied in carefully designed trials and should be performed only at expert centers that are participating in such trials and that adhere to the highest scientific, clinical, and ethical standards.. . .12. The consent process should include discussion of what is and is not known about long-term consequences of DBS. Potential adverse outcomes include potentially limiting participation in future research, inability to use certain other treatments, and an inability to undergo certain tests.  ... Additionally, the consent process should state explicitly that, even with positive outcomes, DBS for disorders of MBT is unlikely by itself to improve all aspects of the individual&amp;#39;s mood, function, and interpersonal relationships: DBS is only one aspect of a comprehensive treatment program.The specific indications mentioned by Rabins and his 18 co-authors were major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome. Severe alcohol dependence was not included as one of the disorders. DBS for alcoholism sounds rather drastic, doesn&amp;#39;t it? Nonetheless, a German research group led by Hans-Jochen Heinze (et al., 2009) was not deterred. They recently reported results from 3 male patients2 with severe and refractory alcohol dependence as part of a small clinical trial that will ultimately include 10 patients.Inclusion criteria are: male gender, age 25–60 years, finished detoxification and subsequent period of abstinence of at least 2 weeks. Moreover, the patients are required to have demonstrated treatment failures of at least two inpatient programs of at least 6 month duration, failure of anti-craving substances (e.g., acamprosate, naltrexone), failure of community and self-help programs. ... Patients are excluded, if they meet any of the following criteria: seizures during the detoxification phase, high score on neuroticism scales, antisocial personality disorder, clinically significant impairments on a neuropsychological test battery Further exclusion criteria were circumscribed brain damage or marked atrophy on MRI, alcohol-related personality change, and use of additional addictive substances.The target region? The nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the “Universal Addiction Site” -- an oversimplification, they admit, but still, the NAcc is......a central place in orchestrating the events related to the “wanting” [Robinson &amp;amp; Berridge, 2008] of alcohol on the one hand and drug-induced neural sensitization on the other hand. Anatomically, the NAcc receives inputs from the prefrontal cortex on the one hand and limbic structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala on the other. This circuitry allows for the integration of contextual information arising from hippocampus and emotional information coming from the amygdala with cognitive information supplied by the PFC in the selection of goal-directed behaviors in general and behaviors related to drug “wanting” in particular, which is why the NAcc has been called a limbic-motor interface.Since anatomical information was not illustrated in the current paper, a figure from the earlier work of Schlaepfer et al., (2007) is presented below.The topographical location of the nucleus accumbens in relation to other brain structures on a horizontal plane 3 mm below the AC-PC plane (Schlaepfer et al., 2007).That protocol was designed to relieve anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure from normally pleasurable life events) in major depression. Why not stimulate the &amp;quot;pleasure center&amp;quot; when you&amp;#39;re feeling blue? Extensive research in animals and humans has demonstrated &amp;quot;hedonic hot spots&amp;quot; (Pecina et al., 2006) [or &amp;quot;liking&amp;quot; of pleasant sensory experiences] in the NAcc that respond to food and pharmaceutical and financial and sexual rewards.But what are the procedures for targeting the same region to reduce reward and pleasure? Well, we don&amp;#39;t know from reading Heinze et al. (2009): &amp;quot;Details regarding the stimulation protocols in the different patients can be found elsewhere&amp;quot; [insert citation of an in press paper that is not online yet]. Details on the &amp;quot;clinical aspects&amp;quot; are pretty sparse and the focus is on the &amp;quot;basic science aspects&amp;quot; (electrophysiological recording and cognitive task performance to assess action monitoring and the salience of drug-related cues).Was the DBS treatment effective? All patients had failed multiple detox treatments, withdrawal therapies,  and drug trials (acamp...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

In so many cases where we can check their distance by other, more fundamental means there seems to be a very nice trend we can use.The theory behind these guys is described by the Chandrasekhar limit, that is, the maximum density at which you can compact an object before the gravity overwhelms internal support forces. For white dwarfs (the dead cores of many stars not massive enough to have gone supernova as they died), they all have a similar radius so usually we just talk about the mass limit as being 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. Any more massive and it would have gone supernova in the first place (a Type II Supernova). If a white dwarf is just under that limit and a companion star dumps enough on it to go over the limit, then a SNe Ia happens.This is a good fit to all the data, but most importantly because SNe Ia don&amp;#39;t have much, if any, hydrogen in their spectra which means that they can&amp;#39;t be main sequence stars that still have their envelope of hydrogen.But as to every story, there&amp;#39;s some exceptions.Back in 2003 a supernova with the exciting name of SNLS-03D3bb occurred that was more than twice as bright as SNe Ia&amp;#39;s should be. It wasn&amp;#39;t reported until 2006 and that same year, another group (Howell et al.) inferred a mass of the pre-explosion core to be 2.1 times the mass of the Sun!Weird.Ok. Whatever. We&amp;#39;ll tweak the model. Maybe these guys were just spinning faster than normal SNe Ia&amp;#39;s which would give them some extra support before the collapse thanks to centrifugal forces. Maybe mass just got dumped on extra fast, as in two white dwarfs colliding. Maybe differential rotation was more important than expected and really does need to be included in the basic model. Maybe the metallicity is somehow really important. Perhaps the orbital period of the white dwarf and the donor star plays an important role. Who knows?So group decided to try to put some constraints on the problem by adding some of these things to the models and trying it out a bunch of different ways.While they haven&amp;#39;t completely solved the problem, the did learn four things:1) If the white dwarf starts off at around ~one solar mass (like most probably are) the resultant supernovae are very uniform, right at the 1.4 limit.2) If the white dwarf is close to 1.2 solar masses to start, the final mass before going supernova can creep up to nearly 1.8 solar masses. Getting there but not good enough.3) To be consistently above the 1.6 solar masses, the donor star must be 2.2 - 3.3 solar masses and in a very short orbit of 0.5 - 4 days. Smaller and shorter if the donor is metal poor.4) Metallicity is important. Metal poor stars are less likely to make these super-Chandrasekhar supernovae. This one&amp;#39;s perhaps the most imminently important one because this means that we&amp;#39;re less likely to be having these oddballs contaminating our data at high redshifts (ie, really far away) which is where they&amp;#39;re the most useful (remember, we have other ways to check distances nearby).So the problem&amp;#39;s not solved, but such is the nature of science.Chen, W., &amp;amp; Li, X.

And &lt;a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/its-now-bhojan-mantra-for-madhya-pradesh-schools_100225949.html"&gt;religious people are mad.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly because this is in India and the prayer is “perceived as a Hindu chant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The schoolchildren in the state will have to recite the ‘bhojan mantra’ before their midday meals. This will come into force from Sep 5 – Teacher’s Day this year,” says a notice from state School Education Minister Archana Chitnis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directive has stirred controversy as many Muslims say the imposition of such a chant is against the religious freedom of minorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mantra is, “Anna grahan karne se pehle, vichar man mein karna hai; Kis hetu se is sharir ka rakshan poshan karna hai; Hey parmeshwar, ek prarthana nitya tumhare charnon mein; Lag jaaye tan man dhan mera, matr bhumi ki sewa mein.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translated into English it means: “Before eating, let us think why we have to nourish and take care of our bodies. Oh lord, this is a daily prayer to you that my body, mind and wealth be used in the service of the motherland).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the Muslims in this case who are making the most sense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Asking children to recite the mantra before midday meals is unconstitutional. It is unacceptable not only to Muslims but also to other religious minorities,” said Irshad Ali Khan, member of the Majlis-e-Shoora, a Muslim body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will urge the government to withdraw such a diktat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim Tehwar Committee chief Ausaf Shahmiri Khurram also opposed the directive saying, “The order infringes the religious freedom of minorities.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from this?  We’re all better off when religion is kept a private matter.  If you want to pray to your god, go for it.  But to enforce one prayer on everybody is a recipe for failure.  First, because prayer won’t do jack for the students.  Second, because it’s bound to make groups of people (children) unhappy or uncomfortable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if it’s Christians trying to force prayer in American public schools or Hindus doing it in India — if you’re in the majority, that doesn’t give you the right to force your beliefs on everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Emma&lt;/strong&gt; adds one more point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From some, Googling the word ‘lord’ (parmeshwar) should probably have been translated as Lord (with a capital ‘l’).  Parmeshwar is apparently used in many Hindi translations of the Bible.   So why are the Christians so upset?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago today was the Republican National Convention, and at that time (and prior, during, and after) numerous arrests were made under Patriot-Act spawn laws of people who did little more than attempt vigorous protest, plan vigorous protest, or in some cases, randomly blunder into town at the wrong moment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most charges were dropped (but not all ... we hopefully await that event in about a month) and law suits that have great promise have advanced.  And now, owing to some excellent reporting based on recently obtained materials, we now know the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Saint Paul Police and their allies in law enforcement are pigs.  And, they are stupid pigs.  And I'll throw the mayor of Saint Paul in that category as well, at least until he publicly and formally apologizes for what happened.  And then there are the judges that let this travesty happen.&lt;/p&gt;

At the time, it looked like the repairs worked well (as in, nothing obvious went wrong, electronics woke up and said “hi”, etc).  However, until the instruments actually take data, one never knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="http://www.hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/25/"&gt;now we know&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" width="500"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img width="500" src="http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2009-25-d-large_web.jpg" alt="Omega Centauri"&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new and refurbished instruments officially kick astronomical butt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, I’ve been hearing rumors of killer numbers, at least for the imaging cameras — throughputs that are 15% better than measured from the ground, electronic read noises that are lower than before the instruments broke a few years back.  I have no numbers on the spectrographs, but the press release photos show some nice looking spectra, which is a zillion percent improvement on the pre-repair state of the telescope, for which the only spectroscopic capabilities were grisms (which only the most studly of spectroscopists dare to use).  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/09/hubble-is-back/"&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt; will probably have more, given his history with one of the refurbished spectrographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For the near-infrared channel of the new imager WFC3, I can personally verify awesomeness.  We got some imaging during the last month, and had to sign non-disclosure agreements that we would keep our mouths shut, which was nearly impossible because the data quality was insane.) &lt;/p&gt;

They convince other people to give up religion by writing long, scholarly books and the occasional angry essay, or by encouraging them to learn more about religion, or by not actually caring whether or not a person is religious. They should really take notes from the Franklin Crossroads Baptist Church in Kentucky, &lt;a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=1973713"&gt;where new recruits to the faith are drafted by taking minors to a group baptism without their parents’ permission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/JesusFootball.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="JesusFootball" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/JesusFootball.jpg" alt="JesusFootball" width="322" height="397"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Two weeks ago, public-high-school football coach Scott Mooney took about 20 members of his team of minors on a “team-building” trip to a church 40 kilometers away, in a school bus, with the school superintendent in attendance, without requiring permission slips, and with at least one parent under the impression that the team was going to have dinner and hear a motivational speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight of the kids changed into white robes and were baptized. At least one kid says he had no idea what was going on, and boy is his Catholic dad pissed—not because he wanted the boy to remain Catholic (the mother is Baptist), but because he wanted his son to be allowed to make up his own mind about his faith, free from the pressure of his coach, superintendent, or teammates. The son, of course, is mortified and just wants his dad to shut up because he “fears ruffling feathers among the team.” What a perfect illustration of why this all happened: peer pressure. What 16-year old boy really wants to be the one who doesn’t go along with the crowd? (While there were other students who weren’t Baptized, if they were already Baptists, they wouldn’t need to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the article is the response from the reverend, Ron Davis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Rev. Davis typically seeks parental consent for baptisms involving minors, he said the boys were “bulked up” and looked older than their 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t check their IDs,” he said, adding that Mr. Mooney — who has brought players to church services in the past — did not pre-arrange for the boys to accept the sacrament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But officer! The boys on the high school football team coached by a known member of my congregation who showed up in a school bus &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; like adults!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/jesus_football.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="jesus_football" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/jesus_football.jpg" alt="jesus_football" width="302" height="232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For full disclosure, I grew up Baptist and was Baptized when I was about seven. The preacher came to my house and asked me questions about Jesus, verifying that I understood I was accepting him as my personal savior. Can a 7-year old really weigh her options, consider alternate religions, and make a rational decision about a thing like that? My adult self says no, of course not—I had never even heard of Islam, Buddhism, or Judaism, and I certainly hadn’t realized that there was even a possibility that my entire family and community could be wrong about the existence of a god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I remember believing fervently in the Baptist god and wanting to be “saved,” and I felt good about my choice. Being Baptized didn’t require that I sign a contract for the rest of my life . . . it just required me to affirm what I believed at that time in front of my congregation. And hey, at least it was what my parents thought would be best for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bamboozled high school football players, though, are another story. Parents were misled and the authority of a public school was used to trick kids into affirming something they didn’t even believe. That’s just slimy. Um, and illegal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, the parents are fighting back. And, this nicely highlights how desperate churches are getting. After all, if your religion is so shitty that you have to trick minors into joining it, you’ve got a serious PR problem on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

The merits of calories counts on menus can be debated (I personally feel the potential benefits far outweigh the potential costs), but a recent study makes one thing perfectly clear - meals eaten in fast food restaurants contain an absolutely unbelievable number of calories.

The new study, which is available ahead of print on the website of the journal Obesity, was performed by Tamara Dumanovsky and colleagues at the New York City Department of Hygiene and Mental Health.  The authors canvassed 300 randomly selected fast food restaurants between noon and 2pm, and quantified caloric intake by collecting receipts (as well as a follow-up survey) from 7,318 customers.  Calories were assigned to each meal based on the nutritional information posted on each restaurant&amp;#39;s website, and when the calorie content of an item was unclear (for example, if the participant did not divulge the type of salad dressing that they used), it was assumed that the item was the lowest-calorie item in its category....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fossils of a newly discovered species of dinosaur -- a 10-meter-long, elephant-weight predator -- were discovered in 1996 along the banks of Argentina's Rio Colorado, and are now being reported after a long period of careful study.   This dinosaur dates to about 85 million years (which falls within the Cretaceous period). 

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most interesting feature of &lt;em&gt;Aerosteon riocoloradensis&lt;/em&gt; is that it demonstrates the evolution of a bird-like respiratory system in an animal that is definitely not bird-like in most other ways.   Indeed, the authors of this paper imply that this dinosaur's respiratory system represents an early phase in the evolution of the bird's respiratory system.  This is a case of an adaptation arising in one context and later being used in an entirely different context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how evolution often works:  An adaptation arises for one reason, and then that adaptation is employed in a similar way but for a very different purpose (it is "exapted" as Stephen Gould would say) in a later organism.  In this case, we see a lung adapted for a certain kind of efficiency in a terrestrial organism.  Later, if the authors are correct, this same efficiency-enhancing adaptation is used in birds as an adaptation related to flight, an entirely different reason.  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;This diagram shows a reconstruction of the dinosaur &lt;em&gt;Aerosteon riocoloradensis&lt;/em&gt; in outline, with the features identified as related to the pneumatic (breathing-related) adaptations indicated.  You can access the original paper on line if you wish to study these features in more detail.  Suffice it to say that there are a lot of pneumatic features of interest!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In order to understand the significance of this find, it may be helpful to first discuss some interesting things about tetrapod lungs, and bird lungs in particular.  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In critiquing his [Dawkins’] example and arguing that information is not created by unguided evolutionary processes, we are indeed making an argument that supports ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various science bloggers have critiqued it; see &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/08/quick_critique_dembski_and_mar.php" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/QuintessenceOfDust/~3/OF1QQWlcmr4/weasels-clouds-and-biomorphs-part-i.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/a-peer-reviewed.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Metropolis Sampler has published &lt;a href="http://msampler.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/a-priori-bias-in-the-dembski-marks-representation/" rel="external "&gt;a more technical analysis of the paper&lt;/a&gt;, concluding that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental lesson here is that the Dembski-Marks approach to evaluating model assumptions is both arbitrary and a poor reflection of scientific reasoning. Model assumptions are not accepted or rejected based on a numerical measure of how many logical possibilities that are ruled out or how far probability distributions deviate from uniform measures. Rather, model assumptions are accepted or rejected based on predictive and descriptive accuracy, domain of applicability, ability to unify existing models and empirical knowledge, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ID creationists persistently use models that misrepresent theories (or in the case of the WEASEL hoorah, misrepresent what the model is intended to represent), and then conclude (on the basis of syntactic manipulations of the model) that the theories are invalid.  Dembski, of course, is a serial offender in this respect, and it’s a pity that he’s inveigled Marks into sharing his delusions.

&lt;p&gt;On his blog, &lt;a href="http://tundratabloid.blogspot.com/2009/03/finland-free-speech-slammed-in-helsinki.html"&gt;he had made comments about Islam&lt;/a&gt; that some found offensive (here’s &lt;a href="http://www.halla-aho.com/scripta/muutama_taky_illmanin_mikalle.html"&gt;the original posting&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Prophet Muhammad was a pedophile and islam revers pedophilia as a religion. Islam is a religion of pedophilia. Pedophilia is Allah’s will.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these statements illegal? They certainly insult muslim’s religious feelings. Let’s approach the issue logically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a 50 year-old man Muhammad was engaged to six or seven year old Aisha. Their marriage was “consummated” when Aisha was nine years old. It is possible to think that they were living in another age and Muhammad’s deeds must not be judged according to today’s standards, but as we have learned during the last few years, schoolbooks from the 50’s were racist when they spoke about ”negroes” (even if ”negro” was not a racist term at the time by anybody’s standards), it’s equally justified to call a child rapist who lived 1400 years ago a child rapist .´&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has to be done so that the bolded statements were not true? You must insist that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) … Quran is not literally true (i.e Muhammad did not have sexual relations with a nine year old girl). This will not do, since according to Islamic doctrine and muslims’ opinion Quran is a literal word of Allah. Consummation and Aisha’s age cannot be denied without insulting muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) …Muhammad’s actions were not always acceptable. This will not do either, since according to muslims (and Tampere district court) criticizing Muhammad is the same as criticizing Allah and therefore blasphemy. The penalty is death. Muslim’s believe that Muhammad’s actions were the will of Allah. Because Muhammad had sexual relations with a child, that was Allah’s will as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we see, all the argumentative ways to disprove the bolded statements have been theologically exhausted. The fact that Muhammad was a pedophile and Allah supported pedophilia can only be denied either by denying the literal truthfulness of Quran or Muhammad’s status as a messenger of Allah whose actions are according to the will of Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I repeat my claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prophet Muhammad was a pedophile and islam revers pedophilia as a religion. Islam is a religion of pedophilia. Pedophilia is Allah’s will.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not some random slur against Muslims.  It’s an argument to be defended or refuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Halla-aho was taken to court over this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He now has to &lt;a href="http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2009/09/true_finns_councillor_fined_for_defaming_religion_986953.html"&gt;pay a fine of 330 euros&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ridiculous.  It’s been said before, but blasphemy is a victimless crime, and this “offense” is hardly blasphemy.  It’s a critique of what the Quran says.  To fine him for this sends a signal that criticism or analysis of religious works is off-limits.  No books or people or fictional beings should be revered like that.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halla-aho plans to appeal, but he’s got a long road ahead of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always surprising to hear a European country taking such drastic measures.  I almost expect it in America, but I thought Europeans were better than us when it came to matters of religion and free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

After a long and nervous wait for those of us stuck on Earth, &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/25/"&gt;the world’s most famous observatory is back on the job&lt;/a&gt;! Behold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W00t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s NGC 6217, a spiral galaxy &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/multimedia/ero/ero_ngc6217.html"&gt;as seen by Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys&lt;/a&gt;, a workhorse detector on Hubble that went on the fritz in January 2007. But when the STS-125 brought the Space Shuttle &lt;em&gt;Atlantis&lt;/em&gt; to Hubble, it also carried two new cameras and the tools to fix two older, busted ones, including ACS. After a daring series of repairs and upgrades, Hubble is now back up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ACS image is gorgeous. NGC 6217 is relatively close by, at a distance of roughly 80 million light years (note that some early press said it was 6 million light years away, which is incorrect). The gas and stars in the middle form an exquisite rectangular bar across the core due to complicated gravitational interactions, and you can easily pick out huge numbers of glowing pink star forming areas, where stars are being born in prodigious quantities. And even from this vast distance — 800 &lt;strong&gt;quintillion&lt;/strong&gt; kilometers (500 quintillion miles) — Hubble can still pick out individual stars in the spiral arms. These are the biggest, baddest, and brightest ones, the stars that will someday explode as monstrous supernovae… and you can rest assured astronomers will be using Hubble or its successors to observe them when they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s more! Check out this deep image of the cluster Omega Centauri:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/384605main_ero_omega_centauri_full_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2667/3903367851_f76fa32c05_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/multimedia/ero/ero_omega_centauri.html"&gt;This picture&lt;/a&gt; is from the newly installed Wide Field Camera 3, the third generation such camera on Hubble. The image shows a portion of the globular cluster Omega Centauri, a giant ball of millions of stars that orbits the Milky Way. This image alone shows about 100,000 stars at all stages of evolution, from slowly glowing yellow to furiously churning red — stars at the ends of their lives, about to fizzle out into tiny, hot white dwarfs — and finally sapphire blue stars, helium-rich objects also nearing cosmic senescence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of all the gorgeous images released today, there is one that is very, very special to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/multimedia/ero/ero_eta_carinae.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2657/3903389361_46bd70c3af_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not look like much to you, but to me that picture &lt;em&gt;sings&lt;/em&gt;. As far as the science goes, it’s a spectrum (the light from an object sliced up into thousands of individual colors) of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/06/20/eta-car-tick-tock-tick-tock/"&gt;the titanic star Eta Carinae&lt;/a&gt;, a monster 100 times the mass of the Sun — the upper limit for how big a star can be without tearing itself apart — that will some day soon explode as a supernova, and may even be a gamma-ray burst. This image shows the light from the star dissected, displaying the velocity and chemical composition of the massive gas clouds surrounding the star: huge lobes of material ejected in a violent outburst from the star over a hundred years ago. Spectra like this let us keep tabs on Eta Car, monitoring it for changes that will gives us clues on how this bizarre and frankly scary star is behaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to me, as important as the science and knowledge gained from this data are, it’s the mere fact of its &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt; that is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3536453593/in/set-72157607165535706/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3341/3536453593_4db2e711c4_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A prelaunch STIS in 1997.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image is from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectroscope, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/17/why-im-watching-the-hubble-repairs-so-intently/"&gt;a camera I worked on for more than six years&lt;/a&gt;. I helped calibrate and test STIS as it was built, and I watched as it roared into space aboard &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; in 1997. For three more years I worked on the incredible data from STIS, displayed on my computer screen, as this camera tool the pulse of the Universe with spectra and images of objects as close as asteroids in our solar system to galaxies 10 billion light years away. I worked on data that laid out to me the chemical composition, temperature, and distance of stars, galaxies, gas clouds, gamma-ray bursts, and so much more. I sweated blood on STIS, and so when it suffered a debilitating short in 2004 I was pretty upset. It was like losing a member of the family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STIS sat silent for five years, orbiting the Earth in Hubble’s instrument bay. But in May 2009, astronauts were able to repair the shorted computer board on STIS during a very dramatic space walk. After that I heard &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; for months, which was making me nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no longer. I’m not at all ashamed to say that when I saw this STIS graphic of Eta Car, I choked up, and there were — oh hell, &lt;em&gt;there still are&lt;/em&gt; as I write this — tears in my eyes. I’m so proud of the team that built STIS, the hundreds of people who used it, the incredible people at NASA, and the men and women of our astronaut corps who risked their lives to make sure our eye on the sky is clear, clean, updated, and razor-focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its quiver full of new and newly repaired cameras, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/SM4/main/SM4_Essentials.html"&gt;shiny new gyroscopes&lt;/a&gt; and other critical pieces of equipment, we’ll be seeing more and better-than-ever scientific images and spectra from Hubble for many, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; more years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252511548437"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/requiem_for_a_quack.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a586c80179a56760</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Requiem for a quack</title><published>2009-09-09T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-09T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/pWlhCgQ7Z-Y/requiem_for_a_quack.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/requiem_for_a_quack.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;What can one say about a woman who wrote books with titles such as&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1890035009"&gt; The Cure For All Cancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1890035165"&gt;The Cure For All Advanced Cancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1890035025"&gt;The Cure for HIV and AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1890035017"&gt;The Cure For All Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, and, most recently, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cure-Prevention-All-Cancers/dp/1890035580"&gt;The Cure and Prevention of All Cancers&lt;/a&gt; (with bonus DVD)? A woman who stated that a liver fluke is the cause of all cancer and that she could cure all cancer by zapping the liver fluke with a device that looks as though it's constructed from spare parts purchased at Radio Shack? What can one say about a woman who can make a video like the one below?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid%3D-135125406106198814%26hl%3Den%26fs%3Dtrue&amp;amp;width=100&amp;amp;height=100" width="100" height="100"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief, what can one say about "Dr." &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulda_Regehr_Clark"&gt;Hulda Regehr Clark&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call her a quack, because that's what she was. I say "was" because I have recently learned that on September 3, 2009 &lt;a href="http://inmemoryofdrhuldaclark.com"&gt;Hulda Clark died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, this quack has quacked her last quack and killed her last patient. This quack is no more! She has ceased to be! She's expired and gone to meet 'er maker! She's a stiff! Bereft of life, she rests in peace! If you hadn't nailed her to the perch she'd be pushing up the daisies! 'er metabolic processes are now 'istory! She's off the twig! She's kicked the bucket. She's shuffled off 'er mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisibile!! This is an ex-quack!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess "Dr." Clark didn't have the "cure for all diseases," after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I couldn't help myself. I even feel slightly guilty about indulging in such a rant, the taboo against speaking ill of the dead being a strong one. No doubt, Hulda Clark's family and friends are devastated, and I can even feel sympathy for them--even the ones who supported her "research" and "treatments." Clark may even have been a very nice and loving woman. I even realize that such a rant is a bit unseemly and may even offend a few readers who detest cancer quackery as much as I do. However, if there's anyone whose natural demise leads me to such a reaction, Hulda Clark is the one. Although I don't wish death upon anyone or even hope for anyone's death, far be it from me to be hypocritical and feign much in the way of sorrow when a woman who has done so much harm to so many patients for so many years is finally, through the fate that awaits each and every one of us sooner or later, rendered unable to do any further harm. And, make no mistake, this is a woman who for over two decades has, in the guise of helping, preyed upon the fears, desperation, and scientific ignorance of many cancer patients in order to sell them useless "cures." She was one of the most infamous of quacks of the sort that I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_price_of_quackery.php"&gt;wrote about yesterday&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/08/the_orange_man_1.php"&gt;few years ago&lt;/a&gt;, the kind whose blandishments lure the unwitting into giving up the best shot they have at beating their cancer. Indeed, she could rightly be called the Dark Lord of Quackery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/requiem_for_a_quack.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/requiem_for_a_quack.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/pWlhCgQ7Z-Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252510352105"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/guess_whos_back.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/106e24a73586e615</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Hubble"/><title type="html">Guess who's back?</title><published>2009-09-09T16:23:41Z</published><updated>2009-09-09T16:23:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/guess_whos_back.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember saying goodbye to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/05/the_camera_that_changed_the_un.php"&gt;Hubble's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/05/the_camera_that_changed_the_u5.php"&gt;old camera&lt;/a&gt;, WFPC2?  This servicing mission was months ago, now, so perhaps you've forgotten about this 19 year old telescope.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/guess_whos_back/hubble-space-telescope.jpg" width="500" title="Floating in this lonely orbit all these years, it still makes quite a picture." alt="hubble-space-telescope.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the new camera, &lt;a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3"&gt;WFC3&lt;/a&gt;, is finally ready to make its debut.  Plans include surveying the Kuiper Belt, looking at newly forming planets, better measuring dark energy, and a new, improved &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/hell_yeah_hubble.php"&gt;Ultra Deep Field&lt;/a&gt; of the distant Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as always, the images are what do it for me.  Take Stephan's Quintet, a group of five galaxies close together.  Regular telescope?  Go, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/guess_whos_back/stephans_quintet.jpg"&gt;click&lt;/a&gt; to enlarge:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/guess_whos_back/stephans_quintet.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/guess_whos_back/stephans_quintet.jpg" width="500" title="This is a pretty nice picture on its own, isn&amp;#39;t it?" alt="stephans_quintet.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad.  But one of the first pictures that Hubble's new camera has released is also of Stephan's Quintet.  It nearly makes my eyeballs pop out, so view it &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/guess_whos_back/hs-2009-25-c-large_web.jpg"&gt;full-size&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;p&gt;Being interested in science communication, I was pleased when the BMJ asked me to review &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America &lt;/em&gt;, by Chris Monney and Sheril Kirshenbaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BMJ provides a link that allows &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/bmj.b3658?ijkey=ZUQzmy5vWqyzmz1&amp;amp;keytype=ref"&gt;you access to the whole review&lt;/a&gt;. They have made very few changes from the submitted version, which is reproduced below (with live links in the text. [Download &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Colquhoun_M&amp;amp;K_review_BMJ_2009.pdf"&gt;pdf of print version&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I very soon discovered that the book had already caused ructions in the USA, as a result of its advocacy of appeasement of religious groups.  In particular there was all out war with P.Z.Myers, whose very popular blog, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=mooney+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fpharyngula%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/em&gt;. documented the battle&lt;/a&gt; in detail). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an American book through and through, and in the USA the biggest threat to reason comes from the far-right religious fundamentalists who preach young-earth creationism. It is said that  46% of US citizens believe that the earth is less than 10,000 years old.  The same far-right religious groups also preach that carrying guns is good, that Iraq was responsible for 9/11, that climate change is a socialist conspiracy and that health care for everyone is a communist plot.  And they never hesitate to lie in the promotion of their ‘religious’ views. The US situation is totally different from that in Europe, where religion is all but dead, and young earth creationism is the preserve of a few cranky used-car dealers (and possibly Tony Blair?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review of the Week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#3366FF" size="+1"&gt;Trust me, I’m a scientist&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Colquhoun, &lt;em&gt;professor of pharmacology, University College London&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unscientific America &lt;/em&gt;sounds like a fascinating topic, not least because the book is a follow-up from Mooney’s &lt;em&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/em&gt;.  It is written entirely from a US perspective (the USA sequenced the genome and invented the internet, apparently unaided).  It’s reported that 46 percent of Americans believe that the earth is less than 10,000 years old.  That’s certainly cause for alarm and Mooney &amp;amp; Kirshenbaum are certainly alarmed.  They think that the public needs to be educated in science.  They identify the obvious problems, evolution, climate change and quackery and ask what can be done.  The problem is that they propose no good solutions, and some bad ones.   Their aims are worthy but sometimes the book reads like  an over-long and somewhat condescending whine about why science and scientists are not sufficiently appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simply don’t think that it’s true that the public are not interested in science, nor that they can’t understand it at a level that is sufficient to be useful.  It’s true that they have been let down badly by some sections of the media.  Think particularly of the &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/the-medias-mmr-hoax/"&gt;“great MMR hoax”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The disastrous fall in vaccination is more attributable to talk show presenters and air-headed celebrities than to lack of interest from the public.  People are systematically deceived by anti-vaxers, climate change denialists, vitamin pill salesmen and a horde of crackpot alternative therapists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one problem that Mooney &amp;amp; Kirshenbaum don’t talk about at all, yet it seems to me to be one of the biggest problems in science communication.  It isn’t lack of interest by the public, nor even lack of understanding, but lack of trust.  The tendency of real science to indulge in hyperbolic self-promotion is one reason for the lack of trust.  Sometimes this descends into outright dishonesty&lt;sup&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;.  That is a tendency that is promoted by government and funding agencies by their insistence on imposing silly performance measures.  The public is quite sensible enough to take with a pinch of salt the almost daily announcements of “cancer cures” that emanate from university press offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, one should be encouraged that ‘public engagement in science’ is the &lt;em&gt;mode du jour&lt;/em&gt;.  It isn’t quite that simple though.  Only too often, universities regard public engagement as a branch of their own PR machine&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. They even instruct you about what &lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/corporate-identity/tone"&gt;tone of voice&lt;/a&gt; to use when talking publicly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why scientists need to talk to people outside the lab is precisely to counteract this tide of nonsense from PR people, who are paid to deceive.  The problem for academics is usually time.  We already do three jobs, teaching, research and coping with HR bollocks.  How can we find time for a fourth job?  That’s not easy, especially for the best researchers (those that do research themselves, not just lead a team).  Mooney &amp;amp; Kirshenbaum suggest that the solution is to create a “cadre of communication and outreach experts”.  I don’t think this would work.  They would, by and large, be outsiders, writing uncritical paeans, dictated by big name scientists.  A new cadre of PR hangers-on does not sound like a great idea. A better, and very much cheaper, solution would be to provide a course in free blogging software and we’ll do it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two chapters that I looked forward to reading, on religion and on “The bloggers cannot save us”, proved deeply disappointing.  The authors are firmly in the camp of what Richard Dawkins called the “Neville Chamberlain school of evolutionists&amp;amp;rdquo.;  They maintain “if the goal is to create an America more friendly to science and reason, the combativeness of the New Atheists is strongly counterproductive”.  They are particularly critical of  &lt;a href="http://www.morris.umn.edu/academic/science/news/biol.html"&gt;P.Z. Myers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, the University of Minnesota  developmental biologist who is splendidly clear in his views. Of the communion wafer, he&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/its_a_goddamned_cracker.php"&gt; famously said&lt;/a&gt; “It’s a frackin’ cracker”. But he, and Dawkins, are right.  When it comes to young earth creationists we have a war on our hands, and nowhere more than in the USA.  What’s more it’s a winnable war.  Mooney &amp;amp; Kirshenbaum are all for appeasement, but appeasement won’t work.  It might please the more moderate wings of the church, but they already believe in evolution and are regarded by fundamentalists as being just as big an enemy as Myers and Dawkins.  And, one must ask, who has done best at getting a wide public readership?  P.Z Myers’ blog, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, has up to two million page views a month. Dawkins’ book  &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt; has sold three million copies.  In comparison the bland and often rather condescending corporate science web sites get tiny numbers of hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe in general, and the UK in particular, young earth creationists are not the major problem that they are in the USA, despite being supported  by &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/revealed-blairs-link-to-schools-that-take-the-creation-literally-732032.html"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Perhaps the nearest analogy in Europe is the threat to reason from various sorts of crackpot medicine.    The appeasers are widespread.  The Royal Colleges and the Department of Health are at the forefront of the Neville Chamberlain approach.  But appeasement hasn’t worked there either.  What has worked is the revelation that university courses are teaching that “&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;amethysts emit high yin energy&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Or, in a lecture on &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043"&gt;herbal approaches for patients with cancer&lt;/a&gt;, “Legally, you cannot claim to cure cancer.  This is not a problem because: ‘we treat people, not diseases’ “&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.  This is shocking stuff but it has not been unearthed by the corporate media, but by bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Mooney and Kirshenbaum have it all wrong.  They favour corporate communications, which are written by people outside science and which easily become mere PR machines for individuals and institutions.   Such blogs are rarely popular and at their worst they threaten the honesty of science.  More and more individual scientists have found that they can write their own blog.  It costs next to nothing and you can say what you think.  A few clicks and the world can read what you have to say.   Forget corporate communications.  Just do it yourself.  It’s fun.  And think of the money you’d save for doing science if the PR people were just fired.&lt;/p&gt;

In so many cases where we can check their distance by other, more fundamental means there seems to be a very nice trend we can use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The theory behind these guys is described by the Chandrasekhar limit, that is, the maximum density at which you can compact an object before the gravity overwhelms internal support forces. For white dwarfs (the dead cores of many stars not massive enough to have gone supernova as they died), they all have a similar radius so usually we just talk about the mass limit as being 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. Any more massive and it would have gone supernova in the first place (a Type II Supernova). If a white dwarf is &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; under that limit and a companion star dumps enough on it to go over the limit, then a SNe Ia happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a good fit to all the data, but most importantly because SNe Ia don't have much, if any, hydrogen in their spectra which means that they can't be main sequence stars that still have their envelope of hydrogen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as to every story, there's some exceptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in 2003 a supernova with the exciting name of SNLS-03D3bb occurred that was more than twice as bright as SNe Ia's should be. It wasn't reported until 2006 and that same year, another group (Howell et al.) inferred a mass of the pre-explosion core to be 2.1 times the mass of the Sun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weird.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok. Whatever. We'll tweak the model. Maybe these guys were just spinning faster than normal SNe Ia's which would give them some extra support before the collapse thanks to centrifugal forces. Maybe mass just got dumped on extra fast, as in two white dwarfs colliding. Maybe differential rotation was more important than expected and really does need to be included in the basic model. Maybe the metallicity is somehow really important. Perhaps the orbital period of the white dwarf and the donor star plays an important role. Who knows?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So group decided to try to put some constraints on the problem by adding some of these things to the models and trying it out a bunch of different ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While they haven't completely solved the problem, the did learn four things:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) If the white dwarf starts off at around ~one solar mass (like most probably are) the resultant supernovae are very uniform, right at the 1.4 limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) If the white dwarf is close to 1.2 solar masses to start, the final mass before going supernova can creep up to nearly 1.8 solar masses. Getting there but not good enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) To be consistently above the 1.6 solar masses, the donor star must be 2.2 - 3.3 solar masses and in a very short orbit of 0.5 - 4 days. Smaller and shorter if the donor is metal poor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Metallicity &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; important. Metal poor stars are less likely to make these super-Chandrasekhar supernovae. This one's perhaps the most imminently important one because this means that we're less likely to be having these oddballs contaminating our data at high redshifts (ie, really far away) which is where they're the most useful (remember, we have other ways to check distances nearby).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the problem's not solved, but such is the nature of science.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=The+Astrophysical+Journal&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1088%2F0004-637X%2F702%2F1%2F686&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=ON+THE+PROGENITORS+OF+SUPER-CHANDRASEKHAR+MASS+TYPE+Ia+SUPERNOVAE&amp;amp;rft.issn=0004-637X&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=702&amp;amp;rft.issue=1&amp;amp;rft.spage=686&amp;amp;rft.epage=691&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fstacks.iop.org%2F0004-637X%2F702%2Fi%3D1%2Fa%3D686%3Fkey%3Dcrossref.ec305b480e812b75bd4df35311dc65c9&amp;amp;rft.au=Chen%2C+W.&amp;amp;rft.au=Li%2C+X.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Astronomy%2CAstrophysics%2C+Cosmology%2C+Stellar+Astronomy%2C+Theoretical+Astrophysics"&gt;Chen, W., &amp;amp; Li, X.

There’s one layer of meaning that kids pick up on, and another layer that their parents watching beside them pick up on. The same signal has different meanings to different audiences. This new paper by Moosman and colleagues investigates how one signal might do double duty in the animal kingdom.Fireflies (which in this case are beetles rather than flies) light up to attract mates. But this is a conspicuous signals, and a conspicuous signal has its downsides: eavesdroppers can pick up on those signals, and even imitate them to lure in prey. Moosman and colleagues suspected this flashing light had yet a third effect: to be a warning sign.This particular firefly, Photinus pyralis,is thought to have chemical compounds that make it distasteful to come predators. Another firefly, Photuris, eats these smaller Photinus, and gain the same defensive chemical compounds from their prey.In that case, is it possible that predators might come to recognize their flash as a warning colouration, like the bright colours of poison dart frogs or some venomous snakes? This paper ran several tests of this hypothesis.First, the authors confirmed that the three species of insect-eating bats they were examining and fireflies overlapped in both space and time: fireflies were signaling at times and places where bats were flying.Second, they examined a lot of bat poo for traces of firefly remains, and found none. They found plenty of other insects, including others that were firefly sized, suggesting that bats avoided these particular insects.Third, they gave captive bats food pellets containing portions of fireflies. Bats rejected food significantly more often if it contained traces of fireflies.At this point, all this is pretty strong evidence that bats don’t like to eat these bugs. But is it because the bats recognize the flashing light signal? The authors tested this capturing several wild bats, and exposing them to artificial lures that flashed... or not. If the lights were a warning sign in the bat’s mind, you’d predict more attacks on the non-flashing lures than the flashing lures.The behavioural results don’t strongly support the idea. Of the three bats species, only one, Eptesicus fuscus (shown), preferentially attacked the non-flashing lures, and the only the larger, Photuris-sized lures. The authors do point out that E. fuscus is the species that overlaps with the fireflies the most, and thus may be the bat that has the most to gain by recognizing a flash as a danger sign.Another potentially problematic aspect of their experimental design was that they presented the bats not with a natural, intermittent rate set of flashes, but with a super-firefly, continuous set of flashes. This might be okay, because greater stimuli often generate greater responses, but it’s also possible that the unnatural stimulus is getting an unnatural response.Given that only one of the six combinations of three bat species and two sizes of lures showed evidence of flashes being warning signs, this sentence in the conclusion paints the situation with far too wide a brush:In conclusion, bioluminescence of adult fireflies should indeed be considered in the context of a warning signal against bats(.)Although it is often important to show that something can happen, that this happens in only one out of six cases tested raises real questions about whether this does happen with regularity. The authors risk overreaching just a little past the data they have.ReferenceMoosman, Jr, P., Cratsley, C., Lehto, S., &amp;amp; Thomas, H. (2009).

&lt;p&gt;When I left my PhD student office at the Museum of National Antiquities I rescued a couple of angel wing begonias. One has recently been joined in its pot by spontaneously appearing yellow fungus. Today four sizeable mushrooms popped up! And Dear Reader William identified them: they're &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucocoprinus_birnbaumii"&gt;Yellow Houseplant Mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Leucocoprinus birnbaumii&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;6:30-8:30 pm with discussion beginning at 7:00 followed by Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: The Irregardless Café, 901 W. Morgan Street, Raleigh 833-8898&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory problems have become increasingly common as our population ages.  The fear of developing dementia is one of the greatest fears of most Americans.  There can be memory changes as one grows older, but what determines if these changes are benign versus the beginning of a dementia process like Alzheimer's disease?  We will discuss types of memory, the neurobiological basis of memory, and ways to tell normal aging from the beginnings of significant memory loss.  We will also discuss symptoms and treatment for people who have been diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the speaker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandeep Vaishnavi, M.D., PhD serves as Medical Director at North Carolina Neuropsychiatry Clinic in Raleigh.  Dr. Vaishnavi specializes in memory and memory disorders.  He has been a fellow at Johns Hopkins Hospital and as part of the Duke-GlaxoSmithKline Psychopharmacology program.

&lt;p&gt;Autism is known as a spectrum disorder. Alex has been diagnosed with  PDD-NOS: pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified, also known  as atypical autism. I think the Yale Child Study site says it better, so here,  read &lt;a href="http://childstudycenter.yale.edu/autism/pddnos.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for a fuller definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex has some of the features of classic  autism but not all. For a long time I’ve thought of autism (or at least Alex’s  flavor of autism) as a communication disorder. Alex seems to have a fundamental  difficulty in understanding the basic notion of back-and-forth, whether it’s conversation or tossing a ball. Lately I’ve begun trying to get him to play ball. With a little coaxing, he will toss it back and forth a few times before losing interest. For years now I’ve wanted him to learn to play a simple card game, like Old Maid or Go Fish or Concentration (or whatever you call those memory-matching games), but the pleasures of that simple exchange (mostly) elude him. I’m hoping an occasional ball game will help him to grasp it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This week we’re featuring images of rainbows found on flickr.com to  illustrate autism’s spectrum — which, when you consider people with Asperger’s or those with sparse or no language, considered to be low-functioning —  is as varied as the rainbow itself, from  a simple striped arc to a splash of every color, like a beckoning ice cream cone.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;•     •     •&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boulder, Colo.-based &lt;a href="http://www.lenafoundation.org/"&gt;LENA Foundation &lt;/a&gt;has increased the  accuracy of the LENA Autism Screen (LAS) to 91 percent for children 24 to 48  months. Slated for release later this month, LAS will also include an automatic  screen for language delays; the LAS is priced at $200. (The average age of  diagnosis is 5.7 years.) The LENA System uses processing software and specially  designed children’s clothing fitted with a small digital language processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;•     •     •&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;a href="http://www.iteachautism.com/blog/2009/07/classroom-technology-for-students-with-autism/"&gt;technology &lt;/a&gt;is your child’s classroom using, if any? While we don’t want our kids completely addicted to any little screen, it never occurred to me that an inexpensive MP4 player could be helpful to Alex. Thanks to Iteachautism.com for an interesting suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;

In this post I'll trawl through a wealth of tid-bits concerning their response to criticism, openness, and the activities of Mandate, the PR company they're spending public money to hire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first big revelation from the company is that they plan to &lt;a href="http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=113"&gt;open up their board meetings to observers&lt;/a&gt;, as part of their somewhat debatable commitment to transparency. Interested members of the public can apply for the three guest slots that will be opened at each meeting. I've applied, and it'll be interesting to see how they respond to a critical freelance journalist (so far, no response). They also plan to release a "Performance Indicators Paper" online, but this has yet to appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, the CNHC's approach to transparency has been verging on the comical; blocking attempts to find out the number of registered members, changing their policy on releasing minutes and then &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/522"&gt;hilariously pretending&lt;/a&gt; that the minutes from last November had never been posted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Freedom of Information Act, the minutes state that policy now will be to refer requests to the Department of Health. Since the regulator is a private company, that leaves people reliant on information provided voluntarily, or documents filed at Companies House. Needless to say, this is hardly an ideal situation for a body responsible for public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Membership:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's especially worrying when the regulator itself has such an... &lt;i&gt;eccentric&lt;/i&gt; approach to its task. Take for instance this announcement from the new minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MW reported that she was discussing the possibility of a celebratory event when the number of registrants reached 2,000, in the autumn but that no decisions had yet been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding a celebration upon reaching 2,000 registrants may not seem that weird, until you remember that OfQuack's stated target in December was to have signed up &lt;i&gt;10,000&lt;/i&gt; members by the end of 2009. So the board are planning an event to celebrate falling eighty percent short of their target. It does beg the question, what exactly would you have to do to disappoint a CNHC board member? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the CNHC claim to be dedicated to transparency, they make no such commitment to reality. One easy way around this headache-inducing cognitive dissonance was to simply change history by &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/government-bails-out-ofquack-as-it.html"&gt;rewriting their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.zenosblog.com/2009/06/moving-the-goalposts-part-three/#more-34"&gt;December press release&lt;/a&gt;, changing 10,000 to &lt;a href="http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/newsManager.cfm?page_id=2&amp;amp;news_id=7"&gt;4,000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this abject failure to bring alternative medicine practitioners on board is simple - most of the relevant professions already have their own cosy regulatory arrangements, and are &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/government-bails-out-ofquack-as-it.html"&gt;loathe to sign up for membership&lt;/a&gt; of some new government-approved body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the CNHC's target of 10,000 was retrospectively changed to 4,000, and they now plan to celebrate getting 2,000 this Autumn. As it happens, this is a still a bit optimistic as by our count they have a grand total of, er, 661 people signed up (602 massage therapists, 52 nutritionists, 7 aromatherapists - &lt;a href="http://www.zenosblog.com/"&gt;Hat Tip to Alan Hennessy&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They might indeed reach 2,000 members by autumn, but it probably won't be &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; autumn. Still, you can say what you like about the CNHC, but at least they don't allow their commitment to positive thinking to be undermined by anything as trivial as 'facts'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Report to the Dept. of Health:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if you really want to enjoy some comedy fiction you can read their May 2009 report to the DoH (thanks to FOIA requests by Tony Brooks and &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.com"&gt;Andy Lewis&lt;/a&gt;), in which their &lt;a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/10409/response/34038/attach/4/FOI%20DE424504%20(3)%20CNHC%20report%20to%20DH%20May%2009.pdf"&gt;totals are outlined next to their projected estimates&lt;/a&gt;; estimates which seem to have been simply plucked from thin air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They admit that as of the end of April only 232 members had registered, but then claim that their target for January through April was to register only 61 members per month. It seems frankly incredible that anyone predicting 4,864 members by the end of the year (interestingly this report disagrees with the press release mentioned earlier) would predict getting only 243 of them in the first &lt;i&gt;third&lt;/i&gt; of the year! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This monthly prediction then suddenly and inexplicably jumps to 364 in May, 410 in June, 678 in July, 678 in Augist and 702 in September, by the end of which they project a cumulative total 3075 members. As we know, they currently have 661. Their business plan predicts cumulative income of £115,570 from registrations by the end of September, yet they will be lucky if they reach £30,000, a short-fall of over 60%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are even harder to explain when you remember that in December they originally predicted 10,000 members would sign in 2009. This was only changed &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/government-bails-out-ofquack-as-it.html"&gt;on their website in June&lt;/a&gt;, very shortly after this report with its odd numbers was released to the DoH. I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public Relations Spending:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 9 of the board minutes is largely devoted to the activities of &lt;a href="http://www.yourmandate.com/"&gt;Mandate&lt;/a&gt;, the public relations company they &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/580"&gt;hired back in May&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href="http://www.yourmandate.com/content/health-evidence-everything-and-evidence-health-mandate-overwhelming"&gt;pages on health lobbying&lt;/a&gt; make the bold claim that &lt;i&gt;"evidence is everything"&lt;/i&gt;, an ideology they presumably don't require their clients to adhere to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.1.3	MD reported on a meeting she and MW had had with Mandate to formulate a strategy to help publicise CNHC activities with local newspapers and radio. Some suggestions were made for targeting specific radio programmes such as You and Yours and Women’s Hour.  It was noted that the Media Tool Kit for PAs currently being prepared would be available shortly and would be sent to Board members for information.  It was also noted that Board members may be required to help out with exhibition and conference attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question is what they're planning to promote. If they're trying to let the public know that there's a new service you can complain to in the event that you get stiffed by a quack, then fair enough. The problem is that in previous board meetings &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/483"&gt;members have advocated promoting alternative medicine itself&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;JG suggested the possible use of patients with ‘good news’ regarding complementary therapies on www.patientvoices.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would obviously be an enormous conflict of interest for a regulator. It would be helpful if the CNHC could clarify what they plan to promote, and make it clear that they will not in any way promote the alternative medicine industry. It will be interesting to see what this PR campaign looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wider Engagement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying with PR, but moving away from Mandate's activities, there are a couple of further points of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;10.1.6	It was agreed that CNHC should not have a presence on the WhatDoTheyKnow.com website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know what "WhatDoTheyKnow" is, it's a website that publishes FOIA requests and their responses. &lt;a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/search/CNHC/bodies"&gt;Several requests relating to the CNHC are on the site&lt;/a&gt;, and frankly given their content it's not surprising that the CNHC are not planning to engage with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's nice to see that the company are still dwelling on their &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/601"&gt;difficult relationship&lt;/a&gt; with the blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;10.1.7	It was agreed that CNHC should not respond explicitly to inaccurate information in blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that the CNHC have alluded to false or inaccurate information circulated by their detractors. As &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/601"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, they make no reference to specific claims, nor any attempt at rebuttal. I can't speak for other bloggers, but armed with the raw numbers and their own words, I'm pretty comfortably with my position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their own is looking increasingly untenable. With the next government likely to have a mandate to crack down on public spending excess, a company sucking in DoH money to fund a business plan that looks indistinguishable from fantasy has to be a prime target. In signing up just 661 members against an original target of 10,000, the CNHC is dying. The kindest option would to put the lame duck out of its misery. &lt;/p&gt;

Here is the short list of “living fossils” which are living, but aren’t fossils:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crocodilians,  Sequoia, Coelacanth, Horsetails, Nautilus, Ginko, Horseshoe Crab, Lycophyta, Vampire Squid, Whisk Ferns, Tuatara, Cycads, Ratites ….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you get the idea. Anyway, the term “living fossil” is a falsehood. The reason for this isn’t due to the definitions used in scientific literature, in fact, that is usually used to describe “species with little or no &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;morphological&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; change over a significant portion of geological time with relatively little radiation of the clade after a significant genetic bottleneck.” Additional colloquial definitions include “a living organism with ancient traits” and “a living species which has remains relatively similar to the fossil ancestors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem with the idea of a “living fossil” is the idea that these organisms are truly unchanged. While they may appear similar, this morphology may, in fact, be the result of stabilizing selection for a specific morphology. A perfect example is the “living fossil” story I am, and you probably are, most familiar with: the coelacanth. There are, in fact, two living species of coelacanth and these two species, while very similar morphologically, are actually quite distinct (color is the main thing that jumps at me). This is an example of an unpreserved trait. There are many of these and without a genetic analysis, it is impossible to make the claim that the modern populations are truly “identical” to the fossil organisms. It would be difficult to distinguish the two living species from each other given only fossil morphological evidence, but genetic analysis indicates they diverged &amp;gt;20 mya compared to the human/chimpanzee lines diverging &amp;lt;10 mya. In other words, these two species are &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; genetically distinct from one another and there is no reason to suspect that the ancestral species were no less different from modern coelacanths than the two living species are at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don’t remember one of the key aspects of evolution I talked about &lt;a href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/09/09/falsehoods-genes-evolve-animals-evolve/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…evolution is not something which is measured within an individual organism, or even within a population at a given time; it is measured between populations separated through time &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; space or both&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “time” component is very important. A species will continue to change (on the genetic level) with or without a selective pressure. A population does not maintain identical allelic frequencies in the absence of selection. This is termed genetic drift, and this is even more pronounced after a genetic bottleneck of some kind. In other words, the exact thing that results in a “living fossil” (a species which does not radiate after a genetic bottleneck) is in the exact situation which results in a high level of genetic drift!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancestral populations will &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (I know, this is a strong statement) be identical to modern populations. These “living fossils,” like all other organisms, are not static in terms of the genetics of their populations. The allelic frequencies (at the very least, mutations within unselected regions of the genome) will continue to change. We must keep in mind, however, that as similar morphologically as the living &lt;em&gt;Latimeria&lt;/em&gt; species are to the fossil forms, they would be very genetically distinct from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the suggestions I received was to discuss debates in biology, and this is one of them (sort of) as well as two falsehoods. In other words, the debate is over which falsehood is more useful! Dawkins is a proponent of the gene-centric model of evolution while Mayr was a proponent of the organism-model of evolution. I, personally, think both of these models have merit in specific contexts, but not when used as falsehoods. When looking to explain a specific organism’s evolutionary history, we should use the organismic level model which allows for easier explanation of “spandrel” attributes arising from complex genetic interactions which result from other selective pressures. One example of this is the “floppy ears” and color patterns present in domestic dogs as a result of selection for “tameness.” The human capacity for religion may also be a spandrel resulting from our capacity for Complex character selection often results in complex effects on an organism impacting a wide variety of genes. When looking at specific allelic distribution in a population, however, the genetic model allows for statistical analysis of specific alleles within a population to evaluate if selection is occurring within a population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, so, they’re both totally useful, but they’re often understood as falsehoods. Animals don’t evolve, nor do genes. Populations evolve. A group of organisms is subjected to selective pressure resulting in the genetically influenced differential survival based upon genotype. The offspring of that population, as a result, has a different frequency of certain characteristics. So, ultimately, what is the UNIT of selection? It is not a single organism, but a subgroup of organisms within a population due to some genotypic and/or phenotypic similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Jay Gould made the point that the genes themselves are not “visible” to selective pressures, merely their phenotypic manifestations. Mayr criticizes the gene-centered model claiming that whole organisms with all the interactions of genes and their resulting phenotypes are the selected units. These claims, however, ignore how much the genetic sequences organisms actually impact the phenotype including behavior and morphology. While the environment certainly plays an additional role, there is some “buffering” from this in the genome, and the degree of buffering is subject to selection as well! In a sense, the inclusive genome (including epigenetic modifications) is what is “ultimately” selected for or against, but it is selected at the whole-organism level and only visible when comparing two populations! Further compounding this is the fact that not all organisms obey the “whole organism” model such as highly communal species of insects and mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the “whole organism” and “genocentric” models, however, miss the point that evolution is not something which is measured within an individual organism, or even within a population at a given time; it is measured between populations separated through time &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; space or both (I know, time and space being completely distinct from one another is a physics falsehood, but I’m not covering that can of worms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution occurs through a lack of gene flow between populations. How these populations are separated does not matter. In order to “see” evolution, you must observe populations which are somehow distinct from one another. A sample of genes or phenotypes from one population must be compared to a sample from a separate (somehow) population. While the genes are a vital component of the phenotype, not all genes play a role in the phenotype of the organism in question. (the placental formation genes present in males comes to mind) This does not mean this gene will not be selected for in the future (in the female offspring of that male). In this sense, whole-organism selection fails to predict the maintenance of these genes within males while genocentric selection succeeds. Genocentric selection fails to account for the survival of byproduct traits which (only upon additional mutations) later serve as a means of selection. Noam Chomsky argued this may account for the origin of language in humans. Other byproduct traits include feathers, sweat glands, exoskeletons in early aquatic arthropods, and so forth. Another name for “spandrels” in this sense is “preadaptations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These debates were, and continue to be legitimate debates within science in the sense of “at what level are traits selected.” Both of these, however, are often misunderstood to be saying that “animals or genes evolve.” This is not at all what is being stated in either of these. Evolution can be the RESULT of selection, but the selected characters do not evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I am assuming Gould, Lewontin, Mayr, and Dawkins were not saying “animals” or “genes” evolve, but that these were the targets being acted upon by selective forces as this is what I gathered from their books. The phrases “animals evolve” or “genes evolve” are, in the sense of single organisms, falsehoods. Gene frequencies and phenotypes &lt;strong&gt;within&lt;/strong&gt; populations change, and the unit of selection (the whole organism, the gene, or the entire population) is irrelevant to what is actually “evolving.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also of note: there are a number of other views on this other than that of Gould/Lewontin, Mayr, and Dawkins. Most prominent of these other views is the D.S. Wilson/E.O. Wilson multilevel selection view which can be found &lt;a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/522809"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

Now their relatives, great tits, have acquired a&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/sep/09/great-tits-hunting-bats"&gt; taste for blood&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/biology_evolution/article6826448.ece"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as well) hunting and killing bats in Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8245165.stm"&gt;the BBC reports&lt;/a&gt; (the link contains a video as well as a grisly photo of a half-eaten bat):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During two field seasons in the Bukk Mountains of northeastern Hungary, the researchers documented 16 cases of great tits &lt;em&gt;(Parus major)&lt;/em&gt; hunting, killing and eating a hibernating bat in the one cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipistrelle bats &lt;em&gt;(Pipistrellus pipistrellus)&lt;/em&gt; are about one-quarter of a great tit’s size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The birds would fly close to the cave walls, landing frequently and often disappearing into crevices. They would either eat the bats there and then or carry them away for feeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="203" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="5"&gt;&lt;img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/shared/img/o.gif" alt="" width="5" height="1" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When their hibernation is disturbed, the bats squeak in the audible range for humans and great tits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculated that the birds may have learned to listen for these squeaks – and when they recorded some and played them back, the birds responded with interest about 80% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m on the road today, and can’t get the original paper in &lt;em&gt;Biology Letters&lt;/em&gt; describing the behavior, but I suspect that, like cream-stealing in blue tits, it comes from observational learning. During the lean winter months, hungry birds presumably watch — and follow — other birds committing chiropticide. But it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be genetically based and evolved. The decisive experiment would be difficult, involving hand-rearing tits in the lab and releasing them in bat caves where they could not observe other tits hunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, there’s something unseemly about a songbird eating a mammal. But, as Darwin pointed out with reference to ichneumon wasps, nature doesn’t care a fig about our squeamishness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UU World&lt;/em&gt; is the free denominational magazine for the Unitarian Unversalist Association.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their Fall, 2009 issue, they printed a paid ad from the Freedom From Religion Foundation.  I don’t have a scan of it at the moment, but to my understanding, it featured &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/news/2009/madison_buscampaign.php"&gt;their six bus ads&lt;/a&gt; with a request for donations so FFRF could place the posters across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad placement makes sense — a lot of atheists belong to UU congregations and would be likely donors to FFRF’s ad campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But several UU readers &lt;a href="http://berrysmom.blogspot.com/2009/09/excuse-me-i-thought-we-were-religion.html"&gt;couldn’t believe&lt;/a&gt; such an ad was allowed in their magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am stunned, appalled and very disappointed with the managerial decision at the UU World to publish a FULL PAGE advertisement by the Freedom From Religion Foundation in the Unitarian Universalist denominational magazine. This organization is not merely atheist or agnostic — they are ANTI-religion. We have absolutely no business carrying their advertising in our denominational magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am deeply offended by the ad copy, which suggests that anyone who believes in God thinks that fairy tales are true, and that such a belief is tantamount to slavery. And furthermore, I am embarrassed that people in my congregation will see this. I have worked so hard to help my congregation claim and own their religious feelings and feel GOOD about being religious people. How can I explain this?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, FFRF’s purpose is the promote church/state separation and to educate the public on non-theism.  FFRF also helps atheists realize there are others out there like them, hence the ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but the bus ads that FFRF places are not going after the type of community and spirituality that UU congregations tend to promote.  FFRF tends to go after the Religious Right and the religious extremists who want to force their views onto everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you would hope the &lt;em&gt;UU World&lt;/em&gt; business manager would defend placing such an ad.  Not everyone will be a fan of FFRF, but there was nothing inherently wrong in publicizing a non-theistic stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those &lt;a href="http://www.uuworld.org/advertising/fall2009freedomfromreligionfoundationad.shtml"&gt;hopes were dashed&lt;/a&gt; by business manager &lt;strong&gt;Scott Ullrich&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I have come to the conclusion that it was a mistake to run this particular ad. While the stated mission of the Freedom From Religion Foundation is entirely consistent with UU values, this ad seems hostile to all religion. To be more specific, I believe that I failed to help the advertiser match their message to our readers. An ad spotlighting FFRF’s purpose of “working for the separation of state and church” would have been more appropriate than one that for many appears to be condemning religion in general.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a depressing response.  The ads are not hostile to religion.  They simply showcase famous people who happened to be atheists.  They reach out to others who may think the same way, which do happen to be many UU folks.  What look to be a few vocal opponents forced the magazine to apologize for a perfectly appropriate ad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll post the ad once I get a copy of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least, that is, according to this email I just got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwinism is under official protection in 95% of the countries of the world. People are forced to believe this false theory imposed on them as an official ideology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE GLOBAL DARWINIST DICTATORSHIP MUST APOLOGIZE TO THE ENTIRE WORLD,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;for presenting innumerable frauds to the scientific world for 150 years,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
for imposing Darwinism as the official ideology,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
for trying to keep Darwinism alive by means of official protection,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
for putting pressure on and removing pro-Creation scientists from their posts,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
for putting anti-democratic pressure on Creationists all over the world through the press and other means...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Statement to Darwinists&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE DARWINIST DICTATORSHIP SHOULD APOLOGIZE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For banning and burning anti-Darwinist books,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For refusing to permit any contrary opinions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For removing scientists holding opposing ideas from their posts,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
For forcing students to give answers in favor of the theory in university exams,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
For deceiving the world with countless hoax fossils,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
For concealing Cambrian period fossils for 70 years and for still hiding every new fossil discovery since they constitute evidence for Creation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
For concealing the impossibility of even a single protein coming into being by chance,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
For portraying only hoax skulls as evidence of the so-called evolution of man,
For so long imposing the lie that mutations cause evolution,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
And for deceiving all of humanity, admitting a biased lie and nonsense, and violating the human rights of all mankind by disseminating that nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwinist publications constantly talk about freedom of expression and democracy. But they support the banning by the Council of Europe of the Atlas of Creation (http://www.atlasofcreation.com/), which is full of scientific evidence and has caused such a wide response across the world, and do all in their power to bring it about. Yet they oppose the banning by court decision of Richard Dawkins' insult-filled book and articles. This is nothing more than dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea that we had so much power. I sure wish I could use it to be able to afford a housekeeping staff for my mansion, and to buy my mansion, and to give me enough money to get a mansion (I'm on sabbatical, which means half-pay, you know) instead of using my immense powers to force students to answer biology exams. Seems kind of a waste of a dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's just noise from a member of the Adnan Oktar cult. &lt;a href="http://newhumanist.org.uk/2131"&gt;The New Humanist has a good bio on Oktar, or Harun Yahya as he calls himself&lt;/a&gt;. He's a crazy, cunning con artist who has enriched himself by peddling nonsense to the gullible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; undocked on Tuesday, and NASA has obliged with &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y42ZeRMXSaY"&gt;this seriously cool video&lt;/a&gt; (watch especially about 3:30 minutes in when the orbiter is seen from the ISS camera. Wow):&lt;/p&gt;

The SGU had a wonderful time in Atlanta at DragonCon (hence the absence of blog posts) but we are now back to the grind and gearing up for the first &lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org/"&gt;NECSS conference&lt;/a&gt; this Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know, Derek and Swoopy from Skepticality run a podcasting and skeptical tracks at DragonCon - a convention that is mostly filled with science fiction and fantasy. There is also a science track - the three together make for a full schedule of science, podcasting, and skepticism (OK, that was a bit circular).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave talks this weekend about the neurology of skepticism, the swine flu, vaccines and autism, and we recorded a live SGU podcast (which will go up this Saturday). We love the energy of live recordings, and I think it was a particularly good show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also live shows by the Skeptic Zone, Skeptoid, Astronomy Cast, and Geologic, the Skepchicks held a panel, and Adam Savage made an appearance. Many of our fellow skeptics were there including Phil Plait, Richard Saunders, Brian Dunning, Joe Nickel, Seth Shostak , Eugenie Scott, and many others. It was a full weekend of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, it’s always fun to give a talk about neuroscience with elves and Darth Vader sitting in the audience. The Alien asked a very cogent question during our live show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skeptic track at DragonCon had double the space this year as last. This is definitely growing into a major skeptical event, and the SGU is already making plans for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that in the US we now have the potential for three regional skeptical events each years - TAM in Las Vegas, DragonCon in Atlanta, and NECSS in New York. These are nicely geographically spaced out, although at present they are temporally bunched up. We really do need to space them out more throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For next year we will definitely move NECSS farther from DragonCon, but it’s in New York so we can only go so late in the Fall, or we can move it to the Spring. A conference in January would be perfect, but I would not want to count on the weather in New York in January.&lt;/p&gt;

In this post I'll trawl through a wealth of titbits concerning their response to criticism, openness, and the activities of Mandate, the PR company they're spending public money to hire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first big revelation from the company is that they plan to &lt;a href="http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=113"&gt;open up their board meetings to observers&lt;/a&gt;, as part of their somewhat debatable commitment to transparency. Interested members of the public can apply for the three guest slots that will be opened at each meeting. I've applied, and it'll be interesting to see how they respond to a critical freelance journalist (so far, no response). They also plan to release a "Performance Indicators Paper" online, but this has yet to appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, the CNHC's approach to transparency has been verging on the comical; blocking attempts to find out the number of registered members, changing their policy on releasing minutes and then &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/522"&gt;hilariously pretending&lt;/a&gt; that the minutes from last November had never been posted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Freedom of Information Act, the minutes state that policy now will be to refer requests to the Department of Health. Since the regulator is a private company, that leaves people reliant on information provided voluntarily, or documents filed at Companies House. Needless to say, this is hardly an ideal situation for a body responsible for public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Membership:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's especially worrying when the regulator itself has such an... &lt;i&gt;eccentric&lt;/i&gt; approach to its task. Take for instance this announcement from the new minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MW reported that she was discussing the possibility of a celebratory event when the number of registrants reached 2,000, in the autumn but that no decisions had yet been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding a celebration upon reaching 2,000 registrants may not seem that weird, until you remember that OfQuack's stated target in December was to have signed up &lt;i&gt;10,000&lt;/i&gt; members by the end of 2009. So the board are planning an event to celebrate falling eighty percent short of their target. It does beg the question, what exactly would you have to do to disappoint a CNHC board member? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the CNHC claim to be dedicated to transparency, they make no such commitment to reality. One easy way around this headache-inducing cognitive dissonance was to simply change history by &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/government-bails-out-ofquack-as-it.html"&gt;rewriting their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.zenosblog.com/2009/06/moving-the-goalposts-part-three/#more-34"&gt;December press release&lt;/a&gt;, changing 10,000 to &lt;a href="http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/newsManager.cfm?page_id=2&amp;amp;news_id=7"&gt;4,000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this abject failure to bring alternative medicine practitioners on board is simple - most of the relevant professions already have their own cosy regulatory arrangements, and are &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/government-bails-out-ofquack-as-it.html"&gt;loath to sign up for membership&lt;/a&gt; of some new government-approved body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the CNHC's target of 10,000 was retrospectively changed to 4,000, and they now plan to celebrate getting 2,000 this Autumn. As it happens, this is a still a bit optimistic as by our count they have a grand total of, er, 661 people signed up (602 massage therapists, 52 nutritionists, 7 aromatherapists - &lt;a href="http://www.zenosblog.com/"&gt;Hat Tip to Alan Henness&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They might indeed reach 2,000 members by autumn, but it probably won't be &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; autumn. Still, you can say what you like about the CNHC, but at least they don't allow their commitment to positive thinking to be undermined by anything as trivial as 'facts'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Report to the Dept. of Health:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if you really want to enjoy some comedy fiction you can read their May 2009 report to the DoH (thanks to FOIA requests by Tony Brooks and &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net"&gt;Andy Lewis&lt;/a&gt;), in which their &lt;a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/10409/response/34038/attach/4/FOI%20DE424504%20(3)%20CNHC%20report%20to%20DH%20May%2009.pdf"&gt;totals are outlined next to their projected estimates&lt;/a&gt;; estimates which seem to have been simply plucked from thin air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They admit that as of the end of April only 232 members had registered, but then claim that their target for January through April was to register only 61 members per month. It seems frankly incredible that anyone predicting 4,864 members by the end of the year (interestingly this report disagrees with the press release mentioned earlier) would predict getting only 243 of them in the first &lt;i&gt;third&lt;/i&gt; of the year! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This monthly prediction then suddenly and inexplicably jumps to 364 in May, 410 in June, 678 in July, 678 in Augist and 702 in September, by the end of which they project a cumulative total 3075 members. As we know, they currently have 661. Their business plan predicts cumulative income of £115,570 from registrations by the end of September, yet they will be lucky if they reach £30,000, a short-fall of over 60%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are even harder to explain when you remember that in December they originally predicted 10,000 members would sign in 2009. This was only changed &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/government-bails-out-ofquack-as-it.html"&gt;on their website in June&lt;/a&gt;, very shortly after this report with its odd numbers was released to the DoH. I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public Relations Spending:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 9 of the board minutes is largely devoted to the activities of &lt;a href="http://www.yourmandate.com/"&gt;Mandate&lt;/a&gt;, the public relations company they &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/580"&gt;hired back in May&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href="http://www.yourmandate.com/content/health-evidence-everything-and-evidence-health-mandate-overwhelming"&gt;pages on health lobbying&lt;/a&gt; make the bold claim that &lt;i&gt;"evidence is everything"&lt;/i&gt;, an ideology they presumably don't require their clients to adhere to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.1.3	MD reported on a meeting she and MW had had with Mandate to formulate a strategy to help publicise CNHC activities with local newspapers and radio. Some suggestions were made for targeting specific radio programmes such as You and Yours and Women’s Hour.  It was noted that the Media Tool Kit for PAs currently being prepared would be available shortly and would be sent to Board members for information.  It was also noted that Board members may be required to help out with exhibition and conference attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question is what they're planning to promote. If they're trying to let the public know that there's a new service you can complain to in the event that you get stiffed by a quack, then fair enough. The problem is that in previous board meetings &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/483"&gt;members have advocated promoting alternative medicine itself&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;JG suggested the possible use of patients with ‘good news’ regarding complementary therapies on www.patientvoices.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would obviously be an enormous conflict of interest for a regulator. It would be helpful if the CNHC could clarify what they plan to promote, and make it clear that they will not in any way promote the alternative medicine industry. It will be interesting to see what this PR campaign looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wider Engagement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying with PR, but moving away from Mandate's activities, there are a couple of further points of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;10.1.6	It was agreed that CNHC should not have a presence on the WhatDoTheyKnow.com website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know what "WhatDoTheyKnow" is, it's a website that publishes FOIA requests and their responses. &lt;a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/search/CNHC/bodies"&gt;Several requests relating to the CNHC are on the site&lt;/a&gt;, and frankly given their content it's not surprising that the CNHC are not planning to engage with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's nice to see that the company are still dwelling on their &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/601"&gt;difficult relationship&lt;/a&gt; with the blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;10.1.7	It was agreed that CNHC should not respond explicitly to inaccurate information in blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that the CNHC have alluded to false or inaccurate information circulated by their detractors. As &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/601"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, they make no reference to specific claims, nor any attempt at rebuttal. I can't speak for other bloggers, but armed with the raw numbers and their own words, I'm pretty comfortably with my position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their own is looking increasingly untenable. With the next government likely to have a mandate to crack down on public spending excess, a company sucking in DoH money to fund a business plan that looks indistinguishable from fantasy has to be a prime target. In signing up just 661 members against an original target of 10,000, the CNHC is dying. The kindest option would to put the lame duck out of its misery. &lt;/p&gt;

Their business plan predicts cumulative income of £115,570 from registrations by the end of September, yet they will be lucky if they reach £30,000, a short-fall of over 60%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are even harder to explain when you remember that in December they originally predicted 10,000 members would sign in 2009. This was only changed &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/government-bails-out-ofquack-as-it.html"&gt;on their website in June&lt;/a&gt;, very shortly after this report with its odd numbers was released to the DoH. I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public Relations Spending:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 9 of the board minutes is largely devoted to the activities of &lt;a href="http://www.yourmandate.com/"&gt;Mandate&lt;/a&gt;, the public relations company they &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/580"&gt;hired back in May&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href="http://www.yourmandate.com/content/health-evidence-everything-and-evidence-health-mandate-overwhelming"&gt;pages on health lobbying&lt;/a&gt; make the bold claim that &lt;i&gt;"evidence is everything"&lt;/i&gt;, an ideology they presumably don't require their clients to adhere to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.1.3	MD reported on a meeting she and MW had had with Mandate to formulate a strategy to help publicise CNHC activities with local newspapers and radio. Some suggestions were made for targeting specific radio programmes such as You and Yours and Women’s Hour.  It was noted that the Media Tool Kit for PAs currently being prepared would be available shortly and would be sent to Board members for information.  It was also noted that Board members may be required to help out with exhibition and conference attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question is what they're planning to promote. If they're trying to let the public know that there's a new service you can complain to in the event that you get stiffed by a quack, then fair enough. The problem is that in previous board meetings &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/483"&gt;members have advocated promoting alternative medicine itself&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;JG suggested the possible use of patients with ‘good news’ regarding complementary therapies on www.patientvoices.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would obviously be an enormous conflict of interest for a regulator. It would be helpful if the CNHC could clarify what they plan to promote, and make it clear that they will not in any way promote the alternative medicine industry. It will be interesting to see what this PR campaign looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wider Engagement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying with PR, but moving away from Mandate's activities, there are a couple of further points of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;10.1.6	It was agreed that CNHC should not have a presence on the WhatDoTheyKnow.com website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know what "WhatDoTheyKnow" is, it's a website that publishes FOIA requests and their responses. &lt;a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/search/CNHC/bodies"&gt;Several requests relating to the CNHC are on the site&lt;/a&gt;, and frankly given their content it's not surprising that the CNHC are not planning to engage with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's nice to see that the company are still dwelling on their &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/601"&gt;difficult relationship&lt;/a&gt; with the blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;10.1.7	It was agreed that CNHC should not respond explicitly to inaccurate information in blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that the CNHC have alluded to false or inaccurate information circulated by their detractors. As &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/601"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, they make no reference to specific claims, nor any attempt at rebuttal. I can't speak for other bloggers, but armed with the raw numbers and their own words, I'm pretty comfortably with my position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their own is looking increasingly untenable. With the next government likely to have a mandate to crack down on public spending excess, a company sucking in DoH money to fund a business plan that looks indistinguishable from fantasy has to be a prime target. In signing up just 661 members against an original target of 10,000, the CNHC is dying. The kindest option would to put the lame duck out of its misery. &lt;/p&gt;

The challenge is that health organizations and governments are trying to optimize their response to this flu strain in the midst of the pandemic unfolding. It’s like preparing for a hurricane as it’s happening, without knowing where it will make landfall, how strong it will be, how much water it will drop, and if the levies will hold. The best option is to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two key features of flu strains that we track – infectiousness (how easily it spreads) and virulence (how severe an infection it causes, and specifically what is the percentage of hospitalizations and deaths). What we can say at this time about the current H1N1 strain is that it is about as infectious and virulent as the regular flu-season flu. This may make it seem like not such a big deal, but of course the regular flu season kills 36,000 people in the US alone, and about 400,000 world wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the pandemic unfolds we are learning some more details. Most flu deaths in regular flu seasons are among the elderly or in susceptible populations due to a chronic illness. The current H1N1 flu, however, disproportionately kills pregnant women and young children. &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17753-dont-be-fooled-swine-flu-still-poses-a-deadly-threat.html"&gt;Another pattern is also emerging&lt;/a&gt; – while in most people this strain causes a mild flu, in about 1% it results in a very severe flu with a 50% mortality rate. The severe cases develop a form of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) that destroys the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot yet predict who will get the deadly form of the virus. It may be linked to genetic differences in the immune system, it may be anatomical, or it may just be bad luck – if the virus sets up an infection in the alveoli. If we could predict, that would enable us to give those who are susceptible and their families high priority in getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of this severe response in 1% of the population is a cause for concern, not only because half of these people die, but because they are all severely sick and require hospitalization and even intensive care. If this pattern holds up, hospitals could be overwhelmed this flu season by young people needing ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this highlights the need for optimal use of the flu vaccine, and further highlights the danger of the absurd fearmongering that has been going on. The anti-vaccine and conspiracy crowds have been working overtime spreading misinformation about the H1N1 vaccine. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1296"&gt;Harriet Hall does an excellent job &lt;/a&gt;of taking down many of the false claims point by point. I have already written about the misinformation about &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=784"&gt;GBS and the flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. And Joseph Albietz has written an excellent &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1229"&gt;Influenza primer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is easier to cause fear than to reassure with facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is this: the H1N1 flu vaccine is likely to be reasonably safe and effective. While it is being fast tracked, it is using tried and true flu vaccine technology, and it is being actively studied in thousands of people. Further, the role out of the vaccine will be tracked to pick up any adverse effects as quickly as possible. Concerns about GBS are overblown, and we are likely to see the usual excess cases due to the vaccine of 1 in a million vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risks of the vaccine are small. Meanwhile the risks of the flu are significant – even if it remains just as virulent as it currently is. And, of course, the strain may become more virulent as it evolves throughout the flu season. The benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks by orders of magnitude, but human psychology is not built to think rationally about such fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-vaccine misinformation will have a real body count this flu season. That is a number we should track as well, so at least, maybe, we will learn something.&lt;/p&gt;

These terms are just that – marketing. They are otherwise vacuous, even deceptive, and meant only to conceal the naked fact that most medical interventions that hide under the CAM/integrative umbrella lack plausibility or credible evidence that they actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicine that works is simply “medicine” – everything else needs marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week in the British Medicine Journal (BMJ) Hugh MacPherson, David Peters, and Catherine Zollman wrote a very telling editorial entitled &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep01_2/b3335"&gt;Closing the evidence gap in integrative medicine&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/sep01_2/b3335"&gt;Edzard Ernst has rightly characterized&lt;/a&gt; “a masterpiece in obfuscation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of the editorial can be boiled down to this – proponents of integrative medicine are disappointed that scientific research has not validated their failed modalities. Therefore they want to weaken the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=120"&gt;rules of evidence &lt;/a&gt;so that they can get the results they desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, they begin their marketing with the branding of “integrative medicine”, taken from &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/www.imconsortium.org"&gt;www.imconsortium.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines (conventional and complementary) to achieve optimal health and healing”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not integrative medicine, which is rather the attempt at mixing unproven, disproved, and often highly implausible methods into science-based medicine. But proponents can’t go around saying directly that they want to use treatments that probably don’t work, so they brand a nice sounding term with a collection of virtues that actually have nothing to do with what they are selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obfuscation because a definition such as this should indicate what distinguishes one category from another – what makes integrative medicine different from medicine. The practitioner-patient relationship has been central to medicine since Hippocrates. The “bio-psycho-social” (whole person) approach to medicine is also nothing new – that’s what I was taught in medical school before the term “integrative” was invented. “Informed by evidence?” – I hope so. In fact, that’s a bit weakly stated. And mainstream medicine already makes use of all “appropriate” therapies – the addition of the world “complementary” is just adding another vague term without any operational definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the difference between “integrative” medicine and medicine? None that I can detect by that statement, except the suggestion (well-hidden) of using unproven treatments. The brilliance of the marketing, of course, is that by defining your made-up brand of medicine with these virtues, you suggest that your competition lacks them – without ever having to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get to the meat of the editorial. They write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet when it comes to deciding whether an intervention, and which type of intervention, might be helpful for a particular patient, a worrying gap exists between the perceived potential for using integrative approaches in areas of poorly met clinical need and the availability of supporting evidence derived from good research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the editorial the unstated major premise is that the authors know that the “integrative” modalities they want to promote work. They simply need to figure out a way to support what they already know to be true with something that can be marketed as scientific evidence. Nowhere do they give a hint that they are concerned about using science to figure out IF a treatment works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also do not give the slightest consideration to the fact that the evidence gap may be the result of the fact that the treatments simply do not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/sep01_2/b3335"&gt;response to the editorial&lt;/a&gt;, David Colquhoun correctly points out their “special pleading” – “If your treatments cannot pass the test, the test must be wrong.” The test they are complaining about is the randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make the usual excuses for why rigorous scientific studies are not adequate to evaluate integrative methods – they are too complex, the studies are artificial and don’t apply to the real world, and they interfere with choice and the therapeutic relationship. This is flawed reasoning on multiple levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, many “integrative” methods are quite amendable to the double-blind randomized trial. Anything that can be taken as a pill – such as herbs or homeopathy – can be compared to an identical-looking placebo. Procedures are more challenging, but researchers have figured out ways to compare acupuncture to sham and even placebo acupuncture, using non-penetrating needles in an opaque sheath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on a deeper level they miss the point of scientific research entirely. They complain that the therapeutic relationship is part of the treatment (as if that is different than regular medicine) and therefore it cannot be separated from the treatment itself in clinical trials. But the entire point of scientific studies is to isolate variables as much as possible so that we can come to conclusions about whether or not each variable has a net positive or negative health effect in certain situations and conditions. This is what makes medicine scientific an allows it to move forward – knowing what works and is safe and what isn’t. The art of medicine is then putting it all together in a positive therapeutic interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James May, chairman of &lt;a href="http://www.healthwatch-uk.org/"&gt;HealthWatch&lt;/a&gt;, nailed it when he wrote in response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Effective medicine is best measured with RCTs. Caring is not.  ‘Integrative medicine’ therefore risks both damaging how we measure  effective medicines (RCTs), as well as reducing caring to measurables. A  better term for this might be ‘disintegrative medicine’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He is saying, as I just did, that the authors miss the point about the purpose of medical research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the place of the randomized controlled trial, the authors recommend so-called “pragmatic” studies, comparison research, and case studies. These all have one thing in common – they are not blinded. They therefore do not separate out the variable of the intervention in question from the therapeutic ritual and non-specific effects. These kinds of studies are useful for guiding the application of treatments that have already been shown to work. But they are useless in determining if a treatment works. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the last couple of decades there has been a persistent effort to promote unscientific medical modalities with increasingly sophisticated marketing – and to the horror of many, the marketing is working. Proponents have come up with an steady stream of euphemisms for medicine not supported by science – “alternative”, “complementary”, “integrative”, and “functional”. They have marketed them as “natural” and “holistic” and assured the public that if we just researched these methods they would be proven to work. They marketed their modalities to the public, to regulators, and to academia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, after decades of research, after the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=345"&gt;NCCAM&lt;/a&gt; spent 2.5 billion dollars of taxpayer money – the research overwhelmingly shows that these implausible methods don’t work. (It should not have been surprising that treatments that had a very low prior probability turned out not to work  – the improbable, it turns out, is improbable.) For years we were told that we just needed more research and better designed research. Acupuncture studies need better placebo-controlled acupuncture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now “integrative” proponents are switching gears (after the research they were asking for did not turn out as they hoped), increasingly arguing that the problem is not their improbable modalities but the research technology itself. They want to switch to the kind of studies that are not even designed to determine if a treatment works or not, and are almost guaranteed to produce the results they want – results they can use to confuse the public and politicians, and to lubricate their passage into the halls of academia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To this skeptic, this is an old and familiar strategy. When science fails to validate your belief system, blame science.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A little bit of my talk (along with others) was covered on PBS’s &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2009/08/gnomedex-90-tech-conference-looks-deeper-at-social-media233.html"&gt;Media Shift blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend and skeptic D. J. Grothe from the Center for Inquiry posted &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blog/phil_plait_preaches_skepticism_at_gnomedex_conference/"&gt;an article on his blog&lt;/a&gt; about my appearance at Gnomedex — apparently, my talk was covered on the CNN live stream! Wow. I wonder how many people saw that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact that’s a legit question. During a break at Gnomedex I went into the lobby to grab some coffee. I was chatting to a couple of attendees, and they complimented me on the presentation I gave. One of them said something that made me laugh a tad ruefully: he said that he wasn’t all that interested in skepticism, but found that he liked the talk and &lt;em&gt;became&lt;/em&gt; interested because of my enthusiasm.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I’m not saying this to brag (because I would never ever ever do that; I’m terribly modest about my overwhelming awesomeness) but because I think it’s a critical point. Sure, in my talk, I defined what skepticism is and what it isn’t. And I also hammered home the idea that skepticism is not a room filled with a bunch of angry, aging, white, balding and bearded men dismissing claims and deciding what’s right and wrong — skepticism is a &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; process that everyone can and must do, it’s a way of looking at the world that keeps things from fooling us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics and scientists have a major PR problem. People think we’re all humorless, cold and without passion. But that’s completely wrong! We run the spectrum: we’re happy, sad, angry, interesting, boring, awkward, calm, confident, silly, serious, smart, smarter — just like any group. &lt;strong&gt;We’re people&lt;/strong&gt;. I think that gets lost somewhere between us and the people we’re talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really not any smarter or harder working or anything like that compared to your average active skeptic. But one thing I do is that &lt;em&gt;I let my passion show.&lt;/em&gt; I love this stuff: I love science, I love understanding things, I love the process of figuring things out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the more general point I want to make here is that I spoke from my own passion. Anyone who’s read this blog for more than ten seconds knows how I feel about antivaxxers, for example. So when I was on stage, I made sure that came through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked about groups like JREF and CfI that do top-down skepticism; professional organizations that put on big conferences, create magazines, host bulletin boards, and so on. But I really stressed bottom-up grassroots work, things like &lt;a href="http://www.skepchick.org"&gt;Skepchick&lt;/a&gt; (well, they’re on the cusp of grassroots versus big lumbering professional group), &lt;a href="http://stopsylviabrown.com"&gt;Robert Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://skepticamp.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Skepticamp&lt;/a&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And looking over the list of groups (both big and small) I showed, it hit me why they’re successful: they’re passionate. This passion may come out as humor, or concern, or anger, but the point is these sites are fun to read and these groups are connecting to people because they let that passion show. I read (past tense) far too many sites and blogs that phoned it in, and those don’t last long in my feed reader. If you want my attention, you need to show me that you’re worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you do that by showing me that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a little free advice to people out there trying to make a point: Let it fly. But remember, passion is a necessary but not sufficient component of any argument. After all, Apollo deniers are passionate, as are antivaxxers. So you need a lot more than that to actually make your point — you’ll need the evidence to back it up, and you’ll need a rhetorical style that isn’t like nails on a blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But passion is a good place to start. It’s where inspiration comes from, and people will respond to it. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252494789754"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=15879">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f7651f7329d87621</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Churches"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">What If I Took My Students on a Field Trip to Get Debaptized?</title><published>2009-09-09T11:00:38Z</published><updated>2009-09-09T11:00:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/09/what-if-i-took-my-students-on-a-field-trip-to-get-debaptized/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I help coach my school’s Speech Team.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’m going to plan a pre-season party to get everyone pumped up about the tournaments ahead — We’re going to listen to a motivations speaker and get dinner together.  I won’t ask the administrators for money, but I am borrowing a school bus.  Another coach will pay for the gas, though.  No one *has* to go, but seriously… they should all go if they know what’s best for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh.  And on the way to dinner, I’m going to take everyone to a local atheist Meetup, where they can perform the Blasphemy Challenge on video, get “debaptized” with a blow dryer, and play Pin the Tail on the Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be ok, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine the reaction if any atheist did that.  No doubt every Christian Right group would be after your head.  Your bosses would (rightfully) get rid of you.  FOXNews would have a field day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why has there been &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-09-07-kentucky-football-trip-baptisms_N.htm"&gt;little to no repercussion for &lt;strong&gt;Scott Mooney&lt;/strong&gt;, the head football coach&lt;/a&gt; at Breckinridge County High School in &lt;strike&gt;Louisville&lt;/strike&gt; Harned, Kentucky, who took his players to get baptized?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The coach took about 20 players on a school bus late last month to his church, where nearly half of them… were baptized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… the school district’s superintendent was there and did not object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Superintendent Janet Meeks, who is a member of the church and witnessed the baptisms, said she thinks the trip was proper because attendance was not required, and another coach paid for the gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeks said parents weren’t given permission slips to sign but knew the event would include a church service, if not specifically a baptism. She said eight or nine players came forward and were baptized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“None of the players were rewarded for going and none were punished for not going,” Meeks said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, even the Religious Right isn’t defending this… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait.  Enter &lt;strong&gt;Mat Staver&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… Staver, founder and general counsel for Liberty Counsel, an Orlando-based group that provides free legal assistance in religious liberty cases, said there was nothing wrong with trip as long as it was voluntary and no public funds were used. He compared it to a coach inviting players to attend a play or to go see a baseball game.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the bus was owned by the coach, public funds were used. And again, I ask what Staver would be saying if this wasn’t a Christian coach but an atheist one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students are saying they knew the church visit would be part of the trip.  This coach knew exactly what he was doing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One mother is hopefully taking action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Michelle] Ammons, who lives in Big Spring, said that she is a Baptist but her husband, Danny, is Catholic, and that both feel like their son should wait until he is 18 to make important decisions on religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We felt he was brainwashed,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she was prepared to drop the matter until she found out that Meeks attended the service. She said she consulted a lawyer in Elizabethtown but hasn’t decided what action she will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have no right to take my son on a school bus across county lines to be a church to be baptized,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No they don’t, and this coach and the superintendent should be out of jobs right now.  They took advantage of teenagers who weren’t about to say no to their head coach and superintendent and abused their responsibility as educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be a bigger uproar over this.  I hope Ammons pursues her lawsuit and wins.&lt;/p&gt;

So I’m glad to see that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/07/just-beautiful/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glamour &lt;/em&gt;Magazine has decided to publish an un-airbrushed photo of plus-sized model Lizzie Miller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only objection is calling Ms. Miller “plus-sized.” I’ve seen plus-sized models. And she isn’t it. On the contrary, Miller is quite thin, with only a slight bit of healthy belly fat that would go entirely unnoticed if she wasn’t posed in a position that deliberately and proudly shows off her curves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is reminiscent of &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/the-evolution-of-beauty/"&gt;Dove’s Campaign For Real Beauty&lt;/a&gt;. And although this doesn’t overtly fit in with the topics I usually discuss on this blog, I consider my job to be fighting distortions of reality wherever I see them, and this includes the media’s extreme measures in distorting the public’s view of how people look and distorting the public’s body image expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I would like to commend &lt;em&gt;Glamour&lt;/em&gt; for doing this and I hope this is the start of a new trend (though somehow I doubt it).&lt;/p&gt;

Despite all the fuss made by his family and crazy “alternative” “medicine” cranks about how chemotherapy would kill him, the 13-year-old boy with Hodgkin’s lymphoma is doing quite well. And now he’s completed his induction course of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, since the family is using quack remedies as well, they’re still deluding themselves into thinking it’s really the bogus remedies doing all the work. Orac sums it up nicely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for “alternative” medicine, it’s “heads-I-win-tails-you-lose.” If the patient lives, it’s always because of the “natural” remedies. However, if the patient dies, it was clearly the toxicity of the chemotherapy that killed him. Scientific medicine always loses in the minds of such people. That’s OK, though. We’ll tolerate it as long as science-based medicine keeps saving lives. Because of that nasty, reductionist “Western” medicine, a 13-year-old has a chance at living a long and happy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the the more useful alien technologies is an "&lt;a href="http://io9.com/5340140/the-science-behind-district-9s-blood-splattering-alien-guns"&gt;energy weapon&lt;/a&gt;" based on a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil"&gt;Tesla coil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The weapon might be fictional, but the Tesla coil is real. It was invented in the late 19th century by Serbian inventor &lt;a href="http://www.teslasociety.org/"&gt;Nikola Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, nicknamed the “Wizard of Electricity.” A born entertainer, his public lectures were hugely popular. Before awestruck crowds, Tesla shot sparks from his fingertips, made light bulbs glow, and even melted metals by running current through his body. He was able to snap his fingers and create a ball of red flame, holding it calmly in his hand without burning his fingers. Some of his demonstrations have never been duplicated. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A Tesla coil is based on an induction coil: two coils of insulated copper wire wrapped around an iron coil. Feed an electrical current through the coil, and a powerful magnetic field builds up. When it gets strong enough, and the current is abruptly turned off, that magnetic field collapses and energy is released: thousands of volts of electricity discharge all at once. Depending on how much energy has built up, it can just a visible spark that jumps across a gap to a terminal, or spectacular volts of virtual lightning.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just how powerful are Tesla coils? In 1899 Tesla was conducting an experiment at his laboratory in Colorado Springs that required millions of volts – currents so powerful that snakes of flame and lightning bolts shot 135 feet in the air. Tesla watched the spectacle from his doorway, transfixed with joy, when suddenly everything stopped. The power was dead. Tesla called Colorado Springs Electric Company, only to be told that his experiment had knocked their generator offline and set it on fire. The entire town was in darkness. The company refused to restore his power until he had repaired their generator, free of charge.&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are lots of modern-day Teslas out there, mostly science enthusiasts who share the Serbian inventors love of electricity. One of them is Greg Leyh, who is heading up plans to build the Nevada Lightning Laboratory just outside Las Vegas. Not only will there be two 12-story Tesla coils capable of creating electrical arcs up to 300 feet long, but the center will have public viewing platforms with a bar and lounge area, and spectacular public lightning shows that would have made Tesla proud.

This is intriguing in part because I see (and have) a need for cheap &amp;amp; facile access to the underlying technologies but also because I think there are some interesting computational problems (not touched on the paper, as I will elaborate below) and some additional uses to the general approach.HAPPy mapping is a method developed by Simon Dear for physical mapping.  The basic notion is that large DNA fragments (the size range determining several important parameters of the map; the maximum range between two markers is about 10 times the minimum resolution) are randomly gathered in pools which each contain approximately one half a genome equivalent.  Practical issues limit the maximum size fragments to about 1Mb; any larger and they can&amp;#39;t be handled in vitro. By typing markers across these pools, a map can be generated.  If two markers are on different chromosomes or are farther apart than the DNA fragment size, then there will be no correlation between them.  On the other hand, two markers which are very close together on a chromosome will tend to show up together in a pool. Traditionally, HAPPy pools have been typed by PCR assays designed to known sequences.  One beauty of HAPPy mapping is that it is nearly universal; if you can extract high molecular weight DNA from an organism then a HAPPy map should be possible.The next-gen version of this proposed by the authors would make HAPPy pools as before but then type them by sequence sampling the pools.  Given that a HAPPy pool contains many orders of magnitude less DNA than current next-gen library protocols require, they propose using whole-genome amplification to boost the DNA.  Then each pool would be converted to a bar-coded sequencing library.  The final typing would be performed by incorporating these reads into a shotgun assembly and then scoring each contig as present or absent in a pool.  Elegant!When would this mapping occur?  One suggestion is to first generate a rough assembly using standard shotgun sequencing, as this improves the estimate of the genome size which in turn enables the HAPPy pools to be optimally constructed so that any given fragment will be in 50% of the pools.  Alternatively, if a good estimate of the genome size is known the HAPPy pools could potentially be the source of all of the shotgun data (this is hinted at).One possible variation to this approach would be to replace bar-coded libraries and WGA with Helicos sequencing, which can theoretically work on very small amounts of DNA.  Fragmenting such tiny amounts would be one challenge to be overcome, and of course the Helicos generates much shorter, lower-quality reads than the other platforms.  But, since these reads are primarily for building a physical map (or, in sequence terms driving to larger supercontigs), that may not be fatal.If going with one of the other next-gen platforms (as noted in the previous post in this series, perhaps microarrays make sense as a readout), there is the question of input DNA.  For example, mammalian genomes range in size from 1.73pg to 8.40pg.  A lot of next-gen library protocols seem to call for more like 1-10ug of DNA, or about 6 logs more.  The HAPPy paper&amp;#39;s authors suggest whole-genome amplification, which is reasonable but could potentially introduce bias.  In particular, it could be problematic to allow reads from amplified DNA to be the primary or even a major source of reads for the assembly.  As I&amp;#39;ve noted before, other approaches such as molecular inversion probes might be useful for low amounts, but have not been demonstrated to my knowledge with picograms of input DNA. However, today I stumbled on two papers, one from the Max Planck Institute and one from Stanford, which use digital PCR to quantitate next-gen libraries and assert that this can assist in successfully preparing libraries from tiny amounts of DNA.  It may also be possible to deal with this issue by attempting more than the required number of libraries, determining which built successfully by digital PCR and then pooling a sufficient number of successful libraries.The desirable number of HAPPY libraries and the desired sequencing depth for each library are two topics not covered well in the paper, which is unfortunate. The number of libraries presumably affects both resolution and confidence in the map.  Pretty much the entire coverage of this is the tail of one paragraph  In the Illumina/Solexa system, DNA can be randomly sheared and amplified with primers that contain a 3 bp barcode. Using current instruments, reagents, and protocols, one Solexa &amp;quot;lane&amp;quot; generates ~120 Mb in ~3 million reads of ~40 bp. When each Solexa lane is multiplexed with 12 barcodes, for example, it will provide on average, ~10 Mb of sequence in ~250,000 reads for each sample. At this level of multiplexing, one Solexa instrument &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; (7 lanes plus control) would allow tag sequencing of 84 HAPPY samples. This means, one can finish 192 HAPPY samples in a maximum of three runs. New-generation sequencing combined with the barcode technique will produce innumerous amounts of sequences for assembly.  Changing the marker system from direct testing of sequence-tagged sites by PCR to sequencing-based sampling has an important implication as discussed in the last post.  If your PCR is working well, then if a pool contains a target it will come up positive.  But with the sequencing, there is a very real chance of not detecting a marker present in a pool.  This probability will depend on the size of the target -- very large contigs will have very little chance of being missed, but as contigs go smaller their probability of being missed goes up.  Furthermore, actual size won&amp;#39;t be as important as the effective size: the amount of sequence which can be reliably aligned.  In other words, two contigs might be the same length, but if one has a higher repeat count that contig will be more easily detectable. These parameters in turn can be estimated from the actual data.   The actual size of the pool is a critical parameter as well.  So, the sampling depth (for a given haploid genome size) will determineIn any case, the problem of false negatives must be addressed.  One approach is to only map contigs which are unlikely to have ever been missed.  However, that means losing the ability to map smaller contigs.  Presumably there are clever computational approaches to either impute missing data or simply deal with it.It should also be noted that HAPPy maps, like many physical mapping techniques, are likely to yield long-range haplotype information.  Hence, even after sequencing one individual the approach will retain utility.  Indeed, this seems to be the tack that Complete Genomics is taking to obtain this information for human genomes, though they call it Long Fragment Reads.  It is worth noting that the haplotyping application has one clear difference from straight HAPPy mapping.  In HAPPy mapping, the optimal pool size is one in which any given genome fragment is expected to appear in half the pools, which means pools of about 0.7X genome.  But for haplotyping (and for trying to count copy numbers and similar structural issues), it is desirable to have the pools much smaller, as this information can only be obtained if a given region of the genome is haploid in that pool.  Ideally, this would mean each fragment in its own pool (library), but realistically this will mean as small a pool size as one can make and still cover the whole genome in the targeted number of pools.  Genomes of higher ploidies, such as many crops which are tetraploid, hexaploid or even octaploid, would probably require more pools with lower genomic fractions in order to resolve haplotypes.In conclusion, HAPPy mapping comes close to my personal ideal of a purely in vitro mapping system which looks like a clever means of preparing next-gen libraries.  The minimum and maximum distances resolvable are about 10-fold apart, so more than one set of HAPPy libraries is likely to be desirable for an organism.  Typically this is two sizes, since the maximum fragment size is around 1Mb (and may be smaller from organisms with difficult to extract DNA).  A key problem to resolve is that HAPPy pools contain single digit picograms of DNA.  Amplification is a potential solution but may introduce bias; clever library preparation (or screening) may be another approach.

While some may question her motivation, the decision isn’t all that surprising. Just like other &lt;a href="http://j.bdbphotos.com/pictures/H/4L/H4I1L9P_large.jpg"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt;, athletes are &lt;a href="http://davidbeckham.fans-online.com/details1.jpg"&gt;regularly&lt;/a&gt; dressed up and &lt;a href="http://www.fadedyouthblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/ebony-serena-williams.jpg"&gt;photographed&lt;/a&gt; in the popular &lt;a href="http://cm1.theinsider.com/media/0/148/76/michael_phelps_sports_illustrated_sportsman_of_the_year.0.0.0x0.375x505.jpeg"&gt;press&lt;/a&gt; and this 18-year-old deserves to enjoy the limelight. Further, after reading her comments to the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8243553.stm"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that she holds a healthy perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am who I am and I’m proud of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Semenya..says she is not bothered by the negative publicity following her gold medal at the Berlin World Championships last month.&lt;/p&gt;

But as a kid I never cared much about him - I usually fell asleep halfway through each episode of 'Cosmos'. But I would not miss for anything an episode of 'The Underwater Odyssey of Commander Cousteau' with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-Yves_Cousteau" title=""&gt;Jacques-Yves Cousteau&lt;/a&gt;. That was breathtaking. And what he and the crew of &lt;i&gt;Calypso&lt;/i&gt; did was truly ground-breaking, both in terms of scientific discoveries and in terms of under-water filming. And those discoveries and breakthroughs were shared with us, the audience, in an intimate and immediate manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a long time ago. The techniques of under-water filming pioneered by the crew are now probably considered to be 'nothing special'. And I bet half the crew of &lt;i&gt;Calypso&lt;/i&gt; were cameramen and sound engineers and lighting engineers and video mixers and other TV and movie professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can't do that any more. Or rarely, with a huge cost, only on a very limited number of voyages on very large ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what one can do, even on vessels much smaller than &lt;i&gt;Calypso&lt;/i&gt;, is to have an embedded reporter. Not an old-timey one, but a modern reporter: someone who can search the Web for information, who can write, and blog, and tweet, and take and post photographs, and record and post audio podcasts, and record and post videos, all without help from any professional engineers, using small portable digital equipment and, most importantly, doing it in nearly Real Time, &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; after the ship docks after the voyage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those new-style embedded reporters on a research ship is Lindsey Hoshaw. I was alerted to her by &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/statuses/3791948691" title=""&gt;a tweet by Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. How did she get to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is a Stanford graduate in environmental journalism who was interested in the Pacific Garbage Patch and she put her proposal on &lt;a href="http://www.spot.us/pitches/238" title=""&gt;Spot.us&lt;/a&gt; and asked people to help her raise the necessary funds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/R-qIQpzqZIU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x006699%26color2%3D0x54abd6&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've been offered a space aboard the ship as the only journalist to chronicle this voyage. My enthusiasm for this project is only surpassed by the amazing opportunity I've been offered by The New York Times to publish an article and accompanying photos of my journey.

&lt;p&gt;The Times has never written extensively about the Garbage Patch and my multimedia slideshow and article will be the first of its kind for the newspaper's website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a recent graduate of Stanford University's communications program, I have a background in environmental journalism. I have produced podcasts, audio slideshows and videos about environmental issues in the Bay Area and I have been studying the Garbage Patch for the past three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From their side the New York Times did not promise they'll carry the story, but &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/opinion/19pubed.html?_r=1" title=""&gt;appear quite inclined&lt;/a&gt; to do so if the quality of her work is good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LINDSEY HOSHAW, a freelance journalist in Palo Alto, Calif., hopes to sell a multimedia slide show and maybe an article to The Times about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a mass of floating plastic trash caught in swirling currents in a stretch of ocean twice the size of Texas.

&lt;p&gt;But first, she has to get there. To help finance a $10,000 reporting trip aboard a research vessel, Hoshaw has turned to Spot.Us, a Web site where reporters appeal for donations to pay for their projects. If she can raise $6,000 before the September departure date -- so far, only about $1,600 has come in -- she will take out a loan for the rest, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Times has told Hoshaw that it might pay about $700 for the pictures, more if it also buys a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some, this is exploitation -- the mighty New York Times forcing a struggling journalist to beg with a virtual tin cup. But Hoshaw does not think so. To her, it is an opportunity she cannot pass up -- a story she has long dreamed of, and a chance for a byline in The Times. To David Cohn, the founder of the nonprofit Spot.Us, it is a way for the public to commission journalism that it wants. For The Times, it is another step into a new world unthinkable even a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She got on the ship today! You can follow Lindsey Hoshaw's trip on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/thegarbagegirl" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (which she wisely separated from her &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lindseyhoshaw" title=""&gt;personal account&lt;/a&gt;) and on her brand new &lt;a href="http://lindseyhoshaw.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow her voyage on the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Garbage-Girl/106503016241#/pages/The-Garbage-Girl/106503016241" title=""&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; as well, where &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Garbage-Girl/106503016241#/topic.php?uid=106503016241&amp;amp;topic=8918" title=""&gt;she also wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What does this all mean both for Spot.Us and for the potential future of journalism? We would never claim to have answers, but we do have theories.

&lt;p&gt;Every pitch on Spot.Us is defacto a collaboration. At the very least it is between the reporter and the community of supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But often news organizations get involved. Sometimes we get TWO news organizations involved. In the future - I hope we can get THREE news organizations to collaborate around a single pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are producing a custom CMS that is based around the idea that "collaboration is queen." It is the acknowledgment that no single news organization can do everything and that it is okay to "link to the rest." It requires a new level of transparency and honesty in our reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="http://rebootnews.com/2009/09/08/00034.html" title=""&gt;Rebooting the News #24&lt;/a&gt; this morning (I am assuming that all my readers listen to the show religiously every Monday), Jay and Dave talked about her as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On September 8, Lindsey Hoshaw set sail for The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a huge pool of debris out in the middle of the Pacific that's been known about for a while but rarely reported on or photographed. Her trip has been funded by users who think it's an important venture. That happened at spot.us, the crowd-funding site for investigative journalism created by David Cohn, who used to work with Jay on NewAssignment.Net. (Background: See Lindsey's original pitch in July 2009 and Jay's original post for NewAssignment.Net back in 2006.) The New York Times has agreed to run her account and photos if they are up to Times standards. Meanwhile you can follow along on Twitter by adding thegarbagegirl.

&lt;p&gt;That's the re-booted system of news at work, already at work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave: we've had reporters there before. Anyone who sailed by the Garbage Patch could have been our correspondent on the scene. We just have to teach them to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay: it's unlikely we'd be able to fund a reporter and a photographer and a videographer, which is why it's important for journalists to be able to do multiple things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you may say "Hmmm, that sounds familiar....didn't I hear something about this before?" And yes, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/put_down_the_duckie_at_least_d.php" title=""&gt;you did&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another research vessel just returned from the Pacific Gyre where the crew studied the Garbage Patch. That was the &lt;a href="http://sio.ucsd.edu/Expeditions/Seaplex/" title=""&gt;Seaplex expedition&lt;/a&gt;, led by Miriam Goldstein, a well-known ocean blogger from the &lt;a href="http://theoystersgarter.com/" title=""&gt;Oyster's Garter&lt;/a&gt; blog. Miriam too, separated her &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/oystersgarter" title=""&gt;personal Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/seaplexscience" title=""&gt;expedition account&lt;/a&gt; (I don't actually know who from the crew tweeted from the official account). And she also blogged about it on the official &lt;a href="http://seaplexscience.com/" title=""&gt;Seaplex blog&lt;/a&gt;. So that crew also had an 'embedded reporter' of sorts - Miriam herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/w39-gdWW4-E%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x006699%26color2%3D0x54abd6&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But take another look at the &lt;a href="http://sio.ucsd.edu/Expeditions/Seaplex/Team/" title=""&gt;crew&lt;/a&gt;. Notice something? Miriam was not the only experienced blogger there. Or even the most experienced as a reporter. There were three other people there whose main purpose was to record and report from the trip - the &lt;a href="http://www.projectkaisei.org/" title=""&gt;Project Kaisei&lt;/a&gt; people, who also used their own &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/projectkaisei" title=""&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. One of them is Annie Crawley, founder of &lt;a href="http://www.diveintoyourimagination.com/" title=""&gt;DiveImagination&lt;/a&gt; who also &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/DiveImagination" title=""&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; from the voyage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Ly_wtRXVCZI%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x006699%26color2%3D0x54abd6&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems all these trips have young journalists embedded as reporters, or as parts of the scientific crew, using all the modern communication technologies to report from the voyages in real time as well as to prepare more robust reports afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, did I say that's all? No, Lindsey Hoshaw is not the only person with reporting and blogging experience on that ship. There is also Bonnie Monteleone on board. Bonnie is a blogger on &lt;a href="http://www.theplasticocean.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;The Plastic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; (associated with &lt;a href="http://www.theplasticocean.org/" title=""&gt;the organization&lt;/a&gt; of the same name (hat-tip to &lt;a href="http://sierraclubnc.blogspot.com/2009/07/our-own-atlantic-garbage-patch.html" title=""&gt;North Carolina Sierra Club Blog&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;UNCW's Bonnie Monteleone and Jennifer O'Keefe, Director of Keep America Beautiful- New Hanover County, will represent North Carolina's passion for the ocean by going out into the Atlantic Gyre, followed by Monteleone joining Algalita Marine Research Foundation into the North Pacific Gyre.  They will be taking samples to quantify pelagic plastics found on the oceans surface, collecting surface feeding fish to necropsy for ingested plastics and bringing national awareness to the issues of man made debris entering our oceans.  Most of this research is personally funded and why they need your help.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Bonnie, who is both a student at UNC-Wilmington and staff in the Department of Chemistry &amp;amp; Biochemistry there, will be able to do a direct comparison between the Atlantic and Pacific Garbage Patches. And write and post videos from both expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, what a tangled web! And the distinctions are getting blurry - who is a scientist, who is crew, who is journalist? Everyone is a little bit of everything these days. The journalists are surrounded by scientists - a constant source of information - and scientists are surrounded by journalists - a constant source of questions. They both also help with the daily ship routines (there is no space on small ships for freeloaders - hoist the sails!). And they all report from the voyage, each in his or her own way, some focusing more on the science, others more on the human connection, both at least some on the personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you've ever been to one of the ScienceOnline conferences (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, or the year before....), you know that Ocean Bloggers are a jolly bunch - they come to the conference and what do they do for three days non-stop? They sing Sea Shanties! But they also do the best, most creative and most informative sessions! They are totally at the cutting edge of the new online technologies and many of them are awesome writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://thebeagleproject.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Karen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/" title=""&gt;Craig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://zelnio.org/" title=""&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://theoystersgarter.com/" title=""&gt;Miriam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogfishx.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/guiltyplanet/" title=""&gt;Jennifer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://coralnotesfromthefield.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Rick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ohfortheloveofscience.com/" title=""&gt;Allie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://observationsofanerd.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Christie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/" title=""&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cephalopodcast.com/blog/" title=""&gt;Jason&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/" title=""&gt;Sheril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://southernfriedscience.com/" title=""&gt;Andrew and David&lt;/a&gt; and many others are all amazing bloggers! And very active on Twitter, FriendFeed, Facebook and elsewhere online (it is entirely possible that Karen tweets more times per day than I do!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know that most of them are planning to come to &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline2010&lt;/a&gt;. I have learned that the best thing to do with the Ocean Bloggers is to give them an one-hour time slot and let them loose. They don't need no guidance from me - they are much more creative than I am and 'get' the spirit of the Unconference better than most. They'll plot something in secret and surprise us all right there and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, what I did as soon as I saw Jay's original tweet was start following Lindsey Hoshaw on Twitter. She followed me back so we could exchange Direct Messages....and, she'll also try to come to ScienceOnline2010. Now I just need to catch Bonnie (she is in Wilmington, an hour's drive from here - perhaps she can carpool with &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/U762852BC/blog" title=""&gt;Anne-Marie&lt;/a&gt;) and Annie Crawley and all the 'embedded reporters' and bloggers from all of this summer's Garbage Patch voyages will be there. So perhaps they can all get together and tell us all about it - compare notes. Each one of them came to this with a different background, with different skills and experiences, with different goals. What did they learn about modern journalism out at sea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps they can put all of their stuff together - all the tweets, blog posts, photographs, podcasts, videos and polished articles (or at least links to polished articles if they are published in corporate media, e.g., New York Times) can, perhaps, be placed in a single online spot which we can then all link to and boost the Google rank so people who search for the 'Garbage Patch' find it up high in their searches. Perhaps they can plot how to do it at their session. Or, knowing them, they can do it quicker and use the conference to unveil the site to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember what Lindsey Hoshaw wrote (above):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What does this all mean both for Spot.Us and for the &lt;b&gt;potential future of journalism&lt;/b&gt;? We would never claim to have answers, but we do have theories. Every pitch on Spot.Us is defacto &lt;b&gt;a collaboration&lt;/b&gt;. At the very least it is between the reporter and the community of supporters. But often news organizations get involved. Sometimes we get TWO news organizations involved. &lt;b&gt;In the future - I hope we can get THREE news organizations to collaborate around a single pitch.&lt;/b&gt; We are producing a custom CMS that is based around the idea that "collaboration is queen." It is the acknowledgment that &lt;b&gt;no single news organization can do everything and that it is okay to "link to the rest." It requires a new level of transparency and honesty in our reporting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we are all Jacques-Yves Cousteau. And all of the filming crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year some of the ocean bloggers were involved in the session with the title "Hey! You Can't Say That!". Perhaps next year they can call the session "Oh, You Bet I Can Talk Trash!" or "Blogging Garbage" or, like this post, "Talking Trash"....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever they decide to do, I am looking forward to the result, and to their session. And the Sea Shanties the evening after it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/talkin_trash.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img

&lt;a title="Pestival!" href="http://pestival.org/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;–it’s wonderful!  And where the heck have I been that I wasn’t in on this myself??  From their &lt;a href="http://pestival.org/about/"&gt;Mission Statement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Pestival is a mobile arts festival examining insect-human interactivity in bioscience, through paradigms of contemporary art, cinema, music and comedy as well as direct scientific demonstration and educational projects. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pestival will bring together eminent international artists and scientists and local and global communities to collaborate on cutting-edge interdisciplinary art projects, placing the natural world under the microscope in order to further public understanding of our place within the biosphere.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This SOOO needs to happen in the US.  The &lt;a href="http://pestival.org/news/the-termite-pavilion/"&gt;termite pavilion&lt;/a&gt; looks simply lovely. And check out the Bee Cab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/pestival-festival/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/6lu1f0bmbCw/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, BTW, a working hive in that cab!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Pestival Coverage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/pestival/pool/"&gt;Flickr Pestival Pool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gallery/2009/sep/06/wildlife-insects"&gt;Guardian Photos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2009/sep/03/pestival-bees"&gt;news coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say next year, we set up a hive of insect bloggers as an exhibit. Who’s in?&lt;/p&gt;

How sweet, I know…but surely he wouldn&amp;#39;t &lt;i&gt;admit&lt;/i&gt; to simply getting his degree for window dressing, would he?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/4822/"&gt;Why, yes he would!&lt;/a&gt; he's very proud of the purity of his creationist heritage and pulling off the acquisition of a Ph.D. from Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went straight to Harvard Medical School, which he said "sounded like it would be useful for credentials and evangelism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a second generation creationist, you might say," he said. He explained how he saw that "salvation was inherent in creation science" and that it could be used as a tool for evangelism, another passion of his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a promising and lucrative career in medical research open before him, Jeanson said he underwent a career shift at Harvard. "I asked myself, 'How can I use and abuse my training to influence eternity, rather than for temporary gain?'" He considered mission work or attending seminary. He decided, instead, to seek employment at ICR, rather than continuing his research in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvard, you've been used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to provide some context for this question… during my time last weekend at &lt;a href="http://dragoncon.org/"&gt;Dragon*Con&lt;/a&gt;, I participated in a panel discussion called “Darwin’s Bulldogs, Teachers on the Front Lines” which addressed the question of how educators can deal with creationism in the context of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="HPIM4066" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/hpim4066.jpg?w=342&amp;amp;h=257" alt="HPIM4066" width="342" height="257"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the photo on the far right is &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/about/speakers#scott"&gt;Dr. Eugenie Scott&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/"&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, who was on the panel with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the panel discussion, we had audience Q&amp;amp;A, and a woman who works at a history museum came up to the microphone and presented us with a tough question – the one I named above.  In museums, they don’t have the advantage of a science teacher who has many months to educate students and the luxury of being able to craft pro-science arguments &amp;amp; experiments.  A museum worker can find themselves in a sudden situation where they’re on the spot to explain to, potentially hostile, people the importance of evolution.  As Eugenie Scott said in our panel, this is a particularly tough situation to deal with, and we all agreed to try putting our collective heads together in an effort to address the issue because we do not yet have a good response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you have a suggestion for a sound byte, please leave it in the comments section below and pass this blog post on to everyone you know.  I’ll share my findings with others in the hopes that we can come up with something workable!&lt;/p&gt;

This is a great classroom exercise in evaluating media reports.1. Meat increases the risk of breast cancer. A 2007 study of 35,000 women published in the British Journal of Cancer found that women who ate meat were far more likely to develop breast cancer than women who consumed none. Will Jessica&amp;#39;s next t-shirt will say, &amp;quot;Real Girls Smoke 3 Packs a Day&amp;quot;?The referenced study reports: &amp;quot;... risk of breast cancer to increase with consumption of total meat, HR (Hazard Ratios)r =1.20 for high consumers vs. non-consumers.&amp;quot; In interpreting statements like this it is important to know what a Hazard Ratio means. HR in this case is the proportion of breast-cancer incidence between the meat-eaters and the vegetarians. So if 10 out of 100 vegetarians get breast cancer 12 out of 100 meat eaters get breast cancer. For observational studies, such as this one 1.20 is not likely to be meaningful. Marcia Angell, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine remarks, &amp;quot;As a general rule of thumb, we are looking for a relative risk of 3 or more before accepting a paper for publication.&amp;quot; The exception to this rule might be for well-controlled double-blind studies. Such controlled methods can increase our confidence in results. Lastly of note a recent study came to the opposite conclusion: &amp;quot;None of the meat or meat mutagen variables was associated with breast cancer with strata of age, body mass index, parity, alcohol consumption, smoking, menopausal hormone therapy or intake of fruits and vegetables, and there were no significant interaction between the meat variables and these factors.&amp;quot; But I would say, as a general rule, results from these giant observational studies are dubious at best. If anything they should drive better, controlled experimental studies. Unfortunately the media LOVES them and is very cavalier about reporting the &amp;quot;results.&amp;quot;2. Real girls don&amp;#39;t support animal abuse. Compassion is super sexy, if the huge number of hot celebs ditching meat is any indication. Young women turn vegetarian in droves when they learn that the meat industry cuts the sensitive beaks off newborn chicks and cuts off the tails of baby piglets.If the only reason you are compassionate is to associate yourself with hot celebs, then you need to re-evaluate your life. Celebrity endorsements and appeals to our need to fit in are not new in marketing and advertising; by now you should know better than to trust these statements. While I am moderately pro-compassion I would also note that hospitals cut the foreskins of newborn babies all the time. I think our compassion might be better directed toward inhumane treatment of humans. 3. The meat industry is destroying the Earth. The only thing that&amp;#39;s hot about the meat industry is that it&amp;#39;s toasting the planet. According to the United Nations, raising animals for food causes more greenhouse-gas emissions than all the cars, trucks, SUVs, planes, and ships in the world combined.And yet we&amp;#39;ve been raising meat for over 4,000 years and cruising around in SUVs for the last 50, maybe the greenhouse gases come from the factories, tractors, and other meat packing machinery. In which case the problem is caused by all industries not just meat. I would imagine the fruit industry produces a lot of greenhouse gases trucking orange up from Florida every winter. 4. Meat will make you fat. All the saturated fat and cholesterol in chicken wings, pork chops, and steak eventually leads to flabby thighs and love handles. I hope the upcoming &amp;quot;Jessica Simpson&amp;#39;s Intimates&amp;quot; line comes in plus sizes! Going vegetarian is the best way to get slim and stay that way.How you choose to manage your diet is up to you. Meat or no, If you take in more calories than you use in the course of a day, some of the remainder gets stored as fat. A balanced diet (which can be achieved with or without meat) and a healthy activity level are the best way to get slim and stay that way. 5. Eating meat steals food from starving kids. Jessica&amp;#39;s trip to help kids in Africa got a lot of media buzz, but by gnawing on meat, she&amp;#39;s essentially stealing food from the mouths of starving children since it takes up to 16 pounds of grain to produce just 1 pound of meat. If more people went vegetarian, we&amp;#39;d free up enough grain to feed every person in the world. Wow. That is harsh. First the stats, I see that 16:1 ratio thrown out a lot without a reference but According to the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, an average of 2.6 pounds of grain is used to produce a pound of beef in developed countries. I think that is a lot more manageable considering the complete proteins you get from meat. I heard a researcher in neuro-morality remark once: &amp;quot;If you were to see a baby drowning in a mud-puddle and you didn&amp;#39;t wade in to save him because it would ruin your $200 Italian leather shoes, we&amp;#39;d call you a monster. However, if you spend $200 on shoes instead of buying cheaper shoes and donating the surplus to charities that could feed dozens of starving children in Africa ... no one even notices.&amp;quot; So I would argue that whatever you can do to live with thrift so that you can contribute to organizations like OxFam, will do a lot more to help starving kids than going vegetarian.Note: I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with you being a vegetarian. If that&amp;#39;s how you want to live your life go for it. This post isn&amp;#39;t designed to dissuade you from your lifestyle, or even to promote meat-eating. Rather it is to examine the way the media often does a poor job of representing science, and that if you want to apply the Method to examining media claims this is one way to do that.Taylor, E., Burley, V., Greenwood, D., &amp;amp; Cade, J.

However, the upcoming &lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org/index.htm"&gt;NECSS&lt;/a&gt; is actually within reach for me both financially (I grew up in NYC, mom still lives there) and timing-wise (Lady Tech has agreed to watch the homefront and corral the kiddies). So I am off to the North East Conference on Science and Skepticism!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Looks like a good gamut of &lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org/speakers.htm"&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt;.

To add to the grooviness there is a &lt;a href="http://www.nycskeptics.org/specialevents/dsnecss2009"&gt;Drinking Skeptically&lt;/a&gt; event at Dewey Flatiron on friday at 8, which I will also be attending. I want to see how this is done, so I can start a Skeptic's in the pub in my area (albany area in NY).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Anyway, if there any questions or things you might be interested in at this event, leave a comment and I'll be sure to follow up for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;I'll also twitter anything useful I see from this event.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nye ran afoul of the faithful by remarking that it is not true that the moon generates its own light as opposed to reflecting light. This contradicted Genesis 1:16, which says quite clearly (if only Nye bothered to read it) that "God made two great lights -- the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars." Fortunately, there were educated people in the audience who proceeded to boo Nye and walk out. One woman with three children reportedly screamed "We believe in God!" while storming out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, they&amp;#39;re more likely to agree that &amp;quot;I have so much in life to be grateful for&amp;quot; (here&amp;#39;s a Gratitude Scale, with six other similar questions).Here&amp;#39;s the thing, though. Is it the prayer that makes people grateful, or is it just that people who are grateful are more likely to pray?It&amp;#39;s a classic problem, and the only way to really sort it out is to do an &amp;#39;interventional&amp;#39; study. That&amp;#39;s one in which you take a group of people, put half on one &amp;#39;treatment&amp;#39; and the other half on another, and see what happens.Studies like this are pretty rare in sociology, for practical reasons, but that&amp;#39;s exactly what Nathaniel Lambert and colleagues from Florida State University have done.They took a group of about 100 students, almost all women and all of them in a current romantic relationship, and put them in four different groups. The first two groups were asked to pray daily, and the second two were asked to do a task unrelated to prayer. Here&amp;#39;s the details of the groups:Pray daily for the well-being of your partnerPray daily (with no specific instructions)Report daily on their activities for the dayThink positive thoughts about their partnerThen they assessed all the participants for their level of gratitude. It seems (although the paper doesn&amp;#39;t spell it out) that there weren&amp;#39;t any statistically significant differences.So they lumped together the two &amp;#39;prayer&amp;#39; groups and the two other groups. That has the effect of increasing the statistical power.Doing this comparison, they found a significant difference. Those students who were asked to pray daily did become more grateful.This is a great study simply because it is interventional. What&amp;#39;s more, they controlled for &amp;#39;social desirability&amp;#39; - the tendency for some people to tell you what they think you want to hear. So it&amp;#39;s good evidence of genuine cause and effect. But there are a few problems with it that need to be remembered.Firstly, they excluded all the non-religious people - in other words all though who said they rarely or never prayed. That amounted to about 25% of potential participants. So this is a study of the effect of prayer in people who already see some benefit to it, but who just don&amp;#39;t get around to it as often as they might.Second, the effect is pretty small - about 1.6 units on a scale that stretches up to 42. The effect might be statistically significant, but that&amp;#39;s not the same as saying it&amp;#39;s important (Olivier Morin has written about this recently over on ICCI blog). Without the authors putting the results into context of other factors that affect gratitude, it&amp;#39;s hard to judge.And third, the after-the-fact lumping together of groups because they didn&amp;#39;t see the result they expected is a little bit dodgy (although much worse goes on regularly, it has to be said).But despite these caveats, this is a good study. However, it leaves open the question of why prayer should increase gratitude. Mike McCullough, at the University of Miami, put forward some potential reasons in a 2002 paper:Most religions promote gratitude as a desirable attribute, so people may link religiosity to expressions of gratitude.Religious people tend to believe in a creator god. So when something good happens (or is seen, like a sunset), they may be more likely to respond with feelings of gratitude.Lastly, religious people tend to attribute good events, but not bad ones, to the actions of a god. So that may enhance their feelings of gratitude.To me, generalised gratitude seems like an odd concept. It seems to be tailor-made for the religious mindset. While I have plenty of things to feel glad about, I only have feelings of gratitude towards people.Religious people are naturally going to extend those feelings towards their god. So I guess we should not be too surprised that making religious people think more about their god also increases their sense of gratitude!_______________________________________________________________________________________Lambert, N., Fincham, F., Braithwaite, S., Graham, S., &amp;amp; Beach, S.

Over 60,000 people died. The authors of this paper took 44 earthquake survivors, and 32 control volunteers who had not experienced the disaster.The volunteers underwent a &amp;quot;resting state&amp;quot; fMRI scan; survivors were scanned between 13 and 25 days after the earthquake. Resting state fMRI is simply a scan conducted while lying in the scanner, not doing anything in particular. Previous work has shown that fMRI can be used to measure resting state neural activity in the form of low-frequency oscillations.The authors found differences in the resting state low-frequency activity (ALFF) between the trauma survivors and the controls. In survivors, resting state activity was increased in several areas:&amp;quot;The whole-brain analysis indicated that, vs. controls, survivors showed significantly increased ALFF in the left prefrontal cortex and the left precentral gyrus, extending medially to the left presupplementary motor area... [and] region of interest (ROI) analyses revealed significantly increased ALFF in bilateral insula and caudate and the left putamen in the survivor group...&amp;quot;They also reported correlations between resting activity in some of these areas and self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms in the survivors.Finally, survivors showed reduced functional connectivity between a wide range of areas (&amp;quot;a distributed network that included the bilateral amygdala, hippocampus, caudate, putamen, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum.&amp;quot;) Functional connectivity analysis measures the correlation in activity across different areas of the brain - whether the areas tend to activate at the same time or not.Now - what does all this mean? And does it help us understand the brain?The fact that there are differences between the two groups is not very informative or surprising. &amp;quot;Resting state&amp;quot; neural activity presumably reflects whatever is going through a person&amp;#39;s mind. Recent earthquake survivors are going to be thinking about rather different things compared to luckier people who didn&amp;#39;t experience such trauma. It doesn&amp;#39;t take a brain scan to tell you that, but that&amp;#39;s all these scans really tell us.But these weren&amp;#39;t just any differences - they were particular differences in particular brain regions. Does that make knowing about them more interesting and useful?Not as such, because we don&amp;#39;t know what they represent, or what causes them. So living through an earthquake gives you &amp;quot;Increased ALFF in the left prefrontal cortex&amp;quot; - but what does that mean? It could mean almost anything. The left prefrontal cortex is a big chunk of the brain, and its functions probably include most complex cognitive processes. Ditto for the other areas mentioned.The authors link their findings to previous work with frankly vague statements such as &amp;quot;The increased regional activity and reduced functional connectivity in frontolimbic and striatal regions occurred in areas known to be important for emotion processing&amp;quot;. But anatomically speaking, most of the brain is either &amp;quot;fronto-limbic&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;striatal&amp;quot;, and almost everywhere is involved in &amp;quot;emotion processing&amp;quot; in one way or another.So I don&amp;#39;t think we understand the brain much better for reading this paper. Further work, building on these results, might give insights. We might, say, learn that decreased connectivity between Regions X and Y is because trauma decreases serotonin levels, which prevents signals being communicated between these areas, which is why trauma victims can&amp;#39;t use X to deliberately stop recalling traumatic memories, which is what Y does.I just made that up. But that&amp;#39;s a theory which could be tested. Much of today&amp;#39;s neuroimaging research doesn&amp;#39;t involve testable theories - it is merely the exploratory search for neural differences between two groups. Neuroimaging technology is powerful, and more advanced techniques are always being developed. What with resting state, functional connectivity, pattern-classification analysis, and other fancy methods, the scope for finding differences between groups is enormous and growing. So I&amp;#39;m being rather unfair in criticizing this paper; there are hundreds like it. I picked this one because it was published last week in a good journal.Exploratory work can be useful as a starting point, but at least in my opinion, there is too much of it. If you want to understand the brain, as opposed to simply getting published papers to your name, you need a theory sooner or later. That&amp;#39;s what science is about.Lui, S., Huang, X., Chen, L., Tang, H., Zhang, T., Li, X., Li, D., Kuang, W., Chan, R., Mechelli, A., Sweeney, J., &amp;amp; Gong, Q. (2009).

The prosecuting attorney wants to make sure she has every angle covered, so she questions the witness over and over to double- and triple-check that he has his story right. When he finally takes the stand, he remembers every detail she asked him about. But when the defense attorney cross-examines him, she takes an unexpected new tactic, asking about details the prosecutor hadn't prepared him for. He stumbles over some of the answers, contradicting other witnesses, and now all his testimony seems suspect. Was he lying?

Perhaps not. In similar situations, researchers have found that when we practice remembering only part of a group of related items, we're more likely to forget the rest of the items in the group. For example, suppose you're asked to remember these two lists:

Then later you practice on just half the fruits you memorized (say, Watermelon, Strawberry, Mango, and Cantaloupe). Finally, you're tested on your memory of items from both lists. Of course, you'll remember the items you practiced best. But you'll remember the drinks you didn't practice better than the fruits you didn't practice. By practicing on only some of the fruit, you actually forgot more of the fruits you didn't practice than you would have if you hadn't practiced at all.

But memory is complicated, and researchers have found that your emotion and mood when forming the memories can affect what you recollect. Karl-Heinz Bäuml and Christof Kuhbandner wondered if emotions while practicing would also affect recall.

Not surprisingly, the relationship between an employee and their boss is the best predictor for job satisfaction according to a 2006 &lt;a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1272/is_2732_134/ai_n27059465/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Accountemps, a Menlo Park, California-based specialized staffing service for temporary accounting, finance, and bookkeeping professionals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interestingly enough, the relationship you have with your boss may not only determine your overall job satisfaction, but also how well you sleep. In an article by Niedhammer et. al in the latest edition of SLEEP they investigated the association between a bullying boss and experienced sleep disturbance. Here is a snippet of their abstract:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Results:&lt;/span&gt; Workplace bullying was strongly associated with sleep disturbances. Past exposure to bullying also increased the risk for this outcome. The more frequent the exposure to bullying, the higher the risk of experiencing sleep disturbances. Observing someone else being bullied in the workplace was also associated with the outcome. Adjustment for covariates did not modify the results. Additional adjustment for self-reported health and depressive symptoms diminished the magnitude of the associations that remained significant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/span&gt; The prevalence of workplace bullying (around 10%) was found to be high in this study as well was the impact of this major job-related stressor on sleep disturbances. Although no conclusion about causality could be drawn from this cross-sectional study, the findings suggest that the contribution of workplace bullying to the burden of sleep disturbances may be substantial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;This article ties in well with Levin and Nielsen's prior work on emotions and disturbed sleep. In their 2007 Psychological Bulletin paper they proposed that high affect load, the consequence of daily variations in emotional pressure, and high affect distress, the disposition to experience events with distressing, significantly influenced nightmare prevalence, frequency, severity, and psychopathological comorbidity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suspect the bullied employees who experience sleep disturbances are also experiencing an associated high affect load and high affect distress.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Niedhammer I; David S; Degioanni S; Drummond A; Philip P.

My congrats to everyone involved: Nancy Atkinson (&lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/09/08/365-days-astronomy-podcast-wins-award/"&gt;who wrote about this at Universe Today&lt;/a&gt;), Pamela Gay, George Hrab (who did the musical theme and accepted the award at Dragon*Con) and everyone else who contributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;365 Days&lt;/em&gt; is a user-driven ‘cast: people signed up for different days of the year, recorded a podcast about astronomy, and then uploaded it to the site. So the content is totally by the audience, which is very cool, and a great way to build a dedicated community to support astronomy. I’m really glad this unique venture — a project of the International Year of Astronomy — got the recognition it deserves! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 365 Days still has quite a few days to go, so you should put it in your iTunes subscriptions or your RSS feed or whatever it takes so that you can listen in every diurnal rotation of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252450092843"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc73c5e7dfc810ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Solar System"/><title type="html">Red sky at night... but why?</title><published>2009-09-08T22:47:44Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T22:47:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sure, we're all familiar with sunsets, and how they appear to turn the entire sky close to the horizon red at night.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why/sunset3.jpg" width="500" title="Sailor&amp;#39;s delight?  Definitely!" alt="sunset3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it turns out it isn't just the Sun, and it isn't just the sky.  If you look at the Moon at either Moonrise or Moonset, guess what color &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; appears to be?  (Even in urban settings!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why/seattlemoon_stephens_strip2.jpg" width="512" title="Hooray for Seattle!" alt="seattlemoon_stephens_strip2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too difficult to tell?  Let's find you a better picture done with time-lapse photography.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why/3704814166_495dbd2f53.jpg" width="500" title="Amazing, dark red colors when it&amp;#39;s close to the horizon!" alt="3704814166_495dbd2f53.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's going on to cause this?  Why do things which aren't normally red &lt;i&gt;appear&lt;/i&gt; red when you look at them on the horizon, from the Sun to the Moon to the sky itself?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all the atmosphere's fault.  After all, things look exactly the same on the Moon's horizon as they do directly overhead:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why/apollo08_earthrise.jpg" width="500" title="This is from the Apollo 8 mission, orbiting the Moon." alt="apollo08_earthrise.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why so different here?  What exactly does our atmosphere do?  Well, the simple answer is that it &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering"&gt;scatters light&lt;/a&gt;.  Not all light equally, though.  The atmosphere is better at scattering blue light away, which means that blue light gets dispersed all throughout the sky pretty easily.  But red light is more likely to pass directly through, which is why things appear redder on the horizon: &lt;i&gt;more of the bluer light gets scattered away&lt;/i&gt;, while the red light comes (mostly) through to you.  See this dramatic photo of the sky just after sunset from an altitude of 500 meters:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why/800px-SDIM0241b.jpg" width="500" title="The colors are truly amazing!  But you can tell where the Sun is just by looking at the reddest parts." alt="800px-SDIM0241b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's another huge effect, as you've probably guessed.  After all, this doesn't work when the Sun is directly overhead, or even close to it, but it works very well on the horizon.  The Earth is pretty big, having a diameter just under 13,000 kilometers.  But the Earth's atmosphere is very thin.  In fact, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere"&gt;troposphere&lt;/a&gt; (where air is breathable), which contains nearly 80% of the Earth's air, only extends 17 km up on average.  Like I said, &lt;i&gt;thin&lt;/i&gt;, at least compared to the Earth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why/strait.gif" width="500" title="The atmosphere even looks thin, doesn&amp;#39;t it?" alt="strait.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through 17 km of air doesn't have such a dramatic effect on light; about 84% of it still gets through.  But when you look at the horizon, the light has a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; farther to go through that atmosphere.  Think about it!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why/distmoon.jpg" width="318" height="372" alt="distmoon.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Moon is overhead, it goes through 17 km of tropospheric air.  But when the Moon is on the horizon, it goes through &lt;b&gt;465 km&lt;/b&gt; of troposphere!  That's not only enough to scatter away most of the blue light, it scatters away about 99% of &lt;i&gt;the total&lt;/i&gt; light that comes from the Moon!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, pretty much, only the red light gets through.  And this very same phenomenon not only explains why the sky looks red at sunset, it also explain why &lt;i&gt;the Moon looks red during a lunar eclipse!&lt;/i&gt;  Because the only light that gets through is the little bit of red light that makes it all the way through the Earth's atmosphere and onto the Moon:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why/TLE2000Jul-5152w.JPG.jpeg" width="500" title="Hello, bloody lunar eclipse!" alt="TLE2000Jul-5152w.JPG.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you've got a message to send hundreds of kilometers through the air, send it in red, please.  The atmosphere is just too strong for blue (or even green) signals to get through very far.  Thanks a lot, &lt;i&gt;Nitrogen gas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/red_sky_at_night_but_why.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252448649103"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/a_question_for_my_readers.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1df5d30cd88bc924</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">A question for my readers</title><published>2009-09-08T22:01:53Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T22:01:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/66_rtnvith4/a_question_for_my_readers.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/a_question_for_my_readers.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, actually, a bunch of questions, and its about fund raising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/a_question_for_my_readers.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/a_question_for_my_readers.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/66_rtnvith4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252445882405"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=6299">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6967219bb435ffcc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Family"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="circus"/><category term="Coney Island"/><category term="summer"/><title type="html">Wheel of wonder</title><published>2009-09-08T20:55:42Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T20:55:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/wheel-of-wonder/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We caught the last day of Ringling’s Boom-a-Ring performance at Coney Island yesterday, capped with a few hours of Coney Island entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex is able to sit through live performances these days, so a couple of times a year we go to a circus, where he enjoys high-wire acrobatics and the spectacle of bodies literally flying through the air. He seems to enjoy more of the performance each time he goes. Yesterday he seemed to really pay attention to the superlative juggling (more things flying through the air, I guess) as well as the first appearance of the elephant, parading grandly around the ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:490px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/09/wonder-wheel.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/09/wonder-wheel.jpg" alt="Photo/Jill Cornfield" width="480" height="360"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo/Jill Cornfield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were waiting to get in, we saw a number of kids and people on the spectrum. It seems like the circus is a great place to go for people who can take the darkness and lights and stimulation. If you make some noise, that’s OK. There are many opportunities to clap and cheer. Since the circus really is for all ages, what does it matter if you’re 15 or 20 and still like to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex loves Coney Island, too, and there’s still plenty left. He insisted on taking Jeff for a brief wade in the ocean. We all enjoyed a hot dog from Nathan’s and a few rides. Alex and I rode one of the swinging cars on the Wonder Wheel, pictured above, and we screamed and laughed at how high we were, and how the car sped along its track way above the world.&lt;/p&gt;

over, I'm off on a business trip for a week. And along the way, I've got some
deadlines for my book. So to fill in, I'm recycling some old posts. I decided
that it's been entirely too long since there was any pathological programming
'round these parts, so I'm going to repost some of my favorites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Today, we're going to take a look at a brilliant language called &lt;a href="http://catseye.mine.nu:8080/projects/befunge93/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Befunge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Befunge is the work of an evil genius named Chris Pressey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Normal programming languages are based on a basically one-dimensional
syntax; the program is a string, a sequence of characters, and it's processed
by reading that string in a straight-ahead fashion. But that's not Befunge!
It's got a two-dimensional syntax. Befunge is something like a two-dimensional
turing machine: the program is written on a two dimensional&lt;em&gt;torus&lt;/em&gt; called the playfield. Each
instruction in Befunge is a single character, and where it's located on the
torus is crucial - control is going to move either up/down or left/right
on the torus. All of the control flow is expressed by just changing the direction that
the head moves over the torus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (In case you're not familiar with a torus, it's what you get
if you take a very flexible sheet of paper, and roll it so that you connect
the top edge to the bottom, and then roll that tube so that you connect the
left edge to the right. You get a donut shape where moving up from what used
to be the top of the page puts you on the bottom of the page; moving left from
the left edge of the page puts you on the right.) &lt;/p&gt;

Woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been at Dragon*Con spreading skepticism all over Atlanta and having a blast doing it! This particular conference was extremely special for me because I almost didn’t go. I came very close to stabbing myself in the foot so I wouldn’t have to get up in front of a live audience at the Skepchick Dragon•Con panel. I know it may seem silly to&lt;img src="http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/1543/99341293078539405020352.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="270"&gt; a lot of you but I was terrified! I have never spoke in front of a live audience, EVER. I was so nervous that I actually almost barfed on A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for everyone involved (especially A) everything worked out fine and I managed to give a (very) short talk on “magic” jewelry and I honestly feel like a better, stronger person for having done it. I now look forward to the next time I will have the opportunity to be on a panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, did I mention I used to be scared of Beaker from the Muppets too? Yes, Dragon*Con helped me overcome that fear as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what fears, irrational or otherwise have you overcome? How did you master them and how has it changed your life?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Amy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252442806127"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/speeches_speeches.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/baa9cefaf85938d9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Speeches, speeches!</title><published>2009-09-08T21:16:48Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T21:16:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Dr08okNYzSc/speeches_speeches.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/speeches_speeches.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The latest &lt;a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/humanist-network-news-podcast-41-crossing-the-streams"&gt;Humanist News Podcast is up&lt;/a&gt;, and it contains my AHA award acceptance speech.

Shadowfax, a blogging ER doc, relates to us &lt;a href="http://allbleedingstops.blogspot.com/2009/09/human-cost-of-woo.html"&gt;what happens when cancer patients rely on quackery like the Gerson protocol instead of scientific medicine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This was a young woman, barely out of her teens, who presented with a tumor in her distal femur, by the knee.  This was not a new diagnosis -- it had first been noted in January or so, and diagnosed as a Primary B-Cell Lymphoma.   By now, the tumor was absolutely huge, and she came to the ER in agonizing pain.   Her physical exam was just amazing.  The poor thing's knee (or more precisely, the area just above the knee) was entirely consumed by this massive, hard, immobile mass about the size of a soccer ball.  She could not move the knee; it was frozen in a mid-flexed position.  She hadn't been able to walk for months.  The lower leg was swollen and red due to blood clots, and the worst of the pain she was having seemed due to compression of the nerves passing behind the knee.  It was like something you see out of the third world, or historic medical textbooks.  I have never seen its like before.

&lt;p&gt;So we got her pain managed, of course, and I sat down to talk to her and her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why had this tumor been allowed to grow so large and painful? I think you know the answer. She was relying on quackery (in this case, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/the_notsobeautiful_untruth.php"&gt;Gerson protocol&lt;/a&gt;) instead of chemotherapy and radiation. Her reasoning was thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a less grave situation I might have laughed and asked "So how's that working for ya?"  As it was, the tears from her only partially-controlled pain took any humor out of the situation.  She was very frustrated that the Gerson therapy wasn't working yet, but she did not perceive this as a failure of the treatment.  Her theory was that the severity of her uncontrolled pain was keeping her immune system suppressed and preventing it from working.  If, she hoped, she could just get her pain under control, she would finally start to get better.

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time with this young lady.  Listening as well as explaining.  She was dead set against chemo, which to her mind was equated with the "toxins" which had caused her cancer in the first place.  She wrote off the oncologists as pushing chemo "because that's all they know how to do, and it never works."  She had, in fact, burnt all the bridges with the various oncologists who had treated her, and was now left with only a pain specialist and a primary care doctor trying to do what little they could for her. She was equally frustrated by doctors in general, who "won't do anything to help me."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see why she felt that way; when a patient refuses the only possible effective treatment, there is not really much we can do to help her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_price_of_quackery.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we got her pain managed, of course, and I sat down to talk to her and her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why had this tumor been allowed to grow so large and painful? If you’re a regular reader of SBM, I bet you know the answer. This patient had been relying on quackery (in this case, the Gerson protocol, immortalized in the quackery propaganda movie &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=291"&gt;The Beautiful Truth&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a less grave situation I might have laughed and asked “So how’s that working for ya?”  As it was, the tears from her only partially-controlled pain took any humor out of the situation.  She was very frustrated that the Gerson therapy wasn’t working yet, but she did not perceive this as a failure of the treatment.

&lt;p&gt;I could see why she felt that way; when a patient refuses the only possible effective treatment, there is not really much we can do to help her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too true. The cliche goes that you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink. This is true for every patient; we can’t force our therapies on a mentally competent adult patient. People have the right to make their own choices and to suffer the consequences when their choices are poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like this woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person primarily at fault is the quack prescribing the treatment, taking advantage of this woman’s fear of chemotherapy. After relating how he arranged for this patient to see another oncologist, who was willing to try to help her despite her baggage and extreme distrust of “conventional” medicine, Shadowfax concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most woo is harmless — but that’s because most woo is directed at chronic, ill-defined, or otherwise incurable conditions.  Think chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia.  Wave a magnet at somebody, get them to do a lot of enemas and go on a special diet, and you get to write a book and go on Oprah and collect a lot of money.  If the subjects of the “magical thinking medicine” think they are better from the intervention, then so much the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the really pernicious thing about allowing fantasy medical theories and treatments into the mainstream is that when they gain enough credence among the masses, they will tend to be used in place of real medical treatments that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. What’s worse is that, the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=28"&gt;more woo infiltrates scientific medicine&lt;/a&gt;, as it is doing, the harder it is to tell woo from non-woo. Then we ostensibly “science-based” practitioners become the quacks who are only marginally better than the quack who indulges the delusions of a young woman with a potentially curable cancer and thereby leads her into a path of extreme suffering and likely death. I’ve seen it before myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve even &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=185"&gt;blogged about it before&lt;/a&gt;–and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=15"&gt;more than once&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I cut-and-paste from Wikipedia:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. It is proposed that a being has maximal excellence in a given possible world W if and only if it is omnipotent, omniscient and wholly good in W; and&lt;br&gt;2. It is proposed that a being has maximal greatness if it has maximal excellence in every possible world.&lt;br&gt;3. Maximal greatness is possibly exemplified. That is, it is possible that there be a being that has maximal greatness. (Premise)&lt;br&gt;4. Therefore, possibly it is necessarily true that an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists.&lt;br&gt;5. Therefore, it is necessarily true that an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists. (By S5)&lt;br&gt;6. Therefore, an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From what I read in the Wikipedia article, the two objections to this argument seem to be whether to buy into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_S5"&gt;Axiom S5&lt;/a&gt; (which I don't understand quite well enough to comment on, but since it is apparently broadly accepted I will grant it for now), and whether to accept the possibility premise (3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it turns out, I am pretty sure I &lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/could-god-coin-word-so-self.html"&gt;don't accept the possibility premise&lt;/a&gt;, but that's not even what I want to talk about.  I think that (2) is not even a valid statement, i.e. we could not even differ over whether it is possible because it is ill-formed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem is that (2) refers to a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; being inhabiting every possible world.  This is nonsensical.  An entity that exists in world W cannot be the &lt;i&gt;same&lt;/i&gt; entity that exists in world X, at least by the definition of "world" that we mean when using logic.  If we attempt to paraphrase Plantinga's assertion with more specificity, it breaks down:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2.  It is proposed that a being which exists in world W has maximal greatness if, in any possible world X it exists and is maximally excellent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, in order to be maximally great, a being -- one single hypothetical being, not two identical hypothetical beings -- has to exist in more than one possible world.  This is nonsensical.  You can't even invoke some sort of transcendence-of-God argument here, because by "possible worlds" we aren't talking about parallel universes, we are talking about thought experiments.  The "possible worlds" are entirely separate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we paraphrase (2) to be less objectionable, then Plantinga's argument falls apart:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2.  It is proposed that a being which exists in world W has maximal greatness if, for any possible world X in which an identical being exists, that other being would be maximally excellent.&lt;br&gt;3. Maximal greatness is possibly exemplified. That is, it is possible that there be a being that has maximal greatness. (Premise)&lt;br&gt;4. Therefore, possibly it is necessarily true &lt;i&gt;in any world X in which a maximally excellent being exists&lt;/i&gt; that an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists.&lt;br&gt;5. Therefore, it is necessarily true in any world X in which an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists that an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists. (By S5)&lt;br&gt;6. Therefore, tautologies are fun.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps a more succinct way of doing it is that Axiom S5, if I understand it, cannot be distributed across multiple possible worlds.  Otherwise, I could make this absurd argument:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. It is proposed that Plantinga's argument is incorrect in world W if and only if there is an error in Plantinga's argument in world W.&lt;br&gt;2. It is proposed that Plantinga's argument would be logically invalid if it is incorrect in all possible worlds W.&lt;br&gt;3. Plantinga's argument might be logically contradictory.  (Premise.  Since people are still arguing over it, I think this is a fair premise.)&lt;br&gt;4. Therefore, it is possible that it is necessary that there is an error in Plantinga's argument.&lt;br&gt;5. Therefore, it is necessary that there is an error in Plantinga's argument.&lt;br&gt;6. Therefore, there is an error in Plantinga's argument&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order for the "possibly-necessary implies possibly" aspect of Axiom S5 to hold water, the proposition it modifies must only say something about &lt;i&gt;one possible world&lt;/i&gt;, not a generalization about all possible worlds.  Otherwise, it could be used to prove anything you want.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-1626401848719241508?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252438368707"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-9026467614950757814">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1eb7264d0b3fa0a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Grassroots Skeptics</title><published>2009-09-08T18:07:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T18:07:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/09/grassroots-skeptics.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">Ok, I was away for the weekend on a fabulous canoe trip (where I didn't catch one fish and almost tipped over in the river), which made me unable to mention a new support group for fledgling skeptic organizations that launched on September fourth.

Some are used for mammalian placenta formation, some are partially responsible for diseases, and the parts of some end up playing various roles in gene regulation and expression. There are over 20 “families” of Human ERVs (HERVs) with several thousand individual sequences. While many&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMTV (Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus) and FeLV (Feline Leukemia Virus) are examples of endogenous and exogenous viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERVs can provide a wonderful ancestry marker to identify related species after ancestral gamete insertions. Over the generations, mutations accumulate within an ERV which can result in a number of possible outcomes ranging from the adoption of a retroviral promoter by another gene or the adoption of a retroviral gene to produce a product which is beneficial for the organism. Because the insertion point of an ERV is random,  multiple locations of a very similar ERVs can indicate multiple insertion events. If you’re really interested in ERVs, read some of Abbie’s posts at the aptly named &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/ervs/"&gt;ERV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below the fold is a repost from Mors dei 1.0 relating to misinformation about ERVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, some Creationist (not IDiot, the regular idiot), posted a little snippet as a comment over on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2008/08/idiots_and_ervs.php"&gt;ERV&lt;/a&gt;. It’s down at comment #6, but for easy of reading, I’ll copy the entire thing here…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We fully expect you to NOT post this, but we’ll give it a whirl anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please refer to:&lt;br&gt;
http://www.whoisyourcreator.com/endogenous_retroviruses.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this person expect it not to be posted because it is complete nonsense? I certainly think that’s why it wouldn’t be posted…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll to:&lt;br&gt;
“How is it that ERVS are Considered Copies of Disease Producing Exogenous Retroviruses but None Have Been Proven to Directly Cause Disease?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, it’s poor English and complete fiction; in the event you are unfamiliar with multiple sclerosis, I suggest reading up on it. Other HERV-induced diseases include a wide variety of auto-immune conditions and some cancers. Additionally, we would expect those disease-causing HERVs to lose functionality if those humans are to survive; if they are completely functional and cause severe disease, the carrier dies, ERV goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By Chance, What Made ERVS Evolve into “The Cure,” Instead of Remaining Disease Related Viruses?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portions of ERVs (notice the last “s” is in lower case?) with beneficial uses are kept, those with extremely deleterious or no effects undergo much more mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By Chance, What Made ERV Elements Change From Viral Activities to Cellular Activities and Create New Essential Genes?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event you still don’t get the effect selection plays on the survival of genes, and remain unable to comprehend how mutations arise and are selected for/against, then perhaps you should take a few remedial courses in biology; ERVs seem to be far out of your league…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ERVS Created the Specie-Specific Regulatory Network that Controls the Expression of Cells in a Collective Manner. What Came First ï¿½ the Host or the Regulatory Network?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a false dichotomy; neither came first, here’s a generalized narrative, retrovirus invades germ cell–&amp;gt;germ cell produces gamete–&amp;gt;infected gamete forms zygote which grows up to be adult (if virus doesn’t kill it)–&amp;gt;virus loses some functionality due to mutations–&amp;gt;genome adapts to include ERV as functional element or ERV slowly disappears… I know, that’s really simplified, but I figured I wouldn’t make your brain explode just yet…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By Chance, What Made ERV LTRS Immediately Turn into Essential Gene Regulators Upon Insertion?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event you don’t know what an LTR is, it is a “Long terminal repeat” which is used for insertion into the host DNA; now, what happens is after dsDNA is formed, LTR-specific integrases put the DNA into the genome. Now, they are presenting evidence that the TF (transcription factor) binding site was present in the consensus sequence of the original retrovirus, it didn’t “turn into” anything, it just happened to contain the consensus sequence for the TF in the original consensus sequence of the retroviral integrase because it is present in many related species… no magic…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By Chance, What Made LTRS Gain Transciptional Abilities for Essential Genes?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote ERV (Abbie), “Its possible that a retrovirus plops down next to a gene, and the genes like ‘Whoa! Ur a better promoter! I keepsies you!!’” Neat, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Misc. Examples of biased and inaccurate research and publications:”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could explain each and every one of these papers, but then how would you learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that there are about 50 + research articles referenced so we look forward to your rebuttal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you can restrain yourself, it would serve all of us well if you would debate without insults and foul language.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you cited so many papers, too bad you didn’t use them to present an actual argument. Using all those papers, I suppose makes you smart; keep in mind citing lots of research papers does not mean they support your conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fearful that people might use this as occasion to, you know, disbelieve in the Bible, creative Bible-believers have created the &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/scienceandthesacred/2009/09/the-message-incident-principle.html"&gt;Message-Incident Principle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;That is, instead of confusing or distracting the biblical writers and their readers with modern scientific concepts, God descended to their level and employed the science-of-the-day. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, passages in the Bible referring to the physical world feature both a Message of Faith and an incidental ancient science. According to this interpretive principle, biblical inerrancy rests in the Divine Theology, and not in statements referring to nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course!  God didn’t want to confuse people!  If everyone believes in a firmament, then God made a firmament.  If everyone believes in human parthenogenesis, then that’s how God rolls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, being omniscient, god must have foreseen that the science-loving denizens of the 21st century would easily distinguish between the parts of the Bible that count as “Divine Theology” and the parts that count as “Cave-People Folk Science.”  It’s just common sense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Phil 2, the 3-tier ancient astronomy is “alongside” the “more important” Message of Faith that Jesus is Lord over the entire universe. Amen!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have kept the details that I believe are pertinent to the challenge he describes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Richard!&lt;br&gt;
I’ve been following your new posts on The Friendly Atheist site for a couple weeks now. You have a great gift of communicating sensitive issues so elegantly for many diverse audiences. Thanks for everything you’ve given the community!  Your advice and tone is exactly what is needed in our society. Keep up the great work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; My wife and I both grew up in Christian homes/communities.  We both went to church every Sunday and were very active in our churches. We’re both from North Carolina, right smack in the Bible Belt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my teens I started experiencing religious doubt and became more skeptical of the existence of God.  In college I continued to become more skeptical.  Soon after I met my wife, she began down her path of skepticism.  We now both consider ourselves atheists. We’ve found friends (new and old) with similar beliefs and methods of parenting.  We’ve developed our own support group to commiserate with and explore new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have a daughter, she’s almost 2 1/2 years old.  Soon after she was born, my parents approached me asking if we were planning to have her baptized.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point I faced the decision to hide my current views on religion and do what I knew my parents would want or to take advantage of the opportunity and tell them how my views had changed.  I did the latter and I still am glad I made that decision.  It wasn’t easy and there has been some tension for sure but I feel good about being true to myself and my family.  It’s no secret that my family is discouraged and disheartened by our change of religious views.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On several occasions they have made remarks and at one point even gave us a letter stating that they thought she should be raised in a church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the issue at hand. When my family gathers for dinner, regardless of location, they pray.  This is perfectly fine with us and even encouraged in our own house.  We respect other’s views and want our home to feel welcoming to all beliefs.  We obviously do not pray ourselves but we remain quiet and respectful while they pray.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For quite some time now my family has been making a huge deal about the act of prayer at the dinner table and even going so far to slapping our daughter’s hands together into a praying position.  At first we were somewhat alarmed by the situation and even remained passive towards them not knowing how to handle it.  Recently we have started instructing our daughter in front of the family to remain quiet and respectful during the blessing, telling her that she wasn’t required to put her hands together or bow her head.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has resulted in some rather unsettling looks from family members, especially my dad.  It’s been very uncomfortable to experience, because I’ve always been so close with my family, and it makes the moments immediately following the prayer even more awkward.  We’d prefer they lead by example, not by force. My wife and I have tried to take the high road and make it known to my family that we believe that our daughter has the right to exercise her choice just as they do, even at a young age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message doesn’t seem to be getting across to them and we’re not sure how else to handle it than firmly and in a potentially hurtful manner.  While the specific scenario seems petty I fear that it’s a springboard for a perpetuation of similar events throughout our daughter’s life (and future children as well).  I’m hopeful that resolving this issue now will preempt similar challenges down the road.  I’m very interested in your thoughts on how I should approach this sensitive issue with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our house, at the dinner table, we take a moment to note something we are thankful for that day.  I consider it more of a moment of reflection and gratitude for what we have.  I also think it’s a good example for our daughter to having something to correlate with similar rituals, such as prayer. When friends and family are over we open the table to anyone to do what they prefer before a meal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve asked for respect from my family in a number of ways. We’ve tried to remain diplomatic and patient as they come around to our rather newly announced set of views.  It’s been over two years now since the day I opened up to them and most days I don’t feel like we’re ever going to gain they respect that I feel we deserve.  I’ve always been close with my family and never imagined a divide such as the one I’ve outlined in this letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts or tips would be very much appreciated!  Thanks again for your time and dedication to a very important topic.  It’s been extremely worthwhile for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denny&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Denny,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your daughter is a rope in a tug-of-war. After giving your parents more than two years to get adjusted to your views and to show basic consideration for your ways in your own home, the time for patient diplomacy is coming to an end.  This has devolved into a power struggle that focuses on your daughter, but it is really a struggle over you.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step by step, as a teen, as a college student, as a young married man and as a new father you have gone through the process of differentiation from your parents that all children must do to become truly independent adults.  The parents cling, and the children squirm. We all, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; do this dance of holding and breaking away, and in the end the parents must finally let go. It is the way humans develop. You finding your own path included your atheism.  Not all differentiated paths do, but yours did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the last stages of these struggles for self-definition are hard, and sometimes they are… harder.  In your case it seems that there will have to be a summit of some sort, to finally and definitively establish your relationship with them as adult-to-adult instead of parent-to-child.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you are correct in your assessment that this is just the beginning of their attempts to mold your daughter to their ways and beliefs.  Losing control of you, they will attempt to compensate vicariously through her. They will persist for years unless you put a firm and unequivocal end to it now. The longer it continues, the harder it will be to stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not surprised that the prayer rituals at your and their dinner tables have escalated for some time now. It is presently your parents’ only opportunity to impose, through your daughter, their religious will on you.  I don’t know if the actual incident was as aggressive as it sounds, but slapping or forcing her hands together into a praying position at your dinner table is way out of line.  It is an example and a poignant symbol of the kind of authoritarian control over children that you and your wife overcame, and which you want your daughter to never have to experience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand your counter-measures at subsequent meals of overtly instructing your daughter in front of them that she need not hold her hands together or bow her head, and simply remain respectfully quiet.  But I don’t suggest that you keep using that kind of demonstrative method.  All that was really to speak to them more than to her.   The main thing your daughter is noticing is the tension in the room. You don’t want to inadvertently use her as a pawn against them any more than let them use her as a pawn against you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is going to have to be a reckoning between you and your wife as a united front, and your parents, without your daughter present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before your speak to your parents, draw upon your group of supportive friends who have similar views and parenting methods to brainstorm specific things you want to say.  Write them down in the form of clear and concise demands, and even rehearse it, having someone play your parent’s roles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three main areas that you must firmly assert with them:  the end of their parenthood of you, the establishment of your adulthood with them, and the affirmation of your parenthood of your daughter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will always be your parents, but they can no longer &lt;em&gt;parent&lt;/em&gt; you.&lt;br&gt;
Their relationship with you must include the same respect for your boundaries that they would have with any adult. They may make suggestions, but they do not order you. If you decline their suggestion, they don’t perseverate.  You are in charge of your home, and they are your welcome guests as long as they respect your boundaries. It is reciprocal when you visit their home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and your wife are the girl’s parents. They are the grandparents. You outrank them. They interact with your daughter only in ways that you approve. You have the right to spell out what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior for anyone who is with your child. They must not try to use her against you, or try to covertly insinuate anything into her behind your back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your secular moments of mindful appreciation at your meals sound lovely.  In your home, you can be as accommodating as you wish to be, allowing others to do their ritual, but no one, &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; at your dinner table or anyone else’s, should be forced, coerced or obliged to participate.  Quietly sitting it out must be anyone’s option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denny, both you and your wife sound so gracious and amiable that I think the two of you can find a way to firmly present your clear and concise demands without being hurtful.  If your parents throw a fit or become petulant, then confront them on who is being childish and who is being adult.  Do not accept parenting from them and do not accept childish behavior either. Coolly demand, expect and deliver adult-to-adult behavior.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be tension, of course, and it will linger. So what? It’s already tense, but you’re being disrespectfully treated.  Tension with acceptable behavior is an improvement. Mixing in, as I always recommend, a lot of that closeness and caring that you have for them will help to relax things over time, reassuring them that you love them, showing that you’re a good father, a good husband and a good son.  And yet, without taking any of that away, you are also first and foremost, your own man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish all the best for your entire family.  Your parents have a gracious, loving and conscientious son.  Your daughter is a lucky kid, and when she, as she must, makes her final differentiation from you, I’m confident that she’ll have learned by example how to do it in a gracious, loving and conscientious way.&lt;/p&gt;

What really blew my mind was this graph:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8sY9bx8acNM/Sp7WsIJGN8I/AAAAAAAAAdM/b9F43JFzp3U/s400/Gervais_atheist+_trust_demographics.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:313px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8sY9bx8acNM/Sp7WsIJGN8I/AAAAAAAAAdM/b9F43JFzp3U/s400/Gervais_atheist+_trust_demographics.png" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The researchers gave subjects one of three passages to read before giving them a questionairre designed to gauge their level of distrust of atheists.  The first passage was a control, something about food or something.  The second was a passage from &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; saying that religion was nonsensical.  And the third -- the one denoted in the middle on the above graph -- was a little blurb talking about the increasing prevalence of atheism, including that 20% of the 18-25 year old demographic considered themselves nontheistic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The result is dramatic.  Simply being reminded that godless heathens are common was enough to virtually shatter -- at least temporarily -- people's prejudices against atheists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This makes it the Out Campaign all the more important.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you’ve heard all the uproar about President Obama’s speech today. A group of folks is very concerned about a speech of his today, because he’s talking to schoolkids. And hey, didn’t Hitler talk to kids…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10672924@N06/2569859537/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/obama_adults.jpg" alt="Obama- adults are talking"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s about as good as their logic gets. I wish I were kidding. &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/MediaResources/PreparedSchoolRemarks/"&gt;Read the transcript of Obama’s speech&lt;/a&gt;, and see if you can find the alarming parts where he calls for the formation of Brown Shirts, or the extermination of a group of humans, or the invasion of Poland. I must have missed it, instead seeing things like where he says, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve given a lot of speeches about education. And I’ve talked a lot about responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked about your teachers’ responsibility for inspiring you, and pushing you to learn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked about your parents’ responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and get your homework done, and don’t spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with that Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked a lot about your government’s responsibility for setting high standards, supporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that aren’t working where students aren’t getting the opportunities they deserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, and the best schools in the world – and none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities. Unless you show up to those schools; pay attention to those teachers; listen to your parents, grandparents and other adults; and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what I want to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call the Allies! Load the B-29s!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, read this whole speech. It’s inspiring, wonderful, and &lt;strong&gt;designed to inspire kids to stay in school, accept the responsibility of the education, learn things, and then go and and do good for the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a lunatic fringe in this country who will go ballistic about Obama no matter what he does; these are the ones saying the speech is indoctrinating children into accepting his socialist health care plan that will mutilate puppies and convert our elderly into Soylent Green. These people may be rabid racists, or simply mentally unbalanced, but we know for a rock solid fact that &lt;em&gt;these people are utterly, completely wrong&lt;/em&gt;. Whatever you want to call them, it’s clear they are so far from the norm of the American people that they can’t even see the horizon from where they are. Simply reading the speech transcript shows that simply and clearly. But it’s also a fact that this subset of the population will always be with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know what? &lt;em&gt;That doesn’t mean we have to give them a voice in the mainstream press.&lt;/em&gt; They have a right to their speech, but that doesn’t obligate anyone to pay attention to them, especially on the platform of national TV. I’m looking you right in the eye, Fox News. Not only do you give these people — factually wrong and provably so — a voice, you reiterate their comments and use your own voice to back them up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of thing mainstreams a view that is charitably called crazy. Again, &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/MediaResources/PreparedSchoolRemarks/"&gt;I urge you to read Obama’s actual speech&lt;/a&gt;. It’s awesome, and something every kid should see and hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet because &amp;quot;news&amp;quot; media like Fox have aired so much invective from the wildly fringe reality-polluting community, even mainstream folks are arguing that Obama’s speech is evil. I saw a news report yesterday about an elementary school in North Carolina where they didn’t air the speech because so many parents complained. I can’t help but wonder what they would would have said if George Bush had made this same speech. Of course, Bush never would have said something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment. You’ll need the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free. You’ll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe if he &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; said those words, the people I’m talking about would’ve complained anyway. Critical thinking skills? Ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I sound angry, then, yeah, &lt;em&gt;I am&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;I’m tired of ignorance held up as inspiration, where vicious anti-intellectualism is considered a positive trait, and where uninformed opinion is displayed as fact.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s killing any real debate in this country, where the system of government depends utterly on a well-informed public. When rampant idiocy is presented as reasonable discourse without any rebuttal, then we all suffer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need are government officials not afraid to talk &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYlZiWK2Iy8"&gt;like Barney Frank did&lt;/a&gt; to such a voice of lunacy. To reiterate, crackpots have a right to air their diseased notions, just as we have the right to tear those ideas to shred when they do. More than that, &lt;em&gt;the news media have a responsibility to do so&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me leave you with this revolutionary and dangerous notion from President Obama:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do that every day. Asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of strength. It shows you have the courage to admit when you don’t know something, and to learn something new. So find an adult you trust – a parent, grandparent or teacher; a coach or counselor – and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add that we all need to not be afraid to speak out against nonsense and to call out willful ignorance when we see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never give up. Never back down against evil. Never tire, because this struggle will be eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Specifically, I believe that biodiversity is a good thing and that we have been rapacious in our treatment of the environment, although I think the environmental movement has greatly exaggerated our condition and that the environment is a lot more resilient than most environmentalists give it credit for. I don’t mind eating cows and fish, but dolphins and whales have big brains and they’re cool, so I don’t think we should kill them. I drive an SUV because I haul around bicycles, books, and dogs, but as soon as there is a bigger hybrid, I’ll buy it. And although I am a libertarian heterosexual who is about as unpink (in both meanings) as you can get, I believe people should have an equal opportunity to be unequal. As for evolution, it happened. Deal with it.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why the God question is so interdigitated with political and economic issues, but it is. It shouldn’t be. It’s okay to be a liberal Christian or a conservative atheist. I am a fiscal conservative and a social liberal. I don’t think there is a God, or any sort of anthropomorphic being who needs to be worshipped, who listens to prayers, who keeps a moral scoreboard that will be settled in the end, or who cares one iota about who wins the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why what we do in this life matters so much — and why how we treat others in the here and now is more important than how they might be treated in some hereafter that may or may not exist. If we knew for certain that there is an afterlife, we wouldn’t have great debates about it, and philosophers wouldn’t have spilled all that ink over the millennia wrangling over it. Since we don’t know, it makes more sense to assume there is no God and no afterlife, and act accordingly. That is, act as if what we do matters &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. That way, we’ll think about the consequences of what we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sick and tired of politicians, and just about everyone else, kowtowing to the religious right’s hypersensitivities and politically correct “tolerance” for diversities of belief — as long as one believes in God — any God will do, except the God who promises virgins in the next life to pilots who fly planes into buildings. Those of us who do not believe in god have had enough of this rhetoric. This is America. We are supposed to be good and do the right thing, not because it will make us rich, get us saved, or reward us in the next life, but because people have value in and of themselves, and because it will make us all better off, individually and collectively. It says so, right there in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights — products of a secular eighteenth-century Enlightenment movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion and politics should be treated as separate entities. Religion is private and politics is public. If you want more religion, go to church. If you want more politics, go to the capitol. Don’t go to church to politic, and don’t go to the capitol to preach. That’s a non-overlapping magisterium I can live with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why”? Why are you interested in biology? What intrigued you so much that you would spend time learning about RNA – DNA – and genetics?? (and other “sciency” stuff like that)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is one of those times I will resort to a somewhat narrative approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, (4 or 5, I suppose) I was utterly fascinated by technology. I would disassemble things (much to my father’s displeasure) just to see how they worked. This included a lawnmower engine, several remote controls, our first computer, a television (very dangerous in hindsight), and a printer (one of those noisy dot-matrix ones). I was always interested in figuring out how things worked. By the time I was in sixth grade, I became (as most children are) interested in marine animals, but not in the typical sense of wanting to know more about them. I had observed that many students were interested in them; “them” being limited to sharks, penguins, cetaceans, and pinnipeds. I was interested in why people found them so fascinating. Why didn’t they think of jellyfish, sea snakes, and gulls to be just as interesting? At about this time, I began to investigate the opinions people had of sharks and dolphins and quite accidentally stumbled across how people tended to anthropomorphize animals. “Sharks are vicious hunters” adults would always say to me; those my age would just say “they’re cool” as if “cool” is some objective property any organism may have. It is difficult to know if the adults were trying to communicate with a child, so they would try to frame this in terms I understood or of they actually thought this themselves. (I remain interested in how people perceive the world through the present day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash forward my senior year of high school. I decided to enlist in the Air Force (i.e. “Chair Force”) but this did not go so well as I was diagnosed a few months into it with what was thought to be an arrhythmia known as &lt;a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4785"&gt;Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, and thus was discharged. Following this, I enrolled in a local &lt;a href="http://lsue.edu/"&gt;two-year college&lt;/a&gt; (since the deadline for the major universities had long since passed) and enrolled in the pre-med program there. Like many other students, I “wanted to be a doctor.” During the course of this, however, I became intrigued with the specific research being done in oncology and neurology. The former leading to my interest in reptiles and amphibians due to a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12881036"&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Francis Markland of the Keck School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snake venom protein that effects cancer. This is really interesting, what other novel proteins exist in so-called “poisonous” snakes. (Note: venomous snakes are not poisonous, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrobates"&gt;Dendrobates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are poisonous) The venom and toxins produced by these animals obviously interrupt a metabolic or physiological system somehow. We must be able to use them to learn SOMETHING from them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, it dawned on me; while most physicians use what has been learned in research, the really cutting edge discoveries concerning life isn’t done with humans (most of the time; think &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Brandt_%28physician%29"&gt;Karl Brandt&lt;/a&gt;) but with model species like yeast, mice, rats, flies, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish"&gt;zebrafish&lt;/a&gt;. During the course of my studies, I learned that basic research into biology is needed before we have any chance of understanding many of the diseases and afflictions humans suffer from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding what makes organisms work can really improve the lives of people around the world. Modern evolutionary insights have given us the knowledge that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; organisms are related either by descent or, at the very least, lateral gene transfer. The more we understand other organisms, the more we will, ultimately, understand ourselves, even if that sometimes provides unflattering descriptions of what it means to be “human.” After all, we so frequently see other organisms to be anthropomorphic due to our own evolutionary history, perhaps there is a bit more of them in us than we would like to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around my junior year of college, I decided to begin exploring genetics and realized how much more there really was to learn. We have only scratched the surface of the role of genetics in developmental biology. There seem to be more questions than answers even though we have answered so much. It seemed I could delve into the recent findings of genetics and never see the other side. The findings in this field hold substantial implications for all of us and can potentially shed light on many other aspects of biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose, ultimately, I cannot give a specific reason why I became interested in biology aside from following the path my interests led me during the course of my studies.&lt;/p&gt;

Pete Stark&lt;/strong&gt; to become the first openly nontheistic member of congress was a big step for our visibility.  But while that was part of a top-down approach, the bottom-up strategy is vital too.  As there are more and more of us in the country, our voice and our presence will be stronger and more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And later in life I’m totally going to take credit.  I’ll tell my children that my hard work paid off.  Thank you all for making me look good to my future kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/cityregion/story/783014.html"&gt;Here’s a key to that success&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Researchers once observed a familiar pattern of religious disaffiliation among young  adults, who then would reaffiliate later on, said Darren E. Sherkat, a sociologist at Southern  Illinois University in Carbondale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that pattern is breaking down, said Sherkat, who analyzes data from the General Social  Surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing greater stability of non-affiliation, and we’re also seeing greater numbers  of parents raising their children without affiliation, which was really quite rare in earlier  generations,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s often the pessimistic assumption in the movement that most of the secular young adults become religious when they get older – usually when they have kids themselves.  But if recent studies are any guide, the trends are changing in our direction, and our growth is more stable than before.&lt;br&gt;

One of botany’s lesser known pioneers, Goethe actually wrote a visionary essay about plants in 1790, which can be summed up in his motto, “All is leaf.” Scientists who are studying the evolution of flowers today hear the echoes of his words.

According to the article, University students who were insulted while seated exhibited neural activity consonant with &amp;quot;approach motivation&amp;quot;, which describes to desire to approach and explore. This activity appeared absent in a control group insulted while lying down. Eddie Harmon-Jones, a cognitive scientist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, interprets this as suggesting that one might be more inclined to attack if one were in the upright state, whereas while lying down we may be more inclined to brood....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I'm still years from the age when people get academic jobs in my discipline, 41, but anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had two experiences that opened my eyes to the fact that I am now an archaeological dad. By that I mean that there are at least two fields where work I once did is no longer the &lt;i&gt;Stand der Forschung&lt;/i&gt;, but where vigorous new studies refer to and build upon my old stuff. I am a member of the parental generation in Swedish archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1992, about the time I turned 20, I finished an MA thesis about burnt mounds, weird Bronze Age structures consisting of fire-cracked stone mixed with apparent household garbage and often burials. It was &lt;a href="http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1990talet/1994_083.pdf"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Fornvännen&lt;/i&gt; two years later (and that contact with the journal's editors became &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/ten_years_as_an_editor.php"&gt;a life-changer&lt;/a&gt; for me). The title was "Burnt mounds with burials in the easternmost part of the Lake Mälaren area".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm the journal's managing editor. Yesterday I started copy-editing Anna-Sara Noge's contribution to the up-coming winter issue. Her paper (based on &lt;a href="http://www.arkeologi.uu.se/ark/education/magister/Magisteruppsatser/noge.pdf"&gt;this MA thesis&lt;/a&gt; of hers) is titled "Burnt mounds containing human bones in the region north of Lake Mälaren". Where I had only anonymous bone concentrations in burnt mounds, she has complete osteological evaluations of all bones from a large number of mounds. She brings new data to the question why on Earth those Bronze Age weirdos were burying people in garbage heaps. And she agrees with what my friend Lars Lundqvist wrote in 1991 and I wrote after him: the modern category of "garbage" probably isn't relevant when studying the society of Bronze Age Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1993 I spent most of the fieldwork season working on Magnus Artursson's excavation of Bollbacken, a Middle Neolithic seal hunting site of the Pitted Ware culture near Västerås. As these sites go, it had an uncommonly landward location inside the great Baltic bay formed by the Lake Mälaren basin at the time. We found lots of post-supported trapezoid hut foundations, and I'm proud to say that as I digitised all the field plans over the following winter, I actually identified most of those huts myself since nobody had been able to see the big picture while we were digging. We also found a mortuary building which I dug together with Claes Hadevik, a number of Pitted Ware cremation graves (which were almost unheard of before Bollbacken), a Pre-Roman Iron Age cremation urn cemetery, and a single 7th century grave which was the sort of thing we had originally expected to dig. (We were actually called the "grave group" at the start of the season.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I had already decided to write my PhD thesis about Late Iron Age matters, so I didn't ask to be given any writing duties on the Bollbacken archive report. In fact, I didn't trust anyone else on the team to organise and register all the finds to a sufficient level of &lt;i&gt;Ordnung&lt;/i&gt;, so I spent that winter as our finds and digitising man. Umm, kid, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yesterday I received &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/08/breaking_and_making_bodies_and.php"&gt;Åsa M. Larsson's PhD thesis&lt;/a&gt;. She wasn't on the Bollbacken dig, but a big chunk of her book is an in-depth study of the cremation burials and associated structures from Bollbacken! I can't wait to read it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Noge nor Larsson is anywhere near young enough to be my daughter, and I certainly don't claim any paternal authority in those two fields that I've been away from for so long. (I'm actually preparing to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/03/back_to_the_bronze_age_again.php"&gt;return to Bronze Age studies&lt;/a&gt; as a humble student.) But I'm very proud to see that my brain babies are having babies of their own now. That proves to me that the work I put in back in the day was worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/09/archaeological_fatherhood.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/POu5r1F4j9c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252422704811"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=17687">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/326682dffd1db385</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Africa"/><category term="AIDS"/><category term="charity"/><title type="html">African Entrepreneurs</title><published>2009-09-08T14:55:17Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T14:55:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/african-entrepreneurs/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The problems facing developing countries, in Africa and elsewhere, are overwhelming in their magnitude and complexity.

For instance, when God helped you win that football game, how do you know it isn't part of His grand plan to eventually make the riches go to your head so you wind up ODing on drugs as punishment for masturbating too much as a teenager?  So don't thank Him.  His motives are ineffable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, 1GOD1JESUS makes a similar point in a much more "articulate" manner:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7UYE66hqw_s%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=440&amp;amp;height=265" width="440" height="265"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-7627882912782679751?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252420701615"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=4736">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f87f5d9dc02227d2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="accommodationism"/><category term="Eugenie Scott"/><title type="html">How many “ways of knowing” are there?</title><published>2009-09-08T12:56:19Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T12:56:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/how-many-ways-of-knowing-are-there/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve become rather ambivalent about Eugenie Scott — and, indeed, about some of the policies of the organization she heads, the National Center for Science Education.  On the one hand, Scott is a really nice person (I used to count her as a friend, though I’m not sure she feels that way about me now!), and, more important, she and the NCSE have done absolutely terrific — and award-winning — work battling creeping creationism in America.  The NCSE’s intercession in the Dover intelligent-design trial, for example, was critical in the victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Scott also travels around giving strongly accommodationist talks, reflecting the NCSE’s policy that science and religion, when properly conceived, are harmonious.  This is, of course, the NOMA stance.  The NCSE has made a tactical decision that selling evolution is most efficacious if you proclaim — never mind what you really &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; — that religion and science are compatible, occupying their own magisteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;Metamagician and the Hellfire Club&lt;/em&gt;, Russell Blackford &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/09/eugenie-scotts-speech-at-dragoncon.html"&gt;reports on a talk&lt;/a&gt; Scott gave yesterday at Dragon*Con.  To be fair, Blackford didn’t take notes, and I haven’t heard the talk.  But if his memory is accurate, Scott told the audience that there are many valid “ways of knowing” beyond science.  As Russell reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . In any event, it was the first part of the speech that worried me. This emphasised the claim that science (Scott said “science”, not “reason”) is only one way of knowing. The others that she mentioned were personal insight and authority (I don’t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; she was saying that these three are the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; “ways of knowing”). She appeared to be happy to count all sorts of ideas gained from personal insight, perhaps assisted by rituals or drugs, as “knowledge”, which is rather odd, since knowledge is, at the least, &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; belief. She counted revelation, including the words of holy books, as a sub-set of authority, and explained that the problem is when empirical claims are based on revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott also said that science is a limited way of knowing because it can only investigate natural phenomena and can only offer natural explanations for them, and so cannot deal with supernatural claims. She offered no argument for this claim. Indeed, she gave an example of scientific study of truth claims that appeared to refute it. This was a description of a controlled experiment to see whether people really can perform better than chance at dowsing for water. Clearly, if the claim “I can perform better than chance at dowsing for water” is refuted by scientific investigation, it follows, &lt;em&gt;a fortiori&lt;/em&gt;, that the claim “I can perform better than chance at dowsing for water by using supernatural means” is also refuted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear dear dear.  Russell, I, and others have addressed the idea of science and the supernatural many times before (see &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/05/nas-on-compatibility-of-science-and.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/11/eugenie-scott-dissembles-about-accommodationism/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/06/23/science-and-religion-are-not-compatible/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example), dispelling the soothing idea that “science has nothing to say about the supernatural.”  That is, of course, hogwash.  Science has plenty to say about the Shroud of Turin, whether faith healing works, whether prayer works, whether God seems to be both beneficent and omnipotent, world without end.  Science can, as we’ve repeated endlessly, address &lt;em&gt;specific claims about the supernatural&lt;/em&gt;, though it’s impotent before the idea that behind it all is a hands-off, deistic Transcendent Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott admits that there is a problem when empirical claims are based on revelation, but seems completely unaware that empirical claims derived from revelation &lt;em&gt;form the basis of nearly every faith&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am absolutely sure that Scott is aware of these arguments. But she ignores them, and goes around spreading the same old accommodationism.  In this sense she’s like the Twins: she’s heard the counterarguments, but not only has she failed to answer them, she &lt;em&gt;ignores&lt;/em&gt; them. What is even more distressing is that Scott is an atheist, so for her, at least, there are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; supernatural ways of knowing.  Does she think she’s missing out on a kind of knowledge that only the faithful have? I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for “ways of knowing,” my response is always, “&lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; do you find out? &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; do you “know”?  And how would you know if you were &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;? Was Jesus the son of God?  Christians’ “way of knowing” tells them, “Yes, of course!” But Islamic “ways of knowing” say, “No, of course not, and you’ll burn in hell if you believe that.”  Revelation, dogma, and scripture are not in fact ways of knowing; they are &lt;em&gt;ways of believing&lt;/em&gt;.  There are no “truths” that religion can produce which are independent of truths derived from secular reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his usual acumen, Russell dissects the problem in detail.  Read his post.  And I agree completely with his conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not suggesting that the NCSE enlarge its remit to attack religion more generally. That is not its &lt;em&gt;raison d’etre&lt;/em&gt; at all. But it can be &lt;em&gt;neutral&lt;/em&gt; about such questions as whether science undermines a large amount of religious thinking, far beyond the claims of creationism and Intelligent Design. It can stop relying on an unnecessarily narrow (and very dubious) view of scientific epistemology, designed to leave as much authority with religion as possible. It can stop selling Gould’s intellectually bankrupt principle of Non-Overlapping Magisteria on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s perfectly clear by now that neither Scott nor the NCSE will ever deal with the ideas that 1) the other “ways of knowing” don’t produce truth, 2) science can indeed address the supernatural, at least some aspects of it, and 3) a lot of people DO NOT find science and faith compatible. By enabling superstition, and giving credibility to irrationality, Scott and the NCSE’s NOMA-ism will, I think, hamper the evolution of a rational America.  Yes, we’re on their side vis-a-vis creationism, and yes, I’ll be more than glad to join hands with them in fighting that scourge of rationality.   But so long as our allies keep spouting half-truths and untruths about the relationship between science and religion, we’ll keep calling them to task.&lt;/p&gt;

They have been cleaned up and mounted in museums and described in papers and monographs. The way this is all done has evolved over time - the early techniques were pretty crude compared to what palaeontologists do today. One of the important techniques is actually quite simple: making measurements of bones. And yes, many such bones have been measured and the measurements reported in the literature. And that literature is scattered all over the place in many different formats in many different journals. Nobody has put all the measurements in one place where one could do statistics with the numbers and perhaps learn something from the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href="http://openpaleo.blogspot.com/2009/09/big-and-crazy-announcement.html" title=""&gt;Andy Farke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://svpow.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/ornithischian-limb-bone-project-of-the-decade/" title=""&gt;Matt Wedel and Mike Taylor&lt;/a&gt; want to do just that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We want to put together a paper on the multiple independent transitions from bipedality to quadrupedality in ornithischians, and we want to involve everyone who's interested in helping out.  We'll get to the details later, but the basic idea is to amass a huge database of measurements of the limb bones of ornithischian dinosaurs, to which we can apply various statistical techniques.  Hopefully we'll figure out how these transitions happened -- for example, whether ceratopsians, thyreophorans and ornithopods all made it in the same way or differently.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in order to accomplish this enormous project, they founded the &lt;a href="http://opendino.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Open Dinosaur Project&lt;/a&gt; - you can be a co-author of the resulting paper if you contribute! What is the idea? To crowdsource the effort. Published measurements need to be all copied into a single place for analysis. Bones not yet measured as well - if you are at a museum or university or in some other ways have access to the fossils, you can take your measuring tools and go down to the vaults and send in the numbers. They explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Constructing the Database&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge, virtually untapped resource of skeletal measurements resides in the published scientific literature. In order to put these measurements to good use, it is necessary to place the data into a form that can be analyzed mathematically. Essentially, we aim to construct a giant spreadsheet with as many measurements for ornithischian dinosaur limb bones as possible. For simplicity, we will focus on bone lengths and maximum diameters along the shaft. From the forelimb, we will look at the scapula, coracoid, sternal plates, humerus, radius, ulna, and manus ("hand"). Within the hind limb, we will look at the femur, tibia, fibula, and pes ("foot").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the old days, this would require a lot of time in the library stacks. Some aspects of the project may still require this. But, a number of scientific papers are now freely available to the general public! So, anyone with an internet connection can help out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who Can Participate?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone! We do not care about your age, education, previous paleontological experience, or geographic location. You don't have to be a professional paleontologist - just a person who is willing to act professionally in the accurate and ethical collection, analysis, and interpretation of real scientific data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Can I Do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's simple! Just locate the necessary scientific papers, and start entering data into our spreadsheet. If you have access to real specimens, you may enter these data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Do I Get Out of This?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things - 1) the thrill of participating in real scientific research; and 2) an opportunity for authorship on a scientific paper. Yes, you read that correctly. All contributors to the database are given the option of joining us as authors for the final published paper. If you opt out of authorship, you will still be listed in the acknowledgments (unless you request otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Do I Sign Up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply drop an email to project head Andy Farke - andrew.farke@gmail.com - with your name and preferred email address. If you have an institutional affiliation, please include that also. . .but remember that a formal academic affiliation is not required! In all aspects of the project, we ask that you use your real name rather than an on-line handle or other pseudonym. This is important both for personal accountability, as well as a professional standard. We may not all be professionals, but we will certainly conduct ourselves professionally!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Help! I'm Lost!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never fear. . .we're going to publish a series of tutorials in the next few days outlining how to search for scientific literature, what measurements to look for, and other important introductory pieces for those new at the research game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you can, participate. And if the analysis uncovers a new species - there's a little paper right there as well. And if the project works well for ornithischians, then future projects may turn to theropods or whatever else strikes the paaleontologists' fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also nice - the resulting paper(s) will be published in Open Access venues. I am salivating at the prospect of seeing these things published in PLoS ONE and joining the fast-growing &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pone.c01.i02" title=""&gt;Paleontology Collection&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/now_this_is_open_science_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/M0ZwBo1_8S0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252420615565"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/who_will_go_to_antarctica.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb67b65434c2d335</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Who will go to Antarctica?</title><published>2009-09-08T14:16:37Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T14:16:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/20yOMpfm7UA/who_will_go_to_antarctica.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/who_will_go_to_antarctica.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;And blog from there? For the Quark expedition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voting has been going on for quite a while now, but now we are in the final stretch. There are several hundred contestants, but only the top few vote-getters have a chance (they also need to pass an in-person interview). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voting is well controlled - it requires a simple registration - so it is not possible to game the system (too much). It is also possible to change your vote, so if you have already voted for someone who now has no chance, you may want to switch to someone who has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several people at the top are good (including Danielle Lee!), but the first three are probably the only ones with a realistic chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first place is some Portuguese radio DJ. He must not be that popular with his listeners if even with a radio station broadcasting his pleas for his audience to vote, he only accumulated &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/view/102" title=""&gt;5952 Votes&lt;/a&gt; so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second place is &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/view/356" title=""&gt;some guy&lt;/a&gt; whose claim to fame is family relationship with some celebrity - does his last name ring a bell? He's got 1858 Votes to date via his celebrity network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/view/152" title=""&gt;the third place is&lt;/a&gt; our own &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/" title=""&gt;Grrrlscientist&lt;/a&gt; the top vote-getting real, true, nature/science blogger who can actually know what to look for and how to write about what she sees in Antarctica. Right now she has 1753 votes. No radio station, no celebrity fan-club, just some blog readers. But she can have more....if you &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/view/152" title=""&gt;vote now&lt;/a&gt; and tell all your friends to do the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/who_will_go_to_antarctica.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/20yOMpfm7UA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252420607741"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/time-for-my-first-coffee-busy/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30f87eb40eacc14f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">time for my first coffee, busy…</title><published>2009-09-08T14:30:39Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T14:30:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/time-for-my-first-coffee-busy/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;time for my first coffee, busy first day back at !mcgill&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252420347673"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/its_scarcely_worth_it_to_phary.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e03a5695c5dbd12</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">It's scarcely worth it to pharyngulate a Scandinavian poll</title><published>2009-09-08T14:06:57Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T14:06:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/uGVIS1e5icc/its_scarcely_worth_it_to_phary.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/its_scarcely_worth_it_to_phary.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A group of prominent Swedes have come out with a &lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=da&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;u=http://politiken.dk/debat/article782292.ece"&gt;manifesto decrying the influence of religion in the world&lt;/a&gt; — which is great, but I do wonder why every time I read about famous Swedes, at least one of them has to be a former member of ABBA. It&amp;#39;s a fine statement that &lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://politiken.dk/debat/article782295.ece&amp;amp;sl=da&amp;amp;tl=en"&gt;promotes humanism as the only valid source of morality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a Danish newspaper ran a poll asking if its readers agree. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://politiken.dk/debat/article782292.ece#poll782414"&gt;Tolv fremtrædende svenskere blæser i manifest til kamp mod religioner, som de mener fylder alt for meget i samfundet. Er du enig?&lt;/a&gt; (Twelve prominent Swedes fan of manifesto to fight against religions that they feel fills too much of society. Do you agree?)&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Ja (Yes)
90%
&lt;br&gt;
Nej (No)
9%
 &lt;br&gt;
Ved ikke (Don't know)
2%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so &lt;i&gt;superfluous&lt;/i&gt;. Sure, go ahead, contribute to the landslide. It would be very pleasant to live in Denmark, except that their complicated language always fills me with confusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/its_scarcely_worth_it_to_phary.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/uGVIS1e5icc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252420347673"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/sayi_have_a_suit_just_like_tha.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/01955ab8ed7d2283</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Art"/><title type="html">Say…I have a suit just like that</title><published>2009-09-08T13:34:12Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T13:34:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/GGJxN55c1RI/sayi_have_a_suit_just_like_tha.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/sayi_have_a_suit_just_like_tha.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I never wear it to class, though.

Instead, the entire thing was filmed on a soundstage, most likely in New Mexico.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is the only logical interpretation of the numerous inconsistencies in the grainy, 40-year-old footage,&amp;quot; Armstrong added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More at the link.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pretty funny.  Except that journalists and editors at a couple of Bangladeshi newspapers thought The Onion was a real news site, and the Armstrong interview was real. They &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8237558.stm"&gt;re-published the story as though it were fact&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We thought it was true so we printed it without checking,&amp;quot; associate editor Hasanuzzuman Khan told the AFP news agency. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We didn&amp;#39;t know the Onion was not a real news site.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hey, I’ve got a couple of other real news sites these newspapers could use as a source for their articles.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org/"&gt;The Landover Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aunix.net.au/ttguy/"&gt;The Society for DNA Free Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dhmo.org/"&gt;Dihydrogen Monoxide Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vetpath.co.uk/voodoo/"&gt;The British Veterinary Voodoo Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I guess the moral is always check your sources.  And yes, I did check &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6138352/Bangladeshi-newspapers-duped-by-The-Onions-spoof-Moon-landing-story.html"&gt;a couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j6KS46abrFjwE7YYu7yASsgfWhKQ"&gt;other sources&lt;/a&gt; before I wrote this post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252419331684"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/dr_mark_hyman_mangles_autism_science_on-.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a08ea6c0af7f2ff7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Dr. Mark Hyman mangles autism science on--where else?--The Huffington Post</title><published>2009-09-08T12:30:59Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T12:30:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/X49kXKJreMA/dr_mark_hyman_mangles_autism_science_on-.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/dr_mark_hyman_mangles_autism_science_on-.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark Hyman is famous as the "founder" of a form of woo known as "functional medicine." This new form of woo is...well, I'm not sure what it is, and neither are Wally Sampson (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=556"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=571"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=622"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=899"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). Suffice it to say that it appears to be a serious grab bag of various forms of woo that, according to Dr. Hyman's website itself, involve &lt;a href="http://www.drhyman.com/7-Keys-Lesson1.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;environmental inputs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.drhyman.com/7-Keys-Lesson2.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.drhyman.com/7-Keys-Lesson3.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.drhyman.com/7-Keys-Lesson4.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;gut &amp;amp; digestive health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.drhyman.com/7-Keys-Lesson5.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;detoxification&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.drhyman.com/7-Keys-Lesson6.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;energy/mitochondria/oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, "&lt;a href="http://www.drhyman.com/7-Keys-Lesson7.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;mind-body&lt;/a&gt;," whatever that means. No woo would be complete without mind-body, you know. Actually, no self-respecting woo would leave out "detoxification," either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, "functional medicine" is such a--shall we say?--"target-rich" environment that I could do a number of posts about functional medicine in general and Dr. Hyman in particular. Having discovered his "Ultrawellness" &lt;a href="http://www.drhyman.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ultrawellness.com/blog/" rel="nofollow"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://feeds.ultrawellness.com/uw/drhyman/audio" rel="nofollow"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, I can see that Dr. Hyman will be the gift that keeps on giving, at least as far as blog material goes. It's only a wonder that I haven't really delved into the serious, serious woo that Dr. Hyman lays down on a regular basis before. Learning that, it now depresses me even more that Dr. Hyman is one of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php"&gt;Four Horsemen of the Woo-pocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, as I have dubbed the four woo-loving physicians whom Senator Tom Harkin invited to testify in front of his Senate committee as a as a "two-fer" from their concurrent engagement at the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=350"&gt;Institute of Medicine and Bravewell Collaborative woo-fest&lt;/a&gt; being held on the same days. The three physicians in addition to Dr. Hyman physicians included &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/Weil.pdf"&gt;Dr. Andy Weil, Director, Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Arizona, Vail, AZ&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/Ornish.pdf"&gt;Dr. Dean Ornish, Founder and President, Preventive Medicine Research Institute, Sausalito, CA&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/Oz.pdf"&gt;Dr. Mehmet C. Oz, Director, Cardiovascular Institute and Complementary Medicine Program, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY&lt;/a&gt;. Of the four, thanks to "functional medicine," Dr. Hyman is by far the most quacktastic of the four, and that's why I'm depressed. That such a woo-meister could be called to testify in front of the Senate as though he were a respectable academic physician boggles my mind, which is why I will be turning my sights on Ultrawellness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Dr. Hyman has popped up on the one web commentary outlet where he should truly feel at home, namely &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/dr_mark_hyman_mangles_autism_science_on-.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/dr_mark_hyman_mangles_autism_science_on-.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/X49kXKJreMA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252418876100"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9167">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/754c7104d678701f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 9.8</title><published>2009-09-08T13:30:19Z</published><updated>2009-09-08T13:30:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/skepchick-quickies-9-8/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

No big deal - but why did I switch pharmacies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I used to pick up my prescription at the pharmacy in the grocery store where I shop. Easy, convenient, and if you phoned it in they gave you a coupon.

The technology to detect these distant objects has been increasing recently. There are two primary methods for detecting exoplanets: One method is to look for the wobble in the parent star caused by the gravity of the planet. The planet and its star revolve around their center of gravity, which will not be in the dead center of the star itself, but off center, causing a wobble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin-left:5px" title="earth-saturn-s" src="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/earth-saturn-s.bmp" alt="earth-saturn-s" width="192" height="197"&gt;The second method is called the transit method in which we look for alterations in the amount of light we can see from a star because of a planet that moves in front of it.  This requires that the view of this system from the earth is roughly in the plane the planet is orbiting – the planet has to move in front of (transit) the star from our perspective. The new &lt;a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/"&gt;Kepler telescope&lt;/a&gt; is designed to detect light from many stars with sufficient sensitivity that it can find small (earth-size) planetary transits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the talk about exoplanets, there has been, until now, little talk of exomoons – moons around planets around other stars. Until Kepler it has simply not been possible to detect exomoons. David Kipping of University College London has now&lt;a href="http://fr.arxiv.org/abs/0810.2243"&gt; published a paper&lt;/a&gt; in which he says that this is feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exciting. While the whole exoplanet exercise is fascinating and is giving us the ability to have some data about the constitution of other stellar systems, interest is highest in earth-like planets – planets around the same size and temperature as earth, specifically able to have liquid water. This, of course, is because we want to know how many planets out there might be capable of harboring life. This will enable us to get a better handle on at least one component of the famous &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation"&gt;Drake equation&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to calculate the likely number of alien civilizations out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely, however, that earth-sized moons of larger gas giants could have conditions suitable for organic life. Even smaller moons could be candidates. In our own system, Jupiter’s moon Europa likely has a liquid water ocean under its surface ice crust – complete with alien creatures swimming around. In fact, life-bearing moons may vastly outnumber life-bearing planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kipping thinks that Kepler is  sensitive enough to detect the wobble in a large and light planet (like Saturn) caused by an earth-sized moon. We are just gearing up for the flood of new exoplanets Kepler will discover over the coming years, and now Kipping adds exomoons to the buffet (how’s that for mixing metaphors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kepler has already passed a test of its ability to detect exoplanets (by detecting planets we already knew were there). At present Kipping’s paper just deals with the mathematical plausibility of exomoons. We don’t know yet of any exomoons so this ability cannot be tested as it was for detecting exoplanets. It seems that we just have to wait and see – when Kepler detects new explanets will their transits wobble due to the presence of large moons. NASA could also point Kepler at known exoplanets of a size and mass that would make them good candidates for detecting their moons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this scheme works, then the number of possible candidates for exobodies that might contain life that we detect in the near future may significantly increase. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;

The Victorians thought they lived entirely on air; a common &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu"&gt;Zulu&lt;/a&gt; superstition is that they're evil (as I confirmed for myself a while back when I tried to show a chameleon I had caught to our gardener); and, more recently, I've been hearing a lot of people say chameleon color changing has nothing to do with camouflage. Even &lt;i&gt;Cracked&lt;/i&gt; has got in on the act with an article on &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.cracked.com/article/105_the-6-most-frequently-quoted-bullshit-animal-facts_p2"&gt;bullshit animals facts&lt;/a&gt;", which argues a chameleon's color is determined largely by its mood. I call bullshit on their bullshit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks to frequent childhood visits to a family farm, I've had lots of encounters with these amazing critters and I've seen them change color to blend in with their environment &lt;i&gt;with my own eyes&lt;/i&gt;. Not particularly good evidence, I hear you say. Agreed, so I spent 2 minutes on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chameleon"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, followed a link, and found &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13944-chameleons-finetune-camouflage-to-predators-vision.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt; piece, about &lt;a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/4/326.full"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; study in &lt;i&gt;Biology Letters&lt;/i&gt;. And guess what? At least one species of chameleon, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%27s_Dwarf_Chamaeleon"&gt;Smith's dwarf chameleon&lt;/a&gt; (which, incidentally, is South African), does change color to camouflage itself from predators. The paper, "&lt;a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/4/326.full"&gt;Predator-specific camouflage in chameleons&lt;/a&gt;" by Stuart-Fox &lt;i&gt;et. al.,&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated in several behavioral trials that these chameleons engage in background matching when presented with model predators. In other words, these guys do their best to blend in with their environment when they encounter things that want to eat them. (You can see a clear example of a chameleon matching its background in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;this YouTube clip&lt;/a&gt; [Note: James informs me in the comments that this &lt;a href="http://shapeandcolour.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/ray-ban-never-hide-super-chameleon/"&gt;might be fake&lt;/a&gt;]).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So why do people think chameleon camouflage is a myth? It seems &lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060025"&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; (also by Stuart-Fox) that concluded color changing evolved for social signalling has been misinterpreted. The conclusion of this second paper was: &amp;quot;our results suggest that selection for conspicuous social signals drives the evolution of colour change in this system, supporting the view that transitory display traits should be under strong selection for signal detectability.&amp;quot; In other words, the primary evolutionary &amp;#39;function&amp;#39; of color changing in chameleons seems to be social signalling. But it does &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;follow from this that chameleons cannot also use color changing for crypsis -- the ability may have evolved for social signalling, but nothing stops it from being &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaptation"&gt;exapted&lt;/a&gt; for camouflage. It is such an obvious evolutionary trick that I'm surprised anyone interpreted Stuart-Fox &lt;i&gt;et. al. &lt;/i&gt;second paper in this way. If you already have a visual system (to detect background color), you can already change color, you suffer predation and camouflage thus increases fitness, we should positively &lt;i&gt;expect &lt;/i&gt;exaptation for crypsis.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As I also pointed out on my &lt;a href="http://ionian-enchantment.blogspot.com/2009/09/silver-fox-domestication.html"&gt;fox domistication&lt;/a&gt; piece, I'm not a biologist so you should be especially skeptical of my opinions on this (though, I managed to &lt;a href="http://treethinkers.blogspot.com/2008/07/myth-busters-chameleons-are-natures.html"&gt;convince&lt;/a&gt; biologist Richard Glor over at &lt;i&gt;Dechronization&lt;/i&gt; that my interpretation is right). But still... At least some chameleons change their color to blend in with their environment. &lt;i&gt;Obviously&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;: I emailed Stuart-Fox and asked whether my take is correct. Here is the reply in part (my emphasis):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, your interpretation is correct. Colour change in chameleons &lt;i&gt;serves multiple current functions&lt;/i&gt; including camouflage (background matching), thermoregulation and communication (courtship and male-male contests). But we need to distinguish current functions from the selective pressures driving the evolution of the abiltiy to change colours. Some species can change colours much more than others - the question I was trying to answer is why such variation? And it seems that sexual selection for communication (signalling) is the most important selective pressure because the species that change colour the most have the most conspicuous colour patterns that they use to communicate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;---------------------&lt;br&gt;

Their hypothesis for the rubber hand illusion was that vision has higher reliability and spatial acquity than proprioception, so the brain gives more weight to visual information. People would thus localize a body part to it's apparent visual location, particularly when the visible location falls within the possible range dictated by proprioception. Some support for this theory lies in the fact that placing the fake hand perpendicular to the real occluded hand destroys the illusion that the fake hand is one's own.Armel and Ramachandran  (2003) reported a closely related but bizarre illusion. The subject is made to place his or her real hand on a table and the hand is hidden from view. However, instead of stroking a fake rubber hand, the researchers simply stroked and tapped the table in precise synchrony for a minute. Astonishingly, subjects reported sensations arising from the table surface, despite the fact that it bears no physical resemblance to a hand. Whereas Botvinick and Cohen interpret their result in terms of resolving incongruities between visual versus proprioceptive location of the hand, Armel and Ramachandran's experiment would lead one to argue that the illusion arises mainly  from Bayesian logic of all perception; the brain's remarkable ability to detect statistical correlations in sensory inputs in constructing useful perceptual representations of the world, including one's own body. It is especially intriguing that the bizarre perceptual representation (assimilating the table into the body image) is resistant to the "top-down" knowledge of the absurdity of the situation!To measure the extent to which subjects incorporated the external objects into their body image, they were asked to rate the vividness of the illusion. The experimenters also recorded the skin conductance response (SCR), to provide an objective test of whether the table had indeed become informationally coupled with the subject's body image. If the external objects became integrated into the body's image, would they be aroused when the table (or a fake hand for that matter) was 'injured'?If a finger of the fake hand is bent backwards to seem painful, does the subject register an SCR? To what extent is the fake hand assimilated into the subject's body image? To address this, after ca. 2.5 minutes of the touching procedure, both the real and the fake fingers were lifted, but only the fake finger was bent backwards into a 'painful position'. SCR was recorded at this point and a free response description and intensity rating of the illusion were obtained. The control for this experiment was a 'delayed synchrony' condition wherein touch to the real and fake hands were identical, the only difference being, that the touch to the real hand was delivered 1 sec after the touch on the fake hand. Mean intensity and mean SCRs showed that subjects identified with the fake hand more in the condition where the touch was synchronized rather than the one where the touch was synchronized but delayed (see Fig. 1)Fig. 1: Mean Intensity ratings (gray bars) and SCR (black circles) in the first experiment where synchronous touch to the real hand was delayed by a second in the control condition. The error bars indicate one SEM (Adapted from Armel and Ramachandran, 2003)Would subjects still experience the illusion if the form of the external object was manipulated? To explore this, a barren table was stroked  and tapped in the same manner and in the same relative location (see Fig.2 ). Fig. 2: Form manipulation where subjects received the table condition (Adapted from Armel and Ramachandran, 2003)Band-aids were placed on both the real hand and the table and subjects were told that the band-aid would be pulled off the table but not off their real hands. At the end of the 2.5 min touching period, in lieu of pulling back a fake finger, the band-aid on the table was partially pulled off. In the control condition for this experiment, the real hand was made visible by removing the occluder. Subjects were instructed to look back and forth between their real hands and the table. Furthermore, the real hand and the location where the table was touched were close together so that they could be seen simultaneously even while looking at one or the other. The band-aid was pulled off the table while the subject viewed it. To ensure that the subject was only looking at the table, the experimenter occluded the subject's real finger at this time. In a comparison of the conditions in which the table and real hand were touched with the partition in place or removed, intensity ratings and SCR were significantly different (see Fig. 3). However, the same experiment (using a band-aid) carried out with a fake rubber hand in lieu of the table is more effective at inducing the illusion in terms of intensity ratings but only marginally so for SCR (see Fig. 3)Fig. 3: Mean Intensity ratings (gray bars) and SCR (black circles) in the second experiment where form of the external object was manipulated. The error bars indicate one SEM (Adapted from Armel and Ramachandran, 2003)Would subjects still experience the illusion if the form of the external object was manipulated? Each subject viewed touch to a fake hand in a 'realistic' location in one condition and then to a distant fake hand in another (se...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Even though it was a mixed marriage (she’s Indian and the guy is white), much of the wedding was culturally Indian.  Which means there will be dancing.  Not just mass dancing for everyone, like at a reception, but individual performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family friends thought it would be hilarious if the guys in our group &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/14/im-going-to-dance/"&gt;did something&lt;/a&gt; in honor of the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

The protein was identified 30 years ago and its gene (TP53) cloned soon thereafter. What&amp;#39;s not so widely known is just how complex the operation of p53 in protecting against cancer really is. And very recent research shows the complexity is even more than previously thought. However, the complexity is to be expected, because evolution doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;design&amp;quot; cellular mechanisms to work in a straightforward way. The mechanisms are simply the result of about a billion years of trial and error. Being pretty and elegant was not a criterion for success. Nature is &amp;quot;hairy&amp;quot;, knowing nothing of Occam&amp;#39;s Razor, and caring even less. Simplicity is for wimps.But one thing is clear: p53 plays a large role in preventing, or at least suppressing, the development of cancer. In many types of cancer, p53 is found to have mutations more than 50% of the time. Even if p53 isn&amp;#39;t mutated, cancer cells generally have other p53 abnormalities, such as low levels of the protein or the presence of various factors that interfere with its activity.Until the latest research, there have been two principal ways known in which p53 works against cancer, and several additional minor ways. The two main ways p53 has been known to act are binding to DNA as a transcription factor, and binding directly to certain proteins. And each of these mechanisms can lead to either of two main types of tumor suppression: apoptosis (cell death) and temporary or permanent suspension of the cell cycle, which is the process a cell goes through in order to divide and proliferate.P53 is primarily a transcription factor. In this role it is found in a cell nucleus and binds to various specific DNA gene promoter regions, in order to direct transcription of the associated gene – the first step in production of proteins from a gene.The proteins that are expressed as a result of this p53 activity can play a part in either apopotosis or cell cycle control (as well as other functions not directly related to cancer – see here, here, here). Which function is invoked depends on the type of signal that activates the p53. Among the possible conditions that may be signaled are detection of correctable or uncorrectable damage to DNA and detection of chromosome telomeres that are too short.In addition to binding to DNA as a transcription factor, p53 is also capable of binding directly to other proteins in order to control their behavior. Mainly these proteins are involved with apoptosis, such as members of the Bcl2 family. P53 itself is actually a family of proteins – there are at least 9 different RNA transcripts that can be derived from the TP53 gene. But one thing that each of these family members have in common is a segment, called the DNA binding domain. It is this part of the p53 that is capable of binding to either DNA or other proteins. (In general, a protein domain is a more-or-less self-sufficient component of a protein. Often the same domain appears in different members of a family of proteins.)One indication of the importance of this p53 domain is the fact that point mutations (errors involving only a single nucleotide pair) in the part of TP53 that code for the binding domain are the only type of point mutations of p53 that are commonly found in tumors. Errors that affect portions of p53 outside of the binding domain are not associated with cancer.There&amp;#39;s one more thing to note about p53&amp;#39;s role as a transcription factor. Namely, the RNA that is transcribed under the direction of p53 is not always messenger RNA (mRNA) that will eventually code for the production of a protein. P53 can also initiate the transcription of genes that code for microRNA (miRNA), which is a single-stranded RNA molecule that&amp;#39;s normally only 21 to 23 nucleotides in length. Over 500 different types of miRNA have been found in human cells.MicroRNA is never translated into a protein. Instead, miRNA molecules regulate the translation of messenger RNA for many different proteins (by binding with the mRNA to prevent translation). It has been known for some time that p53 acts as a transcription factor for the miRNA family known as miR-34. It has also been learned that among the proteins regulated by miR-34 are some found in pathways that lead to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. The net effect is that miR-34 has tumor-suppressing properties, so this is another way that p53, as a transcription factor, helps suppress tumors.Many other miRNA molecules, on the other hand, are found at high levels in cancer cells. Such miRNAs most likely inhibit expression of tumor suppressing genes, whose proteins might otherwise control cell proliferation or migration. We&amp;#39;ve discussed a number of miRNAs associated with cancer, mostly of the sort that promote cancer, here and here.Nevertheless, there are miRNAs besides miR-34 that have anti-cancer effects. Three in particular are miR-16-1, miR-143, and miR-145. It has been observed that these miRNAs, and several others, are found at higher levels in cells where p53 has been activated as a result of DNA damage. (Normally, p53 formed in non-cancer cells is either quickly degraded or else inhibited by certain proteins, especially MDM2, so as not to unnecessarily promote apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. The presence of DNA damage results in the removal of these inhibitions on p53.)It therefore appears that p53 is doing something to help produce a number of miRNAs, some of which are tumor suppressors. The curious thing, though, is that it can be shown that p53 is not a transcription factor for the genes that encode these miRNAs.So what is it that p53 is doing instead to help produce these miRNAs? New research published in the July 23, 2009 issue of Nature answers this question – and it uncovers an entirely new mechanism through which p53 (and its binding domain, in particular) acts as a tumor suppressor. Here&amp;#39;s the research abstract:Modulation of microRNA processing by p53MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Although miRNAs can function as both tumour suppressors and oncogenes in tumour development, a widespread downregulation of miRNAs is commonly observed in human cancers and promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. This indicates an inherent significance of small RNAs in tumour suppression. However, the connection between tumour suppressor networks and miRNA biogenesis machineries has not been investigated in depth. Here we show that a central tumour suppressor, p53, enhances the post-transcriptional maturation of several miRNAs with growth-suppressive function, including miR-16-1, miR-143 and miR-145, in response to DNA damage. ... These findings suggest that transcription-independent modulation of miRNA biogenesis is intrinsically embedded in a tumour suppressive program governed by p53. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of p53 in miRNA processing, which may underlie key aspects of cancer biology.To understand what&amp;#39;s going on, it&amp;#39;s necessary to explain a few things about how miRNAs are produced. It&amp;#39;s not a simple 1-step process of transcribing an miRNA gene into the final short piece of RNA.There are, instead, three steps. The first step is transcription, done just as is done for any other gene. The RNA produced in this step is many nucleotides long, and is called the &amp;quot;primary transcript&amp;quot; or pri-miRNA. This pri-miRNA is then cut into smaller pieces having a hairpin shape, called pre-miRNA. The pre-miRNA, in turn, is further processed to produce the final &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; miRNA.The intermediate step that converts pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA is performed by a protein complex known as the &amp;quot;microprocessor complex&amp;quot; (having nothing to do with computers, of course). One of the key proteins in this complex is an enzyme called Drosha. The final step, which is performed by another enzyme called Dicer, sp...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Why did Anthony reject his faith? Falk writes:&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider, for example, the story of Anthony outlined in his autobiographical essay which is posted at a blog-site for former Christians. Anthony had little room for mystery in his theology. Everything had to be nailed down tightly and he built his life around being-in-the-know about everything related to God. When he found that his tight theology didn't mesh with the facts, he thought he had no choice but to give it all up. So steeped was he in a theology where all the pieces had to fit together, that when he found some which didn't, there was nothing left for him except atheism itself. So Anthony, a former believer who wanted nothing more than to know God, has now decided that there is no God; he has rejected all faith, and he is a regular contributor in the comments section of atheistic blog-sites. There are likely thousands like Anthony, people who no longer think they can have a relationship with their Creator because they find pieces that don't fit into their once-neat theology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8219435539761628383?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear is a curious thing. It often bears no relation to the actual risk of what we fear. When swine flu first broke out in Mexico, people were understandably afraid.  Travel was restricted, schools were closed, and so many people stayed home that the streets of Mexico City were empty. As the disease spread around the world, Egypt developed a paranoid fear of pigs and committed national pigicide. They ordered the slaughter of all 300,000 of their country’s innocent little porkers, ignoring the fact that the flu is spread person-to-person, not pig-to-person. Now that the disease has officially been labeled a pandemic, fears have switched from the real threat of the disease to an imagined danger from the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people just plain hate the idea of vaccines – to the point that they are willing to spread old falsehoods, make up new lies, distort the results of studies, misrepresent statistics, and endanger our public health. There are websites like “Operation Fax to Stop the Vax” and even anti-swine-flu-vaccine rap videos.   Press releases, e-mail campaigns, talk shows, and blogs are being used to stir up irrational fears. These people are irresponsible fearmongers. They are wrong, and they are dangerous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;The 1918 flu.&lt;/span&gt; The flu epidemic of 1918 started as a mild disease in the spring, called the “3-day fever.” Most victims recovered in a few days; there were few deaths. Then in the fall, it turned into something far more severe. It was the same flu strain, but it had become more virulent. Some victims died within hours. Healthy young adults were as susceptible as children and the elderly. It affected remote villages as well as urban areas. It attacked 1/5 of the world’s population, ¼ of the US population, and killed 50 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wartime conditions may have favored the evolution of a more virulent strain. In peacetime, the sicker stay put and the mildly affected move around.  In the trenches, the mildly affected stayed on duty and the sicker were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals. Today, places with social upheaval might have similar effects favoring a virulent strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;The 1976 swine flu. &lt;/span&gt; In February 1976 a strain of H1N1 influenza similar to the 1918 strain killed a soldier at Fort Dix. Officials feared a pandemic and over-reacted. In actuality, the H1N1 strain was limited to the Fort Dix area and quickly died out, and another related strain only persisted until March. Nevertheless, a swine flu vaccine was developed and was given to 48,000,000 Americans, 22% of the population. The vaccination program was stopped in December after 532 cases of paralysis from Guillain-Barré syndrome were linked to the vaccine and 25 people died. It had been a false alarm, and more people died of the vaccine than of the disease. The risk of getting Guillain-Barré from the vaccine was approximately 1 in 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;The 2009 swine flu&lt;/span&gt;. Between April 15 and July 24, 2009, there were 43,771 confirmed and probable cases of H1N1 influenza (“swine flu”) in the US.  There were 5011 hospitalizations and 302 deaths, 39% among those aged 25 to 49, in contrast to the usual flu where 90% of the deaths are in people over age 65. For comparison, the more common strains of flu have been killing around 36,000 people a year in the US.  Swine flu has been declared a phase 6 pandemic by the World Health Organization: that is a measure of its spread, not of its severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the chances that the new swine flu will follow the course of the 1918 flu? We have no way of knowing. All we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst. In addition to the annual flu vaccine for the usual common strains, a specific vaccine for the H1N1 strain is being prepared and tested to see whether one or two shots will be needed to produce a satisfactory immune response. So we may be offered as many as 3 shots this year. Supplies will be limited, at least in the short run, so the CDC has announced these priorities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Household contacts and caregivers for children younger than 6 months of age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthcare and emergency medical services personnel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All people from 6 months through 24 years of age &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persons aged 25 through 64 years who have health conditions associated with higher risk of medical complications from influenza.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if it fizzles out like the swine flu of 1976? That’s already ruled out: the 1976 flu had fizzled by March; the new swine flu hasn’t shown any signs of fizzling yet. We will be monitoring numbers of cases and vaccine complications very carefully, assessing the risk/benefit ratio, and we’re not likely to repeat the mistakes of 1976.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lies and Distortions vs. the Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t hope to address all the misinformation that is circulating, and even if I could, more new lies would come out by the time I finished writing. Here are some of the ones I have heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A correspondent in the Netherlands forwarded me an alarmist e-mail that is circulating in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: It alleges that only one person has died of swine flu in the UK, and it questions whether he really had flu. It tells us “you are slated for vaccination against a disease which poses &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; credible threat whatsoever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: As of August 27, the death toll in the UK was 66. As of Sept. 1, 2009, 2184 deaths had been reported worldwide. Most rational people would call that a credible threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Guillian-Barré Syndrome is a newly concocted name for a much more familiar condition: Polio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Ridiculous! Polio is a distinct disease and its symptoms are very different from those of Guillain-Barré syndrome. A diagnosis of polio can be confirmed by finding the actual poliovirus particles in body secretions or cerebrospinal fluid. The last case of “wild polio” in the US occurred in 1979. Polio has been eradicated in most countries; Guillain-Barré still occurs regularly in every country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Guillain-Barré is still being caused by flu vaccines. A study based on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) found 54 cases of GBS reported after vaccination in the United States in 2004. 57% of these followed flu vaccines and the rest followed other vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The VAERS is a voluntary reporting system that accepts all reports of symptoms or illnesses that occurred after vaccination. It even accepted a fraudulent report claiming that a man had been turned into The Hulk by his influenza vaccine. To find out whether the VAERS reports mean anything, it is necessary to compare the incidence of the condition in those vaccinated to the incidence in the unvaccinated. Guillain-Barré syndrome affects 1 to 4 of every 100,000 people around the world every year, and the increased risk from vaccines is currently estimated at no more than 1 in a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: It usually takes several years to test a drug and show that it is safe, but the swine flu vaccine is going to be fast-tracked for quick approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: A new flu vaccine has to be developed every year to respond to the new strains that are constantly evolving. Time does not allow for the same kind of testing we require for approval of a new pharmaceutical. Time is even shorter for the swine flu this year. We have a lot of experience in producing new flu vaccines every year, and there is no reason to suspect that this year’s batches will be any more dangerous than usual. Because of fast-tracking, we will be monitoring very closely for side effects. We have a choice between fast-tracking and being prepared for a serious outbreak, or being slow and cautious and totally unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: 4000 people were afflicted with Guillain-Barré Syndrome in 1976.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: At least 1 in 100,000 people would have gotten Guillain-Barré syndrome anyway. The excess cases attributed to the vaccine were estimated at 532 (some sources say half of that number), and most of them recovered fully. 25 deaths were attributed to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several websites where writers with a bad track record for scientific credibility (like Joseph Mercola and Gary Null) advocate vaccine refusal. The Health Freedom movement wants the government to forget about trying to protect the public and give us the freedom to harm ourselves by using untested, disproven, useless, or even dangerous treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Legislation allows for you to be isolated or quarantined or “incarcerated in relocation centers” if you refuse vaccination during a declared Pandemic Emergency. This is a violation of human rights and of the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: If you have active TB, the government has not only the power but the responsibility to require treatment or quarantine so you don’t sit next to me on the bus and cough in my face. If you contract Ebola virus, I sure hope you will be quarantined to reduce the death toll. Quarantine is legal, is mandated by legislation, and is accepted by international law. Sometimes the duty to protect most of the people in a society temporarily trumps a few individual human rights. The government is not going to require quarantine unless there is a serious threat that demands action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: People should be allowed to “self-shield.” For self-shielding you go home lock the doors and stay there. Then you can try to further protect yourself with nano-silver, homeopathic remedies, cold packs, vitamins, flavonoids, zinc, astaxanthin, magnesium, and other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  A self-imposed quarantine is better than nothing, but I question whether it would be effective in practice. The suggested (untested) remedies might conceivably keep people entertained so they are more willing to stay home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The CDC and the American Academy of Neurologists have asked neurologists to be vigilant in looking for cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in people who have been vaccinated. This is an admission that they know the vaccine will be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.aan.com/press/?fuseaction=release.view&amp;amp;release=757"&gt;They clearly said &lt;/a&gt;“they do not expect the 2009 H1N1 vaccine to increase the risk for the autoimmune disease” but since this is a concern with any pandemic vaccine, they will be on the alert. This is a good thing. If the incidence starts rising, they will know it earlier and be able to react more quickly than they did in 1976.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The threat of Guillain-Barré is a reason to reject vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: No one understands what causes Guillain-Barré syndrome, but it can develop after an infection, surgery or vaccination. It is possible that &lt;a href="http://www.factsandcomparisons.com/assets/hospitalpharm/IMM1.pdf"&gt;people who develop GBS after vaccination might also have developed GBS after natural exposure to the disease&lt;/a&gt;. “From both the societal and individual perspectives, the risk of GBS after a flu shot pales in comparison to the risk of serious adverse events if infected with the influenza virus: 60 to 70 cases of GBS vs. 20,000 deaths from influenza. Keeping things on the same scale, people over 65 years of age can choose from a risk of 1 case of GBS per million people or 10,000 cases of hospitalization and 1500 deaths due to influenza.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Joseph Mercola writes about “Squalene: The Swine Flu Vaccine’s Dirty Little Secret.” He has claimed that the vaccine adjuvant squalene is dangerous, that the Gulf War Syndrome was caused by the squalene in anthrax vaccines, that squalene is “good” or “bad depending on how it gets into your body: “&lt;em&gt;Injection is an abnormal route of entry which incites your immune system to attack all the squalene in your body, not just the vaccine adjuvant.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;And the only reason they put adjuvants in vaccines is to save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Squalene is found naturally in the human body. It is a precursor of cholesterol and other compounds necessary to human health. Squalene antibodies were found in Gulf War veterans; but the rate turned out to be no higher in those who had Gulf War Syndrome than in those who didn’t. Squalene antibodies were found at similar rates in people who had never been exposed to squalene in vaccines. The anthrax vaccine has been ruled out as a possible cause of Gulf War Syndrome. Anyway, it turns out there was no squalene in the anthrax vaccine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American flu vaccines do not contain adjuvants, but maybe they should. Adjuvants enhance the body’s innate immune response to the antigens in vaccines, making vaccines more effective.  And they allow for broader cross-reactivity against viral strains not included in the vaccine.   &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17931151?ordinalpos=33&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17931151?ordinalpos=33&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&lt;/a&gt; Mercola says adjuvants are added just to increase profits, but the pharmaceutical and health industries could make far more money treating patients in an epidemic than they could ever make trying to prevent one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a large body of data demonstrating the safety of squalene. Flu vaccines containing MF59, a squalene-based adjuvant, have been used in Europe for 10 years, with 22,000,000 doses given; and no serious adverse events have occurred, only mild local reactions.  The vaccine does not raise the incidence or titers of anti-squalene antibodies. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers it safe. &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/topics/adjuvants/squalene/questions_and_answers/en/index.html"&gt;http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/topics/adjuvants/squalene/questions_and_answers/en/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Flu vaccines are not very effective and don’t protect everyone. The effectiveness is particularly low in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This claim is true, BUT… In recent years, flu vaccines have been 75% effective in preventing hospitalizations for flu. 75% is way better than nothing. No vaccine is 100% effective. Flu vaccine is particularly problematic because of the constantly mutating strains of the virus. Nevertheless, the benefits of vaccines are clear.  It is true that the elderly are not as well protected by the vaccine (efficacy rates have been estimated at 50% or less): that’s why it’s so important for younger people to be vaccinated, reducing the prevalence of the disease in the population and thereby reducing the likelihood of the elderly being exposed. In other words, don’t just get the flu shot for yourself, get it for Grandma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Mercola says “Injecting organisms into your body to provoke immunity is contrary to nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Nature kills people. Doing something contrary to nature is what medicine is all about. It’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; “The potential for a weaponized vaccine to be the vector for a weaponized flu cannot be discounted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Most far-fetched conspiracy theories are wrong: I have no trouble discounting this one. The potential may be there, but the likelihood is homeopathic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: People should make their own decisions about their health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the basic principles of medical ethics is autonomy: patients have the right to accept or reject any treatment. Modern doctors try to involve the patient in the decision-making process, but most people are ill-equipped to make health decisions on their own without getting information and guidance from a health care professional. In a recent survey, 30 percent of Americans believed&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;that there had been a case of smallpox in the United States&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;in the past five years, and 63 percent thought there had been&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;a case somewhere in the world in the past five years. &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/348/5/426"&gt;http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/348/5/426&lt;/a&gt;   They didn’t know that the last case in the US occurred in 1949 and the last case in the world occurred in 1977 in Somalia. Twenty-five percent thought it was likely&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;that they would die if they got the smallpox vaccine (the actual risk of death from the vaccine is 1 per million). People who are uninformed and scientifically illiterate are not capable of making rational decisions about health matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Mercola’s advice for preventing flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Eliminate sugar and processed foods from your diet, take a high quality source of animal-based omega 3 fats like Krill Oil, exercise, optimize your vitamin D levels, get plenty of sleep, deal with stress, and wash your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Washing your hands is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Mercola claims&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: “Vitamin D deficiency is the likely cause of seasonal flu viruses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Now really! Vitamin D deficiency in a human body can no more “cause a virus” than it could “cause a cat.” Perhaps he meant vitamin D deficiency could predispose to infection, and there is some research to suggest that it might. Some have claimed that taking vitamin D supplements will prevent the flu, but there is no evidence to support that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—————————–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercola’s claims and arguments were decisively eviscerated on Science-Based Medicine by Dr. Joseph Albietz. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=851"&gt;http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=851&lt;/a&gt; Not only are Mercola’s assertions demonstrably false, but they reveal a profound misunderstanding of immunology. Unfortunately, he reaches a large audience of scientifically naïve people who believe his every word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Dr. Albietz’s article, there were some interesting comments from readers that further demonstrate the anti-vaccine mindset and the ability to distort information to promote a cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The government is going to mandate that everyone get the swine flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; No such proposal has been made. The government couldn’t do it even if it tried, because there won’t be enough doses to go around. That’s why they’ve issued recommendations prioritizing who should get the vaccine first.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: George Bush signed an agreement that if a pandemic emergency arose and the President declared a national state of emergency, control of the government would be passed to the United Nations.  Blue-helmeted UN soldiers would run our country and the Constitution would be suspended.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Fact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: It was simply an agreement to facilitate international cooperation, to share information and enhance collaboration in the event of an emergency. It says nothing about the UN at all, much less about relinquishing sovereignty to the UN or any other organization. The actual agreement can be read online: &lt;a href="http://www.spp.gov/pdf/nap_flu07.pdf"&gt;http://www.spp.gov/pdf/nap_flu07.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same person pointed out that shots hurt and that alone should tell you something. “Yet you are willing to trust these people with your lives to make a vaccine that the Creator never intended the human body should need, and let them inject it into your body? You people are scary or insane!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it is the anti-vaccine zealots who are scary. They are not insane, just self-deluded and misguided. I hope the swine flu won’t develop into a reprise of 1918; but if it does, the false information these people are spreading could be responsible for a great deal of death and suffering. Freedom of speech is a good thing, but this kind of fearmongering is almost as bad as shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's the the 13-year-old boy with Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent one course of chemotherapy and then decided he wanted to pursue "alternative therapy" based on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/daniel_hauser_and_the_rejection_of_chemo.php"&gt;fear of chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; and because of the&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/another_child_sacrificing_himself_on_the.php"&gt; influence of the &lt;em&gt;faux&lt;/em&gt; Native American religion&lt;/a&gt; that his mother had taken up with. Ultimately, after a judge ordered Daniel's parents to make sure that Daniel received the chemotherapy and radiation therapy he needed, Daniel and his mother Colleen went on the lam, but ultimately Daniel's mother decided to turn herself in. As a result, Daniel began live-saving chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Daniel has &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/57328077.html"&gt;completed his induction course of chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Daniel Hauser, the Sleepy Eye teen who gained national attention for resisting court-ordered cancer treatment, has finished his chemotherapy and plans to celebrate with a pizza party at home with family and friends, a family spokesman said Friday.

&lt;p&gt;Daniel is doing "very, very well,'' and his parents are thrilled, said Dan Zwakman, a family friend. The 13-year-old completed his chemotherapy Thursday at Children's Hospitals and Clinics in Minneapolis and is scheduled to start radiation treatment in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's really nice that he's done," his mother, Colleen Hauser, told the Associated Press. On Friday, Daniel was feeling a little sick after his final chemo treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He's throwing up and stuff like normal, but we keep him occupied with things outside, and that helps a whole lot," Colleen Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nausea is a small price to pay for surviving a potentially fatal cancer.

[Nathan A.] Ingold, 27, of Danville, is a full-time DACC student in the new wind energy technician associate-degree program. When he returned to college after serving in the military and being in the work force, he noticed there were three Christian organizations on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seemed like something was lacking, a secular voice. I thought we needed representation as well,” said Ingold, who got the idea to form his organization from friends who were involved in secular groups on other university and college campuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the existence of God or gods, the group will discuss issues like separation of church and state, social perceptions of nonbelievers and rational analysis of supernatural claims. It also will sponsor and participate in community service projects and charitable events. For example, Ingold and other founding members have discussed holding a campus blood drive for the American Red Cross, trick-or-treating for UNICEF and organizing a Relay for Life team next summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be a very charity-driven group,” Ingold said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for Nathan!  If you’re in the area or attend the school, the first meeting is Tuesday (tomorrow).  The meeting information &lt;a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2009/09/07/dacc_group_promoting_civil_dialogue_for_nonreligious"&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/about.php" title=""&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; was horrendously out-dated so I did some quick fixes and edits to make it a little less embarrassing, though it probably needs a complete rethinking and rewriting from scratch one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what should I do with the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Blogroll.php" title=""&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;?!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is huge. And it is so out-of-date. And unmanageable. So many broken and dead links. Blogs that have quit months or years ago. And lacking so many blogs that I read now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 1) delete the whole thing (nobody uses blogrolls any more)&lt;br&gt;
Option 2) delete the whole thing and rebuild it, smaller, from scratch (people left out will be mad!)&lt;br&gt;
Option 3) spend a few weeks fixing it: removing bad links, adding new blogs (will I ever find time and energy?)&lt;br&gt;
Option 4) fix the existing or make a new blogroll and then make a widget on the sidebar that links to five random blogs from the blogroll (too scared to mess with templates on the new MT4 scienceblogs.com platform - likely to mess up the blog majorly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An Irish astronomy group is calling for help in tracing the origin of a huge explosion in the skies over the country on Thursday evening.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomy Ireland said it was currently investigating the explosion, which occurred at 2100 BST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesman said the most likely explanation was a space rock or satellite crashing into the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/03/18/the-evolution-of-beauty/"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/02/26/science-reveals-how-to-lose-weight-and-keep-it-off/"&gt;then&lt;/a&gt; I compose a post about beauty. We humans have a habit of taking what’s most beautiful about ourselves–the very quirks and idiosyncrasies that make us unique–and believing they somehow instead make us inadequate or unacceptable. In the public arena, women are &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/03/16/laura-ingraham-should-know-better/"&gt;all too often&lt;/a&gt; criticized for their physique over their ideas. Meanwhile, runways frequently celebrate a very &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2008/02/08/were-sexually-confused/"&gt;unhealthy image&lt;/a&gt; of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we have Lizzie looking absolutely &lt;em&gt;stunning&lt;/em&gt; celebrated in a top fashion magazine!

&lt;p&gt;Filmmaker Alejandro Amenabar is bringing the story of Hypatia and the fall of the Library of Alexandria to the big screen in his new epic film, &lt;em&gt;Agora&lt;/em&gt;, starring Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, the last currator of The Library of Alexandria, As I’ve blogged before, the film &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gg3-s2lNUEtqAZXnO1PdckqiDrPwD9883Q080"&gt;has already premiered at Cannes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypatia was a mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, and librarian working in a man’s world in 4th century A.D. Egypt before a Christian mob violently murdered her, destroyed the Library of Alexandria, and brought about the beginning of the Dark Ages. Hypatia struggled to preserve scientific knowledge amid militant Christianity. But she failed. The Christians declared her a witch, stripped her, dragged her body through the streets, and burned her at the stake before destroying the library, leading the Western world into a thousand years of darkness. She died a hero and a martyr for science and reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the role, Weisz had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Really, nothing has changed. I mean, we have huge technological advances and medical advances, but in terms of people killing each other in the name of God, fundamentalism still abounds,” Weisz said. “And in certain cultures, women are still second-class citizens, and they’re denied education.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the title of the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Agora” — named for the great square at the city’s center — is far from a dusty treatise, though. A lot of stoning and sword-skewering goes on in “Agora” as Amenabar intersperses Hypatia’s philosophical musings with bloodletting in the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, in her honor, the Freedom From Religion Foundation hosts the &lt;a href="http://www.ffrf.org/lakehypatia/"&gt;Lake Hypatia Advance&lt;/a&gt; in Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is the new trailer to the film &lt;em&gt;Agora&lt;/em&gt; followed by Carl Sagan’s incredibly moving description of the fall of the Library of Alexandria:&lt;/p&gt;

As a consequence, four of the most prominent science bloggers, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/08/31/bye-to-bloggingheads/" rel="external "&gt;physicist Sean Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/09/01/bloggingheads-and-the-old-challenges-of-new-tools/" rel="external "&gt;science writer Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/04/bloggingheads-capo-non-grata/" rel="external "&gt;Bad Astronomer Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/phil_plait_ditches_blogginghea.php" rel="external "&gt;Pharyngula’s PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;, have elected to not participate further on Bloggingheads.  There are comment threads attached to each of the posts linked, with some split in the comments concerning whether the decisions to withdraw are well advised.  I myself think they are well advised to withdraw, and I describe why I think that below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Disco ‘Tute’s &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/09/guillotine_victims_at_blogging.html" rel="external "&gt;Bruce Chapman has weighed in&lt;/a&gt;, his post invoking the metaphor of the guillotine to describe Blogginghead’s fate.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/" rel="external "&gt;Bloggingheads.tv&lt;/a&gt; was founded by Robert Wright, author most recently of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evolution-God-Robert-Wright/dp/0316734918/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1252362530&amp;amp;sr=1-1" rel="external "&gt;The Evolution of God&lt;/a&gt;.   It features pairs of people conversing via internet video links, having conversations about various topics.  (The conversations are called “diavlogs,” surely the ugliest neologism of the InterTubes age.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The kerfuffle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Bloggingheads hosted two conversations featuring creationists.  The first had &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Numbers" rel="external "&gt;Ronald Numbers&lt;/a&gt;, a historian of creationism,  and &lt;a href="http://www.discovery.org/p/45" rel="external "&gt;Paul Nelson&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/04/have-a-querulou.html" rel=""&gt;ontogenetic depth&lt;/a&gt; fame, a young earth creationist, philosopher, and fellow of the Disco ‘Tute.  It was called &lt;a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/21107" rel="external "&gt;Science Saturday: Inside the Mind of a Creationist&lt;/a&gt;.  While it was cordial in tone – Numbers and Nelson have apparently been personally acquainted for decades – Numbers did a pretty fair job of defending science and particularly methodological naturalism against Nelson’s claims.  Numbers missed some opportunities, of course – in a live conversation it’s impossible to pick up on everything.  In particular, Numbers gave a very bad answer to Nelson’s claim that evolutionary theory is saturated with theology, citing as evidence the responses of various recent books defending evolution, like Coyne’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Evolution-True-Jerry-Coyne/dp/0670020532/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1252369422&amp;amp;sr=1-1" rel="external "&gt;Why Evolution is True&lt;/a&gt;.  Numbers’ response was to the effect that one can’t take the statements of a few evolutionary biologists as defining the field as a whole.  The appropriate response would have been, “Evolutionary biology as such is indifferent to theological issues.  However, Coyne’s book is a defense of evolutionary biology against a bunch of specious arguments by theists and so is bound to have some reference to their claims.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real reservation I have about the Numbers/Nelson conversation is its placement in Science Saturday.  It was partly &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the nature of science but there was precious little actual science in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/22075" rel="external "&gt;The other offending Bloggingheads conversation&lt;/a&gt; was between John McWhorter, a linguist, and Michael Behe, a Senior Fellow of the Disco ‘Tute.  In a totally clumsy series of events, that conversation was up on the site for a few days and then was removed, apparently at McWhorter’s request, and then was restored by Wright.  I will say little about it except to note that McWhorter displayed a discouraging ignorance of evolutionary biology coupled with nauseating flattery of Behe.  It was crap on the part of both participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why quit Bloggingheads?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of arguments were given by Carroll, Zimmer, Plait, and Myers, but they seemed to boil down to their not wanting to be associated with a medium/site that gave more or less uncritical exposure to proponents of a view of evolution (and science as a whole) that has been thoroughly and emphatically discredited.  However, I think there’s a deeper reason for the four (and any other scientists) to disassociate themselves from such a site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A venue like Bloggingheads has no intrinsic credibility.  It must earn its credibility, borrowing from the credibility of its participants.  When people like Carroll, Zimmer, Plait, and Myers participate in Bloggingheads conversations, they are loaning the site some of their own credibility built over years of professional work.  The site takes on their luster and acquires an audience attracted by their participation.  What those people have to decide is whether they want to continue to lend their professional credibility to a site whose editorial policy is so confused that it cannot distinguish crap from science.  They have understandably concluded that they don’t wish to do so, and I applaud them for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the question of whether to debate creationists: should ‘real’ scientists debate creationists in public venues?  In general it’s taken to be a bad idea because merely the fact of including them on the same stage lends them credibility they have not themselves earned.  I think the case is the same here.  Bloggingheads borrowed the credibility of genuine scientists and spooned it over a couple of creationists who have not themselves earned it.  Bloggingheads borrowed it and then wasted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atheism really may be fighting against nature: humans have been hardwired by evolution to believe in God, scientists have suggested.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The idea has emerged from studies of the way children's brains develop and of the workings of the brain during religious experiences. They suggest that during evolution groups of humans with religious tendencies began to benefit from their beliefs, perhaps because they tended to work together better and so stood a greater chance of survival.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The findings challenge campaigners against organised religion, such as Richard Dawkins, author of The God Delusion. He has long argued that religious beliefs result from poor education and childhood "indoctrination".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, piss off, you tiresome apologists for superstition. Dawkins did not make any such simple-minded argument; &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; really is becoming one of those books beloved by those who haven't read it for their ability to misrepresent it. There may very well be natural biases that incline people to see agency everywhere around them, and to accept the dogmas of the tribe. So what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an atheist, and it feels good. I am not a mutant freak who is struggling against either my instincts, radio waves broadcast from CIA satellites, or the sub-etheric pleas of downy-winged angels. I have hardwired bits in my brain, I am sure, and I also have the forces of history and culture shaping the way I think, but that does not mean anything as shallow and simplistic as that I should surrender to my church for the good of my biological impulses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also born with a brain that found object permanence extremely surprising. My parents could play peek-a-boo with me, and it took me a year or so to realize that it was not a massively beneficent act of nature that my mother's face could still exist! Behind her hands! When I wasn't looking! Hooray! Ha ha! This does not imply that thinking, conscious, educated adult human beings should continue to collapse in peals of childish laughter every time they open a door and find that their family doesn't vanish when they aren't in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakly formed predispositions of babies are not obstacles to rational thought. Except, maybe, to adults with the brains of babies. The rest of us can grow out of that nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clarification: I actually do think there are inborn biases that tend to make religious belief a path of least resistance for many people. To escape that trap is not 'fighting against nature', nor is it an obstacle to godlessness.&lt;/p&gt;

It has been a mainstay of evolutionary theory since the 1970s.  Natural selection acts purely on the level of the individual and any cooperation observed between organisms merely hides a selfish genetic motive.  There have been two pioneering theories to explain cooperation in the natural world given this framework: the first was William Hamilton's (1964) theory of kin selection and the second was Robert Trivers' (1971) theory of reciprocal altruism.

However, both of these scenarios break down where it comes to unicolonial ants.  In a paper in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution (subscription required) Heikki Helantera, of the University of Sussex, and colleagues at Rice University have investigated how previous theories to explain cooperation don't apply for these unique supercolonies.

Unicolonial ants carry polydomy [multiple nests in a supercolony that all individuals rotate through] and polygyny [multiple queens in one nest] to extremes. Colonies are huge, each being a network of hundreds or thousands of nests, each with multiple queens. There is no worker aggression, and there is free movement among nests on a vast scale. The energy that might have been put into fighting and territoriality flows into the common good, more ants. 

Such a concept, a form of genuine anarchism in the animal world, was thought to be impossible given existing theory.  These ants live in colonies where relatives exist but, with so much migration throughout a network stretching thousands of kilometers, each ant worker is mostly surrounded by total strangers that share none of their genes.  Only one other species has ever been known to organize themselves in such a fashion (and if you're reading these words right now you know who you are).

&lt;p&gt;There's nothing specific in it, as you might expect, and science gets a cursory mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment. You'll need the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free. You'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How an organism interacts with the environment to produce these variations has been a focus in psychology since its inception as a scientific discipline.There is now no question that cumulative experiences throughout life history interact with genetic predispositions to shape the individual's behavior. Recent evidence suggests that events in the past generations may also influence how an individual responds to events in their own life history. Epigenetics is the study of how the environment can affect the genome of an individual and its descendants all without changing the sequence of the DNA.The early stages of life, beginning before birth and up to weaning in mammals, are the time of maximum neuronal plasticity.It is during this early period that hormones and genotype predispose an individual's responses to future experiences throughout the life cycle. Suites of genes underlie the fundamental plasticity of an organism, particularly during development and life history transitions. How do these gene networks interact with the experiences that cumulate during an individual's life history?An important interface between the environment (both internal and external) is that of epigenetic modifications. Exactly how these modifications occur is still relatively unknown, but recent studies indicate that origin of such effects may occur at in the previous generations. That is, experience of previous generations may modify regulatory factors affecting gene expression without changing the sequence of the DNA, but the physiology and behavior of the organism may be substantially influenced. Thus understanding how such events really occur will enhance our understanding of how the environment influences the relationship between genotype and behavior during sensitive periods of development.Molecular vs Molar epigeneticsThere have been several reviews recently as to the origin of the field of epigenetics, all of which recognize the multiple roots of the current tree of research. The debates in the 16th-17th century pitted preformationism against epigenesis, with a central question of how a multicellular organism develops from a single cell, the zygote. The former camp believed that adult characters were present fully formed in the egg and simply unfolded during growth, while the latter held that traits arose due to interactions between the multiple constituent parts of the zygote. Spawned after the resolution of this conflict were two different groups, one rooted in anatomy and geology, which later became the broad science of biology, and the other focused on sensation, perception and mind, which ultimately became the study of psychology. Thus though both have a common origin, they evolved very differently both in perspective and substance. These the author labels respectively as, 'Molecular epigenetics' and 'Molar epigenetics'.Molar epigenetics arises from historical literature in psychilogy, particularly functionalism. Rather than measuring sensory processes, the functionalists focused on the organism itself and development of behavior in relation to its natural environment. Molecular epigenetics arose from molecular biology and modern genetics and its emphasis was on gene regulation and its developmental significance.Thus the object of study in Molecular epigenetics is gene expression during embryogenesis, while in Molar epigenetics, it is on the individual's interactions with the biotic and physical environment usually after birth.Molecular epigeneticsConrad H. Waddington proposed the term 'epigenetics' from classical embryology, ascribing it to the study of processes by which genotype gives rise to a phenotype. His concept was central to what became the modern era of epigenetics when Robin Holliday proposed a molecular model of heritable gene activation and inactivation during development by DNA methylation and demethylation respectively. Since then the term epigenetics is used to connote the study of change in gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. There are several mechanisms that can achieve this end, such as DNA methylation and modification of histones by processes of methylation, deacetylation and phosphorylation. While DNA methylation is clearly involved in genomic imprinting, the signal for the imprint is still not known.Molar epigeneticsEarly comparitive psychologists were also interested in epigenetics, but from the perspective of interaction of an organism's heredity and the nature of species typical behaviors or 'instincts'. Work principally by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen emphasized that such behaviors were a product of natural selection, the result of genes acting in the brain to generate behaviors that were unlearned and innate. Thus, these studies laid the foundation of psychobiology, a field that focuses on how experiences cumulate throughout life to shape the way in which an individual interacts with its environment.It is necessary to emphasize that, an approach that integrates both Molecular and Molar epigenetics, will be required to reveal the mechanisms that underlie behavioral evolution....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Parasites that must infect multiple hosts to complete their life cycle face a complex set of challenges.  One of these is determining the timing of the switch.  The authors of this paper look at the trade-off involved in staying in an intermediate host so as to become larger and more fecund in the next host and the increased chance of mortality in the current host.  The authors conduct two different experiments with a tapeworm parasite, Schistocephalus solidus.  In one experiment they examined the behavior of the first intermediate host, cyclopoid copepods (Macrocyclops albidus).  In the second experiment they directly measured differences in fecundity among different host switch timing between the first and second intermediate hosts (in this case the three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus).  The authors also build an optimality model and use the data from these experiments as well as some previously published data to confirm that the switch from the first to second host occurs at an optimal time for parasite fecundity.What was most novel about this paper to me was the modification of the host behavior that had the effect of reducing parasite transmission, at least in the short run.  Since the parasite was transmitted trophically, the next host eats the previous host, predation enhancement or avoidance directly influences the rate of transmission.  The authors found some evidence of predation enhancement after the optimal switch time, but the stronger evidence was at least a shift in behavior of the current host.  Before the parasite is mature in the first intermediate host, or before the optimal switching time to the second intermediate host, there was a reduction in movement which translates into predator avoidance behavior.  Manipulating the host so as to allow the parasite a longer time to grow is a very clever strategy.  In hosts that have a high potential mortality, this strategy may be found among a diversity of trophically transmitted parasites.ReferenceHammerschmidt, K., K. Koch, M. Milinski, J. C. Chubb, and G.

Ned, typically developing, was the usual sour-faced/hopeless case in this regard, but Alex has shown a willingness to scurry about and put things away if properly motivated. For a long time, I used a pointer (a “stick”), feeling like Patton as I slapped the pointer on toy after toy to be removed from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:322px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/09/pointer.jpg" alt="Image courtesy of Tim Morgan (flickr.com)" width="312" height="312"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image courtesy of Tim Morgan (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, however, I hit upon a new idea. I sat Alex down by his pile of strewn plastic animals, grabbed an index card and a pen, and wrote, “Pick up the animals, please.” I took his finger and guided it across the words and made him read each word. Those he didn’t know, I pronounced for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pick up the … animals … PLEASE!” he eventually said. And he did, scooping them into a big pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put the animals in box, please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he did. We went on like this through the books, the papers, the crayons, the DVDs, and the rest of the animals. He even threw the  filled-up index cards away when prompted by the writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have little idea what schoolwork will be like this year for Alex, except that it will begin on this Wednesday morning. We probably haven’t sat and read or written with Alex enough this summer to prepare him for what I imagine will be a new school and a mid-week shock. The index-card exercise  seemed like a good way to clear the floor and start him back on the mental path to school. Most important, perhaps, it killed 45 minutes on an afternoon of a holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

I mean, it’s pretty fantastic stuff, but it’s a bit too fantastic, and at this point I’m at least 5% functional… though really high on Fioricet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.curetogether.com/"&gt;CureTogether&lt;/a&gt; was mentioned in the Quickies a few weeks ago as a place to gather information from patients/consumers about what treatments and medications work for them. The day it was posted, I looked up what people were saying about migraines. The number one “cure” for migraines is crystal therapy… this made me want to stab people. But worse, the worst rated cure, one that most people said made their symptoms worse, was standing on your head. Yes, &lt;em&gt;standing on your fucking head&lt;/em&gt;. With a migraine. The fact that multiple people tried this, made me want to stab people with bears. Especially on days like today. Why would you tell someone with a migraine to stand on their head? Someone who is too much pain to even begin to start the process in their heads that would tell them that this is a terrible idea. The only positive outcome I can think of is that it will hurt so bad, the migraine sufferer will start screaming so loud and so miserably that the neighbors will call 9-1-1 and an ambulance will come, take them to a hospital and they will get injected with dilaudid. It’s the ONLY thing I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bremner is an apparently well-regarded psychiatrist, and takes a refreshing look at the influence of industry not just on pharmaceuticals but on the conduct of science itself.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/07/academic_institution_policies.php"&gt;His outspoken views have led to attempts to squelch his academic freedoms.&lt;/a&gt;   But his sometimes-heroic record does not excuse dangerous idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand how wading into the cesspool that is conflict of interest can leave one cynical.  But cynicism and suspicion turned up to “11″ is no longer bravery—it’s crankery.  It’s not his snarkiness that burns—it’s his inability to separate his biases from the facts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like the pharmaceutical industry doesn’t deserve to be taken to the wood shed.  Examples of unethical and downright immoral practices abound, such as &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/08/25/ghost-writers-coming-out-of-the-closet/"&gt;ghost-writing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/when_big_pharma_pays_a_publisher_to_publ.php"&gt;fake journals&lt;/a&gt;, and a host of other sins.  But the industry has also helped develop a most remarkable pharmacopeia which saves and improves countless lives.  There is good, and there is bad.  And telling the two apart, well, that makes all the difference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tends to go for headlines that hit hard, but miss the point entirely.  Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/06/25/angioplasty-found-to-be-useless-waste-of-money/"&gt;Angioplasty Found to be Useless Waste of Money&lt;/a&gt;: he cites a journal article which he says concluded that “not useful for patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). ”  His title would be accurate if angioplasty were used only in stable CAD—it is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/03/18/should-i-take-aspirin-or-put-a-gun-to-my-head/"&gt;Should I Take Aspirin or Put a Gun To My Head?&lt;/a&gt;: here, he sort of gets the difference between primary and secondary prevention, but not really.  He also likes to admit that the data contradict his conclusion but he’s nice enough to say, “screw the data”:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although technically the risk of stomach bleeding is outweighed by the heart benefits of aspirin (which can only be shown when large numbers of patients are studied), in terms of what that means to you the differences are clinically meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Just In: Breast Cancer Screening Essentially Useless: yes, Doug, breast cancer screening doesn’t benefit everyone equally. For example, the prevalence of breast cancers in men is low enough that recommending it for you would be stupid—like your article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of consistent inconsistency is why a headline like this is hard to take seriously: &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/01/28/flu-shots-are-still-for-idiots-2/"&gt;Flu shots are [still] for idiots.&lt;/a&gt;   It’s always good to re-examine the evidence behind our practices.  Influenza vaccination uses tremendous resources, and it’s important to know what benefit, if any, we get from this expenditure.  But Doug hates evidence that contradicts his pre-formed conclusions, so &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Cherry_picking"&gt;conveniently ignores it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, though, his “facts” are wrong.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there are many strains of flu and the vaccine targets only one, and you need the shots every year cuz the viruses keep changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.  Each year’s flu vaccine is a mixture of various strains that are circulating or that are likely to become the next season’s prevalent strains.  I’m not sure why he sees this as a weakness.  It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a weakness.  If flu were more like pertussis, for example, we would only need one vaccine with occasional boosters.  Flu does not comply with my wishes, and that’s sad, but that’s the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on to graver sins of ill reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that oft quoted figure of 30,000 deaths per year? Half of those cases of the “flu” are actually flu-related illness that is not actually caused by an influenza virus (and not prevented by flu shots). And most of the rest are in the elderly who often have impaired immunity so the flu shot wouldn’t work for them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/05/how_do_we_know_how_many_people.php"&gt;flu mortality are derived from a complex model&lt;/a&gt; that is not without flaws. We need to estimate because we don’t test everyone.  If anything, though, they &lt;i&gt;underestimate&lt;/i&gt; flu mortality.  As for the elderly having impaired immunity leading to the shot “not working”—well, that’s poppycock.  This &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Begging_the_question"&gt;begs the question&lt;/a&gt; quite ferociously.  His brief statement has several unfounded assertions: all elderly who get the flu have impaired immune systems; these same people would not derive sufficient immunity from the vaccine; and that half of the 30K are in this group.  This many assertions in one sentence makes my head spin, but not in a good way.  Whether and how much flu vaccines benefit the elderly is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2007/09/flu_vaccine_the_elderly_and_th.php"&gt;a difficult question,&lt;/a&gt; but &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/357/14/1373"&gt;there is significant data&lt;/a&gt; that the elderly benefit from these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This of course ignored the fact that for swine flu, it it the young, not the elderly who are the primary target group for immunization.  You see, all flus are not created equal.  Every season is different, and broad, unsupported conclusions such as Bremner’s are usually unwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the cherry picking:  he relies strongly on a single study from the British Medical Journal by Tom Jefferson.  He didn’t bother giving &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7574/912"&gt;the actual citation,&lt;/a&gt; which is good for him.  If he had, the reader would see that the “study” is actually an editorial, and that &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/333/7574/912#145861"&gt;subsequent letters&lt;/a&gt; effectively eviscerated the argument.  He of course does not bother to mention &lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050211"&gt;data that do not support his conclusions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Bremner’s blog sucks is that he’s essentially a one-trick pony.  Every article is about a vast conspiracy.  Without what is sometimes known as the Pharma Shill Gambit, he’s got nothing.  And given the quality of his pieces, perhaps “nothing” is what he should be doing more of.&lt;/p&gt;

While browsing it this weekend, I was drawn to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair/2009/09/nuclear_is_not_the_answer_bein.php?utm_source=editorspicks"&gt;this provocative article&lt;/a&gt;.  In it, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair/2006/06/cohens_clip_list.php#more"&gt;Benjamin Cohen&lt;/a&gt; writes of his interview with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Solnit"&gt;Rebecca Solnit&lt;/a&gt;, who says the following when asked about nuclear power as a viable solution to our energy concerns:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, the first problem is that they still think like big science--that there is "the answer." In fact, there are hundreds of little answers that don't include nuclear, including scaling back our consumption and travel and building better and using a lot of the elegant new engineering to do everything more efficiently and actually doing something about all the renewable energy sources that are out there--maybe having a new renewable/sustainable energy project like the Manhattan Project or race to the moon if they want some big-science action. A lot of what people are trying to hang on to when they embrace nukes is the opportunity to do things pretty much the way they've always done them: sloppily, wastefully. Nukes are the last best chance of not changing. Or so they think. My friend Chip Ward--a brilliant, uproarious writer and antinuclear/environmental activist in Utah--points out that, presuming we're looking for "the answer," nuclear power isn't it. It takes insane amounts of carbon-producing endeavor to mine and refine the uranium ore, build the power plants, and if we started tomorrow they wouldn't be online anywhere soon enough to make a difference in the narrow window we've got. So even in carbon-emissions terms and the race to stop screwing up the climate, they're not the answer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now, there are two very major points here that I disagree with, and I'll get to those in a second.  First, the praise.  She brings up the issue that any non-renewable energy source is not "the answer" to our energy problems, and this is true.  We won't have coal, oil, natural gas, or radioactive elements forever.  Unless we can &lt;i&gt;eventually&lt;/i&gt; use some abundant, renewable resource to meet our energy needs, we're going to drain the Earth of all the Carbon we managed to store in it over the aeons, and shove it back into the atmosphere.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/2012_the_real_milestone_the_re.php"&gt;And we've talked about what that does&lt;/a&gt;, and it's pretty scary.  So no, until we can figure out how to balance our energy consumption with our renewable energy generation, we're going to keep &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/04/how_could_we_affect_the_earth.php"&gt;digging ourselves into a hole&lt;/a&gt;.  The deeper we go, the more and more impossible it may become to get out of it.  And that's a point that cannot be overemphasized.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But decrying nuclear power while promoting anti-nuclear activism?  Do you have any idea how &lt;b&gt;superior in every way&lt;/b&gt; nuclear power is to, say, coal power?  No, nuclear power isn't the final answer, because it draws on a limited resource.  But let's run through how beneficial it would be for all of us if we simply switched all of the coal power industry into the nuclear power industry.  (Ben has arguments &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair/2008/08/protecting_the_environment_fro.php#more"&gt;against it&lt;/a&gt;, Matt Springer has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2009/09/nuclear_power.php?utm_source=editorspicks"&gt;arguments for it&lt;/a&gt;.)  I'm going to make the arguments from the perspective of the United States of America, since those numbers are most easily available, but remember that the USA produces only about 20-25% of the world's carbon emissions and power.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c01.html"&gt;Union of Concerned Scientists&lt;/a&gt;: a typical coal power plant is 500 MegaWatts, and burns 1.4 million tons of coal per year (which becomes 3.7 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  There are about 600 of these in our country, and that produces 54% of our electricity.  Leaving aside that burning coal produces sulphur dioxide (which causes acid rain), nitrous oxide (causes smog and ozone), carbon monoxide, lead, arsenic, and mercury, simply running these coal plants puts well over &lt;i&gt;2 billion tons of Carbon Dioxide&lt;/i&gt; into the air every year.  And that doesn't include the costs -- both environmental and human -- of mining the coal.  All-in-all, coal power plants produce each kilowatt-hour at a cost of &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2007/db20070326_366468_page_2.htm"&gt;755 grams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's come over to the nuclear side.  The &lt;a href="http://oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/publications/briefing_papers/secure_energy_civil_nuclear_power_security_and_global_warming"&gt;Oxford Research Group&lt;/a&gt;, a partisan (pro-wind and solar, anti-nuclear) non-governmental organization (i.e., think tank), has done the research digging up the dirt on nuclear.  They point out while the running of the plants themselves is carbon-free, there are hidden carbon costs in the mining and refining of the Uranium ore, as well as in the containment and disposal of radioactive waste (mostly in the form of &lt;a href="http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/tritium-radiation-fs.html"&gt;tritiated water&lt;/a&gt;).  But their findings -- which give a large range for the carbon outputs dependent on many factors -- show that nuclear plants produce each kilowatt-hour at a net cost of &lt;a href="http://oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/secureenergy.pdf"&gt;10 to 150 grams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Which means, &lt;i&gt;at worst&lt;/i&gt;, replacing all the coal plants with nuclear power plants will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by &lt;i&gt;more than 80%.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yes, it isn't &lt;b&gt;the answer&lt;/b&gt;, but it's such a tremendous positive step that the only reasons &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to switch to nuclear (which we can do &lt;i&gt;currently&lt;/i&gt; on large scales) while we figure out how to do solar and wind more efficiently are wholly fear-based.  Which brings me to the second thing I take offense at: the use of &lt;b&gt;big science&lt;/b&gt; as a derogatory term.  You can pretty much take anything that's neutral-to-good -- business, pharmaceuticals, science -- and immediately make people think that some large, mindless entity is out to get them by putting the word "big" in front of it.  I'm not enough of an expert to write about big business or big pharma, but big science?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's go.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where would we be without science, and all of the improvements to our quality of life that have resulted from our investments in this enterprise?  So, you wouldn't have the internet.  Or cellphones.  Or computers.  We can all live more simply, right?  We all lived without these 20 years ago.  Oh, wait, we'd also have to give up television, telephones, automobiles, mass transit, electricity, running water, heat, refrigeration and air conditioning.  Well, Ethan, you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; going a little overboard here, don't you think?  I mean, if we were going to live that simply, we might as well all just go back to living on farms and growing our own food.  Which we can do, thanks to the very first scientific developments about ten to twelve thousand years ago: &lt;i&gt;crop cultivation&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;agriculture&lt;/i&gt;.  Seems like I'm making a very simple argument here: &lt;b&gt;science and the scientific endeavor has resulted in practically all of the overall improvements to our quality of life.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My point in making this argument?  Science -- the process of understanding how things in this world work -- is the greatest thing I believe we can invest in.  New techniques and technologies that improve our quality of life arise from science, but that's always going to be true.  They are simply a by-product of the scientific endeavor that we get for free.  The fact that someone can even form the phrase "big science" without a hint of irony tells me that -- perhaps for the first time ever -- we're starting to invest enough of our resources in the improvement of our lives that there's tremendous reason for optimism in this world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is the process by which we learn.  It's how we know that nuclear power will be a huge improvement over coal (because we've scientifically quantified it), and how we know that solar and wind will someday be even cleaner sources of energy when they become viable.  It's why we have life expectancies in the 70s and 80s now.  It's why I can write this and gather all of this information from the comfort of my own home.  It's why most of us don't often have to worry about going cold or hungry.  And I could think of no better use of our resources than in making "big science" (all &lt;a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2008/01/science-and-the-2009-budget/"&gt;0.4% of our GDP&lt;/a&gt;, by the way) even bigger.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So work on promoting solar and wind, because they're crucial to our long-term success with this planet.  But if you pick on nuclear power and science in general, I'm going to do my best to rise to their defense, because the good that comes from both of them far outstrips the small negatives that they bring with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/a_labor_day_special.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252347814552"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/50-million-chemicals.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe8f82614ced0f26</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">50 Million Chemicals and Counting</title><published>2009-09-07T08:00:48Z</published><updated>2009-09-07T08:00:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/BG5jYKqPm9k/50-million-chemicals.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/50-million-chemicals.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) will announce the 50 millionth registered chemical substance in its Registry, tomorrow (8th September).

As the ISCA Secretariat put it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We are seeking volunteers to pit themselves against the entries — and prove to the judges just how human they are!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The test involves using a computer interface to chat (type messages) for 5 minutes with a judge, who does the same with the program, not knowing which is which. The judge has to determine which is the true human.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It's no accident that the &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/632/"&gt;next-to-last xkcd strip&lt;/a&gt; dealt with a version of this problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Suspicion.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Fine, walk away.  I&amp;#39;m gonna go cry into a pint of Ben&amp;amp;Jerry&amp;#39;s Brownie Batter(tm) ice cream [link], then take out my frustration on a variety of great flash games from PopCap Games(r) [link]." src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Suspicion.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click on the image for a larger version.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've looked around, and asked around, but if the chat logs for this year's competition have been posted, I can't find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's actually an &lt;a href="http://vkcouplestesting.com/"&gt;xkcd VK testing site&lt;/a&gt; (that's a reference to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voight-Kampff_machine"&gt;Voight-Kampff machine&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;). For more discussion, see &lt;a href="http://blag.xkcd.com/2009/09/05/vk-couples-testing/"&gt;the xkcd blag&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I hope no hearts out there are broken, but it’s important to know these things.  Bots can handle thousands of connections at once, so you don’t know who else your internet partner is chatting with.  There’s nothing worse than a Turing Test coming back positive for chlamydia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — Shalom Lappin responded by email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Sorry I missed you at Interspeech. I was one of the judges for the Loebner prize. The contest was organized locally by Philip Jackson of the University of Sussex, and he might be able to provide you with the transcripts of the interactions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;None of the judges had any difficulty in distinguishing human from non-human interlocutors after the first or second turn in the conversation. The two main features which allowed me to identify a human vs. a non-human agent are (i) capacity for fluent domain general discourse marked by frequent and unpredictable changes in topic, (ii) willingness to allow the judge to take over the conversation, (iii) capacity to handle ellipsis, pronouns, and non-sentential fragments, and (iv) typing errors and corrections in human but not program contributions. The relative absence of progress in developing general purpose conversational agents contrast sharply with the substantial progress of the past 10-15 years in task driven, domain specific dialogue management systems and other types of NLP. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Do not spare them, but kill both man and    woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’” (1 Samuel 15:3)  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No. 3&lt;/strong&gt;: A command of Moses:  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Do not allow a sorceress to live.” (Exodus 22:18)  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No. 4&lt;/strong&gt;: The ending of Psalm 137, a psalm which was made into a disco    calypso hit by Boney M, is often omitted from readings in church:  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us – he who    seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.” (Psalm 137:9)  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No. 5&lt;/strong&gt;: Another blood-curdling tale from the Book of Judges, where an    Israelite man is trapped in a house by a hostile crowd, and sends out his    concubine to placate them:  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped    her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. At    daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell    down at the door and lay there until daylight. When her master got up in the    morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his    way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her    hands on the threshold. He said to her, ‘Get up; let’s go.’ But there was no    answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.” (Judges    19:25-28)  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No. 6&lt;/strong&gt;: St Paul condemns homosexuality in the opening chapter of the    Book of Romans:  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “In the same way also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were    consumed with passion for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men    and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error.” (Romans    1:27) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No. 7&lt;/strong&gt;: In this story from the Book of Judges, an Israelite leader,    Jephthah, makes a rash vow to God, which has to be carried out:  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord, and said, ‘If you will give the    Ammonites into my hand, then whoever comes out of the doors of my house to    meet me, when I return victorious from the Ammonites, shall be the Lord’s,    to be offered up by me as a burnt-offering.’ Then Jephthah came to his home    at Mizpah; and there was his daughter coming out to meet him with timbrels    and with dancing. She was his only child; he had no son or daughter except    her. When he saw her, he tore his clothes, and said, ‘Alas, my daughter! You    have brought me very low; you have become the cause of great trouble to me.    For I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot take back my vow.’”    (Judges 11:30-1, 34-5) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No. 8&lt;/strong&gt;: The Lord is speaking to Abraham in this story where God commands    him to sacrifice his son:  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; ‘Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of    Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains that    I shall show you.’ (Genesis 22:2)   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No. 9&lt;/strong&gt;: “Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.” (Ephesians 5:22) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No. 10&lt;/strong&gt;: “Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect,    not only to the good and gentle but also to the cruel.” (1 Peter 2:18)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;There's lots of stuff like this, of course, and often these are ignored in favour of passages more compatible with one's existing views (or, more disturbingly, these may be invoked for the same reason).  The point is that it is difficult to know which parts of the Bible to take as literal rules about how to live, which are metaphors, and which are, at best, outdated notions that society has rightly long rejected.  But what would happen if you tried to actually live the Bible literally today?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it happens, this little experiment has been tried by best-selling author and editor of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Esquire&lt;/span&gt; magazine, &lt;a href="http://www.ajjacobs.com/content/home.asp"&gt;A.J. Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;.  He describes his trials and tribulations (and new insights) during a year of following every rule in the Bible that he can in his book &lt;a href="http://www.ajjacobs.com/books/yolb.asp"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Year of Living Biblicall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;y.

But it's not cool because it provides "fresh support for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution".  This is about the historical &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; and genetic &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;mechanisms &lt;/span&gt;of evolution -- the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;fact&lt;/span&gt; has been well established for 150 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's the actual abstract and author summary:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Abstract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vestigial structures occur at both the anatomical and molecular levels, but studies documenting the co-occurrence of morphological degeneration in the fossil record and molecular decay in the genome are rare. Here, we use morphology, the fossil record, and phylogenetics to predict the occurrence of “molecular fossils” of the enamelin (&lt;i&gt;ENAM&lt;/i&gt;) gene in four different orders of placental mammals (Tubulidentata, Pholidota, Cetacea, Xenarthra) with toothless and/or enamelless taxa. Our results support the “molecular fossil” hypothesis and demonstrate the occurrence of frameshift mutations and/or stop codons in all toothless and enamelless taxa. We then use a novel method based on selection intensity estimates for codons (ω) to calculate the timing of iterated enamel loss in the fossil record of aardvarks and pangolins, and further show that the molecular evolutionary history of &lt;i&gt;ENAM&lt;/i&gt; predicts the occurrence of enamel in basal representatives of Xenarthra (sloths, anteaters, armadillos) even though frameshift mutations are ubiquitous in &lt;i&gt;ENAM&lt;/i&gt; sequences of living xenarthrans. The molecular decay of &lt;i&gt;ENAM&lt;/i&gt; parallels the morphological degeneration of enamel in the fossil record of placental mammals and provides manifest evidence for the predictive power of Darwin's theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Author summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enamel is the hardest substance in the vertebrate body. One of the key proteins involved in enamel formation is enamelin. Most placental mammals have teeth that are capped with enamel, but there are also lineages without teeth (anteaters, pangolins, baleen whales) or with enamelless teeth (armadillos, sloths, aardvarks, pygmy and dwarf sperm whales). All toothless and enamelless mammals are descended from ancestral forms that possessed teeth with enamel. Given this ancestry, we predicted that mammalian species without teeth or with teeth that lack enamel would have copies of the gene that codes for the enamelin protein, but that the enamelin gene in these species would contain mutations that render it a nonfunctional pseudogene. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced most of the protein-coding region of the enamelin gene in all groups of placental mammals that lack teeth or have enamelless teeth. In every case, we discovered mutations in the enamelin gene that disrupt the proper reading frame that codes for the enamelin protein. Our results link evolutionary change at the molecular level to morphological change in the fossil record and also provide evidence for the enormous predictive power of Charles Darwin's theory of descent with modification.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I can see why the reporter got somewhat confused.  But note what they say, as there is a subtle but important distinction: this provides evidence for the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;predictive power&lt;/span&gt; of evolutionary theory.  This &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; news, because it is sometimes argued that evolutionary research is purely descriptive.  Examples like this and the discovery of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Tiktaalik&lt;/span&gt; in the type and age of rocks where an intermediate fossil was predicted to occur show just how strong modern evolutionary ideas are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As evidence for the fact of evolution, though... *yawn* ... just put it on the pile with all the rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Reference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meredith, R.W., Gatesy, J., Murphy, W.J., Ryder, O.A., and Springer, M.S. 2009. &lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000634"&gt;Molecular Decay of the Tooth Gene Enamelin (ENAM) Mirrors the Loss of Enamel in the Fossil Record of Placental Mammals&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter continues to knock ‘em out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at Universe Today &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/08/20/latest-lro-image-solves-apollo-14-mystery/"&gt;Nancy Atkinson shows how&lt;/a&gt; an LRO Camera image answers a question that’s lasted for almost 40 years: how close did Apollo 14 astronauts Ed Mitchell and Alan Shepard get to Cone Crater before having to turn back due to lack of time? The answer is heart-breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LROC is also finding some things on the Moon we’ve never seen before, or least never had such great images of! Her keen eye spotted what looked for all the world (or worlds) like &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002061/"&gt;the track of a bouncing boulder as it fell downslope on the lunar surface&lt;/a&gt;. That’s sure what it looks like to me. And she has other very cool images to go with it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its 50 cm resolution of the Moon, what more will LROC show us? &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?s=hirise"&gt;A similar camera&lt;/a&gt; that’s been orbiting Mars for years has returned one devastating image after another. So keep your eyes open and trained on LRO. There’s lots more to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252344597897"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4405">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d1f7cd28c81433bd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="1000words" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="1000 words"/><category term="natureimages" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="nature images"/><title type="html">Romalea microptera</title><published>2009-09-07T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-06T18:22:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/09/post-42.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photograph by &lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Smith&lt;/strong&gt;, age 11.&lt;/p&gt;

(Also via &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera/2009/09/more_on_health_care_cjr_link_t.php"&gt;Bioephemera&lt;/a&gt;, who at least was kind enough to embed the video.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video, also at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17512-the-scientific-arguments-for-us-healthcare-reform.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;amp;nsref=online-news"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, takes data from studies by &lt;a href="http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/"&gt;Dartmouth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.oecd.org/home/0,2987,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt;, and uses &lt;a href="http://www.gapminder.org/"&gt;Gapminder&lt;/a&gt; to make the graphs come alive.  It helps explain one of the paradoxes behind health care in the U.S.:  we spend more than most other developed countries, and we get less for it.  The explanation — you’ll be unsurprised to hear — lies in our &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/12/13/change-the-incentive-structure/"&gt;screwy incentive system&lt;/a&gt;.  By making health care a matter of profit for various sets of people — doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies — we push into the background the incentive that we’d really like the system to have, namely keeping people healthy.  Changing those incentives doesn’t mean that Barack Obama decides what treatment you get from your doctor; it just means that we can focus human ingenuity on the task of making people healthier, rather than just making other people wealthier.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252343129062"><id gr:original-id="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/?p=1964">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30c40c299ddfd893</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Daily Mail Recommend Food In Pill Form</title><published>2009-09-07T16:12:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-07T16:12:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/daily-mail-recommend-food-in-pill-form/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Tomato pills "provide all the benefits of a Mediterranean diet" (according to the Daily Mail).&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jdc325.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=1781036&amp;amp;post=1964&amp;amp;subd=jdc325&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>jdc325</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252340986155"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4408">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1650bfa6e011856</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="1000words" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="1000 words"/><category term="natureimages" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="nature images"/><title type="html">Photo Contest Winners</title><published>2009-09-07T16:17:41Z</published><updated>2009-09-11T22:24:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/09/photo-contest-w.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow!

        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/stromatolites.html" rel=""&gt;Stromatolites&lt;/a&gt;, the fossilized colonies of filamentary cyanobacteria and other microbes, by James Kocher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/post-37.html" rel=""&gt;Nymphaea caerulea&lt;/a&gt;, the Egyptian blue Lily, by David Collins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/post-41.html" rel=""&gt;Archilochus colubris &lt;/a&gt;, the hummingbird killing the yellowjacket, by Darren Garrison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irascible judges like the pictures almost equally well, but, alas, we still have to choose among the three. Our judgment, fortunately, is impeccable, so we feel comfortable in declaring first-, second-, and third-place winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We judge Darren Garrison’s remarkable photograph of the hummingbird killing the yellowjacket to be the best of the 3 contenders, largely because of the skill and patience that must have gone into taking that picture.  Mr. Garrison is awarded his choice of an autographed copy of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/Why_Evolution_Works.html" rel="external "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Evolution Works (and Creationism Fails)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Matt Young and Paul K. Strode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unscientific-America-Scientific-Illiteracy-Threatens/dp/0465013058/" rel="external "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens our Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://165.230.98.36/acatalog/____1147.html" rel="external "&gt; &lt;em&gt;Why Intelligent Design Fails: A Scientific Critique of the New Creationism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ed. by Matt Young and Taner Edis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second place goes to Mr. Collins for the Egyptian blue lily. Mr. Kocher’s stromatolites have more scientific interest than Mr. Collins’s photograph, but we judged that the pictorial quality of Mr. Collins’s photograph outweighed the scientific interest in the stromatolites. Mr. Collins gets to choose a book after Mr. Garrison chooses, and Mr. Kocher will receive the remaining book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, besides the 18 contenders in the 3 categories, we received a vast number of excellent photographs, many of which we intend to declare as honorable mentions. We will display the honorable mentions on subsequent Mondays, beginning with photographs by 3 young ladies whose median age is 10.&lt;/p&gt;

A site debuting in time with &lt;a href="http://www.skeptrack.org/"&gt;SkepTrack&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.dragoncon.org/"&gt;Dragon*Con&lt;/a&gt;. A site which promises to expand our horizons, even if just a little, by way of finding more groups and more individuals who associate themselves with rational thinking and a skeptical world view. I’m talking, of course, about &lt;a href="http://ohioskeptic.com/grassrootsskeptics/"&gt;Grassroots Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You all know K.O. Myers, a.k.a. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/03/afternoon-inquisition-34/"&gt;Oskar Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, of Skepchick commenter and &lt;a href="http://suburbanpanic.com/"&gt;Suburban Panic!&lt;/a&gt; fame. Grassroots Skeptics is his baby. His Internet baby. Because he has a real-life baby outside of the Internet (and she’s adorable, if I may say so). He cares deeply about the skeptical movement and hopes for more and better things to come of it. Grassroots Skeptics’ aim is to become a centralized location for advertising your skeptical group’s activities, a tool that can be used to create new groups where there are none and a sounding board for new ideas. There are a lot of people out there who need reaching, whether they’re floundering on the edge of skepticism or just don’t know who else thinks the way they do, and Grassroots Skeptics is a conscious effort to reach out and pull in the stragglers, as well as get already-existing groups motivated to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of us here at Skepchick have been in on getting the site started (Jen on web design, Maria on calendar entries, myself on data entry), and I know I, personally, am really looking forward to seeing what improvements are made thanks to the introduction of Grassroots Skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go check out the site. Sign up for the &lt;a href="http://ohioskeptic.com/grassrootsskeptics/forum/"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;, send in your group’s information, plug your blog/site/podcast and get the word out! Grassroots Skeptics can be reached on Twitter (@&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/GRSkeptics"&gt;GRSkeptics&lt;/a&gt;), on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Grassroots-Skeptics/230555115257"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and by e-mail at GRSkeptics@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chelsea</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252338869990"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/the_blogginheadstv_controversy.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8d95954c4c1e4f70</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism"/><title type="html">The Blogginheads.tv Controversy</title><published>2009-09-07T15:29:50Z</published><updated>2009-09-07T15:29:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/fd9uzcUQrjc/the_blogginheadstv_controversy.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/the_blogginheadstv_controversy.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/22320?in=00:00&amp;amp;out=59:15"&gt;bloggingheads "diavlog" with David Dobbs and me&lt;/a&gt; was the first science-oriented installment to come out (more or less) since the repudiation of Bloggingheads.tv by &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/09/01/bloggingheads-and-the-old-challenges-of-new-tools/"&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/08/31/bye-to-bloggingheads/"&gt;Sean Carrol&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/04/bloggingheads-capo-non-grata/"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/phil_plait_ditches_blogginghea.php"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;, I think I should say something about why I did it and what I think about the whole thing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/the_blogginheadstv_controversy.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/the_blogginheadstv_controversy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/fd9uzcUQrjc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252338869989"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/urban_science_adventures_wins.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5756963fafe746c6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Urban Science Adventures Wins 2009 Black Weblog  Best Science/Technology Award!!!</title><published>2009-09-07T13:48:38Z</published><updated>2009-09-07T13:48:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/WOLXhF892BE/urban_science_adventures_wins.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/urban_science_adventures_wins.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/upload/2009/09/urban_science_adventures_wins/IAMNANCY.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="IAMNANCY.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;




 	&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was halfway through the trailer when I realized who Rachel Weisz was playing: Hypatia, one of the greatest women in all of history. It’s a story — a true one — of religious conflict in the Roman Empire as Christianity was becoming a major force, and the old multitheistic Egyptian religion was on its way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypatia was a scientist before there was modern scientist, a mathematician and great thinker who taught at the great Library of Alexandria. She was considered one of the greatest philosophers of her time, which then meant someone who studies the natural world. She was killed by a Christian mob during what was essentially an uprising. It’s one of history’s major tragedies. &lt;/p&gt;

The main focus of this emphasis on skepticism, of course, has been medicine, which makes sense, given that I'm a doctor and a cancer researcher, but I don't limit myself to just medicine. However, as part of my emphasis on science-based medicine (SBM) as being the best methodology to provide the best patient care that we can, besides the random quackery deconstructions,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tended to harp on two topics over the years. First, there's the subject of what Dr. R. W. has called "&lt;a href="http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html"&gt;quackademic medicine&lt;/a&gt;"; i.e., the infiltration of pseudoscience in the form of divisions or departments of "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) or "integrative medicine" (IM), where what used to be correctly considered quackery and pseudoscience is being "integrated" with scientific medicine. Indeed, I once even went to the trouble of compiling what I like to call my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/the_woo_aggregator.php"&gt;Academic Woo Aggregator&lt;/a&gt;, namely a list of medical schools that teach, research, and support quackademic medicine. It was last updated over a year ago and desperately needs a new update. Unfortunately, the thought of delving into the research necessary to identify more medical schools to add to that list fills me with a deep sense of depression; so I've been procrastinating. The second area that I've emphasized is how the federal government supports pseudoscience in the form of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/01/nccam_your_tax_dollars_at_work.php"&gt;studies of pseudoscience that it funds&lt;/a&gt; through our tax dollars, and how &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/maybe_nccam_isnt_so_bad_after_allnahhh.php"&gt;powerful interests protect it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical science is being corrupted by the creeping infiltration of pseudoscience into the very foundations of the most respected fortresses of scientific medicine. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/theres_no_woo_like_harvard_woo.php"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/05/integrative_medicine_at_yale_a_more_flui.php"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/md_anderson_enters_the_blogosphere_and_g.php"&gt;M.D. Anderson Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;. None of them are immune. What really bothers me, though, is that it's happening with almost no pushback. Rare is the complaint. The AMA is weak and hampered by its history of being more interested in protecting its turf than protecting patients. State medical boards are useless. In some cases, they even license quackery like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/why_would_naturopaths_want_to_prescribe.php"&gt;naturopathy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/07/more_on_legalized_quackery_in_arizona.php"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;. Criticizing the infiltration of woo into medicine generally garners the same reaction as farting loudly in a room, only not as polite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's exactly why I applaud Dr. Lloyd Oppel and the British Columbia Medical Association. They've &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/medical-group-slams-colleges-energy-healing-courses/article1270225/"&gt;done what far more medical associations ought to be doing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/thanks_dr_oppel_we_need_to_see_a_lot_mor.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/thanks_dr_oppel_we_need_to_see_a_lot_mor.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/hbnD24wWVs8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252331883222"><id gr:original-id="http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2009/09/fence-lizards-versus-fire-ants.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3df54a7e65815ed3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Fence lizards versus fire ants: Evolutionary fail?</title><published>2009-09-07T07:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-07T07:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/zH7Uqo0iy5E/fence-lizards-versus-fire-ants.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2009/09/fence-lizards-versus-fire-ants.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">As many know, this is the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species. If I may be so bold, one of the things that might distinguish our thinking about evolution in the last 50 years from the first hundred years might be the speed at which natural selection can operate. For a long time, we thought of evolution taking long times: millions of years would be needed to see the gradual accumulation of changes. We learned in the past few decades that we can see the effects of selection over the course of a few decades.

There are a few fast changing situations that press should press the fast forward button on natural selection. Invasions are one. That’s why they’re invasions, not slow expansions.

RESEARCH UPDATE: Clinical Tests for Meniscal Lesions  Dan Lorenz, MS, PT, ATC/L, CSCS  It has been estimated that approximately 27% of all outpatient physical therapy visits are for knee pain.1 Of the many possible lesions causing pain, one common source is from a meniscal lesion. Recently, Meserve et al2 did a meta-analysis summarizing the accuracy of clinical tests for assessing meniscal lesions of the knee. Previous researchers have performed meta-analyses on clinical tests for meniscus tear, but failed to account for the variability and in test sensitivity and specificity due to differences in methodological quality among the studies.3-5 Because of that, diagnostic accuracy could be skewed. Clinicians should select tests with the highest sensitivity or negative likelihood ratio to rule out meniscal injury, or conversely, rule in meniscal injury with tests having high specificity or positive likelihood ratios.1 The purpose of this update is to provide a synopsis of what was found in their review.  Eleven studies satisfied the authors criteria of sixty-four total considered for potential review. Joint line tenderness, Apley’s, and McMurray’s were reviewed based on them being the most common tests utilized. Ege’s and Thessaly tests were also evaluated, but the quality of the studies was not good based on small sample sizes. Of note, diagnostic tests findings were interpreted without considering whether the lateral or medial meniscus was torn.  The researchers ultimately found that:     Joint line tenderness was found to be the superior test in terms of sensitivity, followed by the McMurray’s and then Apley’s.     Specificity values were larger with Apley’s compared to joint line tenderness and McMurray’s.     Ege’s Test and the Thessaly Test,6-7 tests that have either compression with weight bearing or clinician-applied axial rotation, were found to have the strongest diagnostic accuracy, but with smaller samples in the studies.       Based on this review, like any other special test used clinically, a combination of a thorough history along with a physical exam will help the clinician differentially diagnose conditions that are presented to them. As with many other tests used for other pathologies, it appears that using several tests to detect meniscal lesions is supported by the literature.     EDITOR’S NOTE: The results are interesting and clinically applicable. Anecdotally, I have always observed that joint line pain and pain with deep knee flexion, either with weightbearing or passively, where the most indicative of meniscal pathology in my hands. Conversely, passively extending the knee into hyperextension seems to be uncomfortable in patients with anterior horn tears. One test that just doesn’t seem to work well for me is the Apley’s test. Sounds like the test may still useful as the specificity is high. What has your experience been? What other tests you feel are helpful in detecting a meniscal lesion? Thanks for the review Dan.

Now that Labor Day is here, we get into a whole other set of rituals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One ritual which is sure to become popular is summer sledding.  It turns out there's a park not to far from here with astroturf hills and a sign that basically says, "you are absolutely not allowed to go get a nice piece of cardboard and use it to sled down the turf hills.  Really, don't do it no matter how fun it looks."&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/upload/2009/09/sledding_in_summer_and_other_h/DSC00031.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/upload/2009/09/sledding_in_summer_and_other_h/DSC00031-thumb-195x146-18769.jpg" width="195" height="146" alt="DSC00031.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; That's my kiddo and her friend on their bajillionth run.  The mosquitoes were vicious, but the kids didn't care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real ritual for Labor Day is my wife's invention.  After sufficient sleep, we put on good shoes and head over to the Temple for their big Labor Day fair.  It's free to all, and there's a petting zoo, train rides, food, moon walks---basically anything a kid could want.  The only thing lacking is shade.  After we exhaust ourselves there, we head over to a very cute town nearby, really the only thing around here that looks like a town rather than a sprawling suburb.  There's a huge art fair in the village green with the usual booths, etc.  The cider mill opens up as well, with the requisite fresh, cold cider, doughnuts, and bees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At both events we'll see plenty of people we know, but we get to cap it all off hanging out with my oldest friend and his kids.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, summer, I hardly knew thee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/sledding_in_summer_and_other_h.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/WK6LHwf4p0M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252329746300"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1574">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/472c5a2505cb33eb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Dragon*con"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Podcasting"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Psychology"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="You Tube"/><category term="skeptic zone"/><category term="travel"/><category term="Ben Radford"/><category term="parade"/><category term="podcast"/><category term="skeptic track"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Dragon*Con Day Two</title><published>2009-09-07T11:29:15Z</published><updated>2009-09-07T11:29:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/HT1ad2GqT_8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/?p=1574"/><summary xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_YgLlJL5_Y

I’ve known him for a while, but have never heard him decry any form of religion.  Now, as reported by &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;, May has spoken out against fundamentalism, arguing that the tenets of unquestioning belief may have been useful in earlier societies, but should now be discarded as inimical to progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In such systems, there is unquestioning respect for authority. Faith trumps evidence. But if indeed this is broadly the explanation for how co-operative behaviour&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline!important"&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue!important;font-weight:400;font-size:13px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has evolved and been maintained in human societies, it could be very bad news. Because although such authoritarian systems seem to be good at preserving social coherence and an orderly society, they are, by the same token, not good at adapting to change.” [Quote from May]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of fundamentalism, not just in the Muslim world but in the United States, and within the Catholic Church, could actually make global co-operation more difficult at a time when an unprecedented level of teamwork was needed, Lord May said. “If you take the view that in times of stress, authoritarian hierarchies tend to resist change, what the history of religion has been has been towards a softening, less dogmatic values, but under stress you simplify complex problems to simple mantras,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A new species of giant rat — 82 cm (32 inches!) long, with no apparent fear of humans — has been found living in a volcano in New Guinea.  It was discovered by a BBC team filming in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then trackers accompanying the team managed to trap a live specimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had a cat and it was about the same size as this rat,” says Buchanan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trapped rat measured 82cm in length from its nose to its tail, and weighed approximately 1.5kg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had a silver-brown coat of thick long fur, which the scientists who examined it believe may help it survive the wet and cold conditions that can occur within the high volcano crater. The location where the rat was discovered lies at an elevation of over 1,000m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a video of this gigantic murid &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8210000/8210394.stm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s surprisingly cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although touted as a new species, it looks very similar to another giant rat discovered in New Guinea in June, 2007 and discussed in a &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/12/photogalleries/giantrat-pictures/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; post&lt;/a&gt;.  That rat looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

This is how &lt;em&gt;Newsweek's&lt;/em&gt; Lisa Miller sums up the thinking of Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lobdell's deconversion narrative, &lt;em&gt;Losing My Religion&lt;/em&gt;, refrains from both bombast and suggestions of dopiness. By his very choice of genre—memoir rather than apologia—Lobdell enters a different territory of the new atheism, one already inhabited by several other counter conversion narrators, including John Loftus...and Dan Barker. &lt;a href="http://www.christiancentury.org/article.lasso?id=7793"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There are people on both sides of this debate who claim that anyone who disagrees is a "dope." &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My contention is that anyone who claims this is himself ignorant!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Check out &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/is-atheism-rationally-coercive.html"&gt;this post of mine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/06/one-of-surprising-discoveries-of-modern.html"&gt;this one too&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, there are ignorant people on both sides of the fence. But just because someone disagrees does not mean that person is ignorant at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I argue in my book [which is presently being reprinted], it's about seeing things differently along with &lt;strong&gt;WHY&lt;/strong&gt; we should see things differently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It might make someone feel good to think the other side is ignorant. It might make someone appear to be intelligent and also help him gain many followers. But to claim that anyone who disagrees is a "dope" is the height of ignorance in my opinion. I would never follow someone who made such a claim. I would never follow someone so cocksure of himself when ignorance is the rule and knowledge is the exception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now yes, I happen to agree with the so-called &lt;em&gt;New Atheists&lt;/em&gt; and I appreciate all they have done to open up a debate on the issues. But my goal is to reach believers, not to chide them or to rally the skeptical troops (both worthy goals in and of themselves). Again. My aim is to reach believers, like Barker, Lobdell and others are attempting to do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5844809164316650136?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The book is a look at six Christian families and how they homeschool their children.  Not every family fits the stereotype I know I have in my mind.  Some are impressive; others leave much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following passage highlights a family that is about as Christian and conservative as you can get.  It’s not necessarily typical of homeschooling.  It’s just one glimpse of one family’s mentality about the public schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Father Gary:] “I’m not a wise man in the world’s things.  I’m not even academically able to teach a lot of subjects and neither is my wife.  We resolved in ourselves years and years ago that if we were able to teach our children character, teach them how to read so that they could read the Bible, we would have done all that is necessary for them to survive this world.  And we’re not going to put ourselves up under other people’s ideas of what an educated person is.  So we’ve taught each one of them that we would be just as proud to see them hanging off a garbage truck, knowing that they don’t lie, steal, cheat, and despise God.” (p. 72)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary has returned to the kitchen by this point and has been listening to his daughter describe their schoolwork.  “We started homeschooling back before it became popular,” he recounts.  “Our eldest daughters are twenty-five years old now and they never went to a public school for a day.”  He pulls out a chair from the kitchen table and settles himself in it.  “The public schools are being assaulted by Satan,” he continues.  “In the public schools, we’d be worried about our daughters being raped, assaulted, learning Satan worship, fighting, all the guns, the deaths in the schools, knifings.  Teachers molesting children.  Homosexuals, you know, demanding their wickedness be crammed into the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Daughter] Sharon shakes her head in disapproval.  “The only reason that I would want to go to the public school,” she says, “would be for the socialization.  That’s the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “But you have that at church,” Gary points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharon agrees.  “We have that anywhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And you have that going to Wal-Mart,” Gary adds.  (p. 75)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's been sitting on my desk at home (which I rarely use owing to my schedule and the fact that my computer is all but buster) ever since then, but tonight I have some time and thought I'd finally break it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brochure and &lt;a href="http://yodersgoodhealthrecipe.com/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Yoder's Good Health Recipe website&lt;/a&gt; are both ripe for a good skeptical takedown, and unless I miss my guess, they're in violation of FDA regulations, and to that end I've reported them. My missive to the FDA will be at the end of the post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buckle in, kids; this is gonna be a long one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like to begin by directing your attention to the picture of the "tincture," as they call it on your website, that I have supplied above. When I first checked out their website, I was struck by how much it resembled a somewhat modernized version of stereotypical "snake oil" or "patent medicine" cures from the era of American westward expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For any non-US folks not quite familiar with that piece of pop culture lore, one of the lasting symbols of the Wild West, up there with gunslingers, howling Apache warriors, and high-noon &lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SqSkPAskYdI/AAAAAAAAA2g/W5jzIIX72Ag/s1600-h/Yoder2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:200px;height:163px" title="Tastes like horse piss, you say? Why, that just means it&amp;#39;s workin&amp;#39;!" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SqSkPAskYdI/AAAAAAAAA2g/W5jzIIX72Ag/s200/Yoder2.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;shootouts, is the traveling huckster: a "doctor" going from settlement to settlement with his cart full of potions guaranteed to treat whooping cough, consumption, influenza, rheumatism, astigmatism, nepotism...You name it, there was a bottle full of unidentifiable liquid somewhere in the good "doctor's" Conestoga with your ailment's name on it, most looking more or less like the ones pictured above on the right. He'd heave into town one day and hawk his wares to anyone who would listen, every inch the showman. They'd buy his "patent medicines" (often claimed to be infused with "snake oil," hence "snake oil salesman" as modern slang for "quack") to cure their illnesses and if anyone ever noticed they didn't work, he was already three towns away working them over the same way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compare the two pictures. If you don't see a resemblance, well, perhaps you need a draught of Doc Akusai's Astounding Ocular Enervation Medication!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, the resemblance between the two says nothing about the efficacy of Yoder's tincture; a heroin syringe looks an awful lot like a vaccine syringe, and there's a world of difference between the two. I point it out because it seems funny to me that a modern alternative medical product should so closely resemble its ineffective forebears. I'm willing to bet that the Yoder's company is not intentionally defrauding people, but I do think that their tincture is likely useless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's begin with their brochure. It is a simple trifold document, printed in brown on light beige paper. The front, under the product name, says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;All Natural Ingredients&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cider Vinegar and Herbs too...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ginseng, goldenseal, echinacea, valerian, ginger, black cohosh, chamomile, black walnut, licorice root, fenugreek, star anise, cinnamon, cloves, chickweed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Money-Back Guarantee&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It set my BS detector alight immediately. On the first page inside, it says the same thing that is stated on the homepage of their website, with the exception of the following, which is elided from the brochure:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Yoder's Good Health Recipe is a unique all-natural herbal tonic that has been used by satisfied customers for over fifteen years. It's an old family recipe that combines the goodness of aged apple cider vinegar and fourteen herbs and spices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Which I point out because it makes the tincture sound like something from Colonel Sanders' kitchen. Anyway, onward:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The use of medicinal herbs is sometimes misunderstood and is often ridiculed by many within the medical profession.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I don't think that it is misunderstood; it is understood as (mostly) an archaic throwback to a time before modern scientific medicine. When it is ridiculed, it is because modern "herbalism" has nothing going for it but appeals to popularity and antiquity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than studying the history of herbal medicines, many of the young doctors choose to ignore it in favor of high-tech, high-priced pharmaceuticals that are supported by millions of dollars of advertising.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This single sentence is chock-full of weasel words and inaccuracies. Let's take it piece by piece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than studying the history of herbal medicines&lt;/blockquote&gt;This implies two things that I can see immediately: that the "history" or herbal medicine is worth studying over the efficacy of herbalism in modern times, and that that history is full of success stories worth reading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;many of the young doctors&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is a subtle instance of a poisoning the well &lt;i&gt;ad hominem&lt;/i&gt;: the "young" doctors don't know as much as "old" people who've been around the block a few times; they're just naive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;choose to ignore it in favor of high-tech, high-priced pharmaceuticals&lt;/blockquote&gt;How is "high-tech" bad? And what does the price of a treatment have to do with its efficacy? And do they just completely ignore that aspirin, quinine, and all opiates are herb-derived?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;that are supported by millions of dollars of advertising.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is simply an appeal to "Big Pharma:" "They spend millions trying to get you to buy the product, therefore it must not work." Non-sequitur. Also mostly not true. When was the last time you saw a commercial for vaccines? For old standard ACE inhibitors like Lisinopril? For CT scans? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fact is that most modern medical treatments &lt;i&gt;aren't&lt;/i&gt; advertised; advertisement is relegated to a few over-the-counter drugs and a handful of cutting-edge prescriptions. I figure there are at least as many commercials for "supplements" (be they weight-loss treatments, male enhancement pills, homeopathic remedies, or plan old vitamin pills) as there are for actual FDA-approved medical treatments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What they don't mention is that the "high-tech" medicines and treatments offered by those "young" doctors are supported by millions of dollars of &lt;i&gt;research&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving on:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe that there is a place for medicinal herbs right along side the thousands of synthetic drugs on the market today.&lt;/blockquote&gt;If they prove their medical effectiveness in a battery of randomized controlled trials, then have at it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The herbs contained in our recipe have been used both individually and in combination to relieve and/or treat over 130 ailments and conditions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here is the beginning of what I think of as their semi-slick wording. Their herbs "have been used." Here, they aren't &lt;i&gt;technically&lt;/i&gt; saying that they &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt;, but they're skating damn close to that line. The next line is the same:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our customers use Good Health Recipe for treating or relieving such things as: arthritis, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, sinus congestion, allergies, blood sugar, digestive problems, colds, other health problems&lt;/blockquote&gt;Again, they aren't really claiming the tincture &lt;i&gt;treats&lt;/i&gt; these ailments, only that their customers &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; it to treat these ailments. I'm no lawyer, but I'm not sure that kind of thin qualification really cuts the mustard as far as FDA regulations are concerned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next paragraph reads, to me, almost like a tacit admission of the tincture's ineffectiveness:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Good Health Recipe is not a cure-all. Different herbs and cider vinegar affect different people in different ways. It may help you in one way, while your friend or spouse may experience something entirely different.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This says to me "There is no reliable effect from Good Health Recipe. Feel free to attribute hwatever positive effects you feel, if any, to Yoder's Good Health Recipe." If you cannot pin down a systematic effect for the product, then a quick application of Occam's Razor shows that there is likely no effect at all, merely some confirmation bias and &lt;i&gt;post hoc, ergo propter hoc&lt;/i&gt; reasoning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Many of our health problems are caused by chemical imbalances within our bodies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Weasel word: "many." The word's definition is so broad and subject to interpretation as to be useless. I would take issue with the claim that "many" health problems are caused by chemical imbalances, but I have no idea how many "many" really is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The herbs and cider vinegar seem to help the body to restore the proper chemical balance with the end result being that you feel better.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Apart from the atrocious phrasing here ("the end result being that you feel better?"), this claim directly contradicts their previous pseudo-claims, is incredibly vague, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; is qualified out of usefulness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beginning with the latter and working backwards, the herbs and vinegar "seem to" do something. That something is "restore the proper chemical balance," which is subject to broad interpretation: what is the "proper" balance? Additionally, the end result is that "you feel better," a vague claim if I ever heard one. Usually after a few days of being sick, you "feel better" as the sickness runs its course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the contradictions: they're positing some sort of "chemical imbalance" model of disease (or at least "many" health problems), but only one of the problems they listed on the first page could even be said to be caused by chemical imbalance: "blood sugar," by which I assume they mean blood sugar problems like diabetes and hypoglycemia. Sure, this is a chemical imbalance: too much or not enough insulin. The rest are pathogenic or totally unrelated to "chemical imbalances." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They make vague claims about what the tincture &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; cure and then propose a method by which it &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; work that wouldn't actually effect most of the problems they claimed it &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; cure in the first place. Of course, when confronted, I figure they'll plead ignorance: "We never said anything definitively."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next paragraph details their money-back guarantee: use the product for sixty days and, if you don't think it has helped you "in some way," you can return it to the vendor with the receipt and get a full refund "&lt;b&gt;NO QUESTIONS ASKED.&lt;/b&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, their criteria are hugely open-ended: all it has to do is help "in some way." If you think it cleared up your allergies, it worked. If you think it dulled your arthritis pain, it worked. If you think it helped you stop vomiting, it worked. They are implicitly urging you to attribute &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; improvement in &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; aspect of your health to Yoder's Good Health Recipe. Given that most diseases clear up well inside sixty days, chances are you'll find &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;. Either the Yoder's can target whatever your problem is (no matter what your problem is) and magically clear it up, or you're biased and engaging in fallacious reasoning. I know which &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; think is more likely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, if you're plunked down the cash for their product, chances are you've already bought into the herbal medicine racket to some degree. It is therefore unlikely that you won't let your own biases color your perception of the tincture's effectiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Third, how can Yoder's make guarantees for the retail merchants? Doesn't &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; return policy determine what you can and can't bring back, and how it gets refunded? I don't buy for a second that Yoder's can dictate to the retailer "You must give a full refund for an empty bottle of Yoder's."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If the taste of vinegar bothers you or you think the taste is a little strong, just mix it with water, fruit juice, or other liquid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;That somehow makes it sound even &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It's important that you take it &lt;b&gt;EVERYDAY&lt;/b&gt;. It won't help if you just take it occasionally.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Where is the evidence for this dosage? Hell, where is the evidence for &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; dosage?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Please tell your friends about it, that's the only way we advertise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Except, of course for brochures.&lt;br&gt;The next page is some FAQs, beginning with:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What is Good Health Recipe?&lt;br&gt;It is an all-natural supplement containing aged apple cider vinegar and fourteen herbs and spices and made using an old mountain recipe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;An "old mountain recipe?" I shudder to think that somebody would find that more reliable than modern medicine. To me it conjures up images of an arthritic old crone in a log cabin tossing handfuls of dried plants into a kettle over an open fire and feeding it to her grandkids while insisting that the foul taste is evidence of its efficacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;How do I know that Good Health Recipe is a good product?&lt;br&gt;Good Health Recipe has been around a long time. We have thousands of satisfied customers using it. It has never been advertised or promoted as the latest "miracle of the month."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Note the phrasing of the question: the question doesn't ask how one knows how the recipe &lt;i&gt;works&lt;/i&gt;, merely how one knows it is a "good product," whatever that means. The answer is an appeal to antiquity followed by an appeal to popularity followed by what I'm going to call an "appeal to humility:" "We don't promote ourselves a lot, therefore our product must be good."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What makes Good Health Recipe unique?&lt;br&gt;Many products on the market contain synthesized chemicals or fillers. Good Health Recipe DOES NOT. Good Health Recipe contains no preservatives, no added sugars, and NO ALCOHOL. The ginseng is 100% Kentucky Mountain Ginseng, the best in the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is basically just two Doggerels: &lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2006/07/doggerel-29-chemicals.html"&gt;"chemicals"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2006/06/doggerel-15-natural.html"&gt;"natural."&lt;/a&gt; Those are followed by an unfounded claim that Kentucky Mountain Ginseng is "the best in the world." And what's up with the capitalization of "NO ALCOHOL?" Are they teetotalers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not that I, a teetotaler extraordinaire, have room to judge, but what's wrong with having alcohol in your recipe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If I use Good Health Recipe daily what health benefits can I expect?&lt;br&gt;This is a difficult question to answer. The Food and Drug Administration does not allow us to make direct or implied claims of any kind. We recommend that your educate yourself about the historic used of these herbs and cider vinegar.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is their only mention of the FDA regulations regarding their product, and they seem to think that saying "We're not allowed to make direct or implied claims" somehow ameliorates or renders nonexistent the &lt;i&gt;clear&lt;/i&gt; implications they have made up until this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, they haven't made any &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt; claims, but their &lt;i&gt;heavy&lt;/i&gt; implications come &lt;i&gt;damn&lt;/i&gt; close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On to the back:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Many of our customers enjoy using our recipe first thing when they wake up in the morning. It seems to give them an eye-opening boost that carries them through the day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I question the veracity of this statement. Even if it is true, I imagine that it has more to do with drinking a swig of vinegar on a Monday morning and less to do with the herbs mixed into the vinegar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If you're driving a long distance, take Good Health Recipe along. An occasional sip will keep you alert. Many truckers carry it with them at all times.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There's that pesky "many" again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When you first start using Good Health Recipe, you may experience a cleansing of your bowels. Don't worry, if it happens, it's because you need it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Since when does anyone &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; diarrhea? "If you poop in your pants, it's only because Yoder's magically identified that you needed it and made you evacuate your bowels into your trousers." Add colon-cleanse woo to the list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If you suffer from "acid reflux" or heartburn, daily usage of Good Health Recipe will give you relief.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So let me get this straight: if I have &lt;i&gt;acid&lt;/i&gt; reflux, a condition caused by excess stomach acid entering the esophagus, your proposed solution is to &lt;i&gt;drink a bottle of acid?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone failed chemistry class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean, I hate to belabor the point here, but this is just ridiculous on its face. It's like saying "If you suffer from high cholesterol, eat a Big Mac a day," or "If you suffer from pet allergies, you should get a dozen cats." Seriously, guys? You treat heartburn with &lt;i&gt;antacids&lt;/i&gt; and by &lt;i&gt;avoiding&lt;/i&gt; acidic foods. This is simple stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also feel the need to point out that not only is this ridiculous, but it is a &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt; claim for efficacy. Next time you go to the hospital with a perforated esophagus, tell them Yoder's sent you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the rest of this page is silliness similar to what we've seen before: "Many customers" claim something. This means that Yoder's isn't making the medical claim, and that they don't have to back up the claim about their customers because "many" is so open-ended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who are these many customers? Well, they sound the classic woo klaxon of the "testimonial" loud and clear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Thanks to Good Health Recipe my blood pressure has really dropped."&lt;br&gt;G.P., Charleston, WV&lt;/blockquote&gt;What else are you doing for your blood pressure, GP? Did your diet change otherwise? Are you exercising more? Are you taking an ACE inhibitor? We'll never know, because you're not a critical thinker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"As a Health Professional, I have prescribed Good Health Recipe to my patients as part of an overall health improvement plan. I have found that it reduces sugar cravings, while removing toxins from the body."&lt;br&gt;M.G., DC, Louisville, KY&lt;/blockquote&gt;A doctor of chiropractic has no right "prescribing" anything; his or her expertise is limited only to the cracking of bones and the mending of imaginary "subluxations." A DC is not a dietitian and has no business telling his or her clients what to eat. This DC is basing his or her conclusions on personal experience and the testimony of his or her "patients," and the final appeal to vague "toxins" disqualifies this appeal to authority even further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Wow. I don't know what's in this stuff but send me six more bottles."&lt;br&gt;C.W., Dallas, TX&lt;/blockquote&gt;Really, C.W.? Because I know what's in it and I don't even have the bottle. It's listed right on the front of the brochure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from a few more redundant testimonials, that's the entirety of the brochure. I turn my skeptical eye now to their website, which only compounds their legal problems, as far as I can tell. The &lt;a href="http://yodersgoodhealthrecipe.com/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt; is mostly identical to the brochure. Some things are added, some left out, and some reworded. One thing reworded for the web is rather interesting:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Many of our customers enjoy using our recipe first thing in the morning. It gives them an eye-opening boost that carries them through the day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Recall that above the equivalent claim used the qualifier "seems to" when describing the eye-opening boost. I'm not sure what it means, if anything, but I find it interesting that the website is more explicit here than the brochure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few things that don't exist in the brochure:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The way we make our recipe is truly unique. We hand mix and hand bottle our product in an FDA-approved Amish kitchen in South Carolina. &lt;/blockquote&gt;This comes after the statement that the FDA restricts the kinds of claims they can make; it seems to be a back-door way of introducing the idea of FDA approval. Knowing how people think, they won't remember that it is only the &lt;i&gt;kitchen&lt;/i&gt; that is FDA-approved (a necessary condition for &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; selling food commercially) and instead remember only "FDA-approved" and associate it with the product as a whole. This tactic, though not outright lying, is dishonest.&lt;br&gt;At the bottom of the page, they say:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not make any direct or implied claims regarding the use of our recipe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Actually, they make at least one direct claim and several heavy implications. Do they think that just saying this over and over again makes it true?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We advise you to seek the advice of your health professional before using our product for any particular health condition or ailment. We further advise you to seek the advice of your health professional before discontinuing any medication that you may be presently prescribed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;We have seen how broadly they interpret the phrase "health professional." As long as your naturopath advises you quit taking your metformin and use only Yoder's for your diabetes, they're cool. They specifically do not mention "doctor" here, perhaps because doctors are all "young" and "high-tech."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="http://yodersgoodhealthrecipe.com/id2.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Our Story" page&lt;/a&gt; recounts the dramatic tale of the beginnings of Yoder's Good Health Recipe, tuned to hit a number of down-home American demographic high-points. I'll skip and jump through it, as it's rather long, but I'll try to get all the good stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;About ten years ago, I was injured and was required to recuperate at home for an extended period of time. After way too much time spent in front of the television, I decided (actually, my wife decided for me) to go through a bunch of boxes that had been stored away for a number of years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;If you're injured and in extended home recovery, the extended physical exertion of digging through old boxes is probably low on your list of stuff you should do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While going through these boxes, I came across an old tattered recipe that was handwritten on five unlined pages. It was my Grandmother's recipe for her tonic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here we have the cliche of an old and significant item found in a musty attic, amidst trunks covered in decades of dust, old Christmas decorations, and boxes of unloved photographs. The recipe was even "tattered" and "handwritten." This is almost &lt;i&gt;written&lt;/i&gt; in sepia-tone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought back to the early mornings when Grandma would be busy in the kitchen to get breakfast on the table so that Grandpa could get an early start to his day as a farmer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The good woman working in the kitchen and the early-to-rise, hard-working American farmer: staples of the modern US cultural narrative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Once Grandma had the breakfast on the table, she would go over to her icebox (not a refrigerator), get a little jug out of it, and pour herself a little bitty glass of a reddish liquid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The old-timey nostalgia here is getting ridiculous. They didn't even have a fridge! That must mean Grandma's tonic worked!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me skip a bit, where our narrator makes the tincture and gives it to friends:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;After getting back some pretty good comments from my friends, I decided that I needed to go to the next step and to put the product into the hands of people who would be willing to buy it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;His friends maybe thought it worked. A ringing medical endorsement if ever I heard one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I didn't want our recipe to be "the miracle of the month". I wanted it to survive because it was a good product and not because we could come up with a gimmick to market it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Isn't intentionally calling your product out as &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; being a "miracle of the month" kind of a gimmick in itself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the years, we've received thousands of positive comments about our recipe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;But they have not conducted a single double-blind, controlled trial, or even attempted to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We still make it the same way that my Grandma did, except we make it in an FDA-approved Amish kitchen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And isn't "Amish" an advertising ploy used, like the rest of your story, to evoke feelings of rustic, down-home nostalgia for a non-existent past? That's how it's used in those &lt;a href="http://cache.consumerist.com/assets/resources/2008/01/amishheat.jpg"&gt;hokey full-page "Amish Fireplace" ads&lt;/a&gt; that are dolled up to look like actual news reports, or in any store claiming that their "Amish furniture" justifies exorbitant prices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It's still mixed by hand, bottled by hand, and labeled by hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And this means what?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We will never make it using a high-speed bottling line. It just wouldn't be the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is a clear case of what I call &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/09/appeal-to-metaphysics.html"&gt;"the appeal to metaphysics."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last page I'm going to look at (I can hear you sighing in relief from here) is called &lt;a href="http://yodersgoodhealthrecipe.com/id3.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Use of Herbs."&lt;/a&gt; It details the historical uses of the herbs contained in the product while at the same time claiming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Below, we have listed some of those uses, but we make it very clear that we do not claim nor imply that our product should be used for any of those ailments or conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a customer thinks the product may help him/her, that’s a decision based on his/her knowledge and not based on any claims by us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"I just told her that if she didn't give me the cash register, I was going to shoot her. I merely gave her the information to make a knowledgeable decision. I can't be held responsible for what happened when she chose not to give me the cash register."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, so that's a little exaggerated, but here again we see Yoder's &lt;i&gt;making explicit claims&lt;/i&gt; and then appearing to think that if they say "We're not making claims!" that they are not, in fact, making any claims. They can "make it very clear" all they want; it's still a lie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They do it again, further down the page:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not directly or indirectly make health claims, but several of the widely accepted benefits and features of natural apple cider vinegar are listed below.&lt;/blockquote&gt;After which they go on to say that vinegar is a natural antiseptic, that it helps normalize blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight, that it makes the heart stronger, and that it relieves arthritis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they didn't &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; or even &lt;i&gt;imply&lt;/i&gt; those claims. They said so, remember?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is with these people?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I direct you now to &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/apple-cider-vinegar"&gt;this WebMD article&lt;/a&gt; discussing the myths and truths of vinegar. It turns out that while most claims for vinegar are, and I quote, "unproven (or were disproved)," there are a few scientific leads that show vinegar &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; affect diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol and perhaps help with weight loss. All of the evidence, however, is from preliminary animal tests or single small-scale human tests (we're talking less than a dozen people).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The weight-loss experiment was carried out with &lt;i&gt;white&lt;/i&gt; vinegar, which is funny, because Yoder's claims&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Only real apple cider vinegar has any medicinal qualities. Don’t let anyone tell you differently...Many distilled vinegars are produced through a process using coal tar. It’s vinegar because it’s a mixture of acetic acid and water, but it’s pretty much worthless except for use as a preservative or cleaning fluid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I suppose, though, that I shouldn't let anyone tell me differently. I should just accept whatever Yoder's has to say. After all, it's not like they have a vested interest in my belief that only apple cider vinegar is medically useful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps the most telling comparison between Yoder's old-timey concoction and real medical science is the one regarding potassium. From Yoder's:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;-Rich source of potassium, an “artery softener”&lt;/blockquote&gt;From WebMD:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Long-term use of apple cider vinegar could cause low potassium levels and lower bone density.&lt;/b&gt; If you already have low potassium or osteoporosis, talk to your doctor before using apple cider vinegar.&lt;/blockquote&gt;That's right, folks: one of the claims that Yoder's is not actually claiming is in direct contradiction to modern medical recommendations. This is like a tobacco company claiming that cigarettes &lt;i&gt;cure&lt;/i&gt; cancer, except they don't have rustic nostalgia and a handmade, small business appeal going for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yoder's Good Health Recipe seems to be just what it appears: ineffective "patent medicine" nonsense. As I said before, though, I don't think that the people making and marketing Yoder's are intentional frauds, merely self-deluded herbalists who honestly believe in their product but have jumped headfirst into waters just a bit too deep for them, though it's entirely possible that I am being too generous in that estimation of their character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their little narrative is cute and probably effective for their target audience of backcountry rubes and hippie-types, but their ability to follow FDA policy is quite awful. They don't have the canniness to make untestably vague claims, nor do they, at any point, provide the standard FDA boilerplate warning. Instead, they cover their claims with qualifiers and attempt to pretend that their claims aren't really claims at all, kind of a homestyle marketing version of "You can't see me!" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's problematic and potentially tragic here is that, in their ineptitude, they have potentially exposed their (admittedly small) potential user base to major harm. It seems to me far less ethically justifiable to claim "This product will cure your high cholesterol, but I didn't say that" than to claim "This product will boost your immune system, though it must be admitted that neither is exactly on the moral up-and-up. Someone who might waver at purchasing a vaguely-worded supplement at Wal-Mart could likely pick up Yoder's because of its sheer specificity and end up in serious trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After spending the last couple of hours dissecting Yoder's Good Health Recipe, I am convinced more than ever that they are in violation of Food and Drug Administration regulations for the kinds of claims that supplements can make. To that end, as I mentioned  before, I have sent the following report to the FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations, which looks into, among other things, healthcare fraud:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hello,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recently picked up a brochure for an herbal supplement called "Yoder's Good Health Recipe" at a food market in eastern Ohio. The product is a mixture of apple cider vinegar and 14 herbs and spices that is claimed to have myriad effects on personal health. Their website is located at URL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://yodersgoodhealthrecipe.com/index.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It and the brochure I picked up contain multiple heavily implied claims for the types of health effects their Recipe will have and at least one that is explicit and direct. I will briefly quote a few directly from their website and brochure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(I would like to first provide the caveat that I am not a lawyer and so am not entirely familiar with FDA regulations for supplement claims. It merely appeared to me that the manufacturers of Yoder's went far beyond the bounds of what they can legally claim.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Redundant quote elided]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is followed by a list of the supposed benefits of the herbs, including:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Redundant quote elided]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and multiple others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beneath that, on the same web page, they list the supposed health benefits of apple cider vinegar, including "Helps make heart muscle stronger," "A natural antibiotic and antiseptic," and, perhaps the most egregious because it flies directly in the face of medical evidence regarding the long-term effects had by vinegar supplements on body potassium, "Rich source of potassium, an 'artery softener.'"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brochure says, and I quote directly:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Redundant quote elided]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These statements are such heavy implications that I believe them to be in breach of FDA regulations regarding dietary supplements. In addition to these extreme implications of efficacy, the brochure also makes one explicit medical claim (again quoting directly):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Redundant quote elided]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no medical evidence, to my knowledge, that apple cider vinegar (much less Yoder's specific mixture thereof) can have this effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The strange thing about Yoder's is that they seem to think if they say they aren't making any claims or implications about the medical effectiveness of their product, that the claims and implications they have made are somehow okay. This happens multiple times both on their website and in their brochure:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Redundant quotes elided]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What seems especially curious is that they are making perhaps dozens of claims, directly and implicitly, but seem to think that by naming their claims as non-claims, they have done nothing wrong. They essentially say "We aren't making any claims about our product, but here are the claims we are making about our product."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The website contains much more than I have quoted here, and the brochure contains yet more claims that do not appear on the website (e.g. the Good Health Recipe curbs cravings for sugar, will keep you awake while driving long distances, causes or helps you to lose weight, etc).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The manufacturers of Yoder's Good Health recipe seem to want it both ways: they want to make claims, both implied and direct, while convincing people that they are not making either type of claim. Perhaps I am wrong and these claims do technically fall within the bounds of their abilities as supplement manufacturers. Their extreme specificity (e.g. claiming that certain herbs in their Recipe can cure AIDS, that their Recipe is good for allergies and cholesterol), however, in the absence of solid medical evidence that their Recipe can do anything at all, seems to me to be out of bounds. They can say all they want that they aren't directly or implicitly making these claims; that doesn't actually make it true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm reporting Yoder's Good Health Recipe to the FDA in the hopes that they can be prevented from swaying people away from standard medical treatment for serious ailments due to the many and various claims they make for their product (however they want to frame them).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Akusai]&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'll give you an update should anything come of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-1340871803592684956?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252319543735"><id gr:original-id="http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/09/07/harder-better-faster-stronger/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/90eee7cadfecc825</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">harder, better, faster, stronger?</title><published>2009-09-07T03:53:43Z</published><updated>2009-09-07T03:53:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/rXkmKTRdDqM/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/09/07/harder-better-faster-stronger/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Contrary to popular sentiment and science fiction clichés, human evolution hasn’t stopped.

It would be an unrighteous act. It would be an unholy act. It would fail to satisfy his wrath. Going back to the illustration of the courts, it is not the duty of the court to forgive the offender. The same is true with God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poppycock!  Absolute poppycock.  The fact that I once touted this crap is a surprise to me now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this case the person primarily offended by our sins is God.  He is the primary offended party.  While others on a &lt;i&gt;horizontal plane&lt;/i&gt; might feel slighted by comparison, God is the primary one offended.  In this case, there doesn’t need to be any punishment between offender and offended, even though God is also the judge.  Why?  If God is a person at all then he responds towards us as a person does, a father, and even as a creator who cares for us, not a harsh and demanding judge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your Christian God is primarily a judge and not a father.  He’s an aloof potentate who rules his people like the Kings of old did over the serfs and peasants.  The very image bespeaks of a God who doesn’t really love us, but cares more for administering punishment to offenders in a kingdom of serfs.  But the Christian God wants to be known as a father, a person, a lover, and even as a friend of sinners--in Jesus.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be like living in a kingdom where we slightly offend each other from time to time (the horizontal plane).  But none of us would ever want any of our worst enemies to be punished in ways that the King will do when he's offended by the very same actions that have merely slighted us(on the vertical plane).  We would all desire that our enemies were all completely forgiven, including us ourselves, than suffer under the wrath of that aloof potentate who only cares about a infinite tit for a finite tat.  None of us would be happy about such a king at all, nor that he would have had to punish his own Son (himself?), when none of us would have wanted anyone to be punished at all.  We would think such a God is a monster, a weirdo, and even retarded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;All I am saying is that forgiveness between persons does not logically involve punishment, or retaliation, repentance, or reparations.&lt;/b&gt;  Show me the logical and rational relationship between punishment and forgiveness between persons.  That's all you have to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I'll say that our methods of punishment today are much more humane today by comparison; that all humane punishment should be for the purpose of rehabilitation anyway; and that God should give up on no one--no one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I'll say that the more I understand someone, the easier it is for me to forgive them.  That's why mothers seem to always love their sons no matter what they do.  Does God not understand why we do the very deeds we do?  Then he understands like no one else.  If he understands, then he cannot be angry.  Unless, of course, he's an aloof potentate who simply doesn't care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I may want someone who hit me to spend a few months in jail, or someone who stole from me to spend up to a year in jail, I would never want my worse enemies to be treated as Jesus suffered, nor spend eternity in hell, however conceived.  I would want everyone who has ever done anything to wrong me to eventually be forgiven.  All is eventually forgiven anyway, in time.  Why doesn't God do this, since he apparently has all the time in the world?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-113988612481144626?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The two most frequent targets of the wrath, sarcasm, frustration, and puzzlement of me and my partners in crime at SBM have been &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;Jenny McCarthy and her boyfriend Jim Carrey&lt;/a&gt; for their having emerged over the last two years as the most vocal celebrity faces of the anti-vaccine movement in general and the anti-vaccine organization &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; in particular and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=497"&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/a&gt; for her promotion of pseudoscience, quackery, and mysticism on her show. That doesn’t even count Oprah’s inking of a development deal with Jenny McCarthy to do her own weekday talk show, which has poised McCarthy to walk in the footsteps of previous Oprah proteges, such as Dr. Phil McGraw and Dr. Mehmet Oz. I’ve also lamented how celebrity physicians like &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=512"&gt;Robert “Bob” Sears&lt;/a&gt;, and the hosts of the daytime TV show &lt;a href="http://www.thedoctorstv.com"&gt;The Doctors&lt;/a&gt; have promoted, through the mantra of “balance,” &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=319"&gt;anti-vaccine views in particular&lt;/a&gt; and pseudoscience about health in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As bad as celebrities such as Oprah, Jim Carrey, and Jenny McCarthy are, though, no one views them as skeptics, at least no one I know and no one in the skeptical movement. Even the reporters and newscasters who credulously interview them, I suspect, realize that Oprah, Jim, and Jenny are not exactly the most scientific of people. Unfortunately, if there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years since I became more involved with the skeptical movement, it’s that being an agnostic, atheist, or skeptic is no guarantee against falling for pseudoscience. The problem is that when someone becomes associated with the skeptic movement for another reason, even if that person is a total woo-meister when it comes to medicine, they tend to be given a pass. I don’t give such people a pass because of their anti-religion views because I consider myself a skeptic and don’t really care much about religion, except when it intersects issues of science and health, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses refusing blood transfusions, faith healers offering prayer instead of medicine, and fundamentalists undermining the teaching of evolution. If someone who promotes pseudoscience is a prominent critic of religion, to me that makes it even worse when they spout nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m referring to &lt;a href="http://www.billmaher.com"&gt;Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt;, comedian and host of the HBO show &lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher"&gt;Real Time With Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to an anti-religion movie (&lt;a href="http://www.lionsgate.com/religulous"&gt;Religulous&lt;/a&gt;) and his frequent stance as a “skeptic,” many of my fellow skeptics consider him one of our own, even to the point of &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org/schedule/speakers/"&gt;giving him an award named after Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, when it comes to medicine, nothing could be further from the truth. Maher’s own words show that he has anti-vaccine views, flirts with germ theory denialism and HIV/AIDS denialism, buys into extreme conspiracy theories about big pharma, and promotes animal rights pseudoscience. That’s not a skeptic or a supporter of science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BILL MAHER AND VACCINES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never paid much attention to Bill Maher one way or another until about four years ago. Back in 2005, I started to notice that Maher seemed to be spouting what, as much as I hated to admit, sure looked like standard anti-vaccine talking points. For example, on December 15, 2005, Maher appeared on &lt;a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0512/15/lkl.01.html"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt;, and somehow the topic of the flu vaccine came up. This is the exchange that occurred:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;MAHER:&lt;/span&gt; I’m not into western medicine. That to me is a complete scare tactic. It just shows you, you can…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;KING:&lt;/span&gt; You mean you don’t get a — you don’t get a flu shot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;MAHER:&lt;/span&gt; A flu shot is the worst thing you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;KING:&lt;/span&gt; Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;MAHER:&lt;/span&gt; Because it’s got — it’s got mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;KING:&lt;/span&gt; It prevents flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;MAHER:&lt;/span&gt; It doesn’t prevent. First of all, that’s…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;KING:&lt;/span&gt; I haven’t had the flu in 25 years since I’ve been taking a flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;MAHER:&lt;/span&gt; Well, I hate to tell you, Larry, but if you have a flu shot for more than five years in a row, there’s ten times the likelihood that you’ll get Alzheimer’s disease. I would stop getting your…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;KING:&lt;/span&gt; What did you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;MAHER:&lt;/span&gt; That went better in rehearsal but it was still good. Absolutely, no the defense against disease is to have a strong immune system. A flu shot just compromises your immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antivaccine propaganda blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; couldn’t have said it better! True, AOA didn’t exist in 2005, but if it had that’s exactly the sort of arguments you hear from it in 2009. I also can’t help but wonder if there were a not-so-subtle implication that Larry King is developing Alzheimer’s, thanks to his religious yearly flu vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Skeptico &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/12/drinking_the_an.html"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, at the time that’s a &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;very&lt;/span&gt; specific claim, namely that getting a flu shots more than five years in a row will increase the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease by ten-fold. Personally, I was (and still am) unaware of any good (or even not so good) evidence that flu vaccines can increase the risk of Alzheimer’s, but I’m always willing to try fill in the gaps in my knowledge. That’s why I wondered what research, if any, supported Maher’s assertion. Based on past experience, my guess was probably none. I was right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I was curious about where Maher might have found such a claim, I did a little investigating. First, I did a simple Google search. Guess what website came up on the first page when I did my search? If you said the extremely flaky Whale.to website. . .you won! &lt;a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/flu11.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here it is, right from the source&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hugh Fudenberg, MD (&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000820180850/members.aol.com/nitrf/"&gt;http://members.aol.com/nitrf&lt;/a&gt;), the world’s leading immunogeneticist and 13th most quoted biologist of our times (nearly 850 papers in peer review journals), if an individual has had five consecutive flu shots between 1970 and 1980 (the years studied) his/her chances of getting Alzheimer’s Disease is ten times higher than if they had one, two or no shots. I asked Dr. Fudenberg why this was so and he said it was due to the mercury and aluminum that is in every flu shot (and most childhood shots). The gradual mercury and aluminum buildup in the brain causes cognitive dysfunction. Is that why Alzheimer’s is expected to quadruple? Notes: Recorded from Dr. Fudenberg’s speech at the NVIC International Vaccine Conference, Arlington, VA September, 1997. Quoted with permission. Alzheimer’s to quadruple statement is from John’s Hopkins Newsletter Nov 1998. —-&lt;a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/koren.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ted Koren, D. C.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990503040317/http://www.odyssee.net/~expodome/autism.htm"&gt;http://www.odyssee.net/~expodome/autism.htm#&lt;/a&gt;Top Koren Publications (800-537-3001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in 2005, at least, Maher was getting medical information from the &lt;em&gt;über&lt;/em&gt;-crank site Whale.to and regurgitating it as though Whale.to were a reliable source!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who haven’t heard of him before, Hugh Fudenberg was a &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/protocol-1998.htm"&gt;collaborator and co-inventor&lt;/a&gt; with Andrew Wakefield, the scientist who published an &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-greenhalgh.htm"&gt;absolutely horribly designed &lt;/a&gt;study in the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Lancet&lt;/span&gt; in 1998 linking the MMR vaccine to autism, nearly all of whose authors later publicly &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-retraction.htm"&gt;retracted their authorship&lt;/a&gt;.  Regular readers of SBM know that this study, now &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm"&gt;thoroughly repudiated&lt;/a&gt;, sparked a major scare in Britain and elsewhere regarding MMR, echoes of which persist even today. Since then, evidence has since come to light that not only shows that Wakefield accepted money from lawyers planning a class action suit against vaccine manufacturers; had an undisclosed conflict of interest in that he had a patent application for a single shot measles vaccine, which would be more valuable if the MMR were thought to be unsafe; and ultimately was &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;accused of scientific fraud&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=370"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; published by investigative journalist Brian Deer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fudenberg also happens to have been involved in some very dubious “treatments” for autism that led to some &lt;a href="http://www.casewatch.org/board/med/fudenberg/1995order.shtml"&gt;problems with his medical license&lt;/a&gt;. In November 1995, the South Carolina Medical Board concluded that Fudenberg was “guilty of engaging in dishonorable, unethical, or unprofessional conduct,” and he was fined $10,000 and ordered to surrender his license to prescribe controlled substances (narcotic drugs). His medical license was also placed on suspension. In March 1996, he was permitted to resume practice under terms of probation that did not permit him to prescribe any drugs. His medical license expired in January 2004; and in March 2004, he applied to have it reinstated. However, after a hearing in which the Board considered a neuropsychatric report issued in 2003, Fudenberg agreed to remain in a “retired” status and withdrew his application for reactivation of his license. Nowadays, Dr. Fudenberg runs a nonprofit “research” organization called Neuro Immunotherapeutics Research Foundation and still appears to be pushing dubious remedies for autism. He &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/a77od"&gt;also charged&lt;/a&gt; $750 per hour for “review of past medical records,” $750 per hour for “determining what new tests need to be ordered; ordering of new tests; evaluation of new tests,” and $750 per hour for “determining which therapy will work and which will not; discussing this with patient along with an in-depth study of past medical history to determine what makes a patient better or worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this means Dr. Fudenberg doesn’t make a valid point, but he certainly hasn’t supported it, as far as I can tell, and I looked. If you look at his PubMed publication list, you’ll find that there is nothing after around 1989 other than review articles, speculative articles in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Medical Hypotheses&lt;/span&gt;, plus a a fair number of publications on his “transfer factor” in low impact journals such as &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Biotherapy&lt;/span&gt;. Looking at the list, a knowledgeable person can tell right about when Dr. Fudenberg started to descend into fringe medicine, sometime between 1985-1989. And, try as I might, I couldn’t find an article by Fudenberg to support his claim about the flu vaccine that Maher parrotted on &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the specific dubious autism treatment with which Dr. Fudenberg was involved is the use of something called “&lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/transfer-factor.htm"&gt;transfer factor&lt;/a&gt;” to make a combined measles vaccine and autism “cure.” The method of making these so-called “transfer factors” is &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/goat-recipe.htm"&gt;bizarre in the extreme&lt;/a&gt; and involves injecting mice with measles, extracting and processing white blood cells, injecting the result into pregnant goats, milking the goats after kid-birth and turning the product into capsules for autistic children. In a &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/vaccine-patent.htm"&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; (based in part on the infamous &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Lancet&lt;/span&gt; paper) obtained by Brian Deer, Wakefield represented a vaccine/therapy for “MMR-based” autism using transfer factor as potentially a “&lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/cure-autism.htm"&gt;complete cure&lt;/a&gt;” for autism or for “alleviation of symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, try as I might, I couldn’t find any research that supports this assertion, at least not in PubMed. Any Google searches done inevitably brought up the same quote as above or variants of it, but no source pointed me to any actual research supporting Dr. Fudenberg’s claim, even though he did seem to imply that he had done a study. Certainly there is nothing I could find in the peer-reviewed literature when I searched Dr. Fudenberg’s name with the term “influenza.” Indeed, the only &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=pubmed&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;amp;list_uids=11762573&amp;amp;query_hl=3"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; I &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;could&lt;/span&gt; find on PubMed on the subject of the flu vaccine and Alzheimer’s disease concluded that past exposure to vaccines against diphtheria or tetanus, poliomyelitis and influenza may protect against subsequent development of Alzheimer’s disease. This is, of course, not surprising, given the source of the claim, a source that Maher apparently thought credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all. On that very same show in 2005, Maher also parrotted the claim that it was better sanitation, not the polio vaccine, that eliminated polio. This is simply &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/03HealthPromotion/immu/immu01.html"&gt;not true&lt;/a&gt;. Better sanitation certainly helps decrease the incidence of such diseases, but sanitation was quite good by the 1950s in the United States, just before the polio vaccine was developed; yet polio outbreaks were still fairly common and still quite feared. (People over a certain age will remember polio scares that occurred throughout this country that would shut down public swimming pools and baths before the polio vaccine was developed.) In actuality, better sanitation may have made people more susceptible to severe complications from polio (as cleverly and simply explained in this &lt;a href="http://www.scq.ubc.ca/polio-a-virus-struggle"&gt;neat little cartoon&lt;/a&gt;), because sanitation made sure that most people were no longer routinely exposed to the virus as children. Also going against Maher’s assertion is the observation that when polio vaccination rates fall, &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/05/polio-returns-thanks-to-anti.html"&gt;polio returns&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the same with other infectious diseases, like &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=516"&gt;pertussis&lt;/a&gt;. Unless the disease has been completely eradicated, like smallpox (and thanks to vaccines), whenever vaccination rates fall, the disease will come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2005, I’ve noticed that, virtually every time Maher is on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/em&gt; or other talk shows (or at least whenever I happen to catch him), it seems almost inevitable that he’ll have a bit of a rant against flu vaccines and “Western medicine.” Maybe it’s just confirmation bias on my part for noticing Maher’s tendencies, or maybe it’s because hosts of various talk shows know that Maher holds these wacky views and that asking him about them will produce rants that will make for entertaining, if unenlightening, television, much like what getting Jenny McCarthy on their show to talk about autism will accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;“OH, COME ON, SUPERMAN!”: FLIRTING WITH GERM THEORY DENIALISM AND TELLING CARDIAC PATIENTS TO THROW AWAY THEIR MEDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, it became clear to me why Maher held such beliefs about vaccines in general and the flu vaccine in particular, particularly the belief that vaccines could somehow weaken the immune system. Of course, this made me wonder how Maher could reconcile his support for the HPV vaccine and his extreme skepticism over the flu vaccine. (My guess is that &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/03/02/hpv/"&gt;Maher’s for the HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; because fundamentalist Christians are against it.) If the flu vaccine “weakens the immune system” and makes you more susceptible to the flu, as Maher has said, then why wouldn’t Gardasil, for instance, also “weaken the immune system”? Inconsistencies aside, the reason behind Maher’s extreme “skepticism” about vaccines appears to derive from two beliefs. First, Maher appears to flirt with &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=297"&gt;germ theory denialism&lt;/a&gt;, a common source of anti-vaccine views (after all, if germs aren’t the primary cause of infectious disease, then vaccination is unnecessary), and, second, he has an extreme distrust of big pharma, the latter of which is not necessarily unreasonable when in taken in reasonable doses, but Maher takes his dislike of big pharma into extreme conspiracy theory paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back even further in time to an episode of &lt;em&gt;Real Time With Bill Maher&lt;/em&gt; from March 4, 2005 in which Maher expounded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe in vaccination either. That’s a… well, that’s a… what? That’s another theory that I think is flawed, that we go by the Louis Pasteur theory, even though Louis Pasteur renounced it on his own deathbed and said that Beauchamp(s) was right: it’s not the invading germs, it’s the terrain. It’s not the mosquitoes, it’s the swamp that they are breeding in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t be necessary to repeat this, but I will anyway: There is no evidence whatsoever that Pasteur ever “recanted” on his deathbed and good evidence that he did no such thing, as &lt;a href="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/pasteur.htm"&gt;explained by Peter Bowditch&lt;/a&gt;. There is no record that Pasteur certainly ever “recanted” and said that Beauchamps was correct. This story is a myth, plain and simple. I’m speculating that, as an atheist himself, Maher probably doesn’t buy the rumors by some fundamentalists that controversial atheist activist Madalyn Murray O’Hair “recanted” before her death and said that there is a god. He would quite rightly point out that there is no evidence that she ever did any such thing. (Such stories are also highly implausible because the only persons who could have witnessed such a conversion would be her kidnappers and killers.) Similar myths of deathbed recantations exist for Darwin, in which it is rumored that he renounced the theory of evolution before dying. Even most creationists do not believe these myths about Darwin’s supposed “conversion” now, so ungrounded in any evidence are they. Yet, for all his self-proclaimed “skepticism” or “cynicism,” Maher swallowed second-hand, unsubstantiated rumors and myths that Pasteur recanted on his deathbed and repeated them, despite the fact that there is no more evidence for them than there are for the myths of O’Hair’s or Darwin’s recantations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher went on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re in denial, about I think is a key fact, which is it is the at… people get sick because of an aggregate toxicity, because their body has so much poison in it, from the air, the water… Yes, much of it is not our fault and we can’t control it. But a lot of it we can and even the food people think is good for them, is bad, and I’m not presenting myself as a paradigm. I do cruddy things to my body too and I enjoy them. But when I do them, I’m not in denial. I’m not eating fat free cheese and saying: “You know what, I’m healthy for eating this.” I’m saying: “Oh yeah, this is chemical goop and this is killing me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregate toxicity”? Hulda Clark couldn’t have said it better. From this sort of scientifically and biologically flawed thinking, it’s only a short step to advocating colon flushes or chelation therapy to eliminate vague and undefined “aggregate toxins” or “heavy metal poisoning.” No, I am not saying that diet and environment don’t matter as far as your health is concerned and that there are not substances to which we are exposed that are bad for us. What I am saying is that alt-med mavens like Bill Maher frequently blame some vague “toxins” or “aggregate toxicity” for a wide variety of ailments without ever specifying what the “toxins” are that are supposedly causing the disease in question. It appears that Maher has fallen into this mindset of lumping environmental factors we can control (diet, smoking) with ones we can’t, and then attributing to them all some sort of vague “aggregate toxicity” (conveniently undefined or only very vaguely defined) as the root cause of disease. Sometimes this obsession with “toxins” on the part of people like Maher reminds me of General Jack D. Ripper from &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove, Or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb&lt;/em&gt; and his obsession with the purity of his–as he put it–”precious bodily fluids” and maintaining his “purity of essence.”) Certainly, Maher’s comments are consistent with this sort of mindset that “toxins” are to blame for all disease. He is at once exceedingly skeptical of conventional medicine (but in reality it’s only a knee-jerk distrust) yet at the same time very credulous when it comes to claims made by alt-med and apparently also to intimations of vast corporate conspiracies to suppress what he views as the “truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sidebar, it is of interest to note that Maher’s guest on this show was former NIH director Bernadine Healy. Of late, Healy has become &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/bernadine_healy_flirtin_with_the_antivac.php"&gt;beloved of the anti-vaccine movement&lt;/a&gt; because she apparently believes that vaccines can cause autism, or at least that the question hasn’t been studied enough. It also certainly helps that, as a former director of the NIH, her sympathies with the anti-vaccine movement allow J.B. Handley, Jenny McCarthy, and other anti-vaccine activists to point to her as an “authority” that doesn’t consider them to be cranks. Indeed, the anti-vaccine propaganda blog Age of Autism named Dr. Healy its &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/12/age-of-autism-awards-2008-person-of-the-year-dr-bernadine-healy.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Person of the Year for 2008&lt;/a&gt;. Four years ago, when I first saw this episode of Maher’s show, I was puzzled why Healy didn’t lay the big hurt on Maher for his germ theory denialism and anti-vaccine views. Now I suspect I know. She sympathizes with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest you think this is old news and that Maher has changed his stripes, on an appearance on &lt;a href="http://www.cbs.com/late_night/late_show/"&gt;Late Night With David Letterman&lt;/a&gt; in 2008, Maher had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is there mucus?…It’s because your body is toxic and it’s trying to create a river to get rid of these toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then had the &lt;em&gt;chutzpah&lt;/em&gt; to lecture David Letterman, who had recently returned to work after having had to undergo coronary artery bypass for heart disease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maher:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, I do love health as an issue. This is what I read about when I have time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letterman:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you interested in medical journals and that sort of thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maher:&lt;/strong&gt; Not Western medicine, I think we’re being poisoned…I would love for you to investigate the possibility that your health issues might have arisen from the fact that you’re being poisoned by America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://soberish.wordpress.com/2008/01/07/bill-maher-is-an-irrational-douchebag/"&gt;Soberish&lt;/a&gt; pointed out at the time, Maher wasn’t talking about pollution. He was talking about pharmaceutical drugs. He even concluded by suggesting that David Letterman, who had just survived a heart attack and bypass surgery, should consider giving up all his heart medications and turn to natural solutions. Medical advice doesn’t get much more irresponsible than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most amusing example of Maher’s crank tendencies also occurred in 2008, when, again, on &lt;em&gt;Real Time With Bill Maher&lt;/em&gt;, the subject of the flu and flu vaccines came up, and, after explaining how it isn’t the virus but rather how healthy and free of “toxins” one is that determines whether a person gets the flu when exposed to the influenza virus, Maher said, “I would never get the flu on an airplane,” presumably because his immune system is so healthy and there is no “swamp” there for the virus to breed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exasperated Bob Costas retorted brilliantly, “Oh, come on, Superman!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’ll be my retort to Maher whenever I hear his germ theory denialism rants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Maher wasn’t finished, continuing, “The model you have is wrong. You’re thinking that the problem is the mosquitos, not the swamp. If there’s no swamp, the mosquitos can’t take root.” There was a pause, after which Maher said, “You all look at me as though I’m crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, yes, Bill. We do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I could think when I viewed that exchange is: Who’d have thought that Bob Costas, of all people, would be the voice of rationality, as he tried to set Maher straight on a number of issues, such as when Maher ranted on and on about drug side effects? It’s just another bit of data to show why Maher is not a real skeptic, nor is he a critical thinker. Indeed, the older Maher gets, the more of a crank he appears to be becoming on medical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, anti-vaccine wingnuttery and flirting with germ theory denialism aren’t all the woo that Maher is into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SYMPATHY WITH HIV/AIDS DENIALISTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote at length about the death of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=328"&gt;Christine Maggiore&lt;/a&gt; late last year. As you may recall, Maggiore was a prominent member of the community of pseudoscience boosters known as HIV/AIDS denialists. They’re known by this term because they deny the link between HIV and AIDS and claim that HIV does not cause AIDS. About what the believe to be the cause of AIDS, they are, as many pseudoscientists are about their claims, very vague and “hand-wavey.” Often they attribute it to something that sounds a lot like Maher’s “aggregate toxicity,” namely assaults to the immune system due to drug use, promiscuous sex, and other factors. During her time after discovering she was HIV(+), Maggiore came to believe that HIV does not cause AIDS and stopped taking her antiretroviral drugs. A charismatic and dynamic woman, she quickly became a leader in the HIV/AIDS denialist movement. Worse, she refused to take AZT when she was pregnant with her daughter Eliza Jane Scovill and refused to have her tested for HIV. Unfortunately, the result was that Eliza Jane died a preventable death in 2005 due to &lt;em&gt;Pneumocystis carinii&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia and HIV encephalitis. Maggiore continued to argue that it wasn’t HIV that killed her daughter and even hired a veterinary toxicologist named Mohammed Ali Al-Bayati, who proceeded to spin the autopsy report in a most outrageous fashion, as I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=328"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why am I rehashing all of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s because Bill Maher appears to be &lt;a href="http://richardwilsonauthor.wordpress.com/2009/01/09/comedian-bill-maher-on-maggiores-book-what-if-everything-you-thought-you-knew-about-aids-was-wrong/"&gt;down with the HIV/AIDS denialism&lt;/a&gt; movement as well, having posted a favorable review of Christine Maggiore’s book &lt;em&gt;What If Everything You Thought You Knew about AIDS Was Wrong?&lt;/em&gt; From &lt;a href="http://www.aliveandwell.org/html/top_bar_pages/whatif_eng.html"&gt;AliveandWell.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a book everyone should read, and not a moment too soon! One of the most corrosive flaws in America is our tendency toward conformity; in the quest to understand AIDS, it has been stifling. Christine Maggiore prompts the kind of questioning that is the lifeblood of scientific inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. To Bill Maher, apparently, all that science showing that HIV/AIDS denialists to be wrong is mere “conformity,” as is, apparently, all that science showing his rants about the flu vaccine to be wrong. We wouldn’t want to be “conformists,” now, would we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, it makes a lot of sense that Bill Maher would be sympathetic to the HIV/AIDS denialist movement. After all, as I pointed out before, its ideas of what causes AIDS are very similar to Maher’s ideas of what causes disease in general and the flu in particular, namely some sort of “aggregate toxcity” or assault on the immune system due to “toxins,” drugs, or (of course) pharmaceuticals (pushed by the drug companies to make you sick and keep you dependent on them, naturally) that lead to disease, with the infectious agent being more of an opportunist than anything else. True, there is no doubt that there are opportunistic pathogens that can only cause disease in a compromised host, but, contrary to the concepts that drive the extreme skepticism people like Bill Maher have towards big pharma, the flu virus and HIV are perfectly capable of causing disease in healthy host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a host like Bill Maher, who thinks he’s freed himself of all that aggregate toxicity, rendering him like Superman, immune to the flu and other infectious diseases. I hope for his sake that reality never reveals his views for the hubris that they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;THE PROBLEM WITH BILL MAHER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular readers may wonder why I bothered to write this piece. The reason is simple. Because of his vocal stance against religion as demonstrated by his movie &lt;a href="http://www.lionsgate.com/religulous/"&gt;Religulous&lt;/a&gt;, people who should know better consider him part of the skeptical and science-based world view. Indeed, what prompted me to write this is that Maher is being given an award. In fact, he’s being given the Richard Dawkins Award, which the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org"&gt;Atheist Alliance International&lt;/a&gt; awards to one person every year based on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist_Alliance_International#Richard_Dawkins_Award"&gt;these criteria&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Richard Dawkins Award will be given every year to honor an outstanding atheist whose contributions raise public awareness of the nontheist life stance; who through writings, media, the arts, film, and/or the stage advocates increased scientific knowledge; who through work or by example teaches acceptance of the nontheist philosophy; and whose public posture mirrors the uncompromising nontheist life stance of Dr. Richard Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note one of the major criteria for the award: “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advocates increased scientific knowledge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.” Certainly Maher earns an &lt;a href="http://failblog.org/"&gt;EPIC FAIL&lt;/a&gt; on that aspect, at least. Given that Richard Dawkins made an excellent two-part documentary about pseudoscience for the BBC, entitled &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enemies_of_Reason"&gt;The Enemies of Reason&lt;/a&gt;, the second part of which was primarily about quackery and medical pseudoscience, you’d think that he’d be unhappy about having an award bearing his name be given to a person who would not have been out of place as one of the quacks that Dawkins skewered in the second half of his documentary, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enemies_of_Reason#Episode_2:_The_Irrational_Health_Service"&gt;The Irrational Health Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When commenters on the popular science and atheism blog &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt; started complaining about Maher being given an award with the name of a prominent and outspoken scientist, Richard Dawkins, on it, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_problem_with_writing_by_co.php"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is how Richard Dawkins responded in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Richard Dawkins Award (RDA) has no connection with the &lt;a href="http://www.richarddawkins.net"&gt;Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science&lt;/a&gt; (RDFRS). The RDA was instituted by the Atheist Alliance International (AAI) several years before RDFRS was founded, or even thought of. This year, the committee of AAI took the decision to give the RDA to Bill Maher. They asked me, as an individual, if I approved, and I was delighted to do so because I find him, and especially &lt;em&gt;Religulous&lt;/em&gt;, very funny. I know nothing of any stance he may have taken on medical questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, RDFRS agreed to jointly sponsor the annual conference of AAI. The decision to do so had nothing to do with the AAI’s decision to give the RDA to Bill Maher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the great Richard Dawkins, the man who is viewed as standing up for science and reason against the forces of superstition and pseudoscience, the man who made a documentary largely about medical pseudoscience (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enemies_of_Reason"&gt;The Enemies of Reason&lt;/a&gt;) that contained one of the best illustrations of why homeopathy is nonsense I’ve ever seen, in essence pled ignorance. That in and of itself wouldn’t have been so bad. What was so shocking to me was that, given his history and prior stances on medical pseudoscience, Dawkins showed such an utter lack of curiosity over whether there was anything to the allegations against the person receiving an award that bears his name. In other words, he came across as simply not really caring much about whether Maher promoted anti-vaccine views and quackery or not, as long as Maher was against religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHY DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I was inspired (or, if you will pushed) to write this piece is in fact by my disappointment that any organization ostensibly dedicated to reason and science, among other things, would given an award to Bill Maher. Indeed, from my perspective, Bill Maher and the reaction of much of the skeptical and science-based community to him, those who think they are supporters of science-based medicine and foes of quackery, are of a piece with my experiences dealing with other medical issues. I’ll illustrate what I mean by citing science blogger Jason Rosenhouse, who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/07/bill_maher_is_a_fine_choice_fo.php"&gt;strongly defended the choice of Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt; for the Richard Dawkins Award:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that Maher rejects the germ theory of disease. Yes, I’ve seen the quotes, but I think there are more charitable interpretations. There have been other places where he has said things that seem to accept the germ theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s suppose he does. That’s “anti-science” (as opposed to ignorant or misinformed or whatnot) only if you think science is primarily a list of facts to which you must give your assent. If we’re serious about science being an investigative method as opposed to a list of facts, then rejecting some consensus view does not make you anti-science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’ll try to illustrate what I mean by saying that the defenses I’ve heard of the decision to give Bill Maher this award are deeply inconsistent with how skeptics generally view other topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that Michael Behe rejects evolution. Yes, I’ve seen the quotes, but I think there are more charitable interpretations. There have been other places where he has said things that seem to accept evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s suppose he does. That’s “anti-science” (as opposed to ignorant or misinformed or whatnot) noly if you think science is primarily a list of facts to which you must give your assent. If we’re serious about science being an investigative method as opposed to a list of facts, then rejecting some consensus view does not make you anti-science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds a bit different, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the reason I made this comparison. If there’s one thing the skeptical movement is very good at combatting, it’s creationism or its bastard offspring, “intelligent design” creationism. That’s because evolution is the central organizing principle of biology. What’s depressing is that an otherwise sensible man like Jason apparently doesn’t appreciate that germ theory is far more than just a “consensus” viewpoint in medical science. In fact, it is a major &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt; (word choice intentional) every bit as central to medicine as evolution is to biology or relativity and quantum mechanics are to physics. As one of my favorite bloggers &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/07/bill_maher_is_a_fine_choice_fo.php#comment-1794584"&gt;Skeptico&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, rejecting germ theory is as fundamentally a rejection of science as rejecting evolution, and it just as much involves the rejection of the scientific process that tells us that bacteria causes disease. I also can’t help but point out the parallel between Maher repeating a germ theory denialist myth that Louis Pasteur somehow “recanted” on his deathbed in favor of Louis Beauchamps (who thought that bacteria were merely opportunistic bystanders feeding on dead cells and not the true cause of infectious disease) and the not infrequent creationist refrain that Charles Darwin “recanted” on his deathbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason, like many skeptics, also betrays a profound ignorance of the anti-vaccine movement. The parents who worry about vaccines (largely because of the propaganda of the anti-vaccine movement) could be described as Jason describes them, but the &lt;em&gt;leaders&lt;/em&gt; of the anti-vaccine movement, not so much. Just a bit of time lurking on any anti-vaccine board (something I’ve done a lot of) will demonstrate not just a profound suspicion of but also an extreme hostility towards medical science, mainly because science doesn’t tell the parents what they want to hear, namely that vaccines caused their children’s autism and that the biomedical quackery to which many of them subject their children will “cure” their children. Science says that neither of these assertions are true. As far as science as a process rather than just a collection of facts, you’ll also see a profound antipathy towards the scientific method itself in favor of anecdotal evidence and “mommy instinct.” In fact, Jenny McCarthy herself is an excellent example of this. She once said “&lt;a href="http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahshow/20080910_tows_jennyexcerpt/6"&gt;Evan [her son] is my science&lt;/a&gt;” on &lt;em&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/em&gt; and scoffed at all the science showing that vaccines do not cause autism and that “biomedical” quackery can’t “recover” autistic children, because, well, she’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;seen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; it herself. Meanwhile &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;Generation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;Rescue&lt;/a&gt; and other anti-vaccine groups keep up a constant stream of propaganda attacking every scientific study that fails to find a link between vaccines and autism, not to mention anyone who calls them on their nonsense, like our very own &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=465"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the same hostility towards the scientific method and the fruits of that method that form the basis of scientific medicine is evident in huge swaths of the “alternative medicine” movement, where anecdote is valued over controlled studies, correlation is confused with causation even after science fails to find evidence of causation, and “personal experience” matters more than clinical trials or basic science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that I’m citing anecdotal evidence (which is usually a no-no on SBM), but forgive me a movment as I lapse into an expression of opinion. It is my perception that many skeptics who are hardcore rational when it comes to issues like evolution, paranormal phenomena, and other areas of pseudoscience all too often tend not to understand the important of science-based medicine–or even what science-based medicine is. Moreover, there does seem to me to be a strain of sympathy for the anti-vaccine movement among skeptics. I’ve seen it myself. For example, when I’ve been to meetings with skeptics, namely people who actually belong to skeptical organizations like the &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/"&gt;Center For Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; or who attend meetings like &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/246-amazng-meeting.html"&gt;The Amazing Meeting&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to vaccines, pharma, and medicine, I am continually discouraged by how many “skeptics” actually buy into at least some medical pseudoscience. Indeed, recently I have gotten into discussions with a skeptic about vaccines, and I was surprised at how she actually thought there was something to the claimed link between vaccines and autism and how her doubts could not be easily assuaged. Meanwhile, a lot of skeptics I’ve encountered, although they don’t buy the claims of “alternative” medicine or the anti-vaccine movement, appear to be “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shruggies&lt;/a&gt;,” in that they don’t much care about them either or see why we at SBM get so worked up about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to be totally negative about this and don’t mean to imply that all (or even most) skeptics hold these sorts of views. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt;, President of the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and the great &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/700-once-more-unto-the-breach-dear-friends-once-more.html"&gt;James Randi&lt;/a&gt; himself (who is currently undergoing chemotherapy) clearly “get it.” Indeed, the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/497-tam-7-speaker-schedule.html"&gt;Anti-Anti-Vax Panel&lt;/a&gt; that I was honored to participate in, along with fellow SBM bloggers Steve Novella, Harriet Hall, and Joe Albietz is but one example demonstrating that. But there does appear to be a contingent in the skeptical movement that shows far more deference to the claims of medical pseudoscientists than it should. To me, Maher’s antivaccine nonsense and revulsion towards what he sneeringly refers to as “Western medicine” (you can almost hear him spit the term out, so great is his contempt) is even worse than creationism in that it has real, measurable health consequences for a lot of people. In particular, the anti-vaccine movement has resulted in the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases, while cancer quackery results in direct harm, as has been documented time and time again on this blog and elsewhere. Given how Bill Maher promotes anti-vaccine views, in particular with respect to the flu vaccine, with the H1N1 flu pandemic that has developed over the last several months, his message will be as bad as any that Jenny McCarthy or Oprah Winfrey can spread, the only difference being that his reach is not as great as Oprah’s. (Maybe it’s on par with Jenny McCarthy’s.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who have combatted pseudoscience in medicine know that the very term “Western medicine” is a code word among advocates of unscientific medical practices for scientific medicine or, as we like to call it on this blog, science-based medicine. We know that there is no “Western” or “Eastern” medicine. There is medicine that has been validated through science as effective and possessing a reasonable risk-benefit ratio; there is medicine that has been shown not to be effective; and there is medicine that has not yet been subject to adequate study. Most of “alternative” medicine falls into one of the latter two categories, and any “alternative” medicine that can be scientifically validated will cease to be “alternative” and become just “medicine.” Neither “Western” nor “Eastern” nor “alternative.” Just “medicine.” &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/280/18/1618"&gt;George Lundberg&lt;/a&gt; put it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no alternative medicine. There is only scientifically proven, evidence-based medicine supported by solid data or unproven medicine, for which scientific evidence is lacking. Whether a therapeutic practice is “Eastern” or “Western,” is unconventional or mainstream, or involves mind-body techniques or molecular genetics is largely irrelevant except for historical purposes and cultural interest…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame that neither &lt;a href="http://www.billmaher.com"&gt;Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.richarddawkins.net"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org"&gt;Atheist Alliance International&lt;/a&gt;, nor a fair fraction of other self-proclaimed “skeptics” seems to “get it” with regard to this simple fact. From Maher, I don’t expect any better. Richard Dawkins and the Atheist Alliance, however, should know that actions speak louder than words, and right now their actions belie their dedication to science and the promotion of scientific knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

Phil would be #4, except I realize I was rather ambiguous about it when I mentioned it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just to clarify, NO, I won&amp;#39;t be conversing on bloggingheads in the future…which I regret, since I think the site had some real potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of the commenters on Phil&amp;#39;s site do not think it is a good idea, because lunacy like creationism ought to be confronted whenever we can do so. I agree! The problem with bloggingheads wasn&amp;#39;t simply that creationists were given a venue — it was that creationists were given a venue &lt;i&gt;without voices opposing their ideas&lt;/i&gt;. It was setting up crackpots with softball interviews that made them look reasonable, because their peculiar ideas were never confronted. That's what has to be rejected, not the idea of arguing with bad ideas (although Sean Carroll makes a good case that some ideas are so bad they don't even deserve debate), but a site that promised discussion yet became open mic night for loons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/phil_plait_ditches_blogginghea.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-UvSurDp3Ek" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252302368023"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4dabef0dcf7df42b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Once More Unto the Breach, Dear Friends, Once More...</title><published>2009-09-07T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-07T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/700-once-more-unto-the-breach-dear-friends-once-more.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Please forgive me if I hammer once again at this theme, but I see that just this month, the prestigious Mayo Clinic has issued a lengthy report that stresses the importance of not accepting "alternative medicine treatments ranging from herbal remedies to acupuncture" simply because they have become more popular and offer more options, cautioning that these treatments aren't always proven safe or effective. The report asks that people "Be open-minded yet skeptical of medical claims." While I certainly agree with this advice, and it's stated in an appropriately caring, polite, and skeptical fashion, I'm somewhat alarmed to see that the report also contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any alternative treatment you consider, find out if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. It's a good idea to talk to your doctor and do research on your own before trying any treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With due deference to the authority of the Mayo Clinic, I will state that I have met - quite recently - fully-qualified, licensed, practicing physicians who have endorsed or at least tolerated various aspects of quackery - especially acupuncture. Though innocently presented, such professional opinions originate in benign ignorance.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="pirate-matt" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/pirate-matt.jpg?w=236&amp;amp;h=303" alt="pirate-matt" width="236" height="303"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a serious note, while Dragon*Con is essentially a big science-fiction convention &amp;amp; general geek-fest, there is a very serious science &amp;amp; skeptical presence here.  The &lt;a href="http://www.skeptrack.org/category/main/"&gt;Skeptics track&lt;/a&gt; is now in its second year, and it seems as if it grew out of a desire to counter or provide a rebuttal to some of the more &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Psychic_Phenomena_and_the_Paranormal%28Index%29"&gt;woo-ish paranormal nonsense&lt;/a&gt; that you see here.  For instance, there is a track which seems quite heavy on the paranormal woo called the &lt;a href="http://www.dragoncon.org/fan_tracks.php#X"&gt;X-track&lt;/a&gt; where all manner of &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Ghost_Hunting"&gt;ghost hunters&lt;/a&gt; do their thing.  With so many people attending Dragon*Con who can actually distinguish fact from fiction, it’s no wonder that many people are interested in the actual science &amp;amp; skepticism tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will outline all the things I did here – lecturing on the &lt;a href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/"&gt;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; particle physics, participating on the &lt;a href="http://www.dragoncon.org/fan_tracks.php#SWAT"&gt;Science of Star Wars&lt;/a&gt; panel, moderating the Darwin’s Bulldogs panel on teachers combating creationism, and participating on the Skepticism in the Classroom panel – in future posts.  What I want to discuss for the rest of this post is why it is that I think having skeptics present at events like Dragon*Con is important in the first place…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I think it is important to have a skeptical presence at these events for three main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Science Fiction is Cool!&lt;/strong&gt; – science fiction (and fantasy, for that matter) is a great genre which has wide appeal to many people.  Just think about all of the influence sci-fi classics like Star Wars and Star Trek have had on our society.  The drawing power of sci-fi is undeniable, and as such it can serve as a vehicle for teaching real science and skepticism &amp;amp; critical thinking to those gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when participating in the panel on the Science of Star Wars, as a physics &amp;amp; astronomy professor, I was explaining to those gathered the difference between SW physics and real-life physics regarding the Death Star, FTL travel, wormholes, lightsabers, blasters, artificial intelligence, etc.  But rather than being a wet blanket the entire time, I was making references to the really awesome stuff we do in real life – such as the Large Hadron Collider, which is a real-life machine larger than any piece of technology ever built by humans.  And when I started talking about the power requirements of the LHC, everyone gasped with the realization that “Hey, that’s the real thing, not movie fantasy.  That’s cool!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while we can appreciate good sci-fi and fantasy, I think the real pleasure comes from recognizing the difference between the sci-fi science and the real stuff.  This can lead to a greater appreciation of the real thing, because the sci-fi fans are already kind of “hooked”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Combatting the Woo&lt;/strong&gt; – As I mentioned earlier, there is a real element of woo and pseudoscience at Dragon*Con.  Perhaps the best example of it is all of the paranormal &amp;amp; ghost-hunting crap you see – people from groups such as TAPS (&lt;a href="http://www.the-atlantic-paranormal-society.com/"&gt;The Atlantic Paranormal Society&lt;/a&gt;) are here.  And they are very popular, drawing large numbers to their panels, where they go on about… well… a lot of nonsense, in my opinion.  Such widespread and unaccountable spreading of woo needs to be countered, and having a Skeptic track is a perfect way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the woo-meisters can have their tracks on &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/haunted.html"&gt;haunted houses&lt;/a&gt; and other paranormal stuff.  But over in the Skeptic track, we have people like paranormal investigators &lt;a href="http://www.radfordbooks.com/"&gt;Ben Radford&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://www.joenickell.com/"&gt;Joe Nickell&lt;/a&gt; present who lecture about their researches into these various paranormal/supernatural claims and lay them bare for all to see as completely baseless.  And the skeptical track is getting more and more popular, because we take on other woo-ish issues, such as &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Creationist_Arguments"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I participated in a panel discussion today called “Darwin’s Bulldogs, Teachers on the Front Lines” which was composed of high school &amp;amp; college teachers discussing our experiences with creationists and how to effectively counter their &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Pseudoscience"&gt;pseudoscientific nonsense&lt;/a&gt; while also promoting good science education.  Our main guest was &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/about/speakers#scott"&gt;Dr. Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, who – along with the other panelists – provided a plethora of information to those gathered on how to address these questions.  There were also a large number of science teachers present who were eager to get involved, which brings me to my final point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Socializing &amp;amp; Networking&lt;/strong&gt; – Attending events like Dragon*Con helps to build the social cohesion of the scientific &amp;amp; skeptical movement.  It helps to get us out into the world with other people who are not as much of a hard-core skeptic as me.  This is what I refer to as fighting the Ivory Tower mentality which seems to have afflicted some of the older-generation of skeptics, who seemed to have insisted upon an overly academic approach to the subject.  I’m not saying that the academic community doesn’t have a place in the skeptical movement, because it most certainly does have a pivotal place.  But it isn’t enough to rely &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; on the academic side of things, because there is very clearly a social &amp;amp; networking side to the skeptical movement that cannot be neglected, ignored, or dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is precisely because the younger generation of skeptics have broken out of their collective shells and started to go to events like Dragon*Con that the skeptical movement has grown so much in popularity in recent years.  We need to send the message to others that being a skeptic is fun, it’s cool to think critically and not take woo claims at face value, and that while we’re serious about our approach to understanding the universe with science we are also human like everyone else.  Socializing and networking through non-”skeptic only” events like Dragon*Con are a perfect vehicle for doing this sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it: some of my immediate thoughts on skepticism &amp;amp; science at Dragon*Con 2009.  There’s a lot more I plan to blog about in the next few days regarding some things I mentioned here, plus other things I didn’t mention, so stay tuned for more! &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bremner is an apparently well-regarded psychiatrist, and takes a refreshing look at the influence of industry not just on pharmaceuticals but on the conduct of science itself.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/07/academic_institution_policies.php"&gt;His outspoken views have led to attempts to squelch his academic freedoms.&lt;/a&gt;   But his sometimes-heroic record does not excuse dangerous idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand how wading into the shit pool that is conflict of interest can leave one cynical.  But cynicism and suspicion turned up to "11" is no longer bravery---it's crankery.  It's not his snarkiness that burns---it's his inability to separate his biases from the facts.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not like the pharmaceutical industry doesn't deserve to be taken to the wood shed.  Examples of unethical and downright immoral practices abound, such as &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/08/25/ghost-writers-coming-out-of-the-closet/"&gt;ghost-writing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/when_big_pharma_pays_a_publisher_to_publ.php"&gt;fake journals&lt;/a&gt;, and a host of other sins.  But the industry has also helped develop a most remarkable pharmacopeia which saves and improves countless lives.  There is good, and there is bad.  And telling the two apart, well, that makes all the difference.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tends to go for headlines that hit hard, but miss the point entirely.  Examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/06/25/angioplasty-found-to-be-useless-waste-of-money/"&gt;Angioplasty Found to be Useless Waste of Money&lt;/a&gt;: he cites a journal article which he says concluded that "not useful for patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). "  His title would be accurate if angioplasty were used only in stable CAD---it is not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/03/18/should-i-take-aspirin-or-put-a-gun-to-my-head/"&gt;Should I Take Aspirin or Put a Gun To My Head?&lt;/a&gt;: here, he sort of gets the difference between primary and secondary prevention, but not really.  He also likes to admit that the data contradict his conclusion but he's nice enough to say, "screw the data":&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Although technically the risk of stomach bleeding is outweighed by the heart benefits of aspirin (which can only be shown when large numbers of patients are studied), in terms of what that means to you the differences are clinically meaningless.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Just In: Breast Cancer Screening Essentially Useless: yes, Doug, breast cancer screening doesn't benefit everyone equally. For example, the prevalence of breast cancers in men is low enough that recommending it for you would be stupid---like your article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/before_you_trust_that_blog.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/before_you_trust_that_blog.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/G5R_nQ8mj-c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252296111642"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1572">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c63c9277697b0c04</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Dragon*con"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="You Tube"/><category term="skeptic zone"/><category term="Kylie Sturgess"/><category term="Rachael Dunlop"/><category term="Richard Saunders"/><category term="skeptic track"/><category term="Skepticality"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Dragon*Con Day One</title><published>2009-09-07T03:06:14Z</published><updated>2009-09-07T03:06:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/gguN2Sz4i8c/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/?p=1572"/><summary xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0T9JsV_IRM

Resistance to antibiotics is a huge clinical problem. In the US, more people die of  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections (nearly 19,000 in 2006) than of AIDS (14,627).  We know that antibiotic resistance is carried on mobile genetic elements [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

In the ongoing contest to send a blogger to Antarctica, she has sat in third place, just a few dozen votes behind Don Osmond (who is, indeed, related to the original Mormon Singer, Donny Osmond) for several weeks now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have to tell you, I have a lot of friends and colleagues who are in this contest, and I'd love to root for ALL of them, but Devora is the only one with a chance of taking out the two people who are ahead of her, and she very much deserves to go to Antarctica.   And I don't mean that in a bad way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we please cough up a couple of hundred votes for her now, to push past Don, and then, maybe you should &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/send_grrlscientist_to_antarcti.php"&gt;visit this blog post at Pharyngula and remind people there&lt;/a&gt; (by leaving a comment) that the Pharyngulistas have a job to do!?!? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I former Classics major, I can wax poetic over everything I love about my all-time favorite series (&lt;em&gt;and everything wrong with films like Troy and Alexander&lt;/em&gt;). Looks like &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337124/"&gt;IMDb&lt;/a&gt; has slated the feature film for 2011 and it’s listed ‘&lt;em&gt;in development&lt;/em&gt;‘ on writer &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0375285/"&gt;Bruno Heller’s page&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=97645771496"&gt;facebook group&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJykpzPnL5k&amp;amp;feature=channel_page"&gt;interview with Kevin McKidd&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/rome/cast/character/season2/lucius_vorenus_v2.html"&gt;Lucius Vorenus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) talking about the possibility…&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJykpzPnL5k&amp;amp;feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true, I’ll be incredibly excited! Can any of our readers confirm?&lt;/p&gt;

Neither wanted to be part of an organization that gave credibility to creationists like Michael Behe and Paul Nelson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/04/bloggingheads-capo-non-grata/"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;em&gt;Bad Astronomy&lt;/em&gt; fame) has announced that he too will no longer appear on bloggingheads.tv:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I’ll be more succinct. Bloggingheads had full-blown creationists being interviewed, making all the same long-debunked claims while the other person talking basically supported them. &lt;em&gt;And BloggingHeads called that science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Bzzzzzzzt! I’m done with them. I was on BloggingHeads (with Carl) a few months ago, and I won’t ever do it again either. If they want to cast creationism as science, they might as well say Holocaust denial is real history, 9/11 truthers are engineers, and Birthers are patriots. They can do that, but it’s a crock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Fish &lt;a href="http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/09/05/sticking-a-fork-in-bloggingheads-tv/"&gt;agrees&lt;/a&gt;.  Greg Laden is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/the_blogginheadstv_controversy.php"&gt;ambivalent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for the virtues of accommodationism.  If you pretend that religion has something to say about science, or if you present these two magisteria as coequals, those who have genuine respect for science — and integrity — are going to flee faster than rats on a sinking ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;__________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:  There are actually &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; defectors: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/phil_plait_ditches_blogginghea.php"&gt;P. Z. Myers has also withdrawn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

What were the last three genre books that you purchased? Why did you purchase them?
And do they feel comfortable together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Daniel Abraham,&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076531343X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=076531343X"&gt;The Price of Spring (The Long Price Quartet)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=076531343X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: This is the conclusion to
  Abraham's Long Price Quartet, which is a &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; set of novels. Each
  volume of the quartet is a self-contained story - but the pieces also fit together
  into a larger story-arc. The volumes each take place over the course of a season,
  and each is separated by about 20 years. It's fantasy with very rare but incredibly
  high-powered magic. Certain people can, after significant training, cause an
  abstract concept to become a real physical being, called an &lt;em&gt;andat&lt;/em&gt;
  which they can control. For example, the first book in the quartet focuses 
  on "Seedless", aka "Removing the part that continues", which is the embodiment
  of the idea of removing children - whether that means removing the seeds from
  a bale of picked cotton, or performing an abortion by removing and killing the
  unborn child. The last book doesn't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; live up to the promise of the ones
  before, but it's still excellent. Why'd I buy it? Because I picked up the first one
  on a whim a while ago, and got hooked. I couldn't wait to get the last volume. And
you wanna talk cliffhangers? The last volume of this left &lt;em&gt;every single woman&lt;/em&gt; in the home nation of the main characters, and every single man in the home nation of their enemies, completely sterile.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vernor Vinge, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765308835?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0765308835"&gt;The Peace War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0765308835" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: I haven't started reading this one
  yet. Why'd I get it? Because Vinge is a genius. I've loved everything of his
  that I've read. But some of his early stuff, I was never able to find. Then a friend
  mentioned that it had become available for the Kindle! So I immediately ordered it.
  (And I do mean immediately - I didn't even wait to get back to my desk - I pulled
  out my Android phone and ordered it from Amazon right in front of the coffee machine.)
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;China Mieville, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345497511?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0345497511"&gt;The City &amp;amp; The City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0345497511" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: I just started this one;
I'm about 70 pages in. It seems decent so far. The story of why I bought this
one is interesting. Y'see, I don't like Mieville. His writing always seems to
me to be self-consciously but unsuccessfully stylistic - like Mieville sees
himself as a brilliant prose stylist, while being unable to really pull off
the brilliantly styled prose that he imagines he's writing. But I keep getting
his books - because I keep seeing reviews from people that I really respect
that talk about how wonderful his prose is. I just don't see it. He's a decent
storyteller - but I can't see the beautiful prose that everyone talks about.
It's not that I don't like artistically styled writing; I actually love things
where I'm struck by the beauty of a phrase, and need to stop reading for a
while just to bask in the beauty of the words; Brust's "The funniest thing
about time is when it doesn't. I'll leave that hanging there for the moment,
and let you age while the shadows don't lengthen, if you see what I mean."
from Yendi blows me away every time I read it. But Mieville just seems to be
&lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to write that way. Anyway, "The City and the City" is based
on a wonderful idea, so I figured I'd give it a try. It's a murder mystery set
in a city which is spatially overlapped with another city. In some places (called
"crosshatched regions"), you can see both cities at the same time unless you
will yourself to "unsee" the other one; in other places, you're solidly in one
city or the other. And the two cities are actually different &lt;em&gt;nations&lt;/em&gt;,
so to cross from one to the other requires going through customs. Even 
not "unseeing" the other city is actually a crime. Brilliant idea; I'm really
hoping he carries it off.&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As for "are they comfortable together?" No, not really. We've got one
historical high-fantasy from an alternate earth; one gritty current-time
potboiler in a setting that has fantasy elements; and one far-future
hard science fiction. They really don't make for comfortable neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So. What's your three latest? Post 'em in the comments, or post 'em on
your own blog, and then link from the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

didn&amp;#39;t make me so very different than the rest of you:

Our typical conception of mutation is drawn from the tragic effects of those

relatively rare mutations, induced in our bodies or passed on through germ

cells, that lead to diseases (or, in movies to super powers). In fact, we

are, each of us, mutants. DNA replication is not perfect, we are born with about

6 or 7 new mutations...

Well, a paper published last week[1] proved my general point while proving me wrong

on the detail by a factor of 20 or so. A team of British and Chinese

researchers that work with a family that has a unique Y-chromosome linked

hearing disorder sequenced the entire sequence of the Y-chromosome from two

men and found four mutations. Scaling up from the Y-chromosome to the whole

genome then dividing by the combined 13 generations that separate the two men

they arrived a mutation rate of 3 x 10-8 changes per nucleotide per

generation. That would give us between one and two hundred new mutations.

This finding isn&amp;#39;t actually a revelation. We had an idea of the rate of

mutation in the human genome before we even knew what a gene was made of. JBS

Haldane, one of the founders of evolutionary genetics and perhaps the only

person to have enjoyed the First World War, used his theory of mutation

selection balance to estimate new haemophilia causing mutations occur about

once in every 105 generations.[2] When you consider that the gene

responsible for Haemophilia A contains about 7 x 103 nucleotides

and changes to many of those won&amp;#39;t cause Haemophilia Haldane&amp;#39;s estimate looks

pretty good.

In fact, the Cool New Stuff in this paper isn&amp;#39;t really the number that

they&amp;#39;ve produced - that number is similar Haldane&amp;#39;s esimate and to the

measurble error rate of the enzymes that replicate our DNA and to the

rate inferred by comparing our genome to that of the cimpanzee *. What&amp;#39;s really neat is the fact they directly measured the rate by resequencing the whole Y-chromosome - that&amp;#39;s more than 10 million bases to sequence, 35 at a time, and put together to check for mutations. The sort of project that would only have been possible as part dedicated genome sequencing projects a couple of years ago. With only two people and four mutations the estimate has

wide error bars but it does pave the way to more accurate estimates for

particular areas of the genome (including those underlying for diseases) and

particular lineages of organisms (which is important for us evolutionary

biologists)

I can&amp;#39;t revel in my earlier post being confirmed in the broad sense without

apologising for misleading you in the details. I was just flat out wrong when I

claimed we all have 6 or 7 new mutations - I used a number that I had in my

head and didn&amp;#39;t bother to look it up. You can see where my number came from

once you consider that only about 4% of the genome is functional DNA - 150

mutations in your genome will lead to about 6 mutations in functional regions.

Still, the original is (about to be) modified and I am suitably shamed.

* As Larry Moran points out taken together these studies tell us something

about the way evolution works. If the observed rate of mutation in DNA

replication is not wildly different than the inferred rate of mutation in a

pedigree or between closely related species most mutations aren&amp;#39;t being

selected against - more evidence for the importance of neutral theory in

molecular evolution. back to the story ^

It's an abstract system lightly dressed up in a story about harvesting and distributing fruit and greens on Mallorca of all things. Good fun though! Then we played &lt;a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2453"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blokus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, always fun too.
&lt;li&gt;Took a sunny six-hour bike trip with my 11-y-o son, had kebab &amp;amp; fries, found three geocaches, failed to find two. It&amp;#39;s great when your kid is big enough that he can keep up for hours like that! Quality time.
&lt;li&gt;Went to &lt;a href="http://www.cirkusbraziljack.se/"&gt;Circus Brazil Jack&lt;/a&gt; with my 6-y-o daughter. As usual a mix of the semi-desperately cheezy and the sublimely stupendous. The two acrobat acts were great! And they had a super-professional five-piece live band. It's such a great analog form of entertainment when you can smell the horses and share the acrobats' tension before a difficult trick. But circuses work differently these days: they need to sell a lot of knick-knacks and pony rides to make ends meet, and they can't afford many stage hands. During the intermission even the top performers donned crew uniforms. I bought cotton candy from a gruff greying guy who later balanced two people on a seven-metre pole on his shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you, Dear Reader?

And along the way, I've got some deadlines for my book. So to fill in, I'm recycling some old posts. I decided that it's been entirely too long since there was any pathological programming 'round these parts, so I'm going to repost some of my favorites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As long-time readers know by now, in real life, I'm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a
mathematician; I'm a computer scientist. I'm still a math &lt;em&gt;geek&lt;/em&gt;, mind
you, but what I really do is very much in the realm of applied math,
working on building systems to help people build programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; One of my pathological obsessions is programming languages. Since I first got
exposed to TRS-80 Model 1 BASIC back in middle school, I've been absolutely
nuts programming languages. Last time I counted, I'd learned about 150
different languages; and I've picked up more since then. I've written programs
most of them. Like I said, I'm nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; These pathological programming language posts are my way of inflicting
my obsession on you in a (hopefully) amusing way. You see, in this
screwed up world of ours, there are lots and lots of thoroughly &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt;
people out there. In the world of geekery, many of those crazy people
like to invent programming languages. Some very small number of them try to design
good languages and succeed; a much larger number try to design good languages
and fail; and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; there are ones whose work I'm writing about. The
ones who deliberately set out to design strange, warped, twisted, and
nearly unusable languages, and succeed brilliantly. Most of the people who
design them call them "esoteric" programming languages. I call them evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Today, the beautiful grand-daddy of the esoteric language family: the one, the
only, the truly and deservedly infamous: &lt;a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/"&gt;Brainfuck&lt;/a&gt;,
designed by Urban Müller. (There are a number of different implementations available; just
follow the link.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Only 8 commands - including input and output - all written using symbols. And
yet it's Turing complete. In fact, it's one-up on just being Turing complete - it's
actually been formally specified with a complete formal theoretical design,
called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_prime_prime"&gt;P''&lt;/a&gt;. 
And it's even been implemented &lt;a href="http://www.robos.org/?bfcomp"&gt;in hardware!&lt;/a&gt;.

Groethe of the Center of Skeptical Inquiry and host of the podcast “Point of Inquiry”, Jeff Wagg, Communications and Outreach Manager of the James Randi Educational Foundation, and Maria Walters, founder of the Atlanta Skeptic Society and columnist on the Skepchick.org blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son attended the Naval nuclear power school a few years ago, including a crash course in chemistry, physics, electronics, thermodynamics, other subjects needed to operate and maintain a nuclear power plant.  The students tend to be top achievers, interested in science and math, and would frequently ask for the theory.  They wanted to know WHY not just how. The instructors would answer “this is outside the scope of this course, please just accept this so we can move on.”  So my son and his classmates drew large black dots on the backs of their calculators, with Sharpies. When they were told to accept information for the sake of expediency, they’d ‘push’ this button and say “I believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told you that story so I can tell you this story.  All of us have a button labeled “I believe” that we push.  The button may be as simple as “I believe that my spouse loves me.” Or “education is a positive thing for society.”   But most people of the world have other buttons that they push.  I believe in magic, ghosts, witches, homeopathy, aliens, psychics, conspiracy theories, or one of a hundred versions of a god. And that button might as well be drawn in Sharpie, because it doesn’t work anymore, it is ALWAYS pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an engineer by training, and like to draw diagrams and pictures.  I can’t think without a pencil or marker in my hand.  If you’re like me, you think that if you can just explain something, a scientific topic for example, clearly enough, that your audience will nod their heads and say ‘oh, yes, now I see!  You’re right, and I will adjust my thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with those buttons that are painted on, they have to wear off.  We, as skeptics, want to slice right through the armor that believers have plated up around themselves, which have built up by custom, upbringing, anecdotes, personal experiences, fuzzy thinking, and from lack of exposure to the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me almost three years to get my own mother to check Snopes before she forwarded emails to me.  I’m her daughter, you think she would trust me, but I still have to carefully work with her on issues with her health.  Just this week, she told me, rather reluctantly, that she had gone to a chiropractor for some lower back pain, because ’she was desperate”.  This, from a woman with chronic kidney disease that reads my blog posts.  I had to persuade my aunt to throw away her bowel cleansing kits and pills to ‘improve her liver function” even though she couldn’t tell me what her liver function was supposed to be functioning as.  But, now they check Snopes, and were at least embarrassed to tell me about the chiropractor. These are intelligent women, but they have been told their entire life that these things work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, indeed, they DO feel better after a visit to the chiropractor.  It’s a bit harder to explain the concept of ‘regression to a mean’ to them.  But I could not do it AT ALL with a single clear, simple, unemotional explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than creating the Grand Canyon in a 40-day flood, presenting skepticism to those with a painted-on “I Believe” button is more a process of rain beating the mountains down into the ocean, of the weeds splitting the foundations. It is slow, it is one-on-one, and it can be frustrating.  However, this is how we teach, one person at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

People head up north for the last long weekend of the summer, eat ripe cherries, melon, and peaches, go to street fairs.  Apparently they also go to doctors.  But I have a brief lull before the next onslaught of twisted ankles, hand-foot-mouth disease, flu, strep throat, chest pain, back pain, or whatever other common medical complaints walk in the door attached to a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a little cemetery up the street from me.  This isn't New England, and old cemeteries aren't the norm, but this one look interesting from the car window.  So me and the kiddo saddled up and rode up to the place.  It's really cool.  There's a number of the usual headstones, but a lot of small ones from the mid 19th century, back when this was all farmland.  Many are too faded to read.  There are also a number of ostentatious obelisks marking family plots, and small veterans stars, some with flags, some rusted nearly away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And bees.  Lots of bees.  Some hornets, yellow jackets, wasps---basically anything that can sting.  After enjoying the spot, I got out, and a little ice took care of one particularly annoying sting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's Labor Day weekend, so you should be away from your computer.  You may discuss below why you have failed in that task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/writers_block_open_thread.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/359Swr4Mg5Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252274503807"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=15809">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b48068d808562a86</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Art"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><title type="html">The Reasonists</title><published>2009-09-06T22:00:23Z</published><updated>2009-09-06T22:00:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/06/the-reasonists/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s &lt;em&gt;Doonesbury&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.gocomics.com/doonesbury/2009/09/06"&gt;gets you where it hurts&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Remember, the vulnerability is an illusion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that’s true. Many religious people are very vulnerable. Your suggestions are primarily for dealing with those who are not. So you really haven’t addressed how to deal with that proportion, however small, who are vulnerable. And the most vulnerable are often those closest to you. Or at least those are the ones you care about. It’s is a real problem. Do you have an answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original post, as the title says, is about dealing with those who &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; fragile.  These are the people about whom Mike asked, people who, unbidden, approach you with their sad story as a proselytizing tool.  The majority of the time they are shined on, turned down or shooed away. They are already used to it, and have not been crushed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a good idea; to expand my suggestions to how to handle religious people who are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; vulnerable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are actually vulnerable then they are still in the midst of their troubles, their addiction, their codependency,  their emotional turmoil, whatever it is.  They are vulnerable because they don’t yet have the successful outcome to add at the end of their sad story.  They will not be approaching strangers with this stuff. They will be avoiding any and all challenges.  You won’t meet them on the street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only likely way you would know such people is that they are, as you say, close to you in some way, such as a family member or a close friend.  That means that you are close enough to be a possible resource for help, advice or encouragement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are using religion as an emotional support, let them.  Ridding  them of religion is not what is important in this situation. If their sanity, health or life are at risk, whatever stops the hemorrhaging is fine for the time being. For this scenario I repeat my suggestions on the other post of listening politely and patiently in a neutral stance. You don’t have to debate them and you don’t have to pretend that you agree.  You don’t have to go with them to their church or whatever they ask.  All you have to do is to be courteous and tactful.  You can still politely decline whatever you wish to decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because of your closeness, you can still be of more tangible help to them.  Suggest that in between their religious efforts, they go to see a counselor or go to an appropriate support group, or take classes or training for better employment or whatever might help, just as an augmentation to their religious efforts.  Never mind that that’s where the real improvement will come from.  The important thing is that they have a chance to get better, that they survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If misdirecting the credit for their recovery to a deity puts a limit on how well they otherwise could become, oh well.  Most people rise to a level of functioning and emotional development where they just get by.  Very few reach their full potential.  We can love and encourage those who limp along because limping is far better than falling down and dying. Maybe some day the limping will fade and they will be able to discard whatever is their crutch,  But that will only happen if they are alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we can all work on our own lameness. None of us are so self-actualized that we don’t need improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

Essentially positive, the piece doesn’t gloss over the friction religious institutions seem to occasionally spark with special needs families (”One family told us about being asked by their rabbi not to return to the synagogue anymore … Their child liked to be too close to the Torah!”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wonder if our pediatrician would give us  a prescription for a mild sedative for Alex to go to the dentist?” Jill wonders. Good idea. Now we just need to find a dentist with our now-spotty dental insurance situation…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Willmar, Minn., special education teacher has compiled a dandy list of tips for parents to help their special-needs children get ready for school: get clothes ready to go the night before; have a routine for homework; back-to-school shop in a tight timeframe, since that sometimes better fits the sense of time for the autistic; and use a large family calendar to keep track of schedules.

&lt;p&gt;Local conferences are great sources of information and connection, assuming one has the time to attend (and who doesn’t know that half the country has been laid off?). Madison Cortland ARC and the Arc of Oneida Lewis in New York, will offer a full-day seminar on Tuesday, September 22: “Advances in Understanding and Interventions- Autism Spectrum Disorders and Asperger’s Syndrome in Children.” The seminar will be given by Dr. Celine Saulnier, training director for the Yale Autism Program at the Yale Child Study Center. Goals of the conference include differences between Autism and Asperger’s, assessments and diagnostic procedures in evaluating ASD. key elements in appropriate educational programs and teaching strategies, social skills interventions and communication strategies, and common pitfalls in treatment and intervention services. The event will be at the Shenandoah Golf Club of Turning Stone Resort in Verona, N.Y. Cost will be $50 for a family member, $60 for a NYSARC staff person, and $70 for a teacher or other professional. Registration deadline is September 15. For more info, call Madison Cortland ARC at 315.363.3389.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/weekend_diversion_preparing_fo/02%2520February%25201.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some places have it far worse than others.  For instance, in many places of the world relatively close to the equator, the dead of winter still brings tremendous amounts of daylight:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/weekend_diversion_preparing_fo/winter-solstice-sunrise-to-sunset.jpg" width="512" title="At about 45 degrees latitude, you still get about 9 hours of sunlight at winther solstice." alt="winter-solstice-sunrise-to-sunset.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other places closer to the Arctic/Antarctic circles, the winter solstice barely brings any daylight at all, making for an incredibly dreary, depressing time:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/weekend_diversion_preparing_fo/winter-solstice-fairbanks-alaska.jpg" width="512" title="In Fairbanks, Alaska, winter solstice brings about a cool 2 hours of Sun." alt="winter-solstice-fairbanks-alaska.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some people thrive in the cold.  Some people can take what would be a challenging, intense situation and simply do their best work under those circumstances.  My friend &lt;a href="http://www.astronautforhire.com/2009/09/fmars-retrospective.html"&gt;Brian was only 11 degrees away from the North Pole&lt;/a&gt; this summer, and loved it.  But now one of my cherished SciBlings, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/"&gt;grrlscientist&lt;/a&gt;, has an opportunity to do something just as cool at the other pole, but she needs our help.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quark Expeditions is looking for an official blogger to join their expedition to Antarctica.  And &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2009/06/the_gift_of_an_adventure_of_a.php"&gt;she is not only in the running&lt;/a&gt;, and not only one of the leading vote-getters, she's &lt;i&gt;the best qualified person&lt;/i&gt; of all the top candidates.  Seriously, go check it out &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/entries"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, sort it by popularity, and here's what you'll find:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/weekend_diversion_preparing_fo/yougottabekiddingme.jpg" width="500" title="A barely literate candidate should not be the leading vote-getter!" alt="yougottabekiddingme.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first guy?  &lt;b&gt;Can't even write properly!&lt;/b&gt;  It's seriously appalling.  The second guy?  &lt;b&gt;No understanding of science whatsoever&lt;/b&gt;, and it looks like the only reason he's got so many votes is because of his relation to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donny_Osmond"&gt;another Osmond&lt;/a&gt;.  The third person?  That's our Grrl!  &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/view/152"&gt;Go vote for her here!&lt;/a&gt;  (Yes, you have to register.)  This isn't just about helping out another scienceblogger, it's about declaring that the most coveted jobs should &lt;i&gt;go to the best people&lt;/i&gt;.  And I can't think of a better message to send this Labor Day.  So seriously, go &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/view/152"&gt;vote for her&lt;/a&gt;.  Help her make the most of her keystrokes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the best I have to look forward to this winter is another one of these in Portland:

As I am currently living in Portugal, I do not know what the situation is in other countries, but I can tell you how the situation is here. Every news bulletin starts with more news about the flu, even though no one has died here yet. It then finishes with a previously recorded warning on how one should wash hands frequently and keep 1m away from other people while talking to them, quite an ordeal in a country where the common greeting is a couple of kisses in the cheek. In addition, we have ambulances going around with the paramedics dressed as in the photo, right out of films like ‘Outbreak’. Now, most people seem to assume that because I have just graduated with a Biology degree that I should know everything there is to know about the current flu. Besides the generic question ‘So, what do you think about this flu thing?’, I have had some more specific questions, from ‘I heard that it is impossible for this combination of genes to happen in nature, surely this must have been created by evil scientists with corporative interests?’ to ‘This virus is called H1N1, the 1918 pandemic virus was also H1N1, are we all going to die of Spanish flu?’. I try to explain people that at uni we are taught how to get informed about things, rather than becoming specialist on every single biological problems; and that frankly I am so fed up of hearing about this flu that I couldn’t be bothered to look it up. However, I think the hysteria might be affecting me, probably because I’ve just read the book Blindness (if you have read it/watched the film you will know why). So I decided to interrupt my holidays-away-from-science to read a bit about this topic, and thought I would tell you some of my findings.My first port of call was the website of the World Health Organisation, usually a reliable source for information. I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of over-dramatic information. There is of course a whole section dedicated to this flu, right in the home page, but the answers given in the FAQs seem quite sensible. It tells us that 2009 A(H1N1) is spread as the normal flu, and that the current worries as based on the fact that being a virus which never circulated in humans before, there is no, or very little, immunity. In addition, as stated in their website, the virus is spreading fast in young people (10-45), from a majority of mild cases to some serious illnesses, the majority of which in patients with underlying conditions. The recommendations of the WHO are to take pain killers and drink loads of fluids if you have the flu. And only contact the medical services if you have serious symptoms like shortness of breath, or if the fever lasts for longer than 3 days. Quite unlike what recently happened in Portugal. When a  man who had travelled to Britain was diagnosed with this flu, he saw his house invaded by doctors who quickly took him away to a hospital and confined the whole family to their house. Without telling them what to do or when they could leave.Anyway, I then thought it would be a good idea to read some information from journals, a bit more scientific and hopefully less dramatic source of news. However, as you know, I am currently unable to access most papers, as I am in between universities and am yet to be provided with a username in my new institution. So what follows is based on a couple of papers I could access, and is by no means comprehensive.As an introduction, some information from the Virology handouts we were given last October. Influenza viruses are RNA viruses that have a segmented genome (8 segments/genome). The glycoprotein spikes, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are important in the entrance of the virus in the host cells. There are 15 known HA and 9 NA serotypes, and their combination provides the name that we see for the viruses such as H1N1. Birds and pigs are important reservoirs for genetic and antigenically diversity and reassortment in these viruses. In particular pigs, as their cells can be infected by both avian and human influenza viruses, making them nice ‘mixing pots’.In July this year Garten et al., published a paper in Science in which they characterised the 2009 A(H1N1) virus both antigenically and genetically. They start the paper by giving a small introduction on the influenza pandemics of the last century, and how we got from those to the current 2009 A(H1N1). Then it goes on to characterise the actual viruses. The closest ancestral gene for each of the eight segments seems to have a swine origin, although having originally come from avians and sometimes humans in different occasions. This is quite interesting, as swine influenza viruses had not, until now, caused much disease or been incredibly good at human-human transmission. As the authors point out, this virus probably had been circulating for a while in pigs, unnoticed due to lack of monitoring.Analysis of the virus genome showed that none of the molecular signatures of increased transmissibility or virulence of A(H1N1) viruses can be found in this strain, and that functionally important receptor binding sites on HA do not differ from classic swine influenza viruses. No markers were also found that indicate adaptation to the human host or features of previous pandemic virus. The main important difference seems to be a genetic marker for resistance to adamantine antivirals, but the virus still seems to be sensitive to the other type of antivirals, the neuraminidase inhibitors. So, this study concludes, we must be worried about this virus firstly because we don’t really know what makes it good at replicating in humans, and secondly because it has a genetic composition not seen before, so we don’t really know what to expect.I then went on to read a couple of papers regarding studies done in mammal models such as ferrets (apparently classic models for influenza studies) and mice.The first study was published in Science also in July, by Maines et al. This post is becoming quite long already, so I’ll just summarise their results (based on 3 independently isolated 2009 A(H1N1) viruses as compared with a seasonal influenza strain). They basically inoculated 106 p.f.u in ferrets and monitored different indicators such as body weight, viral titres, direct and indirect transmissibility, etc. The main conclusion from the study was that 2009 A(H1N1) caused higher morbidity (weight loss, etc, depending on which virus isolate), showed, unlike seasonal flu, high viral titres in the lower respiratory tract or the intestine, but that it was less efficient at indirect transmission (putting healthy ferrets in cages near to inoculated animals).The second animal study I looked at was published online by Nature, in what they call a ‘near final version’. They also used virus isolated from infected humans, though not all of which were the same as in the Science paper. They studied the effect of these viruses in mice, macaques, ferrets and pigs, though not all of the virus isolates seem to have been used in all of the experiments. They also looked at more indicators, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, lung pathology, etc. In ferrets the results were similar to those of the Science paper, except that this time indirect transmission was successful. In mice and macaques, the 2009 A(H1N1) virus seems to be worse than the seasonal virus (at least one of the isolates that they seem to mostly use throughout, CA04) although according with which criteria varies with the model. The inoculated pigs were asymptomatic, explaining why the virus had not been noticed before in this animal.So, what are the conclusions I could get, overall, from these three studies? Overall it seems that the 2009 A(H1N1) virus is worse than the seasonal influenza viruses in mammalian models. However, how much worse is probably hard to say. I am not familiar at all with viral studies, so it is hard for me to critically analyse these studies, but it seems to me that in most cases the n numbers were quite small (n=3 in some cases in the Nature study), but this is perhaps not surprising, as they must have been quite quick studies, considering the current need to understand this new virus. And, as it is probably the case in most animal studies in general, I reckon the doses used were probably much higher than what humans would be exposed to in the real world. In addition, there is always the question on how well do these animal models really reflect what happens in humans.In any case, it seems that so far these studies indicate that 2009 A(H1N1) is, in these models, worse than seasonal flu. Whether it is as bad as some of the pandemics that have been affecting us in the last 100 years it is unknown. The other worry is of course that the virus might evolve i...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

What if social scientists could exploit this technology to spy on our social behaviour: who we speak to and who we spend time with? It turns out they already are. Nathan Eagle, named recently as a leading young innovator by Technology Review, and his colleagues, have published one of the first studies into social network analysis using spy software loaded onto Nokia smartphones.For  nine months, Eagle&amp;#39;s team recorded data from the phones of 94 students and staff at MIT. By using blue-tooth technology and phone masts, they could monitor the movements of the participants, as well as their phone calls. Their main goal with this preliminary study was to compare data collected from the phones with subjective self-report data collected through traditional survey methodology.The participants were asked to estimate their average spatial proximity to the other participants, whether they were close friends, and to indicate how satisfied they were at work.Some intriguing findings emerged. For example, the researchers could predict with around 95 per cent accuracy who was friends with whom by looking at how much time participants spent with each other during key periods, such as Saturday nights.There were also discrepancies between the two data sets. For example, participants tended to overestimate how much time they spent with friends, and underestimate how much time they spent with non-friends. Also, the accuracy of the self-report proximity data tended to peak over the previous seven days (at which point it correlated highly with the phone records), but then it&amp;#39;s accuracy tailed off. This provides useful information about the validity of survey records over time, and an interesting insight into people&amp;#39;s memories for their social interactions.As regards satisfaction at work, it turned out that people who were in closer proximity to their friends during work time, tended to be happier at work, whilst participants less happy at work tended to make more phone calls to friends during work hours.&amp;quot;Data collected from mobile phones have the potential to provide insight into the underlying relational dynamics of organisations, communities and potentially societies,&amp;quot; the researchers said._________________________________Eagle, N., Pentland, A., &amp;amp; Lazer, D.

Hot, hot, caliente science. I feel like we have already established that, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to do hot science has not been a trivial thing, but learning to write in the scientific arena was orders of magnitude harder. It's still something that does not come easy for me and that I have had to practice to improve. I learned the first time I received my first &lt;a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail204.html"&gt;crapvalanche&lt;/a&gt; of papers from a group of students that I am not the only one who has had trouble translating the suckquake of writing I learned in high school and as an undergraduate into successful scientific writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if scientific writing is something that we don&amp;#39;t spend enough time teaching pre-graduate school level students.  I know that in science courses I&amp;#39;ve taught that have required papers, the most formal instruction time I have been able to devote to writing is showing them this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

Strong Bad is full of wisdom and has taught me about 90% of the awesome stuff I know. I'd encourage you to check him out &lt;a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I mean, seriously, I would love to receive a love poem like &lt;a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail195.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; from the man I love.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I digress. This long, overly drawn-out, unnecessary introduction had tweo purposes -- 1) to give me an excuse to use Strong Bad in a blog. I &amp;lt;3 Strong Bad. 2) to point the following resource out to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend someone showed me "&lt;a href="http://depts.washington.edu/engl/askbetty/"&gt;Ask Betty: Grammar in College Writing&lt;/a&gt;." Ask Betty is run by the Department of English at the Univeristy of Washington and has all sorts of great information. It has a list of common editing symbols for those of us who edits papers and a lessons on common &lt;a href="http://depts.washington.edu/engl/askbetty/10main.php"&gt;grammatical mistakes&lt;/a&gt; for those of us who are writing papers. I think this site could potentially be a fantastic resource for those of use who speak English as a second language. There's a &lt;a href="http://depts.washington.edu/engl/askbetty/faq.php"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A page&lt;/a&gt; with examples of phrases and discussion of whether they are well-written. There is also a &lt;a href="http://depts.washington.edu/engl/askbetty/review.php"&gt;resource page&lt;/a&gt; with links to external writing resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go check out Ask Betty and send it to your students. I am tempted to write and ask if, "That was a &lt;a href="http://getyourownmotherfuckingblogasshole.wordpress.com/"&gt;profound act of goatfuckery&lt;/a&gt;" is grammatically correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/basic_writing_resources_for_ba.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/Fr3weni-CKs" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252261230590"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=1051">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bda3edce4f7045d3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="advertising"/><category term="alfonso ribeiro"/><category term="annulment"/><category term="catholicism"/><category term="coeliac disease"/><category term="communion"/><category term="mormons"/><category term="natural family planning"/><category term="top chef"/><title type="html">Dear Catholics: Please Hire Alfonso Ribeiro</title><published>2009-09-06T17:25:12Z</published><updated>2009-09-06T17:25:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2009/09/06/dear-catholics-please-hire-alfonso-ribeiro/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why is Catholicism losing popularity?  While researching &lt;a href="http://yrif.org/book"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; I conducted several focus groups and found that the most common reasons were things like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Communion rituals unfairly &lt;a href="http://www.adoremus.org/0904CeliacDisease.html"&gt;exclude&lt;/a&gt; coeliac disease sufferers
&lt;li&gt; lost faith in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_family_planning"&gt;natural family planning&lt;/a&gt; after tenth pregnancy
&lt;li&gt; tired of being solicited for contributions every papal election season
&lt;li&gt; can’t believe in a god who would condemn “Top Chef” Season 3 favorite &lt;a href="http://chicago.metromix.com/restaurants/article/life-after-top-chef/335721/content"&gt;Dale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; don’t understand why children of “annulled” marriages &lt;a href="http://www.dioceseoflincoln.org/purple/anullments/index.htm#4"&gt;don’t become illegitimate&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Catholicism false
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why I’m skeptical of the &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lapsed-catholics6-2009sep06,0,2441126.story"&gt;new Catholic ad campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn’t seem to address any of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“In this world filled with chaos, hardship and pain, it’s comforting to know that some things remain consistent, true and strong,” an announcer says. “If you’ve been away from the Catholic Church, we invite you to take another look. . . . We are Catholic. Welcome home.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you’re one of the handful of people who left the church searching for a religion where you get to sit in an airplane hangar after you die and watch a movie showing all of your old haircuts, some of your worst pecadilloes, and the time you had sex with a blonde teenager in a cheap motel, then this new ad campaign is for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Although Mormon ad campaigns have been similarly ineffective, at least they were savvy enough to cast the always-watchable &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNaHUxi6H-U&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;Alfonso Ribeiro&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252259884700"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/06/the-sunday-snog-9/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7565dc9f76b74c25</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="science of kissing"/><category term="Archie"/><category term="The Sunday Snog"/><category term="Veronica"/><title type="html">The Sunday Snog</title><published>2009-09-06T17:27:59Z</published><updated>2009-09-06T17:27:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/06/the-sunday-snog-9/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/05/28/archie-betty-and-veronica-a-timeline/" title="090528s_archie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I just got my first flea: &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/09/robert-wright-against-jerry-coyne.html"&gt;a piece by Jim Manzi at the Daily Dish&lt;/a&gt; (Andrew Sullivan’s blog at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;) defending Robert Wright against &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books/creationism-liberals"&gt;my &lt;em&gt;New Republic &lt;/em&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt; of Wright’s book, &lt;em&gt;The Evolution of God&lt;/em&gt;. I’m not familiar with Manzi, but he’s the former chairman of Lotus Corporation, who now writes on science, politics, and technology. (&lt;strong&gt;CORRECTION&lt;/strong&gt;: not the same Jim Manzi — see his comment appended — although also a software entrepeneur.) And I don’t know his connection with Sullivan, nor how people get to blog on &lt;em&gt;The Daily Dish&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Manzi’s piece is not impressive, even for a flea, and I’ll respond briefly.  “In Defense of Robert Wright Against Jerry Coyne” resurrects two old theological arguments, but presents them as new.  And neither stands up any better than it did when rebutted decades ago by philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manzi begins by claiming that I have definitively ruled God out of the evolutionary process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coyne is an eminent evolutionary biologist, but here makes an enormous claim about the philosophical implications of science: that evolution through natural selection demonstrates that there is no divine plan for the universe. I think this claim is, in fact, a gigantic leap of faith unsupported by any scientific findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong!  What I have said — repeatedly — is that there is&lt;em&gt; no evidence&lt;/em&gt; for a divine plan for the universe.  There could, of course, be a divine plan that happens to coincide with The Big Bang, evolution, and all the materialistic processes we study, and we wouldn’t be able to disprove that.  Deistic evolution, in which  a god starts everything off and then retires, could be a divine plan, though of course it’s not the sort of divine plan that many religious people would accept.  All that science can do on this front is to seek evidence for a divine plan &lt;em&gt;of a certain type&lt;/em&gt;, and either support or falsify that plan.  Some divine plans — for example, those that preclude innocent people or animals from needless suffering — have already been ruled out by science.  Science has also dismissed any divine plan that involves an omnipotent and omnibenevolent god.   Science and reason, then, can have things to say about Divine Plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manzi goes on to describe, in tedious detail, various search algorithms used by computer scientists and others, algorithms that are somewhat analogous to evolution by natural selection, except that the human algorithms all have goals built in.  It’s not clear what point Manzi is making with the analogy between biology and programming, but he seems to think that because these evolutionary algorithms arrive at good results, then  a). evolution by natural selection is also a “designed” algorithm (i.e., it gives evidence for a designer, something that Wright believes as well), and b). there is a divine purpose behind it all — that evolution has a goal. (This too was suggested by Wright.) &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Ponzi&lt;/span&gt; Manzi does admit that we don’t know exactly what that purpose is, but asserts that science can’t rule it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Manzi’s main points are two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.   The “first cause” argument is evidence for God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he says:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is obvious from the factory analogy that evolution does not eliminate the problem of ultimate origins. Physical genomes are composed of parts, which in turn are assembled from other subsidiary components according to physical laws. We could, in theory, push this construction process back through components and sub-components all the way to the smallest sub-atomic particles currently known, but we would still have to address the problem of original creation. Even if we argue that, as per the GA which spontaneously generates the initial population, that prior physical processes created matter, we are still left with the more profound question of the origin of the rules of the physical process themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is a very old question that far pre-dates modern science. A scientific theory is a falsifiable rule that relates cause to effect. If you push the chain of causality back far enough, you either find yourself more or less right back where Aristotle was more than 2,000 years ago in stating his view that any conception of any chain of cause-and-effect must ultimately begin with an Uncaused Cause, or just accept the problem of infinite regress. No matter how far science advances, an explanation of ultimate origins seems always to remain a non-scientific question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. This chestnut is so old that it’s fossilized.  And the answer to this claim hasn’t changed for decades:  why is God any more an “uncaused cause” than is the universe, or the “physical laws” themselves?  God is always called the “uncaused cause” without further explanation, but that simply won’t do.  If He &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an uncaused cause, what did He do before creating everything? Hang around twiddling His thumbs?  The people who make this argument are claiming, in effect, that God is &lt;em&gt;by definition&lt;/em&gt; an uncaused cause, but we can properly ask “What caused God?” with exactly the same tenacity that theists ask “What caused matter?” And why is God exempt from having a cause, but matter or physical laws are not?  This is just sophistry.  Faitheist philosophers are always telling us that we don’t grasp the subtleties of theological argument, but that won’t wash here: Manzi’s argument is identical to that made by Aquinas and refuted by Hume and his successors. It ain’t subtle.  You can look up the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  Evolution might very well have a God-induced purpose, but scientists can’t discern it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now consider the relationship of the second observation to the problem of final cause. The factory GA [genetic algorithm], as we saw, had a goal. Evolution in nature is more complicated — but the complications don’t mean that the process is goalless, just that determining this goal would be so incomprehensibly hard that in practice it falls into the realm of philosophy rather than science. Science can not tell us whether or not evolution through natural selection has some final cause or not; if we believe, for some non-scientific reason, that evolution has a goal, then science can not, as of now, tell what that goal might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh.  First of all, what reason do we have to think that evolution &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; a goal?  That idea doesn’t come from empirical observation, for there’s not a scintilla of evidence that evolution is being externally driven toward some specific product.  Nor does it come from reason, for if you understand natural selection you see that it &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; have a goal.  As Manzi recognizes, the idea that there’s a “goal” has to come from &lt;em&gt;religion&lt;/em&gt;.   Well, if that is the case, can religion&lt;em&gt; tell us &lt;/em&gt;what that goal might be? (We all know, by the way, that it’s a certain hairless primate.)  Nope.  Religion is in fact &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; than science in studying whether evolution has a “goal,” for faith, unlike science, has no way to test any hypothesis it comes up with.  If we think that humans are the goal, then why did it take so many billions of years for us to appear?  And would we have appeared if the African forests hadn’t disappeared? Why weren’t dolphins, or squirrels, the goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most tellingly, everything we know about evolution and natural selection militates against the idea of an externally-imposed goal, both because of the way the process works (competition between genes to leave copies of themselves in a contingent and changing world), and because evolution goes in different directions in different lineages, depending on what happens to be useful in different environments. (Fleas lost wings, dinosaurs gained them.)  If complex humans were the goal, why do the rest of the millions of species over the history of life go off in completely different directions?  What kind of goal-driven process is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manzi’s conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory of evolution, then, has not &lt;em&gt;eliminated&lt;/em&gt; the problems of ultimate origins and ultimate purpose with respect to the development of organisms; it has ignored them. These problems are defined as non-scientific questions, not because we don’t care about the answers, but because attempting to solve them would impede practical progress. Accepting evolution, therefore, requires neither the denial of a Creator nor the loss of the idea of ultimate purpose. It resolves neither issue for us one way or the other. The field of philosophical speculation that does not contradict any valid scientific findings is much wider open to Wright than Coyne is willing to accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, I agree that evolution doesn’t disprove a creator or purpose.  You can have a deistic creator who set things in motion and went to lunch, and you can have a purpose that is “making everything look as if it evolved by natural means.”  Beyond that, Houston, we have problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In  the end, Manzi fails to tell us why we should even see “ultimate origin” and “ultimate purpose” as &lt;em&gt;problems&lt;/em&gt;, at least, as problems whose solution is God.  What is the “purpose” of a snowflake? Its marvelous “designed” appearance is the ineluctable result of natural processes acting on matter.  There is no mind, no God, behind its appearance.  The products of natural selection and evolution are like snowflakes.  There is not one speck of evidence contradicting the idea that &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, like all species, is the result of physical processes (transmuted into biological processes) acting on matter. As to where that matter came from, well, we don’t yet know, but we might someday. Manzi, on the other hand, will never know — not as long as he forsakes science for theology.  And perhaps, if he thinks about it, he will realize that science can indeed address — and refute– &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;religious theories about creation and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;:  Manzi’s logical and biological errors have now been &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/09/in-defense-of-robert-wright-against-jerry-coyne-ctd.html"&gt;pointed out by others&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The Daily Dish. &lt;/em&gt;He answers these critics &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/09/in-defense-of-robert-wright-against-jerry-coyne-ctd-1.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img title="flea-info1" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/flea-info1.gif?w=82&amp;amp;h=82" alt="flea-info1" width="82" height="82"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The book is a look at six Christian families and how they homeschool their children.  Not every family fits the stereotype I know I have in my mind.  Some are impressive; others leave much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following passage, the author visits Bridgeway Academy, a homeschool umbrella organization (with over 100 families enrolled in their program) in Los Angeles.  The founders are &lt;strong&gt;Alan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Priscilla Bartlett&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author brings up the point that, for some children, homeschooling may not be the best option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“So is the child just out of luck,” I ask, “if she happens to be born to parents who neglect their responsibility to educate her, and she’s functionally illiterate at age eighteen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The child is not out of luck, because, see, there are larger issues here,” Alan says.  “There is the providence of God.  Children don’t just arrive in families by happenstance.  And as hard as it is for us to be willing to understand, every family, every individual, is under the providential direction of God.  But the other issue is, the family doesn’t exist in isolation.  You don’t just jump from the family to the state government.  There’s extended family, there’s community, there’s church.  And all those things used to have a tremendous force, and to the extent that government has this larger and larger role, those forces have broken down.  And the state can’t raise children.  (p. 69-70)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You may like it, though, so feel free to check it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, I have decided to make the switch to &lt;a href="http://www.mendeley.com/"&gt;Mendeley&lt;/a&gt;, a desktop application with an optional online sync function.  It is still in beta, but is coming along nicely and soon should be able to do all the things I want.  Specifically, allowing PDFs to be linked with records and read within the program, searching within PDFs, creating "playlists" rather than separate files for each paper I am working on, and automatic organization and renaming of PDFs in a single folder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The program is not quite there yet, but I am now very optimistic.  For now, the automatic metadata extraction is pretty much useless when you import a PDF, but then again I currently have to enter everything manually anyway with my existing program.  In this case, you can have the PDF open in the same screen as the record update window.  This alone is much easier than flipping back and forth or printing every reference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[UPDATE: The metadata extraction works a &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;lot&lt;/span&gt; better if you set up a Mendeley account and mostly use newer reprints, and even better if you then do a "search by title" once the file is imported).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another issue is that it is dreadfully slow when loading if you have a lot of PDFs.  Apparently this only happens when you first input a bunch of new papers, but we'll see.  I have thousands of papers that will need to be entered, so if it can't handle it, then it's not going to work.  Also, it has a tendency to crash when inputting a lot of papers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, the program looks like it will be great once the bugs are worked out and some other missing features are incorporated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This raises a larger point, which is that free, community-driven projects are getting to be my preferred kind of software.  This is because the programmers are usually very responsive to user feedback, and in many cases users themselves can create add-ons for specific functions that make the software even more useful.  Here are some additional examples:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; -- A great browser, with an unbelievable collection of user-provided plugins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/"&gt;Google Earth&lt;/a&gt; -- Simply awesome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/ig"&gt;iGoogle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/reader"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; -- Also awesome.

We can pinpoint the amygdala as being the &amp;quot;source&amp;quot; of the flight-or-fight (ie, fear) response, and we have now learned that as we (or, at least, as rats) grow, a &amp;quot;protective molecular sheath&amp;quot; coats the cells of the amygdala, which seems to also &amp;quot;protect&amp;quot; the memories contained within. So baby rats can forget &amp;quot;traumatic&amp;quot; experiences which would otherwise elicit the fear response. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean, however, that chemically (or otherwise) removing this molecular cell coating would actually &amp;quot;erase&amp;quot; memories. Baby rats forget past fears, adult rats do not; adult rats with the molecular coating removed recover &amp;quot;their early ability to erase fearful memories.&amp;quot; This is not the same as actually erasing the memories themselves. Current phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder therapies aim to &amp;quot;reprogram&amp;quot; the person&amp;#39;s fear response - such that, as the story says, a soldier who survived being in a car bomb can &amp;quot;learn to believe that a car ride doesn&amp;#39;t have to end in violence.&amp;quot; The advent of drug therapies which would dissolve this chemical sheath on amygdala cells would still need to be in tandem with psychological treatment. This, of course, also assumes that human beings would react as rats do to the removal of this molecular layer. Though we are similar, we are not the same. And, in the end, is it so bad that fearful memories are &amp;quot;erasure-resistant,&amp;quot; as the study itself (ref 1) says? We may not wish to remember, but is that cause enough to warrant forgetting?The second story is also quite interesting. Several biologists from the University of New Mexico and UBC in Vancouver argue that one thing - disease - basically shapes who we are and how we behave, anthropologically speaking (ref 2). The article in Smithsonian Magazine does an excellent job of explaining the main points; to quote the author, Rob Dunn&amp;#39;s, summary:Their theory is simple. Where diseases are common, individuals are mean to strangers. Strangers may carry new diseases and so one would do best to avoid them. When people avoid strangers—those outside the tribe—communication among tribes breaks down. That breakdown allows peoples, through time, to become more different.Differences accumulate until in places with more diseases, for example Nigeria or Brazil, there are more cultures and languages. Sweden, for example, has few diseases and only 15 languages; Ghana, which is a similar size, has many diseases and 89 languages. Cultural diversity is, in this view, a consequence of disease.Then Fincher and colleagues go even further. Where people are more xenophobic and cultures more differentiated from one another, wars are more likely. Democratic governments are less likely because the tribe or group comes first; the nation and individuals in other tribes within the nation come second. And finally, poverty becomes nearly inevitable as a consequence of poor governance, hostility between groups, and the factor that triggered this cascade in the first place—disease.It&amp;#39;s a rather convincing argument, but, as we all know, everything looks like a nail when one has a spiffy new hammer. First and foremost, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Many of those who commented on the article pointed out weaknesses in the study&amp;#39;s theory, in addition to citing counter-examples:&amp;quot;Wouldn&amp;#39;t this behavior eventually prove maladaptive? While disease-induced xenophobia might ensure a group&amp;#39;s survival over the course of a few generations, wouldn&amp;#39;t that group eventually become inbred if its members cannot curb their distrust of outsiders?&amp;quot; - Matthew Graybosch&amp;quot;The only way this theory works is if the researchers can demonstrate that indigenous theories of death and disease act identically to the modern germ theory they are using in this model.&amp;quot; - heteromeles&amp;quot;Much as we are an animal, our society is far more complex and our behavior is, biologically looking, often times irrational and likely governed by more than biological factors, at least as we understand them now (although they do provide neurological and hormonal framework).&amp;quot; - Marko Pecarevic&amp;quot;...a small, genetically-homogeneous population may have particular reason to fear stranger&amp;#39;s diseases, since these may wipe them out. The way out of this trap is to outbreed. But this exposes you to more diseases.&amp;quot; - Peter H. ProctorWhile &amp;quot;rudeness&amp;quot; specifically isn&amp;#39;t actually explained by the theory (but who reads articles titled &amp;quot;Pathogen prevalence predicts human cross-cultural variability in individualism/collectivism&amp;quot; anyway?), it would seem that, in the end, biology cannot alone explain the behavior of human beings, no matter how pretty a theory might appear (biology isn&amp;#39;t like physics, sorry boys!). There has been, and perhaps always will be, a continuing argument over nature versus nurture (as Dunn eloquently wrote, &amp;quot;Somewhere, probably, a cultural anthropologist is writing and rewriting a thorough and vehement response.&amp;quot;). Perhaps this is somewhere &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; religion can help - not the xenophobic, cultish religion, but the &amp;quot;love your neighbor as yourself,&amp;quot; good-Samaritan, &amp;quot;heal the sick&amp;quot; kind of religion. We are taught to always extend our hand, even to the sick and leprous, and in light of the theory, this encouragement of sociological &amp;quot;mixing&amp;quot; would, in the end, bolster our immunity, both to disease and to fear of cultural diversity.References:(1)Gogolla N, Caroni P, Lüthi A, &amp;amp; Herry C (2009).

(I even ran into an allusion to it in a &lt;em&gt;La Repubblica&lt;/em&gt; piece on the Google Book Settlement when I arrived in Rome yesterday morning.) A number of people passed along their own &lt;a href="http://segalbooks.blogspot.com/2009/08/google-books-broken.html"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; with flaky metadata. Others criticized me on grounds that could be broadly summed up as "Don't look a gift horse in the server," "It's better than nothing," "Who needs metadata anyway?," "J&lt;a href="http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2009/09/white-dielectric-substance-in-library.html"&gt;ust&lt;/a&gt; give them time," and "Why &lt;a href="http://northwesthistory.blogspot.com/2009/09/googles-book-search-disaster-for.html"&gt;concentrate&lt;/a&gt; on trivialities like metadata while ignoring the real perils of corporate monopoly" (as in "serving as a consultant for monitoring the proper temperatures of the pitchforks in hell").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all to the good, if it helps move up the metadata issues in Google's queue. I do think this will get a lot better as Google puts its considerable mind to it. But there was one other aspect of the metadata problem which I hadn't noticed or even thought about, but which in its own small way was unkindest cut of all. It was &lt;a href="http://acebauer.livejournal.com/"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; by the children's book author Ace Bauer, who was prompted by my account of the metadata problems to check his &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4U5KNBFZp58C&amp;amp;dq=%22No+Castles+Here%22&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"&gt;Google Books listing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out my &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4U5KNBFZp58C&amp;amp;sitesec=reviews&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"&gt;review rating&lt;/a&gt; ranked only one star out of 5. That's dim. But see, the review upon which they based this ranking was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkus_Reviews"&gt;Kirkus&lt;/a&gt;'s. Kirkus &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;loved&lt;/span&gt; the book. They gave it a star. One star. That's all they give folks. It's considered a major honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed it is, and actually the falling-star glitch affects a number of writers, for example Roy Blount, Jr., the president of the Author's Guild, who is has been an enthusiastic &lt;a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/advocacy/articles/roy-blount-on-google-orphans.html"&gt;backer&lt;/a&gt; of the settlement. Google Books assigns a one-out-of-five star rating to at least two of Blount's books on the basis of their starred Kirkus reviews, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Zz2PAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;sitesec=reviews&amp;amp;rf=ns:1"&gt;Crackers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Zz2PAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;sitesec=reviews&amp;amp;rf=ns:1"&gt;First Hubby,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt; and visits similar review rating downgrades on books by Guild vice-president &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GXUyIl_jARsC&amp;amp;sitesec=reviews&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"&gt;Judy Blume&lt;/a&gt; and Guild board members &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DqlGuTpjmFUC&amp;amp;sitesec=reviews&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"&gt;Nick Lemann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IWQ_y90P2uIC&amp;amp;sitesec=reviews&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"&gt;James Glieck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2uNaAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;sitesec=reviews&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"&gt;Oscar Hijuelos&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I don't know exactly what the Google people will say when they cotton to this one, but it's a good guess the first sentence will begin with "oy."&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;It's got to be a frustrating if very minor gaffe, particularly given the trouble Google went to to reach an accord with the authors. Of course it isn't hard to see how it could have happened, and it probably won't be that hard to fix, but it underscores the usefulness of having book-savvy people looking over your shoulder when you're setting up your metadata, whether you generate them yourself or get them from a provider. There's a transitivity to cluelessness. If you pass on obviously broken data, whether about starred review rankings or the quarter of a million Portuguese language books all dated 1899, you're apt to look foolish yourself, the same  way you do as soon as you put on the dumb t-shirt your grandmother sent you from Atlantic City. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be reviewing the book elsewhere, so it would be inappropriate for me to comment here, but you can read extracts from &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,4217,Extract-from-Chapter-One-of-The-Greatest-Show-on-Earth,Richard-Dawkins---Times-Online"&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_extracts/article6808173.ece"&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;Times Online&lt;/em&gt;.  Richard also gives a video introduction to &lt;em&gt;TGSOE&lt;/em&gt; in a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-QWv_0Mjq0"&gt;short YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I’ve seen three reviews of the book: by paleontologist Richard Fortey in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/sep/05/richard-dawkins-greatest-show-evolution"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, by Anjana Ahuja in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article6812474.ece"&gt;Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and by an anonymous reviewer in &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14361755"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (for some bizarre reason, &lt;em&gt;Economist&lt;/em&gt; reviews are never signed).  And of course the sourpuss creationists at the Discovery Institute have already &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/dear-richard-dawkins-what-is-new-in-your-book/"&gt;dismissed the book &lt;/a&gt;as a compendium of the “same tired old evidences.”  Well, some of them may be tired, but — unlike intelligent design — they have the merit of being &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA recently released this cool picture of &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/index.html"&gt;the Ares-1 rocket stack&lt;/a&gt; inside the assembly building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/evjx3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/08/ares-1.jpg" alt="The NASA Ares-1 rocket stack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not yet reached a conclusion about my personal opinion on the Ares rockets… there is much controversy and speculation going on right now about whether NASA will even build these rockets en masse to replace the Shuttle. &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/hsf/home/index.html"&gt;The Augustine Commission&lt;/a&gt; — a group of people asked to review NASA’s future of the Shuttle, Constellation, the space station, and going back to the Moon and on to Mars — released some of their results but I haven’t had time to review much yet. It’s a lot to read, and I have a lot to do. But I’m not exactly thrilled that this is happening this late in the game for NASA, when there are only six Shuttle flights left, and then the U.S.  faces a gap in our ability to loft humans into space that will last at least four years (and I’m betting it’ll be a lot more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a static test firing of the motor for Ares was supposed to happen the other day, but was canceled due to a failed power unit, and the test has been postponed for an undisclosed amount of time. These things happen, but it’s not a great sign.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252246621279"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-76835609729837720">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3ab64f06b9d9c4c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">To Moderate or Not to Moderate...</title><published>2009-09-06T13:04:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-06T14:14:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/V4QtdmCPuqw/to-moderate-or-not-to-moderate.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/76835609729837720/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=76835609729837720" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/09/to-moderate-or-not-to-moderate.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Based on my own judgment we'll continue to moderate comments here at DC. The recent polls are not that accurate of a measuring stick of the people who actually comment regularly at DC.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I shut the polls down here were the results:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On Moderating Comments at DC -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except for Extreme Abuses Let There be a Free For All 45 (35%)&lt;br&gt;Continue Moderation As Is  49 (38%)&lt;br&gt;Be Flexible Depending on the Threat  34 (26%)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A Reader Poll on Comments -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only Prohibit X-Rated Comments 44 (37%)&lt;br&gt;Prohibit X And R-Rated Comments 4 (3%)&lt;br&gt;Prohibit X, R-Rated Comments And Personal Attacks 24 (20%)&lt;br&gt;Prohibit All the Above Plus Ignorant or Troll Comments 35 (29%)&lt;br&gt;Prohibit All Comments 10 (8%)&lt;/blockquote&gt;My detractors want their cake and eat it too. If I allow a free for all, they'll spam up the combox to the point where no reasonable discussion can take place. There will be personal attack after personal attack, personal charges and counter-charges. That's the nature of the beast when there exists such a potent force like this site with these contributors who speak on the level of the average person for the most part.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If instead we moderate comments, my detractors will claim that I'm censoring speech by prohibiting some very important refutations of our arguments. This is not true nor has it ever been true. We follow a reasonable &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/02/our-policy-here.html"&gt;comment policy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A third option that I and/or other team members should monitor comments 24 hours a day (or even most of the day) is simply unacceptable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What my detractors must do is to provide reasons to suggest this Blog would not degenerate as described if there was a free for all, or else they must provide evidence that we have not followed our comment policy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My goal is to have a reasonable discussion of the ideas that separate us. That's all I have ever wanted. Some people do not share this goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until later, happy surfing!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and check out a couple of new books linked in the sidebar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-76835609729837720?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Hey Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I want to say that I’m really loving your advice column. I’ve always respected the thought you put into your posts and comments, and I think this format really works. I hope it’s a permanent feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question deals with people who say their life was the subject of country songs before they found god. Every now and then I’ll have a religious conversation in which someone says that if they hadn’t found Jesus, they’d be on drugs, raising ten welfare babies, or dying in a gutter with no reason to carry on. I’d guess that most of them would learn other ways of dealing with their problems, but there probably are some lives held together only by religion. Not wanting to mess up their life, I generally make an awkward move to drop the subject at that point. The odd thing is, sometimes people will say this and then continue to evangelize and press the debate. How do you think these situations should be handled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;
Mike
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mike,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguing with their beliefs is one thing.  Arguing with their decision to keep evangelizing you is another.   Both are completely okay for you to do, although the former is probably pointless while the latter might relieve you of an annoying pest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think you need to worry that arguing with these people about their beliefs will mess up their lives.  The only thing that might do is mess up your evening. They’re not going to end up “on drugs, raising ten welfare babies and dying in the gutter with no reason to carry on” just because you disagreed with their beliefs. If they were that fragile, they’d already be dead. The world is a tough place, and many people are not very tactful or diplomatic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have come to you, you have not come to them.  You won’t be the first person who as disagreed with them, and you &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; won’t be the one who persuades them to abandon their beliefs. My point is that it’s almost always a completely futile task, like bailing out a cesspool with a bottomless bucket. The only despair coming out of such a discussion will be from you, for having wasted an hour that you could have much better enjoyed by, say, watching your Aunt Mildred’s old grainy 8mm movies of the Ice Capades in 1961.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard many of these “tales of woe” at the beginning of testimonials for the transformative powers of a religion.  They take two forms:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A claim that this is how they actually lived, and now they are so much better because of their conversion to their religion, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A claim about how awful they &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be if not for their religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, It is impossible for you to know how much of it is true at all,  and how much of it is embellished.  That becomes moot anyway, because the more often they repeat the story, the more set and vivid it becomes in their minds, so that eventually they believe it themselves, even if at first it was an exaggeration or a complete fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that often it is a ploy, a manipulation with two purposes: Firstly, it is dramatic and grabs your attention.  If you assume it is a true story or a likely scenario, then it impressively portrays the power of their remedy.  The second thing it does is to make it more likely that a listener will refrain from challenging them, as it did to you, for fear that you might undermine their support and they would fall into that squalid life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it has stirred your compassion, you might also be reluctant to ask  them to please stop evangelizing you, and you’ll let them go on and on out of a sense of kindness to them.  Their illusion of vulnerability is actually an armor, and they are taking advantage of your sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s assume that you’re in a patient mood, and you listen to one of these missives of misery, and you say “uh-huh” at all the right places, and then at an opportune moment you try to close it with your version of “Well. Thank you for sharing,” but they don’t take the hint and they keep on going, starting into the really unwelcome evangelizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the vulnerability is an illusion. If they were that fragile, they’d already be dead.  You can’t destroy them by merely declining to listen any more. You don’t need to be rude or snide, but it is really okay to be firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try saying, “Jack, (always get their first name, and don’t offer them yours) I’m glad that you have something that has helped you with your challenges.  However, I don’t have those challenges, and we all have to find our own solutions to our own problems.  Thank you for telling me this, but it’s not for me.  Now let’s talk about something else, like…”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will have already thought of some change of subject, because  while listening to their story, you were observing something about them, or making note of some non-religious interest of theirs that they  had mentioned.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change of subject part is completely optional. You could just end it with “…but it’s not for me.”  No guilt is necessary.  You have the right to be left alone. They came to you, you didn’t come to them. You have not been aggressive, merely assertive.  Good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, you could just look them right in the eye and say with finality, “I’m an atheist.”  More often than not, they’ll leave faster than if you told them that the building is on fire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Workmans have joined with the Victorious Life Christian Center Church on Tamarack Circle North to organize a “Circle of Prayer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to circle the circle with enough people to pray over the community,” Mrs. Workman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that with the state of the community right now, the only thing that’s going to change it is prayer,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in that case, why not just keep all your doors unlocked while you’re at it? I mean, since you’ve already got God looking out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Canadian province of Quebec, a trial court judge has rejected a challenge by Christian parents to the mandatory new course in grades 1 through 11 in Quebec schools that teaches about a broad range of world religions. The Ethics and Religious Culture course covers Christianity, Judaism, aboriginal spirituality, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism… It replaces parents’ choice of one of three separate courses that focused on Catholic or Protestant thought, or moral instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is &lt;em&gt;SuperGod&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Warren Ellis&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Garrie Gastonny&lt;/strong&gt; and you can see a &lt;a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2009/09/03/preview-of-supergod-by-warren-ellis-and-garrie-gastonny/"&gt;preview of it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… In the world of SUPERGOD, superhumans are the ultimate expression of the Messiah complex, and scientists can build Messiahs who will fly down from the skies to save the world. No-one thought about how they’d do it — or even if they’d want to. So begins the apocalyptic tomorrow of SUPERGOD — the story of how supermen killed us all and ended the world just because we wanted to be rescued by human-shaped things from beyond Science itself! Take every superhero comic ever published, shove them into a nuclear-powered blender, soak it in bad vodka and set the whole thing alight — and SUPERGOD will crawl out and eat your brain!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Defined as a reduction in a conditioned fear response following a non reinforced exposure to a feared conditioned stimulus, fear extinction is known to involve the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). It&amp;#39;s also a frequently striven-for goal in cognitive behavioral therapy during the treatment of various phobias including arachibutyrophobia; the fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of the mouth, or barophobia; the fear of gravity. Unfortunately, extinguished fear responses sometimes reappear with the passage of time (spontaneous recovery), through a shift of context (renewal), or by unsignaled presentations of the unconditioned stimulus (reinstatement). However, the likelihood of these events happening after a few intense sessions of fear exposure may differ significantly depending on the age of the patient according to a new study published in this weeks Journal of Neuroscience.Kim, Hamlin, and Richardson investigated the role of the mPFC during fear extinction among postnatal 24 day rats (P24) and postnatal 17 day rats (P17). They found that temporary inactivation of the mPFC during extinction training blocked extinction retention the following day in P24 rats but not in P17 rats. Furthermore, through immunohistochemical analyses they observed that extinction of conditioned fear involved an increased number of phosphorylated MAPK-immunoreactive (pMAPK-IR) neurons in the mPFC and amygdala in P24 rats, but an elevation of these neurons was only seen in the amygdala of P17 rats. The results show that the mPFC has no part in the neural circuitry underlying fear extinction in P17 rats. The authors suggest that fear extinction is essentially the process of unlearning for the younger rats. In other words, they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;erasing&amp;quot; their fear altogether! These important findings may significantly impact the future treatment of phobias; targeting and treating fears earlier rather than later in life. Perhaps one day we can teach little barophobic Johnny why the force of gravity isn&amp;#39;t really such a scary thing after all.         Kim JH, Hamlin AS, &amp;amp; Richardson R (2009).

I will confess to having a strong preference for the original series (TOS), on account of that was what my parents watched with us when we were wee young nerds growing up.  (My dad had a freakish ability to tell within the first few words of Kirk's "captain's log" at the opening which episode it was going to be.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I didn't realize until I was a mature nerd was just how regularly, in TOS, Kirk and/or the rest of the crew of the Starship Enterprise violated &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive"&gt;the Prime Directive&lt;/a&gt;, which, as Wikipedia tells it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
dictates that there can be no interference with the internal development of pre-warp civilizations, consistent with the historical real world concept of Westphalian sovereignty. It has special implications, however, for civilizations that have not yet developed the technology for interstellar spaceflight ("pre-warp"), since no primitive culture can be given or exposed to any information regarding advanced technology or the existence of extraplanetary civilizations, lest this exposure alter the natural development of the civilization. Although this was the only application stated by Captain Kirk in "Return of the Archons", by the 24th Century, it had been indicated to include purposeful efforts to improve or change in any way the natural course of such a society, even if that change is well-intentioned and kept completely secret.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of plotting a gripping episode on a strange new world, you can kind of see where breaking a non-interference rule would come in handy.  (It also increases the damage for those &lt;a href="http://services.tos.net/text/misc/tos-drink.txt"&gt;drinking along at home&lt;/a&gt;.)  But we viewers hardly ever saw any official repercussions from these Prime Directive violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's where the idea for a new show in the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; franchise comes in.&lt;br&gt;

This is what teachers call a "content area" degree.  In other words, it is not an education degree, but a degree in the actual real world content, in this case, biology (as the name of the degree strongly implies).  This is a fairly impressive thing for a teacher to do, and she did a good job of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, I remember well, that on our very first date we talked about the idea of her getting this degree, and I encouraged her to do it.  (You know about that first date &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/2009/06/quiche-moraine-at-azia-and-the-black-forest/"&gt;if you read this&lt;/a&gt; ... )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure some of her "capstone" research was secret, so I can't tell you much about it, but it has to do with combining body parts of different species to achieve some sort of interesting effect and then make graphs of it.  The ultimate outcome will be to stop aging and cure disease and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to sexuality, two sizes don’t fit all. Nor does one institution. That’s why a nontheistic, humanist approach recognizes sexual diversity, individuality, freedom, and responsibility. And that’s why humanists continue to work for an end to needless guilt and repression and actively call for a broadening of human possibilities and pleasures.

&lt;p&gt;Now, you should &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2009/09/what_would_you_like_to_see_in.php" title=""&gt;go to this post on Page 3.14&lt;/a&gt; and give your feedback. There is a poll there that you can do - it is a little unusual: you vote not by clicking but by dragging items up (which pushes other items down).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the poll does not work for you, or if some of the items you really, really hate (and the poll does not allow you to NOT vote for any item), or if there are other things you'd rather see, please post a comment. They are reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, all of those new things will be optional. We were promised that they will remain optional forever. Thus, if you don't like it, or if you just come to one of our blogs by chance through a Google search or random link, you will see the site as it is now and be able to interact with it as it is now. But for regular readers, frequent commenters and bloggers themselves, this will be a nice new set of ways to interact with each other more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2009/09/what_would_you_like_to_see_in.php" title=""&gt;go to this post on Page 3.14&lt;/a&gt; and have your opinions heard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/what_do_you_want_to_see_implem.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/1id5f9p7blM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252201255031"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/most_excellent_news_from_wyomi.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a8bcb0b4a6b2bc9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Communicating science"/><title type="html">Most excellent news from Wyoming</title><published>2009-09-06T01:55:38Z</published><updated>2009-09-06T01:55:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/uqEmHo8nbdE/most_excellent_news_from_wyomi.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/most_excellent_news_from_wyomi.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I reported a while back that the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/another_museum_in_danger.php"&gt;University of Wyoming geology museum was in danger of extinction&lt;/a&gt;: it has been pulled back from the brink by a &lt;a href="http://trib.com/articles/2009/09/04/news/wyoming/f07c7ab472d2db7b8725762600829639.txt"&gt;generous private donation of over half a million dollars, with matching funds from the state&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;There are even &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/anaglyph/"&gt;3D images &lt;/a&gt; but you will need &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/sun/3D_Glasses.html"&gt;special glasses&lt;/a&gt; to see them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/new_high_res_images_from_mars.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/zrhNkGcQFO4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1252195195206"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=15771">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/caa44deb721d67c9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Worst Security System Ever</title><published>2009-09-05T23:00:07Z</published><updated>2009-09-05T23:00:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/05/worst-security-system-ever/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Columbus Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; reports on what some local residents are doing in the &lt;a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/faith_values/stories/2009/09/04/FV_Circle_of_Prayer.ART_ART_09-04-09_B4_F3EVEQL.html?sid=101"&gt;aftermath of a couple robberies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Many people who encounter sudden, unexpected violence have no idea how to react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Melynda Workman, there was never any question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last September, her husband, Jack, was shot in the stomach during a robbery of the couple’s Dairy Queen on Tamarack Circle South on the North Side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine months later, after her husband had recovered and the business had reopened, Workman found herself staring at the barrel of a gun wielded by one of two masked robbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall, after her husband was shot, two men were killed in separate incidents near Tamarack Circle. Theft and vandalism are common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know how many other countless things have happened in this area, but we want to do something about it,” Mrs. Workman wrote. “It is time to make a stand.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is she going to do?  Hire security guards for local businesses?  Form a neighborhood watch group?  Rally at the police department to get them to patrol the neighborhood more?  Those are ideas that reader &lt;strong&gt;Alycia&lt;/strong&gt; feels would be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know where this is going….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Workmans have joined with the Victorious Life Christian Center Church on Tamarack Circle North to organize a “Circle of Prayer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to circle the circle with enough people to pray over the community,” Mrs. Workman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that with the state of the community right now, the only thing that’s going to change it is prayer,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; *sigh*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure the criminals will run up to join them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, more likely, while the residents are off praying in a circle, the criminals will be taking advantage of their absence and robbing their stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Alycia&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="bearded dragon46" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/bearded-dragon46.jpg?w=505&amp;amp;h=669" alt="bearded dragon46" width="505" height="669"&gt;Fig. 1.  Dr. Stephen Secor, Dept.

&lt;p&gt;Check out my brand new and unique &lt;a href="http://coturnix.org/" title=""&gt;HOMEPAGE&lt;/a&gt;!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had a homepage before. I never made a static web-page in my life. I made blogs. I made many, many blogs. And I always used my main blog (this one since summer of 2006) as my homepage. But now that I am all over the place, on various social networks, while reserving the blog for Most Important Stuff only, it makes sense to have a homepage that links to everywhere I am on the Web. It makes it easy to tell people in person how to find me. It makes it easy to make Moo.com business cards. It removes the need for a dozen links in the signature of my e-mail messages. Everything is at a single one-stop-shop page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The page was designed and built by &lt;a href="http://arikia.com" title=""&gt;Arikia Millikan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://millikandaily.com/" title=""&gt;The Millikan Daily&lt;/a&gt;, the former Overlord here at Scienceblogs.com. I love the clean look of the page - not easy to make it uncluttered for someone like me who is everywhere online. The header font is &lt;a href="http://www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=caveman" title=""&gt;Caveman&lt;/a&gt;. The blog banner was painted by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/banner_art.php" title=""&gt;Carel Pieter Brest Van Kempen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may add a picture of myself to it soon (once I shave and get a haircut and get a nice picture taken), as well as a link to the &lt;a href="http://www.zazzle.com/thinkingrags" title=""&gt;Zazzle store&lt;/a&gt;. And that will, probably, be it. Keep it nice and clean and simple. &lt;/p&gt;
