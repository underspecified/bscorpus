I&amp;#39;m going to be spending most of my day driving, I think, and then talking, and sleeping, and driving back, and then getting a whole two days of relaxation at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have then crazily agreed to appear in a Canadian prime-time documentary by a Christian film company (I must have delusions of being the reincarnation of Daniel) which will be in part filmed at the Creation &amp;quot;Museum&amp;quot;…so a little more travel. This could be interesting.

Imagine the impact of doubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, on Friday the numbers stood at 1 in 160. This morning, the government proclaims, the numbers are actually closer to 1 in 100 children. That’s a spike that’s going to look awfully impressive on some chart in a history book a century (or 160 years) from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/crowd.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of James Cridland (flickr.com)" width="500" height="322"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of James Cridland (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greater awareness, broader definitions and diagnoses in younger children may explain some of the increase, federal health officials said. “The concern here is that buried in these numbers is a true increase,” said Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. “We’re going to have to think very hard about what we’re going to do for the 1 in 100.” I guess he wouldn’t have thought as hard about what to do for 1 out of every 160.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that’s not what he meant. But it is amazing how numbers can inspire. I remember standing with my then-boss Howard in his lower Manhattan office eight years and a month ago, watching the towers smolder and marveling that somebody could still have gotten to that target after the 1993 bombings. “Not enough people died then,” he said simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new estimate would mean about 673,000 American children have autism, though “figuring out” how many children have autism is extremely difficult because diagnosis is based on a child’s behavior, said Dr. Susan E. Levy of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism. “With diabetes you can get a blood test. As of yet, there’s no consistent biologic marker we can use to make the diagnosis of autism.” Well, considering that one function of numbers is to indicate the potential of profit, I have to think this morning’s revised estimates have caught the attention of more drug companies; I’ll bet my next unemployment check that at this moment e-mails are flying through drug companies about how to make money on this new information, how to turn this into some kind of golden spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine. They come up with a pill for autism, and we will be first in line with Alex. I’ll probably even pick some up for most of the bosses I’ve ever had (not Howard) since I’m convinced they were on the spectrum, too. That’s the thing about the spectrum: It’s so large as to be almost valueless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex is on it, that I’m sure. He’s on this morning, and he was on it last week. Except now he has a whole lot more company in the eyes of society, and only time will tell what that really means for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

I have read four of his books (the rest are on my “to read” list), but perhaps more importantly to my personal journey into skepticism, were his writings from SWIFT, the former online weekly newsletter of &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/"&gt;The James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (which has since evolved into a most enjoyable blog with contributions from some of my favorite people in ‘Skepticdom’.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, every Friday, the first website I would open was &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;www.randi.org&lt;/a&gt; so I could lose myself for 15-20 minutes soaking up every drop of biting sarcasm, sharp wit, and grounded sensibility that only Randi could almost effortlessly offer, like a pirate wielding a cutlass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite moments were when Randi would share some or all of a letter or and email he’d receive, in which the content of the message was so utterly indecipherable, that Randi would, with sincerity, not know whether to belly-laugh or show pity or concern. In more cases than not, Randi would simply present the message, unedited and uncommented, so that it could stand on its own merits, thereby allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions. Randi might add just one or two lines of commentary to sum up his feelings, and they would typically include one of the following words: incomprehensible, incoherent, drivel, gobbledygook, claptrap, mind-boggling, babble, flabbergasted … you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as soon as I received this email a few days ago, I could only think of the countless times that I spent reading SWIFT and thinking to myself how appreciative I was that Randi would share such insights into the minds of people who are clearly reality-challenged. It is a fascinating gaze into an aspect of humanity that we might otherwise never get a chance to witness at a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in keeping with the very effective template that James Randi has spent a lifetime perfecting, I present to you this unedited email message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject: star child thingy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message: your anoying me with you pseudo science drivel, as your using it as an excuse to cover up your own lack of facts and sources inter alia as well as their is no such thing as pseudo science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your facts are either right, or they are wrong based on your evidence at hand, and you either choose to believe your souces, or you do not, and if the source is yourself you may coose to weigh that evidence more, then other peoples results. depending on who they were of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and while your logical interpretation is either right or wrong based on the information at hand, i.e. have i missed anything out? its still flawed. as every conclusion based on logic is made from an underlying assumpyion which in turn, couldmost probably be wrong, as you assume the rules are the same, when in fact they might not be at all… and any moment now the walls could come down, as you find yourself in a holodeck again, and that would f**k you right up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as your going generally arguing this happens, so we assume this happens, and in fact it couldbe nothing from the truth, as you just get lucky 99% of the time, and the 1% which “is wrong” is in fact right, and your assumption, and underlying conclusion was flawed as you forgot to take into account the exception to the rule, which in turn is right, and is why your model has to change inter alia of course, as i am talking absolute drivel now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i.e. You argue that it can’t be alien because alien dna would not be compatible wit human dna, and you have no basis to make that asumption… as their is nothing stopping us having alines, which are compatible with humans, if they in turn came first…. (i.e. we were an offshoot of them, discarded or some other such thing, perhaps grown or made (see genisis inter alia notwithstanding its a crap book, and most probably wrong) and well this (waves arms around widly) is oh so fake, why so bother with anything now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;further to which you assume this reality is real, and well i myself am starting to argue it isn’t given my own evidence in life. [your not going to get that evidence in this mail, je suis desole pour ca, mais je besoin plus temps]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i.e. if i were god, how did i exist? i can’t create myself, and likewise how the hell can matter come out of nothing, and if you argue “but it always existed” your still ignoring the concep of the idea, and well how the hell do we get ideas anyway? as its more an external force (at times) then our our mind (unless thatin turn is an illision of self) i.e. surely the concept of existence had to come from somewhere, before you even had it. i.e. saying time doesn’t exist, and we always had matter, ignores the point that it shouldn’t even exist in the first place!!! as something should have come before, which in turn goes back on itself, into paradox as i hold an apple up as an example and go the universe exists. care for a bite? it shouldn’t exist, and yet yet it does… which goes to show the entire thing is impossible and is. so must be taken as proof of parodox, and thus proof that the impossible is indeed possible, and therfore exists … which kinds of screwed everonye over, once you reach that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;either you make the leap or you do not here… as trying to prove thins become a waste of time, in part…though you might like to prove what other people areup to, and forumlate guesses on outcome, based on whats gone before, on the understanding its most probably wrong, and well people can change (perhaps gods?) and wel it might all go in the blink of an eye, and the walls come down again 2012? prophacy perhaps, if i were to make a guess, or is that reading inot things again?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway if the impossible does exist, and i am here as proof it does, it means their can be no rules, as well you can do the impossible and that breaks the rules you see (or perhaps you don’t as you sycnics, tend to cling to the prision of belief as much as religion does inter alia) and well its anoying as hell. much like your argument on pseudo scicence, you close minded elitist swine! may you burn in hell for eternity, for trying to pull that card out again. stick to the facts, and the evdence at hand, show other cases, other skulls, where the evidnce is similer, recreate it, and show how you can fool the tests if you much, just don’t use the term pseudo science again!!!! Please yada, yada ya as i cut the psychic stuff out, as your perhaps not ready for that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oooooooooops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you still reading, and in case you have no idea what the Starchild Project is all about, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/the-starchild-project/"&gt;here is the link to the Starchild Project article that Steven Novella wrote &lt;/a&gt;back in 2006. There has been no further serious research or any legitimate controversies since Steve wrote the article. And no, Lloyd Pye did not write this email to us … I think.&lt;/p&gt;

I was contemplating heading to Boots and buying an armful of lovely drugs and pharmaceuticals, but the helpful advisors of &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ofquack"&gt;@ofquack&lt;/a&gt; showed me a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="http://www.lightparty.com/Health/EbolaCure.html"&gt;it's a homeopathic cure for Ebola&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gail Derin studied the symptoms of Ebola Zaire, the most deadly of the three that can infect human beings. Dr. Vickie Menear, M.D. and homeopath, found that the remedy that most closely fit the symptoms of the 1914 "flu" virus, Crolatus horridus, also fits the Ebola virus nearly 95% symptom-wise! Thanks go to these doctors for coming up with the following remedies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Crolatus horridus (rattlesnake venom) 2. Bothrops (yellow viper) 3. Lachesis (bushmaster snake) 4. Phosphorus 5. Merc. cor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not in the U.S., you must locate your closest homeopathic practitioner and ask him or her to order these remedies for you from Hahnemann Pharmacy, (510) 327-3003 (Albany, California, a suburb of Oakland). If your country's laws allow you to call a homeopathic pharmacy directly, do so. In any case be sure to find a homeopathic practitioner you can work with. Do not try to take care of yourself without the further education and experience that a homeopath can give you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure where to find your closest homeopath, call the National Center of Homeopathy, (703) 548-7790, Take this article with you and let a homeopath read it and instruct you on how to use the remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there's a lot of stuff contained in the above nugget of stupidity that I could pick up on, so let me just pick up on two points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola"&gt;Ebola can cause death&lt;/a&gt; (from systemic multi-organ failure) in as little as two days. That gives me enough time to attend the TAM fringe tonight, but finding my nearest homeopath, getting them to place an order for the remedy with a clinic in San Francisco, having the remedy shipped here and then getting treated in two days is a feat beyond the capabilities of even Jack Bauer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be dead by the time it arrives, and they can bury me, clutching the vial, as mourners mutter "if only DHL got their act together."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point that amused me was the assertion that: "the remedy that most closely fit the symptoms of the 1914 "flu" virus, Crolatus horridus, also fits the Ebola virus nearly 95% symptom-wise!" So in other words, this quack believes that Spanish Flu and Ebola are 95% the same symptom wise. Let's just &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4946718"&gt;check this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flu Symptoms:&lt;/b&gt; Fever, nausea, aches,  diarrhea, pneumonia, dark spots on cheeks, bleeding in lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ebola Symptoms:&lt;/b&gt; Fever, nausea, aches, diarrhea, severe headache, abdominal pain, severe weakness, exhaustion, sore throat, dizziness, internal and external bleeding, joint pain, dark or bloody faeces, vomiting blood, bleeding eyes, petechia (broken capillaries), maculopapular rash, purple discolorations of skin, low blood presure, tachycardia, hypovolemia (low blood volume), disruption of clotting, altered white blood cell count, bleeding from incompletely-healed injuries, external haemorrhae from orifices including nose and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, remarkably similar symptoms really, apart from the heart problems, massive internal bleeding, haemorrhages from every orifice and wotnot. Oh, and the fact that the two diseases are caused by completely different viruses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;To have Blackburn and Grieder win the prize is an incredible accomplishment for any scientist, but one that I think will pay huge dividends in helping our young women (and the mini-women that some of us Dads have) in appreciating that they too can be a world-class scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

There is one little problem, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible is suffused with liberal bias. A lot of the Old Testament isn't bad, but the New Testament, when Jesus makes the scene, suddenly takes a turn into commie-land, with it's talk of helping the poor and camels and needles and  so forth. Jesus was &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt; misquoted all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what to do? When your claim of godly authority rests on your interpretation of God&amp;#39;s holy word, but God&amp;#39;s holy words contradict your desired ends, you&amp;#39;re in a bit of a pickle. There is a solution, though: rewrite the Bible and change the liberal bits! For this reason some of the deranged editors at Conservapædia have launched &lt;a href="http://conservapedia.com/Conservative_Bible_Project"&gt;The Conservative Bible Project&lt;/a&gt;, which will purge the wimpy stuff and return it to it's authentic roots, as a book that could have been written by a dumb-as-a-stick American Republican NRA member who wants to kill communists and A-rabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not joking. They cite as reasons for a rewrite the fact that the Bible uses the term "comrade" &lt;i&gt;three times&lt;/i&gt;, and acknowledges the existence of laborers &lt;i&gt;thirteen times&lt;/i&gt;. It's practically a Marxist/Leninist tract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They conveniently give an example of the kind of thing that needs to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest, most authentic manuscripts lack this verse set forth at Luke 23:34:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this a liberal corruption of the original? This does not appear in any other Gospel, and the simple fact is that some of the persecutors of Jesus did know what they were doing. This quotation is a favorite of liberals but should not appear in a conservative Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all know, after all, Jesus really wasn't into that "forgiveness" thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be some little problems with commenting on this article (besides the usual boneheaded glitches in the Sb commenting system). A while back, we had some serious problems with spamming by the Conservapædia cretins, and I had to put the word &amp;quot;conservapedia&amp;quot; into the filter file. You can&amp;#39;t use that word or your comment will get blocked! That means you won&amp;#39;t be able to link directly to Conservapædia, and that you&amp;#39;ll need to use the Pharyngula-approved spelling of their name, which includes that foreign, European ligature — just type Conservap&amp;amp;aelig;dia. It also infuriates them, making the little work-around well worth doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/conservapdia_has_a_new_project.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/qt4tq0QhGYg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254752326685"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=5457">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/889d443f3ec0e79c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><category term="Andromeda galaxy"/><category term="Swift"/><category term="ultraviolet"/><title type="html">A Swift view of Andromeda</title><published>2009-10-05T13:59:57Z</published><updated>2009-10-05T13:59:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/05/a-swift-view-of-andromeda/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;NASA’s Swift satellite is a modern success story: designed to peer at the Universe in ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays, it is on constant lookout for gamma-ray bursts, explosions so vast they are second only to the Big Bang itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift scans the skies, constantly observing, always on its toes for that fleeting blast of high-energy light. But it also does other science as well; an orbiting camera like that has many uses. For three months in 2008, astronomers used Swift to target the nearest major spiral galaxy like our own: M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/uv_andromeda.html"&gt;And what they got was this gorgeous picture&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/386913main_Swift_M31_large_UV.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/Swift_uv_m31.jpg" alt="Swift_uv_m31" title="Swift_uv_m31" width="610" height="268"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. You &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; want to click that to embiggen it most cromulently — you’ll get a whopping 4400 x 200 pixel version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is incredible, both scientifically and logistically. It is the combination of 330 images, totaling 24 hours of solid observations, and amounted to a hefty 85 gigabytes of data. It covers three UV wavelengths: 192.8, 224.6, and 260 nanometers, which are just outside the range the human eye can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image is huge; the full Moon would just fit over the apparent size of the central bulge of the galaxy. Over 20,000 individual sources of ultraviolet light can be found.  Some science can be seen just with just a glance: for example, the light coming from the spiral arms is clumpy, and from the bulge it’s smooth. The arms are where you find patches of giant gas clouds forming newly born stars; the most massive of these blast out UV light and fierce winds which make the clouds themselves glow in UV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the bulge at the core is smooth, because stars there are old; star formation long ago ceased in the galactic center. The UV glow is mostly from tightly packed stars, not from gas. There are so many stars that the individual sources blend together into what looks like a continuous glow (not unlike a digital image itself, where individual pixels blend together to make what looks like a smooth picture). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is the most detailed ever taken of our big neighbor in the ultraviolet, and I have no doubt it will be used as an atlas for higher-resolution cameras aboard Hubble and future spacecraft. Pictures like this are scientifically incredibly useful; they are roadmaps we can use to plan out our travels ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they are also just very, very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

She was mummified and buried at the necropolis at Thebes, where she remained for over two millennia before being unearthed in 1819. Her well-preserved body was brought to the British Museum where it was examined by the physician and obstetrician Augustus Bozzi Granville. It was the first ever medical autopsy of an Egyptian mummy and Granville presented his results to the Royal Society in 1825. His conclusion: Ityersenu died of ovarian cancer.

The mummification techniques of ancient Egypt were so good that Irtyersenu's corpse still retained many soft tissues, and most of her organs intact. In particular, an unusual mass around her right ovary caught Granville's attention. He interpreted it as a cancer and the cause of the lady's death. But according to later studies, the tumour was a benign one, far from the fatal affliction that Granville envisaged.

Some scientists have since blamed malaria for Irtyersenu's death but Helen Donoghue from University College London believes she has uncovered the true culprit - tuberculosis.

It's clear that tuberculosis was a big killer of ancient Egyptians. Scientists have found DNA from Mycoplasma tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes the disease, in several mummies from both genders and all social circles. Donoghue managed to do the same for samples of Ityersenu's lung, gall bladder and other tissues.

Evolution is always moving forward. From molecules to cells to invertebrates to vertebrates; from fish to reptiles to mammals to us. There’s a lot wrong with those ideas, but the underlying question is worth asking: Can organisms go back the way they came?Louis Dollo thought not. He suggested that once a feature was lost in a lineage, it could never be regained. Enough people agreed with this suggestion that it became known as “Dollo’s Law.” A couple of recent papers address whether Dollo’s suggestion was a correct one.The first paper, by Lynch and Wagner, tests Dollo’s Law at the organismal level. It follows previous suggestions that reptiles have flip-flopping between egg-bearing and live birth. These were only suggestive, because scenarios with no reversals were just about as likely as those without.The boa family Boidae may provide a strong test of whether evolutionary zig-zagging occurred with egg-bearing. Boas generally give birth to live young, but two do not.It is possible that these egg-layers were the earliest species to branch off from the rest of the family, which then evolved live-birth, but if so, there should be a raft of other features marking them as very divergent from all other boas.As is typical now, most of the features examined are DNA. Much of this paper details relationships between many genera of boas, with the specific question about egg-laying being a rather small cookie in what is obviously a much bigger systematic meal. Disappointingly, one of the two-egg-laying boas, Eyrx muelleri (pictured), is not included in this analysis.The genus Eryx is not an early branch within the boa family, however. The one egg-laying species examined here, Eryx jayakari, is nestled firmly in the middle of the boa family tree, which strongly indicates that its ancestors were live-bearing boas.Showing that reversals happened does not answer why or how they happened. Lynch and Wagner do discuss some of the selective pressures that may have led to these particular species re-evolving egg-laying. Both live in desert environments, which could be a key factor in what led to the loss of live birth.A major question for understanding reversals is just how similar the re-evolved feature is to the original. To qualify as a true reversal, the similarities would have to be very extensive and detailed. Otherwise, this may not be a case of reversal, but of convergence instead. The authors note that other snakes have a small tooth to push through the eggs when hatching, but hatchlings in these two boa species do not, indicating that the boas have not wound the clock back entirely or exactly.Understanding whether this is reversal rather than convergence will probably require doing detailed anatomy of the reproductive organs of a lot of snakes. DNA is great for understanding the relationships between species, but it will probably only be by looking closely at the actual organisms that we will be able to understand the chain of events that might lead groups back the way they came.A second paper, by Bridgham and collegues, argues that at the level of molecules, Dollo may have been on the money. They ran models of the evolution of a molecular that binds to the hormone cortisol. According to their model, the cortisol receptor was derived from receptors that bound to a much wider range of molecules. The new receptor, then, is a specialization of generalists.When they took the modern receptor, and experimentally changed several key mutations back to the predicted ancestral state, they got a molecule that bound to... nothing. Bridgham and company’s explanation is that in addition to the key mutations that made the modern receptor possible, there were other changes in the rest of the molecule that. These “background” changes were not obviously related to the molecule’s ability to bind to the hormone, but, in the context of a long, complex molecule where the parts interact to give the receptor it shape, those changes were enough to prevent the experimentally modified receptor to bind to hormones.Interestingly, the authors stress that these background changes make it unlikely for the molecule to revert back to its ancestral condition... but then they proceed to do it (their Figure 3a). Sure, the chain of events needed to revert the molecule back is longer and less probable. The ratchet they propose for molecular evolution may be a slightly slippery one.In a sense, both papers show that the argument about evolutionary reversal is not whether it is possible or impossible. The question is not whether reversals happen, but how often they happen. Reversals could be rare. And the frequency of reversal may differ depending on what level of organization you’re looking at. It could be easier in whole organisms than in molecules, or vice versa.This post is part of National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCENT) competition for the Science Online 2010 conference.ReferencesBridgham, J., Ortlund, E., &amp;amp; Thornton, J.

The scheme, originally thought to depict an evolutionary sequence, has two major groups: spiral galaxies with a small central bulge, spiral arms and possibly a central bar, and elliptical galaxies that are more spherical in structure with no spiral arms or disk. There are however, many galaxies which do not fit into this scheme, being neither spherical or disk-like, and these are usually lumped together into a class called the irregulars. These disturbed galaxies are surprisingly common, and many are the result of collisions or close encounters between galaxies. Such interactions happened frequently throughout the history of the universe, but it is also going on right now in our own galactic neighbourhood.The nearest major galaxy to our own is the Andromeda Galaxy, otherwise known as M31, slightly larger than the Milky Way and located 2.5 million light years away. It is heading towards the Milky Way at some 300 km/s and, in a few billion years, the two galaxies will eventually collide. In some cosmological models, galaxies grow over time by disrupting and absorbing smaller galaxies in such collisions. In such violent processes, a significant number of stars should be tossed out of the galaxies involved, forming a diffuse halo which can provide clues to the merger history of a galaxy, if they are bright enough to be detected. In research reported in the journal Nature on the 3rd of September, a team of astronomers led by Alan McConnachie at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Canada, report a panoramic survey of Andromeda and its nearby neighbour, the Triangulum galaxy, M33, which shows clear evidence of the remnants of galactic mergers.Detecting this evidence is difficult as these stellar populations are extremely faint and distributed over a huge area, so the astronomers are using the MegaCam camera on the 3.6-metre Canada-France-Hawaii telescope to build up a sensitive wide-field survey of the Andromeda galaxy and it's companions. The so-called Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey will cover more than 300 square degrees when completed in 2011, but has already produced results showing the vast extent of M31's stellar halo, covering an area of nearly 100 times the classical optical disk of the galaxy.These early results from the survey lend support to the idea that large galaxies build up through the accretion of smaller galaxies. The halo stars discovered away from the disk of M31 are unlikely to have been formed at their present positions because there is not enough gas there for star formation to occur. The most likely explanation is that they have been thrown out in a tidal interaction. Another piece of evidence that they are relics from previous galactic mergers is that the stars in this faint population are often located in huge arcs, loops and other diffuse structures which are characteristic of the gravitational disruption of dwarf galaxies undergoing a merger with a larger galaxy.As well as lending support to the hierarchical model of galaxy formation, the team's results also show a new diffuse stellar structure around M33, M31's largest companion galaxy. This newly discovered feature matches up with a distortion in the disk of M33, as well as a mild warp seen in the outer disk of M31, adding to the evidence of a past tidal interaction between the two galaxies....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The heat from the impact and subsequent accretion of material created a magma ocean which would have caused the loss of most of the volatile materials from the surface, so-called because they have low boiling points and evaporate easily. In a press conference at NASA on Thursday 24th September, results were announced from three separate spacecraft showing evidence of water on the lunar surface in far greater quantities than has previously been seen. Two of these spacecraft, Cassini and Deep Impact, observed the Moon as they passed by on their way to other parts of the solar system while the third, India Space Research Organisation's Chandrayaan-1, observed the lunar surface from orbit around the Moon.What each of these probes detected was an absorption feature in the infra-red part of the spectrum at a wavelength of about 3 microns, a wavelength characteristic of absorption by hydroxyl - a hydrogen atom joined together with an oxygen atom. Add another hydrogen to hydroxyl and you produce H20, water, which also absorbs infra-red light near 3-microns. It has been known since the observations of the Lunar Prospector spacecraft in the late 1990s that there is an estimated 10 to 300 million metric tones of water ice buried in permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles. These new results however, show that the hydroxyl and water signature is in fact present over large parts of the lunar surface, not just at the poles.Launched on October 22nd 2008, India's Chandrayaan-1 carried several scientific instruments on board. One of these was the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, or M3, built by NASA, a spectrograph operating in the infra-red part of the spectrum. Although Chandrayaan-1 sadly ceased operations last month, it had already returned many months of usable data from the instruments on board. When the data from the M3 experiment was analysed, researchers found absorption features consistent with patterns expected for water and hydroxyl over most of the lunar surface. Although M3 only probed the top few millimetres of the lunar regolith, they found a strong hydroxyl signature across the surface, stronger towards the lunar poles at higher latitudes, and varying throughout the lunar cycle, suggesting that the Sun has some effect on the distribution.According to the scientists, the most likely origin for this water is a reaction between protons in the solar wind and oxygen atoms already present in the lunar dirt. The M3 results were subsequently confirmed by observations by the Deep Impact spacecraft which also has instruments that observe in the infra-red and regularly uses observations of the Moon for calibration purposes, and also in old data from the Cassini spacecraft which observed the Moon during a flyby in 1999. The data show that there may be as much as 0.1 to 1 per cent water by weight in the regolith, in contrast to the rocks brought back by the Apollo missions which were incredibly dry. This is roughly equivalent to a litre of water per cubic metre of regolith but, since it is only present in the top few millimetres of soil, extracting usable amounts of water would require processing a very large surface area.The results from the three spacecraft were announced together to coincide with the publication of three papers in the journal Science on September 24th, and come just two weeks before another spacecraft, NASA's LCROSS, the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, is due to crash into the Moon's surface near the south pole in an attempt to kick up water ice buried in the regolith in craters which rarely see sunlight....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Most of these techniques are indirect because planets are much fainter than the stars they orbit, and so are very hard to detect directly. Because their effects are easier to spot, larger planets are easier to find, but smaller and smaller planets are being discovered as techniques and technology improve. One of the smallest exoplanets known to date is CoRoT-7b, a planet discovered by the CoRoT satellite in February 2009, orbiting an otherwise unremarkable 11th magnitude star catalogued as TYC 4799-1733-1, located almost 500 light years away in the constellation of Monoceros. Most of the known exoplanets are thought to be larger versions of Jupiter, likely to be large gas giants, but new observations of CoRoT-7b suggest that it is far more like our own Earth.A team of astronomers, led by Didier Queloz at the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland, used the HARPS instrument on ESO's 3.6-metre telescope at the La Silla observatory in Chile, to observe the CoRoT-7 system and try and determine the mass of CoRoT-7b. HARPS, or the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher, is a high resolution spectrograph which enables astronomers to measure the tiny changes in velocity of a star as it is gently tugged by the gravitational pull of it's orbiting planets. These velocity shifts are extremely small, so very accurate spectrographs are needed to see the effects.In the case of CoRoT-7b, the planet is so close to its parent star that it completes one orbit every 20.4 hours, blocking out a tiny fraction of the stars' light for just one hour during each orbit. Because the planet is so small, the team had to obtain more than 70 hours of observations to see the tiny changes in the stars' spectrum that would tell them about the planet. What the team found was that CoRoT-7b is one of the lightest exoplanets known, with a mass of just 4.8 times that of the Earth, putting it in the category of so-called "super-Earths". Since the planet directly transits the star, passing directly between the star and us, astronomers have already been able to determine that the planet's radius is less than twice that of Earth. If you know both the mass and the radius of a planet, you can calculate its density. The team did this and found that CoRoT-7b has a density of 5.5 grams per cubic centimetre, very similar to the density of the Earth. This suggests that CoRoT-7b is a rocky planet, not a gas giant like Jupiter, and is likely to be composed mainly of silicates with a small iron core, the first time such a determination has been made for such a small exoplanet.As well as determining the mass and density of CoRoT-7b, the team also discovered a new planet, CoRoT-7c, which is slightly larger with a mass of 8.4 times that of Earth. Unfortunately, this planet does not directly transit the star, so its radius, and hence density, cannot be determined. The research will be published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on October 22nd....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

None of you saner people (non-protistgeeks) seem to have taken advantage of the massive handicap, and subsequent hint. Seriously, type in &amp;quot;testate amoebae&amp;quot; in Google image search, and it&amp;#39;s on the first page! Perhaps I should do a tutorial on some methods of attacking those mystery images...Quite shockingly(not!), Opisthokont got the last one. I agree with his statement that that was like shooting fish in a barrel, but easier since fish are actually difficult to shoot at from air due to refraction, etc. The organism behind the shell in the mystery micrograph was...Euglypha!(Wikipedia; Euglyphid test)Euglypha morphologically belongs to the polyphyletic &amp;#39;testate amoebae&amp;#39;, but is phylogenetically quite distant from your garden variety test-building amoebozoans, like Arcella and Difflugia. Euglyphids are cercozoan rhizarians. Since those words likely mean nothing to the vast majority of the human population, here&amp;#39;s a &amp;#39;map&amp;#39; of Rhizaria in my Coelodiceras (Phaeodaria) post, and an overall tree of eukaryotes can be found here. They can often be found in moss samples, but are also present in soil and freshwater environments. Their test scales are made of silica, and preserve quite decently as fossils. Speaking of which, I apparently may have a slight fetish for unicellular microfossils:(Javaux 2007 in Eukaryotic Membranes and Cytoskeleton: Origins and Evolution ed. Jékely; 10 - fossil; 11 - modern Euglyphid; 12 - VSM - &amp;#39;vase-shaped microfossil&amp;#39; (micropaleontological equivalent of mycologists&amp;#39; LBM - &amp;#39;little brown mushroom&amp;#39; ?) with holes possibly caused by predation; fossils ~750My old)Fast forward 750My back to the present, the modern euglyphids are about as diverse as they are understudied:(Lara et al. 2007 Protist; tree of Euglyphids)Images of Euglyphid diversity, shamelessly stolen from the same paper:(Lara et al. 2007 Protist; Euglyphid SEMs, scalebar 50um except for E,F,H, where it&amp;#39;s 10um. A - Assulina; B- Placocista; C,D - Euglypha ciliata &amp;amp; compressa; E - Corythion; F - Trinema; H,G - Euglypha penardi)Unfortunately, finding nice plates full of euglyphids is rather difficult, since until quite recently, they were lumped together with testate Amoebozoans. Also, since euglyphids fossilise, they seem to be mostly studied by paleontologists, who seem to have an &amp;#39;interesting&amp;#39; relationship with systematics of the living. Where &amp;#39;interesting&amp;#39; entails being at least a couple decades out of date. Well, they are millions of years in the past...Paulinella can be argued to be particularly interesting - it is a case of an independent event of primary plastid endosymbiosis. Why this is interesting can be seen in this really nice overview:(Keeling 2oo4 Am J Bot (free access); overview of plastid endosymbiosis - the &amp;#39;Pacmen&amp;#39; are pretty awesome! Interestingly, if the Chromalveolate Hypothesis is correct, this would mean that Paulinella already had a plastid in its ancient past. However, it would&amp;#39;ve been a red algal plastid of a different cyanobacterial origin, not a Synechococcus-derived cyanelle)Cyanelles are photosynthetic endosymbionts/organelles - they differ from plastids by retaining some prokaryotic features like the peptidoglycan wall. Among the conventional plastid-bearing algae, glaucophytes carry cyanelles from the primary cyanobacterial endosymbiotic event which eventually led to plant chloroplasts and most algal plastids. In sequence comparisons, Paulinella cyanelles  branch with the cyanobacterium Synechococcus, and retain much of the gene order, suggesting a fairly recent endosymbiosis with Synechococcus (...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Donors Choose provides a way to make direct contributions to classrooms and we’ll be asking for your help throughout October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation’s schools are hurting and teachers often  cannot afford to purchase the equipment and supplies they need. Your tax deductible gift matters tremendously during these difficult economic times. Donations support primary and secondary school projects that are described in detail on &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=24484"&gt;our page&lt;/a&gt;, so you get to decide how your money will be used.  We love this charity because Donor’s Choose promotes scientific literacy with clear and meaningful results.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you contribute to Donors Choose, students send personal handwritten thank you notes so you can find out exactly who has benefited from the gift. Support our schools, our children, our future.&lt;/p&gt;

I was contemplating heading to Boots and buying an armful of lovely drugs and pharmaceuticals, but the helpful advisors of &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ofquack"&gt;@ofquack&lt;/a&gt; showed me a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="http://www.lightparty.com/Health/EbolaCure.html"&gt;it's a homeopathic cure for Ebola&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gail Derin studied the symptoms of Ebola Zaire, the most deadly of the three that can infect human beings. Dr. Vickie Menear, M.D. and homeopath, found that the remedy that most closely fit the symptoms of the 1914 "flu" virus, Crolatus horridus, also fits the Ebola virus nearly 95% symptom-wise! Thanks go to these doctors for coming up with the following remedies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Crolatus horridus (rattlesnake venom) 2. Bothrops (yellow viper) 3. Lachesis (bushmaster snake) 4. Phosphorus 5. Merc. cor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not in the U.S., you must locate your closest homeopathic practitioner and ask him or her to order these remedies for you from Hahnemann Pharmacy, (510) 327-3003 (Albany, California, a suburb of Oakland). If your country's laws allow you to call a homeopathic pharmacy directly, do so. In any case be sure to find a homeopathic practitioner you can work with. Do not try to take care of yourself without the further education and experience that a homeopath can give you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure where to find your closest homeopath, call the National Center of Homeopathy, (703) 548-7790, Take this article with you and let a homeopath read it and instruct you on how to use the remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there's a lot of stuff contained in the above nugget of stupidity that I could pick up on, so let me just pick up on two points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola"&gt;Ebola can cause death&lt;/a&gt; (from systemic multi-organ failure) in as little as two days. That gives me enough time to attend the TAM fringe tonight, but finding my nearest homeopath, getting them to place an order for the remedy with a clinic in San Francisco, having the remedy shipped here and then getting treated in two days is a feat beyond the capabilities of even Jack Bauer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be dead by the time it arrives, and they can bury me, clutching the vial, as mourners mutter "if only DHL got their act together."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point that amused me was the assertion that: "the remedy that most closely fit the symptoms of the 1914 "flu" virus, Crolatus horridus, also fits the Ebola virus nearly 95% symptom-wise!" So in other words, this quack believes that Spanish Flu and Ebola are 95% the same symptom wise. Let's just &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4946718"&gt;check this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flu Symptoms:&lt;/b&gt; Fever, nausea, aches,  diarrhea, pneumonia, dark spots on cheeks, bleeding in lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ebola Symptoms:&lt;/b&gt; Fever, nausea, aches, diarrhea, severe headache, abdominal pain, severe weakness, exhaustion, sore throat, dizziness, internal and external bleeding, joint pain, dark or bloody faeces, vomiting blood, bleeding eyes, petechia (broken capillaries), maculopapular rash, purple discolorations of skin, low blood presure, tachycardia, hypovolemia (low blood volume), disruption of clotting, altered white blood cell count, bleeding from incompletely-healed injuries, external haemorrhae from orifices including nose and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, remarkably similar symptoms really, apart from the heart problems, massive internal bleeding, haemorrhages from every orifice and wotnot. Oh, and the fact that the two diseases are caused by completely different viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea where Dr. Vickie Menear got her doctorate from, but the above article is probably the stupidest thing I've read on the internet today. And that's an achievement. Anyway, I'm off to the pharmacy for some proper drugs. See you tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes, remarkably similar symptoms really, apart from the heart problems, massive internal bleeding, haemorrhages from every orifice and wotnot. Oh, and the fact that the two diseases are caused by completely different viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea where Dr. Vickie Menear got her doctorate from, but the above article is probably the stupidest thing I've read on the internet today. And that's an achievement. Anyway, I'm off to the pharmacy for some proper drugs. See you tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention the variety show on Saturday night. It was headlined by comedian &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Ince"&gt;Robin Ince&lt;/a&gt; (you may have seen his MAGIC MAN DUNNIT clip) and offered a lot of funny and musical and skeptical and cynical acts of high standard. I was particularly impressed by high-brow rapper &lt;a href="http://www.babasword.com/"&gt;Baba Brinkman&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is he witty and knowledgeable, he also made me feel that hmm, rapping really can involve a lot of technical mastery. When I told him I like him not rapping about bitches and bling, he replied, "But I do, in other bits of my Darwin rhymes. I say that bling is peacock feathers evolved by sexual selection."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday began with an ace performance by the talented and friendly George Hrab. Then we had an incisive talk by Glenn Hill who is the son of Elsie Wright, the woman who at 16 painted and photographed the 1916 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottingley_fairies"&gt;Cottingley Fairies&lt;/a&gt; and inadvertently helped Arthur Conan Doyle make himself look silly. Hill spoke about that, but more about this recent anti-religion book &lt;i&gt;Religion Explained in an Hour&lt;/i&gt; where he argues among other things that the founders of all the Abrahamitic religions were psychotics, and that it's no wonder that they're all so intolerant. I would add that Abraham was probably not only psychotic, but also a fictional character, and a really strange choice for an ideal mythical ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Savage spoke entertainingly about &lt;em&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/em&gt;, Tim Minchin the awesome singer &amp;amp; piano-player performed excellent songs and the &amp;quot;Storm&amp;quot; poem, and Phil Plait talked about asteroid and comet impacts with reference to &lt;i&gt;Armageddon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/i&gt;. And a great time was had by all. I then spent the evening in excellent company: VoF forum regular Anders, &lt;em&gt;Aard&lt;/em&gt; regular Jon Jarrett of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://tenthmedieval.wordpress.com/"&gt;A Corner of Tenth-Century Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, T'anta Wawa of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://karaspita.wordpress.com/"&gt;T'anta Wawa Talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (above) and later Bendik &amp;amp; Marit of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hugsandscience.com/"&gt;Hugs &amp;amp; Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and a whole bunch of other Norwegian skeptics. In fact, Norwegians were the biggest non-UK element at TAM London. I promised them that when the Oslo skeptics put on a conference, then at least 200 Swedes will attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org/"&gt;The Amazing Meeting London 1&lt;/a&gt; was a top-quality event. The only way it could have been even better is if they&amp;#39;d included a few more interactive bits, workshops &amp;amp; stuff. But my hat&amp;#39;s off to the organisers! Many thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

His post resulted in a hot debate in the comments section – a discussion I thought deserved a longer response than I could cram into a comment, so I am responding here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found most interesting reading through the comments was that most people had legitimate points to make, even when they disagreed. In my opinion this is because we are dealing with a situation in which there are cross purposes or competing, although legitimate, interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Specifically, Brian was making the point that as a movement with common goals (promoting science education, counteracting misinformation from ideologues and charlatans, for example) it is in our best interest to be constructive and discrete in our internal criticism, rather than showboating for apparent attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, science and intellectual honesty are among our core values, and these require transparent and open criticism. Open self-criticism strengthens the movement, it does not weaken it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself simultaneously agreeing with both points of view, not because I am wishy-washy and don’t like taking firm positions (I hope my reputation has established that much) but because both points of view are valid. It seems the only option is to seek a thoughtful and nuanced compromise – which is difficult to do, and harder to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herding Cats&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no wonder that Michael Shermer has characterized organizing skeptics as akin to “herding cats.” We as a group are like Groucho Marx &lt;a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/g/groucho_marx.html"&gt;who quipped &lt;/a&gt;that he would not join any group that would have him as a member. The skeptical movement, as we loosely call it, is made of people who generally don’t like belonging to groups or being tagged with labels, and certainly don’t like being told what to think, say, or write. We are rugged individualists of intellectualism, and proud of it. (In fact, some skeptics have even objected to calling what we do a “movement” or who bristle at any suggestion of organization.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I sometimes get a bit nervous when I find myself in the majority of public opinion on any issue (not scientific or expert consensus, but mass opinion). This makes me wonder if I am adequately informed and have thought through my opinions, or just absorbed them from the culture. I’m not saying the public is always wrong, but rather admitting the tendency to take pride in having a minority opinion that was earned through careful study and consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anyone bothers to accuse me of it – yes, this is intellectual elitism, but in a good way – valuing intellect and hard work. This is no different than valuing athletic or artistic achievements earned through skill and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of this is to paint the context of the debate prompted by Brian’s post – skeptics value their intellectual independence. We also recognize that constructive criticism is vital to science and any open intellectual pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Together Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time we are not just sitting around in our virtual drawing rooms contemplating abstract concepts. We are trying to change the world, to make it a better place, to raise the level of scientific understanding and appreciation among the public, and to counter anti-scientific agendas from ideologues and the purveyors of pseudoscience. We are trying to do stuff, together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion this makes us colleagues. Obviously this is a continuum, and not everyone who reads a skeptical blog is engaged in the skeptical movement. But, if you have a skeptical blog, a podcast, run local meetings, post you-tube videos, or whatever – to some extent, you are a colleague in the skeptical movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it is appropriate for colleagues to extend to each other a certain amount of courtesy. It is certainly not “required” (whatever that could mean in this context) but does reflect a certain amount of savvy and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will tell you specifically how I typically extend courtesy to my skeptical colleagues. When the Bill Maher-AAI controversy reared its ugly head, I did not immediately fire off a scathing criticism of the AAI (who I actually consider a tangential colleague, as they are an atheist and not strictly skeptical group, but in any case). I had a discussion with some other colleagues about how to respond. And prior to any public response we wrote to Richard Dawkins and the AAI to get their side of the story and give them a chance to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then publicly come out against the AAI for giving Maher a “science” award only after they had a chance to respond to our privately expressed concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule I will always try to give constructive feedback to my fellow skeptics before going public with criticism. Venue also plays a role – if we are having a public conversation (on a forum, in blog comments) I won’t censor the dynamic back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of courtesy is to give each other a little benefit of the doubt. I won’t immediately assume the worst about a colleague simply because they get something wrong and start accusing them of not being skeptical. I admit, I find those accusations the most counterproductive. I will simply assume that they are reasonable and open, and present them with evidence or arguments of which they might not be aware. I treat them as I would want to be treated – not publicly swat them down the moment they step over some imaginary line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have extended this courtesy  to me also – and it can be public, as long as it’s polite and not an attack. I frequently make factual errors in my blog, and have had colleagues point out these errors in the comments section – to which I respond – thanks, I have made the appropriate fixes. It’s all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I would have been pissed if they instead wrote an attacking blog accusing me of deliberately omitting information in order to promote my ideology, or of generally being a bad skeptic. That has happened to me also, but not by anyone I respect. That is what the jerks over at the Discovery Institute or Age of Autism do – not us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further I try to have the humility to consider that maybe I am wrong. And so my initial contact with my skeptical colleague is more to ask questions and gather information, to discuss the question with them to see what is correct, not just assume I am right and they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also not pretending to be perfect in this regard. I am sure I stepped on some toes over the years – I produce so much unscripted content that it’s bound to happen. But these are the ideals of courtesy I strive for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the commenters to Brian’s blog pointed out that they don’t feel like colleagues – like those of us who are more prominent in the skeptical movement are inaccessible. I can understand why someone might assume this perspective. It is a natural default perspective to take. I certainly don’t feel as if I can shoot off an e-mail to Bill Maher and expect that he will read it and respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I will say that the skeptical movement is small and intimate as movements go. I know we all try to be as accessible as possible. I read every e-mail I get and make a priority of responding to polite constructive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So partly my answer is – you are a colleague if you act and behave like one, and we are likely to treat you accordingly. Yes, I am overloaded with e-mails and comments to monitor, so don’t take it personally if I don’t immediately respond to an e-mail. Have some patience. But generally the skeptics I know are engaged in activist skepticism because they like communicating, and they genuinely want to be open and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But on the other hand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while we are being polite to each other, we should also be uncompromising when it comes to factual accuracy. No one is suggesting otherwise, and Brian was explicit on this point. Open discussion, even conflict and disagreement, is a good thing. It is part of science and skepticism, and it makes our movement intellectually healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think it is OK to show this to the public, and perhaps I differ a bit from Brian here. I don’t think a united front is as important as a collegial front. It might even be to our advantage to show that we happily and openly disagree and correct each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, I think colleagues should not attack each other in public without fair warning.  There may be a fuzzy line there, but one worth contemplating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complex issue and I welcome the discussion that Brian’s post has prompted. It reflects the mixed feedback I have received over the years. To summarize what I think are the main points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Scientific skeptics are an intellectually diverse group. This diversity is welcome and a sign of the intellectual health and openness of skepticism as a philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Generally we welcome open self-criticism in the spirit of scientific methodology, honesty, transparency, and valuing truth over conformity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Individual skeptics have a variety of relationships and attitudes toward organized skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Like it or not, there is a skeptical movement. Humans are political and social animals and we instinctively organize ourselves as a way to pursue common goals and promote (or at least defend) a common world view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- If you want to function as a member of the skeptical movement, your colleagues will likely expect a certain amount of common courtesy (just like in any social construct).  This means exercising some maturity and humility and keeping criticism constructive. It does not mean censoring legitimate criticism or alternate or even minority viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

It is one of the scientific mysteries of our generation, and it’s a fascinating story that is unfolding before our eyes with each new discovery. It’s just a good science story. A recent observation has just added to the drama, perhaps calling into question dark matter’s existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark matter  is a helpful example of how the scientific process sometimes works. Scientists first proposed the notion of dark matter to explain anomalies in the rotation of galaxies – they rotate faster than they should, indicating that they have more mass than is visible. It’s as if they have lots of matter that is not visible – dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark matter became a working hypothesis to explain our observations about the universe, especially how galaxies move. But all scientific theories, in order to be of any value, must not only have explanatory power, they also need predictive power – they must make predictions that allow the theory to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One piece of evidence that is thought to be confirmation of dark matter is the&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1720848.htm"&gt; bullet cluster&lt;/a&gt;. This is an area of space where two galaxy clusters are colliding. Astronomers can see that the gas clouds slowed down as they crashed into each other. But the stars mostly passed right by each other. It also appears that the dark matter in the clusters also just went past each other, as the gravitational lensing of the areas where there are lots of stars is much greater than the stars alone can account for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is an alternate theory to dark matter – called MOND for modified Newtonian dynamics. Since dark matter only appears to interact with other matter through gravity (like in the bullet cluster, it was not physically slowed down by the collision – only its gravity is evidence), then perhaps, says MOND, all we need to do is tweak gravitational theory to account for the apparent effects of dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, if gravity does not fall off as quickly as we currently think then we could explain the rotation of galaxies without having to invent a new kind of matter. Perhaps studying gravity on the scale of our solar system only gives us an approximation of how gravity works. Perhaps there is  some mathematical factor in the gravitational equations that only becomes measurable at galactic scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now dark matter is the dominant theory and MOND is a minority alternative. A new piece of data, however, may shift the balance a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thorough study of 28 galaxies has uncovered a curious feature – all of the galaxies (despite their age or shape) have “five times more dark matter than normal matter where the dark matter density has dropped to one-quarter of its central value” (according to &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17892-galaxy-study-hints-at-cracks-in-dark-matter-theories.html"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;). Dark matter theory cannot account for this remarkable mathematical symmetry. Such symmetry implies that we are dealing with a force that has precise mathematical features. There is no property of matter that can explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this feature might suggest that MOND is correct – we do need to tweak the gravitational equations, and if we do it in the right way we might not only explain the “extra” gravity we are seeing but this curious symmetry also, and dark matter will go the way of the ether – an invention to help explain cosmology that turned out to not exist. It will be fun trivia for science buffs in about a century, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this observation, while incredibly interesting, is not enough to kill dark matter. There are still other lines of evidence, like the bullet cluster, that tip the scales toward something like dark matter as the explanation. But perhaps this new observation will give MOND more life as an alternate theory. Or perhaps there is some third alternative no one has thought of yet. Or perhaps there is some truth to both theories – there is some dark matter but our gravitational models also need tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not currently taking a position on this controversy. I’m just standing on the sideline watching astronomers fight it out over their competing theories. It’s like a science soap opera, although the story unfolds much more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, each new piece of evidence has seemed to deepen the mystery, raising more questions than they answer. That is also often typical of how science progresses. In the early phase of any new theory each new bit of data increases the complexity and confusion of the question, until we get enough pieces to start to put the big picture together. We are right about at the point of maximal confusi0n with dark matter, or at least it seems that way to this neurologist. I’m happy to be corrected by any astronomers out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have no idea what dark matter is. Until we solve that puzzle, I suspect that MOND theory or something like it will persist. It may even turn out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to see how it all turns out.&lt;/p&gt;

Her co-worker (a male) was there and also needed a ride.  Her boss (a male) had a car with one seat available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-worker suggested (rightly, I believe) that he could walk back by himself and the woman should take the safer option and be driven back by the boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boss refused to drive her.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His response included the phrase, &lt;strong&gt;“… it would be inappropriate for me to take you back since I am married and you are a female, so I am going to have to take [co-worker] Joel instead.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/24/why-would-a-christian-leave-her-stranded/"&gt;found that appalling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it happens more often than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon Acuff&lt;/strong&gt; at Stuff Christians Like &lt;a href="http://stuffchristianslike.net/2009/10/630-awkward-opposite-sex-friendships-2/"&gt;faced a similar predicament&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A few weeks ago I spoke at a conference that required me to fly. In arranging rides to and from the airport with the conference staff, I realized they had me scheduled to be driven back to the airport for my flight home by a lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… I decided to request that a guy drive me to the airport. I just wasn’t comfortable with the idea of spending an hour in LA traffic alone with a girl. That just didn’t seem smart to me and the conference was completely cool with that request. They found a guy, everything was good.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, that sounds ridiculous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acuff makes it sound like this type of scenario is often the beginning of a slippery slope that will ultimately lead to an affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… But of the two camps, “Jeez you’re such a Puritan, loosen up” and “Better safe than sorry, can a dude drive me to the airport,” I know which one I want to fall into. Because no one ever wakes up and says, “Today I’m having an affair.” Affairs are slow burn decisions, with a wick a mile long made of little steps and little compromises.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His last line makes sense, but it seems very possible to me that you can have close &lt;em&gt;platonic&lt;/em&gt; friendships with the opposite sex (or whatever sex you’re attracted to).  To say otherwise sounds like you can’t control your own emotions or feelings or sex drive.  Are some people that weak?  Isn’t it possible to be around other people and not think about jumping them?  Should we give up possible friendships because other people might think there’s something going on between you two?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between spending time behind closed doors during a business meeting with someone of the gender you’re attracted to and staying in a hotel room with that same person.  (Hell, I’ve done the hotel room thing with female friends, too, and it’s never been an issue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a difference between catching a ride with someone and working on a project together in isolated areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acuff’s situation is different from my own, of course, because he’s married.  But I would hope there’s enough communication between the couple that, if such a situation arose, his partner would just trust him to make the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would hope if you just explain the situation to your partner and not try to hide it, most of the hypothetical problems he discusses could be worked out before they escalate into anything bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am I being completely naïve when I say all this?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or is Acuff right and we’re better off playing it safe and keeping a distance at all times from people we could theoretically have an affair with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through many of the comments on his thread, it seems like a lot of people are &lt;em&gt;overly&lt;/em&gt; cautious about everything.  (e.g. If I get into a car with another woman, I text my wife and let her know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one friend said to me, “If you can’t control yourself, maybe you shouldn’t be in a relationship.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SundayTime online reported - and a rebuttal was written - &lt;a href="http://www.stfc.ac.uk/PMC/PRel/STFC/STOct09.aspx"&gt;Science and Technology Facilities Council:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article6860249.ece"&gt;Sunday Times article&lt;/a&gt; of 4 October on UK involvement in the European particle physics laboratory CERN and high profile global astronomy projects, such as ALMA, is incorrect. The article has misquoted the Chief Operating Officer of STFC, Professor Richard Wade, and taken other comments out of context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lorddrayson/status/4608444524"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1452/picture2kz.png" alt="" width="279" height="147"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fact is that UK membership of CERN is governed by an international treaty, and could only be changed with UK Government approval. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite liked the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lorddrayson/status/4608444524"&gt;Tweet from Lord Paul Drayson in response&lt;/a&gt;. Excellent news and well done to Brian Cox for what I heard was a well-recieved talk this weekend in London.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s adorable! Read more here and here. It&amp;#39;s not surprising anymore to find dinosaurs with feathers, as a matter of fact there are several small toy models of feathered dinosaurs on my desk right now looking up at me so they&amp;#39;ve started to find their way into popular culture. What makes Anchiornis so striking is that both the sediments in which it was found and its characteristics place it at the very base of the origin of birds from small feathered dinosaurs in the late Jurassic, before the oldest known bird, Archaeopteryx. It provides evidence of bird-like features in a time before there were birds. All other feathered dinosaur fossils that have been found have been dated to a later time. There are of course many more interesting details surrounding this finding, but I&amp;#39;ll just refer you to the far more knowledgeable articles I linked to above. I just wanted to get something down because this is exactly the kind of thing that gets my imagination going and really takes me back to when I was first &amp;quot;bitten&amp;quot; by dinosaurs when I was seven or eight years old. I can only imagine what I must have thought or felt back then if someone had told that not only had there been small, feathered, four-winged (!) dinosaurs hopping and flapping around on earth, but that all birds were actually living breathing dinosaurs; great, great, great, grand-cousins of Velociraptor or T. rex. I still can&amp;#39;t walk past the thrushes and blackbirds that skittishly and vigilantly peck for earth worms out on the yard without smiling to myself imagining a much, much older, but maybe not too dissimilar scenario in the Mesozoic.

She holds to the ancient nonsense about how nouns tell us the people, places, and things while verbs give us the deeds and actions but adjectives give us nothing but qualifications and hot air and spin — they contribute no content.  And she is clearly implying that she (cynically) expects political speeches to be full of adjectives.  But as before, she hasn&amp;#39;t done any checking at all, she has just spouted her conjectures straight into the microphone.  So let&amp;#39;s try a second breakfast experiment, shall we?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I examined the first few paragraphs of the transcript of &lt;a href="http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/gordon-brown-keynote-conference-speech/"&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown's speech&lt;/a&gt; to the 2009 Labour Party Conference the other day (curiously, he seems to have begun with the coordinator &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;).  Here is the first part of the text, with the adjectives underlined (and again, I am counting them very conservatively, ignoring many items that traditional grammars include under the adjective heading):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; And so today, in the midst of events that are transforming our world, we meet &lt;u&gt;united&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;determined&lt;/u&gt; to fight for the future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country confronts the &lt;u&gt;biggest&lt;/u&gt; choice for a generation. It's a choice between two parties, yes. But more importantly a choice between two directions for our country.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;u&gt;last&lt;/u&gt; 18 months we have had to confront the &lt;u&gt;biggest&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;economic&lt;/u&gt; choices the world has faced since the 1930s.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only a year ago that the world was looking over a precipice and Britain was in danger. I knew that unless I acted decisively and immediately, the recession could descend into a &lt;u&gt;great&lt;/u&gt; depression with millions of people's jobs and homes and savings at risk.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And times of &lt;u&gt;great&lt;/u&gt; challenge mean choices of &lt;u&gt;great&lt;/u&gt; consequence, so let me share with you a little about the choices we are making.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;u&gt;first&lt;/u&gt; choice was this: whether markets left to themselves could sort out the crisis; or whether governments had to act. Our choice was &lt;u&gt;clear&lt;/u&gt;; we nationalised Northern Rock and took shares in &lt;u&gt;British&lt;/u&gt; banks, and as a result not one &lt;u&gt;British&lt;/u&gt; saver has lost a &lt;u&gt;single&lt;/u&gt; penny. That was the change we chose. The change that benefits the &lt;u&gt;hard working&lt;/u&gt; majority, not the &lt;u&gt;privileged&lt;/u&gt; few.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we faced a &lt;u&gt;second&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;big&lt;/u&gt; choice — between letting the recession run its course, or stimulating the economy back to growth. And we made our choice; help for &lt;u&gt;small&lt;/u&gt; businesses, &lt;u&gt;targeted&lt;/u&gt; tax cuts for millions and advancing our investment in roads, rail and education. That was the change we chose - change that benefits the &lt;u&gt;hard working&lt;/u&gt; majority and not just a &lt;u&gt;privileged&lt;/u&gt; few.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we had a &lt;u&gt;third&lt;/u&gt; choice, between accepting unemployment as a price &lt;u&gt;worth&lt;/u&gt; paying, or saving jobs. And we in Britain made our choice, it's meant half a million jobs saved. And so, Conference, even in today's recession there are 29 million people in work. 2 million more men and women providing for their families than in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's 23 adjectives in 332 words, or 6.9 percent.  Decisively less than the scientific paper &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1790"&gt;analyzed earlier&lt;/a&gt;, and roughly the frequency one would expect from any ordinary text.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Rev. Tilby says is that we should try &lt;b&gt;deleting all&lt;/b&gt; the adjectives, which is really absurd (though in fact it is exactly what &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000671.html"&gt;Alistair Cooke&lt;/a&gt; seems to have thought, delusionally, that he used to do to all his radio scripts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-appointed writing gurus who preach in these extreme terms against adjectival modification seem to forget that sometimes adjectives are there because they are crucial not only to the sense but to the structure. Delete the adjectives in this sentence of Brown's and you get a result that doesn't even seem grammatical, and certainly doesn't have anything like the truth conditions of the original.  These two are not synonymous:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the &lt;u&gt;last&lt;/u&gt; 18 months we have had to confront the &lt;u&gt;biggest&lt;/u&gt; economic choices the world has faced since the 1930s. &lt;br&gt; In the 18 months we have had to confront the economic choices the world has faced since the 1930s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example, where the result is not even grammatical:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; [T]he challenge of change demands nothing less than a &lt;u&gt;new&lt;/u&gt; model for our economy, a &lt;u&gt;new&lt;/u&gt; model for a more &lt;u&gt;responsible&lt;/u&gt; society and a &lt;u&gt;new&lt;/u&gt; model for a more &lt;u&gt;accountable&lt;/u&gt; politics.&lt;br&gt;*The challenge of change demands nothing less than a model for our economy, a model for a more society and a model for a more politics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make any sense of the claim that such prose could be improved by removing adjectives one would have to propose completely removing all traces of the adjective phrases to which they belong.  That would give us the following:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The challenge of change demands nothing less than a model for our economy, a model for a society and a model for a politics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the Rev. Tilby suggesting that we would understand his proposals better if he couldn&amp;#39;t draw the distinction between models and new models, between societies and responsible societies, between politics and accountable politics?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that the Prime Minister would have been totally unable to convey his drift, of course.  He could in principle have rephrased using only abstract nouns, thus completely avoiding the anti-adjective critique:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; [T]he challenge of change demands nothing less than a model for our economy that has novelty, a model (with novelty) for a society that has responsibility to an extent exceeding the responsibility of society as it now exists and a model (with novelty) for a politics with a degree of accountability that exceeds the degree of accountability that politics has today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Rev. Tilby expecting us to believe that this is an &lt;b&gt;improvement&lt;/b&gt;, bringing greater &lt;b&gt;clarity&lt;/b&gt;?  Has she completely lost her wits?  Or did she simply not give any thought to what she was saying?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that you can better see what is being said when the adjectives are removed is simply (yes, I do have to use an adjective here) asinine. Gordon Brown says at one point:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; [T]hese are my values — the values I grew up with in an ordinary family in an ordinary town.  Like most families on middle and modest incomes we believed in making the most of our talents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deleting the adjectives from it yields this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; These are my values — the values I grew up with in a family in a town.  Like most families on incomes we believed in making the most of our talents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the point of this ridiculous pretense that it would be a better political world if Brown were blocked from distinguishing ordinary families from unusually affluent ones, not allowed to draw the distinction between having an income and having a median-level income?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s why I bothered to write anything at all about a pathetic little 500-word radio sermon: I am so sick of seeing stupid writing advice handed out by pusillanimous pseudo-experts on language — dim-witted vicars like Angela Tilby, pontificating authoritarians like E. B. White in the chapter he added to &lt;i&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/i&gt;, and all the English teachers who have (while hypocritically making free to &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000469.html"&gt;constantly using adjectives in their own writing&lt;/a&gt;) poisoned the reputation of adjectives down the centuries (see the first chapter of Ben Yagoda's delightful little book on the parts of speech, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-You-Catch-Adjective-Kill/dp/0767920783"&gt;&lt;i&gt;When You Catch an Adjective, Kill It&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people are wasting educational time and effort, and helping to drive students into a state that I have written about before, characterized by &amp;quot;vague unease instead of a sense of mastery,&amp;quot; and feeling &amp;quot;less sure of themselves, yet no better informed,&amp;quot; so that their writing ability is &amp;quot;probably being harmed rather than enhanced&amp;quot; — in short, a state of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1357"&gt;nervous cluelessness&lt;/a&gt; about language.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeating the falsehood that adjectives are bad in general makes people &lt;b&gt;less&lt;/b&gt; able to see what is wrong when they really are over-used. For a remark about the real lesson of Dan Brown's over-use of adjectives, with a diagnosis of what is wrong, see my piece "&lt;a href="http://nymag.com/arts/books/bookclub/lost-symbol/index4.html"&gt;He doesn't trust us&lt;/a&gt;" on the &lt;i&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/i&gt; site. There's a real point to be made, I think; but it's not about the adjective category per se.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjectives are neither good nor bad.  The dumb usage pundits who recommend eschewing them totally are handing out advice that is at best exactly what Angela Tilby wrongly claims adjectives are (vapid, empty, and superfluous), and at worst clearly mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

A plethora of items awaited me, most of them promising (rather unsurprisingly) to bring the purchaser luck and wealth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Past installments have taught us that vampires bring good vibrations and centaurs bring happiness. Why is it that those mythical creatures are so totally divorced from their commonly-held characteristics while our poor, green-clad Irish sprite is saddled instead with centuries of stereotyping? Can't the leprechaun bring death to one's enemies? Can't he bring firmer, longer-lasting erections? Alas, the &lt;i&gt;bocht&lt;/i&gt; leprechaun is stuck bringing naught but good fortune and &lt;i&gt;saibreas&lt;/i&gt; to his purchaser.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know, if leprechauns had any luck to give away, I figure they wouldn't be caught by hippies and trapped inside cheap baubles for sale on the internet. But maybe that's just me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/MEET-SARKA-UR-LUCKY-LEPRECHAUN-W-WEALTH-SPELLS-SZ-8-5_W0QQitemZ290351549149QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item439a4d0add&amp;amp;_trksid=p3286.m20.l1116"&gt;Item Number 290351549149: MEET SARKA, UR LUCKY LEPRECHAUN W/WEALTH SPELLS, SZ 8.5&lt;br&gt;WITH 9 POWERFUL WEALTH $$ SPELLS ALSO CAST WITH HIM!!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;WELCOME TO SPIRITED-ENTERPRISE &amp;amp; SPIRAL MORRIGAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where the Magick Happens...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Sarka&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your LUCKY LEPRECHAUN cast with an additional&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9 POWERFUL WEALTH $$$ SPELLS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;for maximum effectiveness!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;Not only is poor Sarka (which sounds less Irish Gaelic and more Conan the Barbarian) crammed into a brooch of some sort and tasked with living down to a cultural cliche, but he is further insulted by the assumption that he needs "9 POWERFUL WEALTH $$$ SPELLS" to increase him to maximum effectiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe they're just coercion spells to make him do what they want him to do; leprechauns always were wily little bastards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He can aid his companion in:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;changing luck&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;bringing about financial stability&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;gambling&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;business&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;investing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;games of chance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;unexpected gifts or monies&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and so much more!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;So basically he has five dots in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage_The_Ascension#Entropy"&gt;Entropy sphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Be warned, his most common manifestation is flicks and streaks of light.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Flick" is not a noun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If seeing manifestations is not something you would like, then he is not the companion for you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Why go out of your way to buy some supernatural something-or-other if you don't like ghostly activity?

I miss shareware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;~Spirited Enterprise &amp;amp; Spiral Morrigan~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...bringing REAL MAGICK back to REAL PEOPLE!!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ah yes, the re-democratization of magic. Except it was never democratized in the first place. Magic, in myth and legend, was always the purview of a chosen elite. In reality, those thought to have magic powers have never been "real people," but instead twisted outcasts, bizarre shamans, or ascetic lonters.. Magic isn't populist; it's elitist or exclusionary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This reeks of proletarian revolution. One of the magical bourgeoisie, a lucky man in green, was conquered and subdued, forced into a cheap piece of tacky jewelry, and made to do the bidding of poor white trash in an attempt to make them elites in the temporal world. Those without the means to generate their own wealth instead exist on the back of a poor leprechaun, far from home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ah, well. 'Tis the lot of the Irish to find themselves on another shore, exploited by others and looked down upon. Sarka will get used to it, or he'll start &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boondock_saints"&gt;murdering Italian mobsters&lt;/a&gt;.

This hypothetical property is located in proximity to the modern conveniences of a nearby city and the natural beauty offered by the Gulf Coast, and more interiorly, the Everglades.  You purchased the property several years prior, and now that you’ve reached retirement you’re ready to build your dream house and commence to living the good life in south Florida style.  Unfortunately, just as you’re ready to break ground a call from your contactor brings bad news…

It turns out that your property is occupied by wetlands; regulated wetlands that will be obliterated by your new house. 

What to do?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mothers and their newborns in an Oregon City church that practices faith healing routinely died during or shortly after birth because medical help was not sought…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benny Hinn, from Texas, who draws large crowds to his Pentecostal revival rallies, was turned back at Stansted airport under new rules on visiting ministers of religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thousands of Pentecostal Christians travelled from across Britain and Europe and booked long weekend breaks in the capital’s hotels for his mission at the ExCeL exhibition centre in Docklands, East London, which had been due to begin on Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were left disappointed after Border Agency officials turned him back when he landed with his private jet because he had failed to obtain a “letter of sponsorship” from a church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Mr Hinn flew on to Paris and tried to enter Britain at Luton airport but was again turned back. He was on his way back to France last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe now would be the appropriate time for the U.S. to adopt the same policy to keep him out of our country too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date&lt;/strong&gt;: Thursday, October 15, 2009&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 6:30pm   &lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: Zerbo's Health Foods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event Details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Heidi Scheer is a national spokesperson for Autism Awareness and the Biomedical Approach to treating autism. She serves as an advisory board member to the American Medical Autism Board and is the co-chair for the annual International Conference on Autism Spectrum Disorders. Heidi and her husband Doug (a professional magician) enjoy performing and volunteering for local chapters the Autism Society of America and The Judson Center Autism Connections program. She has been featured on numerous television news reports as well as on Lansing's "Current Affairs" with Michigan Representative Cathy Angerer. After meeting with Governor Granholm, Heidi received a proclamation declaring April 5th as "Autism Intervention Day" in Michigan. She also co-wrote and produced a short film titled "Gannon's Story" that has been inspiring families worldwide. Heidi is the mother of three beautiful children: Carson, Gannon, and Ella.

I obviously don't do that too often and am just managing to keep myself out of Martin's knicker drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I might start as I mean to go on, by writing about vaginal orgasms. Call me an attention seeker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sent a study from the Journal of Sexual Medicine by the fabulous and recommended &lt;a href="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/"&gt;Dr Petra Boynton&lt;/a&gt; and have to say that, however angry it made me, I will be forever in debt to Prof Stuart Brody for introducing the word 'clitoromania' into my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the study is more than a little Freudian. Feminists have frequently had a problem with Freud, mostly on the basis that he was talking bollocks (heh), but also because he was often hugely simplistic and lacking in evidence. Somewhat like our new friend Prof Brody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Petra makes some &lt;a href="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/?p=890"&gt;excellent points &lt;/a&gt;about the flaws in the methodology of this study, notably that it was a questionnaire which was asking the female participants to estimate and recall such things as partners' penis length, duration of penetrative sex and what they had been taught about female orgasms. Questionnaires asking for estimation and recall may return interesting information on attitudes but does not lead to very credible factual information. For example, you may be likely to say that your lovely partner has a larger than average cock because you're a nice person not because its true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can't shrug off the feeling that Prof Brody has an agenda here, most notably because of his reference to women's studies courses (codeword for hairy-armed, feminist, lesbians):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many North American university courses, including women’s studies courses, promulgate texts that falsely claim that vaginal orgasm does not exist, is very rare, or is essentially the same as clitoral orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? Do they really? Really, do they? There is no evidence offered to support this statement or indeed most of the statements made in the discussion of this paper which specifically do not follow from the evidence reported by the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an illustrious history of 'scientific' fascination in female sexuality and genitalia; from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria"&gt; hysteria &lt;/a&gt; (meaning literally disturbances of the uterus, hence hysterectomy) to the widespread myth (for I'm afraid it is a myth) of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina_dentata"&gt;vagina dentata&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is how bad science, and bad science reporting, can be irritating but also damaging - to health, sexual satisfaction, and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study generated the headlines &lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/man-woman/Womens-ultimate-fantasy-Size-not-foreplay/articleshow/5013125.cms"&gt;"Women's ultimate fantasy: Size not foreplay"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.yourtango.com/200937362/does-size-really-matter"&gt;"Wait. Size Matters, After all?"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/the-elusive-orgasm/article1300640/"&gt;"The elusive orgasm"&lt;/a&gt; and "Oui, la taille du sexe, ça compte’ (roughly translates ‘Yes, the size of the sex counts’, but check out the less than supportive &lt;a href="http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1520/Sexe-Relations/article/detail/996055/2009/09/16/Oui-la-taille-du-sexe-ca-compte-.dhtml"&gt;accompanying picture&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there's pressure to orgasm, to have multiple orgasms, to not take too long and now according to this study, have the right sort of orgasm. Listen Stuart Brody - back off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a concentration on “doing sex right” which leads to the medicalisation of male and female sexual ‘dysfunction’. I don’t deny that sometimes drugs and treatments for sexual dysfunction are necessary and beneficial to individuals but often, and certainly historically, we are being told that there is a right and wrong way to have sex and if you're not doing it right then you have to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans, together with other animals notably the &lt;a href="http://www.primates.com/bonobos/bonobosexsoc.html"&gt;bonobo&lt;/a&gt; (great article, doesn't link to animal porn. Honest), have sex for pleasure not simply procreation. By sex, I don’t share Brody’s fixation on heterosexual penetrative sex (believe me it is a fixation, see &lt;a href="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/?p=692"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4646010.stm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2009/08/31/stoking-fire-the-sexual-politics-condom-use"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) I would include oral sex, same-sex sex and all number of sexual practices which I'm not going to list here because you all have access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on heterosexual penetrative sex is therefore frankly boring, unrealistic and makes us less adventurous than our ape cousins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead let me recommend &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090928172536.htm"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; to you, which is also survey-based but is explicitly collecting data on attitudes, on the health impacts of women having positive attitudes towards their genitals. Debby Herbenick the lead researcher draws attention to how our culture portrays women's genitals as dirty and in need of cleaning and grooming and how this impacts on sexual health and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the point of science is to check for biases and strive as far as is possible for objectivity, it still takes place - and importantly is reported - within a cultural context. A cultural context which is full of inequality, prejudice and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why when you read the headline "scientists say size does matter" followed by a story of a flawed study that certainly doesn't prove penis size increases the prevalence of vaginal orgasms; stop and think - I wonder why? When you do, you would have taken your first step on the path to feminism ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

As I was perusing &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?author=8"&gt;my list of posts&lt;/a&gt; the other day, it occurred to me that there’s one huge topic that in the more than a year and a half I’ve been blogging for SBM I’ve never covered. It’s a particularly pernicious and dangerous quackery. Indeed, it’s a quackery I mentioned during part of my talk at the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=491"&gt;Science-Based Medicine Conference&lt;/a&gt;, which Steve organized and where several SBM bloggers spoke the day before TAM7 started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m referring to the dangerous and vile quackery known as the &lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;German New Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Die Germanische Neue Medizin&lt;/em&gt;). Pioneered by Ryke Geerd Hamer, it is a quackery that claims lives. So what is this &lt;a href="http://germannewmedicine.ca"&gt;German New Medicine&lt;/a&gt;? Well, it appears to be a &lt;a href="http://www.markolin.com/section2/index.shtml"&gt;Theory of Everything Medical&lt;/a&gt;, and in particular everything having to do with cancer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE GERMAN NEW MEDICINE provides us with illuminating explanations about the origin, development and healing of both physical and mental disorders. In 1981, Dr. Hamer discovered that every DISEASE is caused by a shock experience that catches us completely off guard. He found that this shock not only occurs in the psyche but simultaneously in the brain and on the organ level. At the moment the unexpected trauma takes place the shock impacts a specific area in the brain causing a lesion that is clearly visible on a brain scan as a set of sharp concentric rings. With the impact the affected brain cells communicate the disturbance to the corresponding organ. Whether the organ responds with a tumor growth (cancer), with tissue degeneration, or with functional loss, is determined by the exact type of conflict shock. Based on the analysis of over 40,000 case studies Dr. Hamer is the first to provide scientific proof that cancer is not caused by a malfunctioning organism producing deadly cancer cells but is rather the result of an innate meaningful survival program that has been successfully practiced for millions of years. Since HEALING can only occur after the conflict has been resolved, the GNM-therapy focuses on identifying and resolving the original conflict. By understanding healing symptoms such as painful swelling, infections, fever, or inflammation in their psychological, biological and evolutionary context, we are able to liberate ourselves from the fear and panic that often come with the onset of an illness. Dr. Hamer’s findings offer a completely new understanding of so-called diseases. His scientific discoveries revolutionize entirely our view of medical conditions and their causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German New Medicine presents a comprehensive system that allows us to understand what type of conflict causes the onset of a particular disease, how the disease manifests itself in the conflict active phase, what can be expected in the healing phase, and how all the developments are connected to the brain, verifiable with a brain scan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German New Medicine is a natural science, based on FIVE empirically disovered BIOLOGICAL LAWS that apply, in a strong scientific sense, to each and every case of disease of man and mammal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository of quackery known as &lt;a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2007/08/21/a-new-view-of-cancer-german-new-medicine.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mercola.com&lt;/a&gt; describes the “Five Biological Laws” of German New Medicine thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;GNM is based of five biological laws that apply scientifically to each and every case of disease. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com/documents/firstlaw.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Every disease is caused by a conflict shock that catches an individual completely off guard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com/documents/secondlaw.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Provided there is a resolution of the conflict, every disease proceeds in two phases, a conflict-active phase and a healing phase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com/documents/thirdlaw.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ties the findings of the first two laws into the context of embryology and the evolution of man. It illustrates the biological correlation between the psyche, the brain, and the organ from an evolutionary point of view. (The Ontogenetic System of Tumors and Cancer-Equivalent Diseases.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com/documents/fourthlaw.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Addresses the role of microbes in the context of evolution and in relation to the three germ layers from which our organs originate. Microbes are indispensable to your survival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com/documents/fifthlaw.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Every so-called disease has to be understood as a “meaningful special biological program of nature” created to solve an unexpected biological conflict&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Dr. Hamer believes that a person cannot die of cancer in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone dies during the conflict-active phase of disease, he says, it’s because of energy loss, weight loss, sleep deprivation, and emotional and mental exhaustion. The stress of receiving a cancer diagnosis, or being given a negative prognosis, is often enough to deprive a person of their life-force. Conventional cancer treatments only accelerate the downward spiral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oooh, boy. So much woo in such a concentrated form. Oddly enough, it never occurs to Hamer that it might be–oh–the metastatic cancer that results in weight loss and the gradual decline of cancer patients. Also note how Hamer blames the doctors. If we tell a patient that that patient has a life-threatening cancer, it’s a “psychic shock” or a severe stress that actually “deprives the person of his life force.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first heard of this particularly odious form of cancer quackery, my first question was: Why five BIOLOGICAL LAWS? (And in all capital letters, yet, as in “FIVE empirically disovered BIOLOGICAL LAWS”?) Why not four? Or six? It reminds me of the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail about the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Hand_Grenade_of_Antioch"&gt;Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch&lt;/a&gt;, with a little change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… And the Lord spake, saying, “First shalt thou take out the Unholy Conventional Medicine. Then, shalt thou come up with FIVE LAWS. No more, no less. FIVE shall be the number of laws thou shalt find, and the number of the laws shall be FIVE. Six shalt thou not find, neither find thou four, excepting that thou then proceed to FIVE. Seven is right out. Once the number FIVE, being the fifth number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy BIOLOGICAL LAWS towards cancer thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.” Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I can see it now, except with German accents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’re curious, the creator of the German New Medicine, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryke_Geerd_Hamer"&gt;Dr. Ryke Geerd Hamer&lt;/a&gt;, named the DHS after his son, Dirk. You see, Dr. Hamer’s son was tragically shot in his sleep by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Emanuele%2C_Prince_of_Naples"&gt;Vittorio Emanuel, the last crown prince of Italy&lt;/a&gt;. After a prolonged course requiring multiple operations, his son unfortunately succumbed to his wounds, which undoubtedly caused Hamer immense emotional trauma, as the sudden loss of a child always does. Three years later, Hamer developed testicular cancer. So, in a perfect case of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc"&gt;post hoc ergo propter hoc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reasoning, Hamer decided that it must have been the psychic shock of his son’s death that caused his cancer. Forget about all that molecular biology. Forget about oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Forget about increased mutation rates. Forget about all that. Dr. Hamer is here to tell you that it’s “Hamer-time.” (Sorry, couldn’t resist.) In actuality, he’s here to tell you that everything that scientists think they know about the pathogenesis of cancer is wrong. Cancer is really due to a “psychic shock,” not genetic alterations in cells that lead to uncontrolled proliferation. What about cancer patients who have lived happy lives devoid of “highly acute, dramatic, and isolating shocks”? There’s no such person. If you search back far enough, you could probably find such a shock, and if that fails you could alway postulate some sort of birth trauma. I don’t mean to minimize the tragedy that Dr. Hamer must have suffered because of the shooting of his son and the fact that the killer got off with a slap on the wrist because of his title and wealth, nor am I claiming that mental stress doesn’t contribute to disease, but Hamer took his tragic personal experience and generalized it to a ridiculous extreme, even to the point of basing rather arrogantly-named “biological laws” on it. It’s as if the shock of losing his son unhinged his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are these “laws” that Dr. Hamer so confidently postulated? Well, let’s look at the First Law, a.k.a. the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060505213248/www.markolin.com/section2/subsection1/index.shtml"&gt;Iron Rule of Cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, it’s subdivided into three criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every cancer or cancer-equivalent disease originates from a DHS (Dirk Hamer Syndrome), which is a serious, highly acute, dramatic and isolating shock that catches an individual completely off guard. The conflict shock occurs simultaneously in the psyche, the brain and the corresponding organ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the moment of the DHS, the content(s) of the conflict determine the location of the Hamer Focus in the brain and the location of the cancer or cancer-equivalent disease in the organ.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The development of the conflict determines the exact development of the Hamer Focus in the brain as well as the exact development of the cancer or cancer-equivalent disease in the organ.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most ridiculous “law” at the heart of Hamer’s quackery is the &lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com/documents/secondlaw.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Second Law&lt;/a&gt;, in which he claims that the origin of all cancer is in the brain. This, specifically, is what the “&lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com/documents/Explore%20GNM%20Website%20Update.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hamer Focus&lt;/a&gt;” is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing thousands of brain computer tomograms (CT) in relation to his patient’s histories, Dr. Hamer discovered that the moment a DHS occurs, the shock impacts a specific, pre- determined area in the brain, causing a “lesion” that is visible on a CT scan as a set of sharp concentric rings (In 1989, Siemens, the German CT scanner manufacturer, certified that these ring formations are not artifacts of the equipment). Upon impact, the affected brain cells communicate the shock to the corresponding organ, which in turn responds with a particular— predictable!—alteration. The reason why specific conflicts are indissolubly tied to specific brain areas is that during our historical evolution, each part of the brain was programmed to respond instantly to conflicts that could threaten our survival. While the “old brain” (brain stem and cerebellum) is programmed with basic survival issues that relate to breathing, eating, or reproduction, the “new brain” (cerebrum) is encoded with more advanced themes such as territorial conflicts, separation conflicts, identity conflicts, and self-devaluation conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hamer’s medical research is firmly tied to the science of embryology, because whether the organ responds to a conflict by a tumor growth, by tissue meltdown, or by functional impairment is determined by the embryonic germ layer from which both the organ and corresponding brain tissue originate (Third Biological Law).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video further describing Hamer’s bizarre ideas about cancer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/LPb-rGRBjJs%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it particularly despicable how Dr. Holt, the narrator of this video, blames osteoporosis in a psychic conflict or blow that comes from menopause, in which loss of estrogen supposedly leads women to feel that they “aren’t the woman they used to be” and that that conflict is manifest in the bone. Equally despicable is the part where he talks about an athlete’s being angry because of an injury that screws up his ability to perform and that anger leading to an osteosarcoma of extremity. Here’s a further &lt;a href="http://www.markolin.com/section2/subsection2/index.shtml"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The therapeutic focus of the New Medicine is to identify the original DHS and to find a solution to the conflict that is as real and as practical as possible. For example, a man who lost his business and suffers a territorial loss must find a new occupation; the shock from an unexpected early retirement could be resolved by establishing a new “domain”, such as by joining a club or taking up a neglected hobby. As soon as the conflict is resolved, healing runs its natural course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Hamer really saying that, for example, if a new retiree was forced out of his job and then later develops colon cancer, his colon cancer could be cured just by finding him a hobby or other productive way to spend his time? How nice. I guess that would put us surgeons out of business, given that most colon cancer is cured primarily by surgery, with chemotherapy and, if it’s rectal cancer, radiation therapy decreasing the rates of post-surgical recurrence. More likely, if you tried to use that concept to treat GI malignancies it would give us more of the business that we really don’t like: malignant bowel obstructions that require urgent, rather than elective, surgery, with a resultant decrease in cure rates and increase in complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/3980323269/" title="Hamerfocus by David SBM, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3489/3980323269_017b20866f_o.jpg" width="257" height="274" style="margin:10pt 10px 10px 10pt;float:right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is pseudoscience with an implausibility on par with that of homeopathy. Really. First, let’s take a look at the photo of a brain CT that, according to the “Second Law,” allegedly shows a “Dirk Hamer” focus (right). I’m not a radiologist, but this “Dirk Hamer focus” looks a lot to me like your &lt;a href="http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/24/6/1679.full"&gt;basic CT scan artifact&lt;/a&gt;. One also has to wonder: If this were real, why has no other physician or investigator reported finding similar lesions in cancer patients? If all cancer really is due to the presence of the DHS lesions in the brain (which, according to Hamer, are due to whatever “psychic trauma” that supposedly caused the DHS and therefore caused the cancer), then why is it that no other oncologist or radiologist has ever reported them? After all, if every single cancer patient suffered some sort of psychic trauma resulting in DHS rings that in turn result in cancer, the correlation between such lesions and cancer should have been really easy to see, particularly with more modern CT scanners. Is Hamer so much more brilliant than everyone else? Whenever anyone claims that there is one cause for all cancers, run, don’t walk, from him! Hamer and his “DHS rings” are no different than &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/clark.html"&gt;Hulda Clark and her liver flukes&lt;/a&gt;, which Clark claims to be the cause of all cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how Hamer views cancer, described in his &lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com/documents/thirdlaw.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Third Law&lt;/a&gt;, which he calls the “Ontogenetic System of Tumors’ Meaningful Special Biological Programs of Nature” (whatever that means):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/3980317499/" title="ontogenetic by David SBM, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2460/3980317499_1c976d0b38.jpg" width="500" height="396" alt="Ontogenetic"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it, Hamer divides all tumors into two phases that he calls “sympatheticotonia” (conflict active phase) and vagotonia (conflict resolution phase). He explains how these phases work &lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com/documents/Explore%20GNM%20Website%20Update.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;thusly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;GNM’s “Ontogenetic System of Tumors” illustrates that “old-brain”-controlled organs, which derive from the endoderm or the “old-brain”-mesoderm, like the lungs, liver, colon, prostate, uterus, corium skin, pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, breast glands, etc., always generate cell proliferation as soon as the corresponding conflict occurs. Tumors of these organs therefore develop exclusively during the conflict-active phase (initiated by the DHS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take lung cancer, for example: The biological conflict linked to lung cancer is a “death-fright conflict”, because in biological terms the death panic is equated with being unable to breathe. With the shock of the death- fright the lung alveoli cells, which regulate breathing, instantly start to multiply, forming a lung tumor. Contrary to the conventional view, this multiplication of lung cells is not a pointless process but serves a very definite biological purpose, namely, to increase the capacity of the lungs and thereby optimize the organism’s chance of survival. Dr. Hamer’s brain scan analyses demonstrate that every person with lung cancer shows a distinct target ring configuration in the corresponding area in the brain stem, and that each patient had suffered an unexpected death panic prior to the onset of cancer. In the majority of cases the death scare was triggered by a cancer diagnosis shock that the person experienced as a “death sentence”. Given that smoking is on the decrease, this sheds new light on the enigmatic increase of lung cancer (“The #1 Killer”) and calls into question whether smoking is per se an actual cause of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. According to Hamer, smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer, so smoke ‘em if you’ve got ‘em!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also blames breast cancer on either a “mother-child” or “partner worry” conflict. To him, these sorts of “conflicts” involve a child becoming ill or being seriously injured. According to the article above, Hamer’s “many case studies” show that women develop cancer of the breast from “obsessively worrying about the well-being of a loved one”, such as a child who is in trouble, a parent who is ill, or a dear friend who is a cause for concern. This concept is, of course, the purest poppycock, utter woo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, no good piece of cancer woo would be complete without its creator telling us “conventional” types that we have it all wrong about some key aspect of cancer. Not content to tell us that we have no idea what we’re talking about regarding the pathogenesis of cancer, like Hulda Clark, Hamer boldly tells us that we also have no clue about the real reason for &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060505213248/http://www.markolin.com/section2/subsection3/#metastasis"&gt;cancer metastasis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard metastasis theory suggests that cancer cells of a primary tumor travel via the blood stream or the lymph system to other parts of the body where they cause a cancerous growth at a new site (theoretically, this assumption would imply a potential risk of contracting cancer through a blood transfusion). The New Medicine does not dispute the fact of secondary and third cancers. However, according to the Five Biological Laws, second and third cancers are not the result of migrating cancer cells but of a second or third DHS, often triggered by a diagnosis or prognosis shock that puts the individual into total panic, causing a new conflict or even several new conflicts leading to additional cancers. For example, a cancer diagnosis shock can trigger a “death fright conflict” leading to the development of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, dude. If your cancer metastasizes, it’s not really the same tumor at all, but a new one. Moreover, obviously you’ve had some sort of other “psychic trauma” that caused the metastasis to pop up. It’s also pretty convenient that Hamer attributes metastasis to a “death fright conflict.” Pretty much each and every single cancer patient fears that his or her cancer will kill him. Thus, every cancer patient has a “death fright conflict.” Now that I think of it, though. If it is the case that most, if not all, cancer patients fear that their cancer will kill them, isn’t it true that most, if not all, cancer patients have a “death fright conflict”? If that’s the case, then why don’t all cancer patients develop metastases? Just a thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s move on to the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050621081221/http://www.markolin.com/section2/subsection4/index.shtml"&gt;Fourth Biological Law&lt;/a&gt;, which supposedly addresses the role of microbes in disease and evolution, but for the life of me I can’t figure out exactly what the heck Dr. Hamer is saying about disease. Let’s whittle it down to two sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When our organs developed over the course of evolution, very specific types of microbes developed with them. The biological purpose of the billions of micro-organisms that inhabit our body is to maintain all the different tissues and keep them in a healthy state. Given the purposeful co-existence of man and microbes, the New Medicine identifies fungi, bacteria or viruses as loyal helpers that are indispensable for our survival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the discovery of the New Medicine that microbes become without exception only active in the healing phase. In the phase of Normotonia as well as in the conflict active phase they are dormant and do not cause any infection. But at the moment of the conflict resolution, they receive a signal from the brain to start the work that was assigned to them. Pathogenic (active) microbes are totally harmless to all other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is true that microbes are present in infectious diseases, but it is not the microbes that cause the disease. On the contrary, our organism uses the microbes to optimize the healing process.  It is also true that microbes can be transmitted, but they stay inactive as long as we are not in the healing phase of the appropriate conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, so all of those pathogenic bacteria? Don’t worry about them. They only work for your good. So, if you have a big abscess, a gangrenous foot, pneumonia, AIDS, or hepatitis C, it’s just your body using bacteria or viruses to “optimize the healing process.” You don’t need antibiotics or antiviral drugs. If you die in the process, it just means that you weren’t able “resolve your inner conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Especially this &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050621081221/http://www.markolin.com/section2/subsection4/index.shtml"&gt;part about microbes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungi and myco-bacteria (yellow group) are the oldest microbes. They exclusively work on organs and tissues that originate from the endoderm  and are directed from the brain stem. Fungi like Candida or myco-bacteria like tubercular bacteria are the “destruction crew”. They decompose tumors such as colon tumors, lung tumors, kidney tumors, or liver tumor. During the healing phase  they break down the extra cells that are no longer needed. Usually, this decomposing process is accompanied with fever and night sweats. What makes myco-bacteria remarkable is that they start to multiply immediately at the moment of the conflict shock. They multiply at a rate which parallels the growing tumor. The moment the conflict is resolved, the exact amount of tubercular bacteria is available that is necessary to decompose the tumor cells. If the microbes are absent because, for example, they were eradicated through vaccination, the tumor will be encapsulated in scar tissue and stays in place with no further cell augmentation. In this case the tumor will be viewed as “benign”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria (orange group) inhabited the organs and tissues that derive from the mesoderm directed from the cerebellum (old brain mesoderm) or the cerebral medulla (new brain mesoderm). Bacteria are the “cleanup-workers. In old brain mesodermal tissue they decompose tumors such as glandular breast tumors or melanoma, and assist by clearing away the remnants. Bacteria also help to restore the tissue by forming abscesses that will be filled with scar tissue. In new brain mesodermal tissue, bacteria such as staphylococcus bacteria fill the gaps in the bone that were caused by the meltdown of callus cells and reconstruct the bone with granulating callus forming tissue. During the healing phase, bacteria also rebuild the cell loss (necrosis) of ovarian or testicular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses (red group) are the youngest microbes. They exclusively work on tissue that derives from the ectoderm and is controlled from the cerebral cortex, e.g. the epidermis, the cervix, the intra-hepatic bile ducts, the mucous membrane of the stomach, the bronchia or the nose. Viruses are the “reconstruction workers”. They replenish the tissue that was lost during the preceding ulceration process. While old brain directed myco-bacteria start to multiply immediately with the onset of the conflict active phase, viruses start to divide and to become active only upon the resolution of the conflict. With viruses involved the healing phase  is more dramatic, often accompanied with fever and inflammation. Examples for viruses at work are: pneumonia, hepatitis, herpes, or the “flu. If the necessary viruses are absent, healing still occurs but not to a biologically optimum degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like tumor cells, microbes never cross the germ layer threshold (diagram). For example: pneumonia viruses only work on bronchial tissue which originates from the ectoderm and is controlled from the cerebral cortex, while tubercular bacteria are specialized to operate exclusively on lung alveoli tissue that originates from the endoderm and is directed from the brain stem. That is why we will never find tuberculosis in the bronchia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, no. Just one example: Tuberculosis can infect many organs and sites and not just ectodermally derived tissues, including lungs, kidneys, the meninges (lining of the brain), and bones and joints (which, happen to be derived from mesoderm, by the way). It is also &lt;a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;amp;cpsidt=2818438"&gt;not true&lt;/a&gt; that you don’t find tuberculosis in the bronchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the bottom line for Hamer is the &lt;a href="http://www.markolin.com/section2/subsection5/index.shtml"&gt;Fifth Biological Law&lt;/a&gt;, and, if you’ve been paying attention to alt-med concepts, you will realize that this “Law” echoes so much woo that you have to wonder if Dr. Hamer thought of it himself or simply synthesized many varieties of woo into a single concise statement that seems to sum up huge swaths of alternative medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every so-called disease has to be understood as a Meaningful Special Biological Program of Nature created to solve an unexpected biological conflict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every “so-called disease”? Yes, indeed. &lt;a href="http://learninggnm.com/documents/fifthlaw.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to Dr. Hamer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All so-called diseases have a special biological meaning … While we used to regard Mother Nature as fallible and had the audacity to believe that she constantly made mistakes and caused breakdowns (malignant, senseless, degenerative cancerous growths, etc.) we can now see, as the scales fall from our eyes, that it was our ignorance and pride that were and are the only foolishness in our cosmos. We could not understand such a ’sewn up’ totality, and so brought upon ourselves this senseless, soulless and brutal medicine. Full of wonder, we can now understand for the first time that nature is orderly (we already knew that), and every occurrence in nature is meaningful, even in the framework of the whole, and that the events we called ‘diseases’ are not senseless disturbances to be repaired by sorcerers’ apprentices. We can see that nothing is meaningless, malignant or diseased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these ideas have power and resonance among cancer patients, and this attractiveness, coupled with the fear of science-based cancer therapy, particularly chemotherapy, has led all too many cancer patients to believe in Hamer’s quackery. For example, there was the case of &lt;a href="http://www.ariplex.com/nmwiki/index.php?title=Victims_of_new_medicine#Olivia_Pilhar_.28Austria_1995.29"&gt;Olivia Pilhar&lt;/a&gt;. Olivia was six years old in 1995 at the time she was diagnosed with a Wilm’s tumor, a highly treatable childhood malignancy, and her parents discovered Ryke Geerd Hamer. Her parents withheld conventional medical therapy and persued Hamer’s German New Medicine. In an echo of later cases in the United States of children whose parents decided to pursue “alternative medicine” rather than scientific medicine, such as Abraham Cherrix and Daniel Hauser, the Austrian government finally removed the parents’ rights of care and control, and they fled from Austria to Spain with Olivia. Despite Hamer’s “treatments,” Olivia’s tumor continued to grow. After negotiations including the intervention of the Austrian president, the parents were persuaded to return with the condition of no punishment. By then, Olivia’s tumor weighed several kilograms. The child was finally given emergency medical treatment, including chemotherapy and surgery, after a court order against the parents’ wishes. Olivia is still alive in 2009 and very lucky to be so. In the end, her chances at survival had been eroded, and she suffered far more than she needed to in order to treat her cancer. Her parents received an eight-month suspended jail sentence in Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another victim of Hamer’s quackery is &lt;a href="http://www.ariplex.com/ama/amamiche.htm"&gt;Michaela Jakubczyk-Eckert&lt;/a&gt; (note: photos on this site not for the squeamish). This is the patient I spoke about at the Science-Based Medicine Conference in July. Michaela developed stage III breast cancer and initially underwent chemotherapy, with good response. If she had continued, likely she could have undergone surgery with curative intent. Unfortunately, she discovered Ryke Geerd Hamer, who persuaded her to give up chemotherapy and pursue German New Medicine. As a result, her cancer returned with a vengeance. She developed &lt;em&gt;en cuirasse&lt;/em&gt; disease, which is cancer growing over a large portion of her chest wall. Her death in 2005 was unpleasant and very painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another, equally unsavory aspect to Hamer, and it ties into another aspect of any serious cancer quackery, namely a foe that keeps The Truth from the people. Basically, Hamer is a &lt;a href="http://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2009/07/13/german-new-medicine-hamer-house-of-horror/"&gt;raging anti-Semite&lt;/a&gt;. He has become convinced that the German New Medicine is being suppressed by the “International Jewish Conspiracy,” that Jewish scientists have stolen from him the idea of German New Medicine, and that they are hiding it from the world. Indeed, he further claims that the Jews use German New Medicine for themselves to cure their cancers but &lt;a href="http://www.germanische-neue-medizin.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=9&amp;amp;Itemid=20" rel="nofollow"&gt;keep it from Gentiles&lt;/a&gt;, all the better to &lt;a href="http://www.german-new-medicine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;Itemid=2" rel="nofollow"&gt;allow two billion people to die&lt;/a&gt; “needlessly” from cancer. In this, the German New Medicine shares with many other forms of quackery another essential ingredient: A conspiracy theory to explain why Hamer’s quackery isn’t more widely known, practiced, and above all appreciated for the “genius” that it is. In most cases of cancer quackery, it’s the pharmaceutical companies, governments, or some cabals made up of both who are said to be “suppressing” the latest cancer cure. In the case of Ryke Geerd Hamer, it’s…&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE JEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!!!!!!! (Cue scary music.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing about the German New Medicine that feeds in to what I’ve  thought for a long time now, it’s that many “alternative medicine” beliefs seem to demand some sort of “meaning” from disease. The cancer patient, when faced with the horror of his or her disease, will rail against the unfairness of it all. And indeed it &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; fair. It isn’t fair at all. Cancer sucks. Regardless of the type of cancer, it’s a horrible, nasty disease, and some varieties are particularly deadly. But life itself isn’t fair. Sadly, bad things (like cancer or other life-threatening diseases) happen to good people. Personally, I don’t see much difference between Hamer’s quackery, in which all diseases are postulated to have a “special biological meaning” where the symptoms are the result of an inner mental conflict and the beliefs expressed by many religious people that bad things (like being afflicted with a horrible disease like cancer, whatever type) must be the result of a “higher purpose,” that they must serve a “greater good.” The only difference is that Hamer has replaced the appeal to an unknown and unknowable “meaning” dictated by God with an appeal to a greater “meaning” dictated by Nature. The hope that one’s suffering is all in the service of a greater good may well help many people deal with  cancer or other life-threatening or debilitating diseases, but it’s not such a good idea as the basis of any sort of medicine, whether “New German” or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, even worse thing, about the German New Medicine is that it feeds into another common strain in “alternative medicine” thought, namely to blame the victim. In the case of this particular form of cancer quackery, cancer isn’t a disease but rather a manifestation of something going on in the mind. If the cancer patient can’t overcome this “trauma” and thus dies, the implication is that it’s the cancer patient’s fault. If only he had believed more or done more to follow the particular woo that is supposed to save him, he would still be alive today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, I find to be the most despicable aspect of all when it comes to cancer quackery.&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, you read that correctly.  They're watching us and being all, &lt;i&gt;"You guys don't know what skepticism is!  We know what it is and what you're doing isn't it!  You guys are all CYNICS!"&lt;/i&gt;  It's quite hilarious.  Watch the little embedded video; in it, there's a reference to an essay by one Winston Wu who has apparently:&lt;blockquote&gt;...written an essay that brilliantly and decisively rebuts the general skeptical arguments against the paranormal.  This is among the best essays ever written on the subject, and deserves extensive study.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wow.  I better take at least a cursory look at the thing.  &lt;a href="http://www.debunkingskeptics.com/Contents.htm"&gt;Here it is.&lt;/a&gt;  Click the link for &lt;a href="http://www.debunkingskeptics.com/Page3.htm"&gt;Occam's Razor&lt;/a&gt;, if you would; it's argument number three.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, the first bit of the Occam riff is stupid, but bearable.  Sometimes the simpler answer is not the truth, that's for real.  Occam's razor falls apart from time to time when we know exactly what's going on and the truth is not always super simple.  The point, however, is that when the paranormal believer folks try to introduce their pet idea, they treat it as though it were already proven to exist as a viable option.  Look at what Wu says in part two:&lt;blockquote&gt;...what is “simpler” is often relative.  For example, having telepathic or clairvoyant experiences in some primitive cultures is very common (e.g. Tibetan, African, Amazonian) and those who have such abilities all their lives consider it ordinary.  As Phil Gibbs points out in the same Physics FAQ: &lt;/blockquote&gt;No one has ever proven that these "primitive cultures" actually had any "powers" beyond our own.  To just assume that clairvoyance or telepathic powers existed in these people is naive and unscientific.  If you have evidence, show it, otherwise, be quiet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The quip about Dr. Charles Tart's OBE evidence re: the girl reading the five-digit secret number from a shelf above her bed, seems a bit snarky seeing as there is cause for skepticism about the objectivity in the study.  "Miss Z", as Tart refers to her, is described as follows in Tart's &lt;a href="http://www.paradigm-sys.com/ctt_articles2.cfm?id=31"&gt;study paper&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Psychologically, it is extremely difficult to describe Miss Z. My informal observations of her over a period of several months (undoubtedly distorted by the fact that one can never describe one's friends objectively) resulted in a picture of a person who in some ways was quite mature and insightful, and in other ways so extremely disturbed psychologically that at times, when she lost control, she could possibly be diagnosed as schizophrenic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So she was a "friend".  Doesn't mean she cheated at all, but it's something.  Tart describes how he came up with the random five numbers in the adjacent room then deposited the target numbers on the shelf above "Miss Z's" room.  He says:&lt;blockquote&gt;My conversation with Miss Z after I had prepared the target was, of course, minimal and could not have given her any clue as to the target number. In future experiments, however, it would be preferable for a second experimenter, who had had no contact at all with the subject, to prepare the targets.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So he prepared the numbers, put them in an envelope, then chatted with her.  Not exactly stringent controls.  Plus he admits he fell asleep through the night:&lt;blockquote&gt;Occasionally I dozed during the night, beside the equipment, so possible instances of sleep talking might have been missed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So these red flags, along with Tart's research never being replicated since he did it in 1968, make for me not buying it.  Could it be real?  Sure, why not?  But if it's as common as Tart makes it seem, it should be proven beyond a doubt by now.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Occam's razor entry then says this confusing line: &lt;i&gt;"...if I toss a die, it is more likely that I will roll numbers 1-5 than a 6.  But that doesn’t mean that a 6 will never come up."&lt;/i&gt;  This line, while true, is very misleading.  If he is equating paranormal events with being the number 6, it's a false analogy because we can look at the six dots on that one special side and, occasionally, yes, a six will come up.  No one has ever reliably read another person's mind or "remotely viewed" a place or target.  If he thinks they have, then show it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Wu says: &lt;i&gt;"...if someone had an amazing psychic reading at a psychic fair (not prearranged) where they were told something very specific that couldn’t have been guessed by cold reading..."&lt;/i&gt;  Um, not to be a dick, but cold reading can produce WAY more specific things than a rope and the will to steal.  We get a nice window into Wu's "thinking" from this quote:&lt;blockquote&gt;A skeptic did that to me once when I brought up how a psychic was able to tell me that I had a tragic period in my life when I was 9 years old, without any other information or clue from me other than my birth date.  He kept insisting that I gave her clues which allowed her to predict that, even though I guaranteed him that I didn’t.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I love it when the tiny guy with the Napoleon complex insists that his memory is perfect.  It's not, no one's is.  Especially when he's having an adult conversation about specific events that happened when he was nine.  I barely remember three days ago, let alone decades.  To be that certain about what he said and did &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; long ago is delusional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go check out this site and their ridiculous nonsense.  I just want to chill and enjoy my Bud Light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(edited: Thanks to Andy for catching my mistake in the paragraph about "rolling a six on a die". I was really tired last night and made a stupid error. My thanks again.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(edited again: Of course, after being tipped off by commenter Yakaru, the great &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/11/winston-wu-woo-rebuttal.html"&gt;Skeptico&lt;/a&gt; has already covered this topic.

The study estimated that people with a gun were 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not possessing a gun.

I obviously don't do that too often and am just managing to keep myself out of Martin's knicker drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I might start as I mean to go on, by writing about vaginal orgasms. Call me an attention seeker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sent a study from the Journal of Sexual Medicine by the fabulous and recommended &lt;a href="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/"&gt;Dr Petra Boynton&lt;/a&gt; and have to say that, however angry it made me, I will be forever in debt to Prof Stuart Brody for introducing the word 'clitoromania' into my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the study is more than a little Freudian. Feminists have frequently had a problem with Freud, mostly on the basis that he was talking bollocks (heh), but also because he was often hugely simplistic and lacking in evidence. Somewhat like our new friend Prof Brody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Petra makes some &lt;a href="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/?p=890"&gt;excellent points &lt;/a&gt;about the flaws in the methodology of this study, notably that it was a questionnaire which was asking the female participants to estimate and recall such things as partners' penis length, duration of penetrative sex and what they had been taught about female orgasms. Questionnaires asking for estimation and recall may return interesting information on attitudes but does not lead to very credible factual information. For example, you may be likely to say that your lovely partner has a larger than average cock because you're a nice person not because its true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can't shrug off the feeling that Prof Brody has an agenda here, most notably because of his reference to women's studies courses (codeword for hairy-armed, feminist, lesbians):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many North American university courses, including women’s studies courses, promulgate texts that falsely claim that vaginal orgasm does not exist, is very rare, or is essentially the same as clitoral orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? Do they really? Really, do they? There is no evidence offered to support this statement or indeed most of the statements made in the discussion of this paper which specifically do not follow from the evidence reported by the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an illustrious history of 'scientific' fascination in female sexuality and genitalia; from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria"&gt; hysteria &lt;/a&gt; (meaning literally disturbances of the uterus, hence hysterectomy) to the widespread myth (for I'm afraid it is a myth) of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina_dentata"&gt;vagina dentata&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is how bad science, and bad science reporting, can be irritating but also damaging - to health, sexual satisfaction, and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study generated the headlines &lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/man-woman/Womens-ultimate-fantasy-Size-not-foreplay/articleshow/5013125.cms"&gt;"Women's ultimate fantasy: Size not foreplay"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.yourtango.com/200937362/does-size-really-matter"&gt;"Wait. Size Matters, After all?"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/the-elusive-orgasm/article1300640/"&gt;"The elusive orgasm"&lt;/a&gt; and "Oui, la taille du sexe, ça compte’ (roughly translates ‘Yes, the size of the sex counts’, but check out the less than supportive &lt;a href="http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1520/Sexe-Relations/article/detail/996055/2009/09/16/Oui-la-taille-du-sexe-ca-compte-.dhtml"&gt;accompanying picture&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there's pressure to orgasm, to have multiple orgasms, to not take too long and now according to this study, have the right sort of orgasm. Listen Stuart Brody - back off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a concentration on “doing sex right” which leads to the medicalisation of male and female sexual ‘dysfunction’. I don’t deny that sometimes drugs and treatments for sexual dysfunction are necessary and beneficial to individuals but often, and certainly historically, we are being told that there is a right and wrong way to have sex and if you're not doing it right then you have to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans, together with other animals notably the &lt;a href="http://www.primates.com/bonobos/bonobosexsoc.html"&gt;bonobo&lt;/a&gt; (great article, doesn't link to animal porn. Honest), have sex for pleasure not simply procreation. By sex, I don’t share Brody’s fixation on heterosexual penetrative sex (believe me it is a fixation, see &lt;a href="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/?p=692"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4646010.stm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2009/08/31/stoking-fire-the-sexual-politics-condom-use"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) I would include oral sex, same-sex sex and all number of sexual practices which I'm not going to list here because you all have access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on heterosexual penetrative sex is therefore frankly boring, unrealistic and makes us less adventurous than our ape cousins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead let me recommend &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090928172536.htm"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; to you, which is also survey-based but is explicitly collecting data on attitudes, on the health impacts of women having positive attitudes towards their genitals. Debby Herbenick the lead researcher draws attention to how our culture portrays women's genitals as dirty and in need of cleaning and grooming and how this impacts on sexual health and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the point of science is to check for biases and strive as far as is possible for objectivity, it still takes place - and importantly is reported - within a cultural context. A cultural context which is full of inequality, prejudice and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why when you read the headline "scientists say size does matter" followed by a story of a flawed study that certainly doesn't prove penis size increases the prevalence of vaginal orgasms; stop and think - I wonder why? When you do, you would have taken your first step on the path to feminism ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Mass requests guidance from the Holy Spirit for all who seek justice, and offers the opportunity to reflect on what Catholics believe is the God-given power and responsibility of all in the legal profession.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/dmKgYyFWjmU%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.necn.com/Boston/Nation/2009/10/04/6-Supreme-Court-justices/1254685356.html"&gt;Who attended&lt;/a&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice &lt;strong&gt;John Roberts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sonia Sotomayor&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Antonin Scalia&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Anthony Kennedy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Breyer&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Samuel Alito&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breye, who is Jewish, has attended this service before.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Bader Ginsburg&lt;/strong&gt;, who is also Jewish, has her reasons for not attending:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… Ginsberg said she grew tired of being lectured to by Catholic officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I went one year, and I will never go again, because this sermon was outrageously anti-abortion,”&lt;/strong&gt; Ginsburg said in the book “Stars of David: Prominent Jews talk About Being Jewish” by author Abigail Pogrebin.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;, the sixth Roman Catholic on the court, didn’t attend.  I’m not sure why…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not illegal for the justices to attend church, but I am troubled by this special outreach to politicians and judges.  It sounds like an &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/10/01/dc.red.mass/"&gt;easy way to curry favor&lt;/a&gt; toward Catholic issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Critics of the service, however, find the attendance of leading decision-makers, including members of the highest court in the land, to be inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The truth is, this was set up as a way to basically lecture and give information to the justices,” said the Rev. Barry Lynn, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. “There is no other institution that has this special way to talk to the justices on the Supreme Court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn, an ordained minister with the United Church of Christ, noted the Mass was begun after several high court decisions that were disapproved of by the archdiocese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They figured if they got all the justices together and chatted them up in a worship service, they might be able to convince them to see the law their way,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is influence no other religious group (or non-religious group) has — it’s influence none of those groups &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have — and it’s very disturbing that more justices don’t take the hard-lined stance of Justice Ginsberg.&lt;/p&gt;

I still wasn't sure, though...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, all of the above is a nuanced discussion that I may elaborate on tomorrow if I am in the mood for it.  What has suddenly convinced me that single payer is a really good idea is much more present and visceral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, I work at a major multinational corporation, I am a salaried employee, and I pay for the most comprehensive health plan my employer offers.  While it is true that my employer got rid of all the HMOs a few years ago and now only offer PPOs (which are sweet because you can pick your own doctor with virtually no limitations, but which suck because you typically have to cover 20% of anything that is non-routine), I still think I have what would be considered pretty good health insurance.  You better damn well believe I pay for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Total out-of-pocket costs for the birth of my first child:  FOUR THOUSAND MOTHERFUCKING DOLLARS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was supposed to be $1700.  Things didn't quite go according to plan, but then again, it wasn't like it was a cesarean or required a visit to the NICU or anything.  Pitocin induction, epidural, vaginal birth.  We even left the hospital early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is, there isn't a single unified entity I can complain to.  There are at least FOUR parties involved in this fuck-overage:  The OB my wife was seeing initially, the midwife, the hospital where she gave birth, and the insurance &lt;strike&gt;thieves&lt;/strike&gt; company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it was single payer, even if they decided to fuck me in the ass to the tune of 235% of the initial quote (and by the way, WHY THE &lt;b&gt;FUCK&lt;/b&gt; is it legal for insurance companies and providers to &lt;i&gt;conceal net prices from their customers&lt;/i&gt;???!?!?!??) at least then I could call somebody up and argue.  As it is, basically all I can do is roll over and spread it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So uh... if I put ads on this blog, will anybody click-through?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-5287298524689424234?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254695951815"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/is_intelligent_design_science.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/249d2280b0bf9606</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Is Intelligent Design Science?</title><published>2009-10-04T22:19:48Z</published><updated>2009-10-04T22:19:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/CvbC_n4zEzQ/is_intelligent_design_science.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/is_intelligent_design_science.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/8Lt_yBpUxm4%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26feature%3Dplayer_profilepage%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/is_intelligent_design_science.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/CvbC_n4zEzQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254695951815"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/fear.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe093947850dff43</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Fear</title><published>2009-10-04T21:26:11Z</published><updated>2009-10-04T21:26:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/j6nTe87x6-8/fear.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/fear.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fear has been a subject of discussion around here lately.

Basava Premanand, founder of the &lt;a href="http://www.indiansceptic.in/"&gt;Indian Sceptics&lt;/a&gt;, has died after a long battle with cancer. Premanand spent the past 35 years, fighting gurus and godmen in India, going into villages and duplicating their alleged miracles with his amateur magician skills to show them as the charlatans that they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="Premanand" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/02/Basava_Premanand.JPG" alt="This man kicked ass" width="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This man kicked ass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premanand also founded the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, which tours the villages of India to educate people by debunking gurus and fakirs who they consider either frauds or self deceived. He also founded Indian CSICOP and published the monthly magazine, The Indian Skeptic, which publishes articles on the scientific investigation of apparently paranormal occurrences with a special emphasis on cases from India. He also ran a JREF-style paranormal challenge where he offered Rs. 100,000 (about US $2,000) to anyone who could prove paranormal powers under scientific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most famously, Premanand went after Satya Sai Baba (who I have &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/2007/12/moonstruck/"&gt;written about before&lt;/a&gt;) for many years. Sai Baba is very influential in India and Premanand had a lot of fallout from his attacks but it &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm"&gt;never stopped him&lt;/a&gt;. One of my favorite stories of his efforts: Sai Baba would supposedly produce gold out of think air. Premanand &lt;a href="http://www.uni-giessen.de/~gk1415/sai-baba.htm"&gt;sued him&lt;/a&gt; for violation of the Gold Control Act for Sathya Sai Baba’s materializations of gold objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Act imposes restrictions on the”manufacture, possession, sale and transfer of gold” and since Sai Baba was “creating” the gold, Premanand said he should be subject to the appropriate tarrifs. Unfortunately, the case was dismissed, but Premanand appealed on the ground that spiritual power is not a legal defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will be sorely missed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254688483294"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/the_value_of_a_mentor_who_look.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7117d093049eac5b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Diversity in Science"/><title type="html">The Value of a Mentor Who Looks Like You...</title><published>2009-10-04T20:23:14Z</published><updated>2009-10-04T20:23:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/cJ8Gtk1nO28/the_value_of_a_mentor_who_look.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/the_value_of_a_mentor_who_look.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">Being, basically, the hottest female scientist at ScienceBlogs is not easy, and in order to do smoking hot science, I have had to learn a lot of really important lessons.  Some of them I have been learned quickly  -- for example, keep the HCl in the hood.  Other lessons have taken me more time and much more painful reflection in order to learn.  It's one of those lessons that I would like to share, to hopefully begin a new conversation with you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isis Lesson #37: No one individual can provide you all of the mentoring that you need to be successful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific world is a bit of a strange place.  When we are trainees, we enter into relationships with people who serve as our advisors and frequently we expect that they will  solely mentor us to success.  The reality is that sometimes we need things that these advisors are either incapable or unwilling of providing for us.  It seems like a simple lesson, but it is a lesson that I spent years beating my head against the wall, stomping me feet, and crying in order to learn.  The mentor who serves as our academic advisor can really only teach us to be them, because those are the experiences they&amp;#39;ve had.  We are each a reflection of the experiences we&amp;#39;ve had and the people who have taught us. At the end of the day I had to realize that, as much as I wanted it, there were things that the men I have been mentored by could not provide for me and to continue to demand it only made us both uncomfortable.  The establishment of a diverse network of advocates and mentors has been and will be crucial to my success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/the_value_of_a_mentor_who_look/getbloodfromstone.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/the_value_of_a_mentor_who_look/getbloodfromstone-thumb-400x288-20153.jpg" alt="getbloodfromstone.jpg" height="288" width="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: Sometimes trying to force these relationships is like getting blood from a stone.  Check out Idioms by Kids &lt;a href="http://www.idiomsbykids.com/taylor/mrtaylor/class20022003/idioms/idioms2003/idiomsalllinkedon1pg.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, what kind of mentors does a scientist need to be successful?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had a very interesting conversation recently with a group of other women scientists about the value of having a mentor who &amp;quot;looks like you&amp;quot; if you are a woman, minority, or (God forbid) a minority woman in science. Initially many of the discussants commented that they had received quality mentoring from white men in their field and that one should not turn down a mentor because of his white d00dliness.  Before some of you lose you junk in my comments section, I think that sounds very reasonable.  However, as the conversation progressed, several women remarked that they also see value in having someone &amp;quot;like them&amp;quot; to discuss the cultural aspects of academia with, someone to ask if they are interpreting a situation correctly, and someone to come to with issues unique to being a woman/minority/minority woman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have had several valuable white d00d mentors, two of whom I spent yesterday with, learning to make beer and wine, grunting, playing music, and generally making fun of their d00dliness. Central to our relationship is a level of trust and a sincere belief that they tell me things because they have my best interests in mind.  Neither of them are scientists -- one is a Catholic deacon and the other is the editor of a major publication. Even though they are not in my field, they both still have had experiences that I can learn from and I have frequently called upon them for help.  What I value the most about our relationship is that they are willing to have a good, solid scrap without taking it to heart.  They also have the perspective to grab me by my shoulders, give me a shake, and say, &amp;quot;Isis, what the fuck are you doing?&amp;quot; when I need it (as I did this trip).  They offer me glimpses into their culture, one that I am unfamiliar with, and have frequently helped me frame my behavior in order to pass in academia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, I also frequently find myself feeling isolated in the sea of white d00dliness and having contacts who &amp;quot;look like me&amp;quot; to help me navigate the culture may be really important too.  There are differences in how cultures communicate and what the norms are for discourse.  Frequently minorities are brought in to help &amp;quot;diversity,&amp;quot; but most of us appreciate that this is not really the intent.  Minorities are brought in to make the culture &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; diverse, but are usually expected to blend into the dominant culture.   That assimilation process can be awkward and painful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Friday night I had dinner with a group of women scientists I recently met who were more like me than my white male colleagues, speak the same languages I do, and had families with the same educational background I do.  That experience was tremendously valuable.  While I appreciate that there is no rule that says that the best mentor for a woman is a woman, or a brown person for a brown person, or a brown woman for a brown woman, and I have great relationships with white men, this new network is also incredibly important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So where does this post go from here?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Balls if I know, but I suppose it's fodder for future blog posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do we establish these networks?  Certainly every woman/minority/minority woman can&amp;#39;t be expected to mentor every person like them who is coming up in the ranks, but I fear that we fail to establish these networks at our peril.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm going to go eat some tacos and ponder this some more...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/the_value_of_a_mentor_who_look.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/cJ8Gtk1nO28" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254688483294"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/donorschoose-y-ness.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e3ab6a5438f7f7c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DonorsChoose"/><title type="html">DonorsChoose-y-ness!</title><published>2009-10-04T20:17:46Z</published><updated>2009-10-04T20:17:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/qgY7FVNWWUk/donorschoose-y-ness.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/donorschoose-y-ness.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am profoundly humbled by the generosity of my readers.

&lt;p&gt;Since we &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/donorschoose_2009_social_media.php"&gt;kicked off the challenge on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, three more blogs have mounted challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as I type this, 61 ScienceBlogs readers have donated a grand total of $4,784, funding projects that will reach 1,329 students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are more students to be reached.

Jonathan Wells is the latest ID creationist to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/10/storming_the_beaches_of_norman.html" rel="external "&gt;recent post at “Evolution News &amp;amp; Views”&lt;/a&gt; describing an event at the University of Oklahoma, Wells said, “I replied that duplicating a gene doesn’t increase information content any more than photocopying a paper increases its information content.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells is wrong.  I frequently give this as an exercise in my classes at the University of Waterloo:  &lt;em&gt;Prove that if x is a string of symbols, then the Kolmogorov information in xx is greater than that in x for infinitely many strings x&lt;/em&gt;.  Most of my students can do this one, but it looks like information expert Jonathan Wells can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf" rel="external "&gt;Like many incompetent people&lt;/a&gt;, Wells is blissfully unaware of his incompetence.  He closes by saying, “Despite all their taxpayer-funded professors and museum exhibits, despite all their threats to dismantle us and expose us as retards, the Darwinists lost.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to “expose” the intelligent design creationists as buffoons; they do it themselves whenever they open their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the shirt worn by some high school band members in Sedalia, Missouri… that is, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/30/evolution-of-a-trumpet-player-shirt-banned-in-missouri/"&gt;until religious parents called to complain&lt;/a&gt; they were offended by evolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Assistant Superintendent Brad] Pollitt said the district is required by law to remain neutral where religion is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the shirts had said ‘Brass Resurrections’ and had a picture of Jesus on the cross, we would have done the same thing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Band parent Sherry Melby, who is a teacher in the district, stands behind Pollitt’s decision. Melby said she associated the image on the T-shirt with Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was disappointed with the image on the shirt.” Melby said. “I don’t think evolution should be associated with our school.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story has a bit of an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The print shop that created the design for the shirt, Main Street Logo, is getting so many requests from people interested in purchasing the shirts, they’re &lt;a href="http://www.sedaliademocrat.com/articles/main-18871-gained-attention.html"&gt;taking advantage of the opportunity &lt;/a&gt;and making the sales:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Initially, both men debated whether or not to reproduce the shirts but eventually decided it was an opportunity they couldn’t pass up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have carefully tried to consider the feelings of the people that feel strongly about the shirts,” Ingram said. “But, to survive in small business we’d be fools not to.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in purchasing the shirt, just &lt;a href="http://www.mainstreetlogo.com/?go=main&amp;amp;let=contactus"&gt;contact the store here&lt;/a&gt; and let them know!  You can also &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sedalia-MO/Main-Street-Logo/134784439459"&gt;support them on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Indeed, sometimes I was forced to make my own entertainment: such as the time I poured a glass of water over the housemistress’ head. From two floors up. Or set fire—but no. I’ll leave that one for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;High school physics experiment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was, in fact, a whole regiment of patsies that could be relied upon to relieve the routine of studying for ‘O’ Level. And some of them managed to do it from behind a wall or two…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fine day we traipsed into the chemistry lab to be given a list of instructions, complete with boxes for us to write down our observations. It was meant to be some sort of test; and just so that there could be no cheating, the other top chemistry set was sitting it simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first task was to take a set amount of chalk, and heat it over a bunsen. Then we were to let the powder cool, weigh that, then transfer it to a watchglass and add water. Finally we had to measure the pH of the suspension and figure out what just happened. Something like that, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had instructions. &lt;em&gt;Clear&lt;/em&gt; and and detailed instructions. We heated up the chalk. We (eventually) transferred the resulting powder to watch glass. We read the bit where the instructions said ‘holding it in your hand, add three drops of water’. And because we were doing this (all forty or so of us between two classes) simultaneously, the scream came at the precise moment we were dripping water onto the innocuous-looking powder in a watchglass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because some berk next door (and I know who it was was but I’m not going to embarrass him, on the off-chance he might track me down after 25 years) had taken the instructions too literally: tipped the powder directly into his hand and added water to that. The exothermic reaction alone must have hurt; the alkali burning a hole in his hand did the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

The endless to-do list. This morning Jeff let me sleep in (we take turns with this on weekends). While I was dozing and listening to the sounds of my family waking up and starting an easygoing weekend day, Alex was shrieking and chattering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/rainbow-pencils-stack.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/rainbow-pencils-stack.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of kain.kalju (flickr.com)" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of kain.kalju (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Really have to get him to stop shouting&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. &lt;em&gt;Maybe it’s that Elmo video he watches&lt;/em&gt; — Elmo is agitated about something (maybe that he’s eternally 3 years old? That he is covered in glaring red-orange synthetic fur? That everyone over the age of 6 loathes him?) — &lt;em&gt;whenever he hears Elmo yell, he yells along with him. Right. Out it goes&lt;/em&gt;, I decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Immediately one task (get Alex to stop shouting and screaming) became two (hide or get rid of that Elmo tape) and then three (basement? closet? garbage?) and then four (work on getting Alex interested in some other, more mature form of entertainment: Arthur? Spongebob?) and then five (get up and brush teeth, because there’s no way I’m getting back to sleep now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;•      •      •&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to buy some kind of soapy bathtime paint thing for Alex (bath crayons, I think). He loved them, but they were a complete  pain to clean off the wall — kind of greasy-smeary. Someone on Autism Blogger posted about an &lt;a href="http://www.avon.com/1/1/300-avon-kids-bath-time-body-paints.html"&gt;Avon product&lt;/a&gt; that sounds awesome. Fun and easy to clean: they are in fact soapy body paints, meant to be used on the skin, but I don’t think there would be any harm if he painted with them. They are even on sale. Since Alex hasn’t had anything like this for years, I think it would keep him entertained for quite a while. (Confession: we let/force Alex to take rather long baths every evening because it gives us an hour or so of peace and quiet. At the end all we have to do is mop the (extremely) wet floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have received notice from Narisetti Innaiah, chairman of CFI India, that our friend Basva Premanand has died. Mr. Innaiah's tribute reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. Premanand, the doyen of Indian rationalist movement, is no more. He breathed his last on 04.10.2009 at 2.20 pm at Podannur, Tamil Nadu. He was 79. According to his wishes, his body has been donated to the local medical college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born on 17 February 1930 in Kozhikode (Kerala), Premanand was a keen observer of paranormal phenomena even in his childhood. In his teenage, he approached assorted swamis and gurus to gain spiritual insights but soon fell out with each one of them when he realized that they were all fakes. In 1969 he met the ace Sri Lankan skeptic Dr. Abraham Kovoor who was in India for his "Miracle Exposure" lecture tour. That was a watershed in the life of Premanand, who immediately plunged headlong into the business of debunking spiritual tricksters. After Dr. Abraham Kovoor's death in 1978, Premanand continued Kovoor's famous challenge of offering One Lakh Rupees [US$2,000] to anyone who could demonstrate psychic abilities under fraud-proof conditions. Admittedly, there have been few takers.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>randi@randi.org (James Randi)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254683798328"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9681">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8b4a407daa7e6d6d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: culture</title><published>2009-10-04T19:00:33Z</published><updated>2009-10-04T19:00:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/ai-culture/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5fbe618e00e7572fe179f8952e0d6d2a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently a friend said to me, “My son asked me where he could get some green clothes.” My mind immediately wandered to the myriad of local “green clothing” stores that sell environmentally sound, eco-friendly, compassionate clothes, vegan wear, cruelty-free products and hemp gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it struck me, “Oh, do you mean green-&lt;em&gt;coloured&lt;/em&gt; clothes?” He did…&lt;/p&gt;

That was a bad idea back in May when it was instituted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, they’ve made it worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday night, the Lodi (California) City Council voted unanimously, 5-0, to &lt;a href="http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/news/23504-california-city-council-oks-prayers-in-jesus-name"&gt;allow uncensored prayers&lt;/a&gt; before meetings.  That is to say, you can now “pray in Jesus’ name” before council meetings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is getting a lot of attention from Christians everywhere… I wonder how many of them could tell you what issues are discussed at the council meetings post-prayer.  Do they know?  Do they care?  Doubtful.  The prayer is all that’s important to them.  Not anything of real substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new changes, other faiths can offer invocations, too.  So can the non-religious.  But I can see this easily getting out of hand.  What will the reaction be when someone praises Allah pre-meeting?  Can someone bring up Xenu?  Thor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lodi and other local cities Tehachapi, Tracy and Turlock are &lt;a href="http://www.sacbee.com/religion/story/2225082.html"&gt;in for a fight&lt;/a&gt; over this.  The Freedom From Religion Foundation is just waiting to pounce, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/us/02lodi.html"&gt;looking for the right test-case&lt;/a&gt; to file a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you doubt how “Christian” these pre-council prayers are, &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/legal/lodichart.pdf"&gt;FFRF has made a chart&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) documenting the types of prayers which have been used in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* = Prayer conducted in the name of “Jesus,” “Jesus Christ,” “Christ’s name,” “Your Son’s Name,” or “Lord, in Your Holy Name”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = Attendees requested to “bow your heads”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W = Excerpts from the Bible or references to Scripture used&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G = Christian dogma or sermonizing used&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s just the chart from 2008-2009:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are the non-Christian prayers in there?  Non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that’s going to change.  It’ll only get more religiously charged now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFRF will continue to keep an eye on the situation and they’ll file a lawsuit if needed.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#990000;font-size:14pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNP signals debate legal threat &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crash blossoms (as we've discussed &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1693"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1762"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) are infelicitously worded headlines that cause confusion due to a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence"&gt;garden-path&lt;/a&gt; effect. Here we begin with &lt;em&gt;SNP&lt;/em&gt;, which British readers at least will recognize as the abbreviation for the Scottish National Party. Then comes &lt;em&gt;signals&lt;/em&gt;, which can be a plural noun or a singular present verb; following a noun, most readers would expect it to work as a verb. The third word, &lt;em&gt;debate&lt;/em&gt;, can be a singular noun or a plural verb, and if you've parsed the first two words as Noun + Verb, then you'll be inclined to take &lt;em&gt;debate&lt;/em&gt; as the direct object of the verb. So far, so good. But then comes &lt;em&gt;legal threat&lt;/em&gt;. What to do now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you could go back to the beginning of the headline for a reparsing, now construing &lt;em&gt;signals&lt;/em&gt; as a plural noun modified by &lt;em&gt;SNP&lt;/em&gt;. That would allow you to continue on with &lt;em&gt;debates&lt;/em&gt; as a plural verb and &lt;em&gt;legal threat&lt;/em&gt; as the object of the verb. But what in the world are &lt;em&gt;SNP signals&lt;/em&gt; and why are they debating a legal threat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out the first path was moving in the right direction. &lt;em&gt;Signals&lt;/em&gt; is indeed the verb here, and the object of the verb is &lt;em&gt;debate legal threat&lt;/em&gt; — one of those wonderfully opaque compound nouns that British headlines are prey to. You see, &lt;em&gt;debate legal threat&lt;/em&gt; refers to threatened legal action that could be taken if the SNP isn't permitted to take part in televised debates before the next UK election. And the SNP is now signaling that it may follow through on this threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had fun with such outrageous compounding in previous posts (Geoff Pullum in "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=279"&gt;Noun noun noun noun noun verb&lt;/a&gt;," "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=437"&gt;Canoe wives and unnatural semantic relations&lt;/a&gt;," and "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1121"&gt;Dentist fear girl&lt;/a&gt;," and Mark Liberman in "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1194"&gt;UK death crash fetish?&lt;/a&gt;"). This one's a bit different in that the second element of the compound noun, &lt;em&gt;legal threat&lt;/em&gt;, is a noun phrase consisting of an adjective modifying a noun. That makes &lt;em&gt;debate legal threat&lt;/em&gt; unusually hard to parse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noun-Adjective-Noun compounds are possible in English, of course — think of such constructions as &lt;em&gt;Minnesota Supreme Court&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Obama White House&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Guardian front page&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Microsoft legal team&lt;/em&gt;. In those cases, however, the Adjective-Noun component is a set phrase (&lt;em&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;White House&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;front page&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;legal team&lt;/em&gt;), which makes the addition of a premodifying noun unproblematic. But &lt;em&gt;legal threat&lt;/em&gt; is not such a set phrase, and &lt;em&gt;debate&lt;/em&gt; is not an immediately obvious choice for an attributive noun ready for grafting (certainly not compared to the proper nouns in my examples: &lt;em&gt;Minnesota&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Obama&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft&lt;/em&gt;). So these factors, plus the ambiguous syntactic role of the preceding word, &lt;em&gt;signals&lt;/em&gt;, conspire to make this crash blossom particularly crashy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254676509043"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=5528">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/20cb4c8da14f5bb0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Richard Dawkins is not an accommodationist</title><published>2009-10-04T17:06:01Z</published><updated>2009-10-04T17:06:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/04/richard-dawkins-is-not-an-accommodationist/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh for God’s sake!  An alert reader called my attention to two blog posts by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/10/richard_dawkins_accommodationi.php"&gt;Josh Rosenau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/02/richard-dawkins-accommodationist/"&gt;Chris Mooney/Sheril Kirshenbaum&lt;/a&gt;, both claiming that Richard Dawkins explicitly voiced accommodationist views in a &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; interview. “He’s changed!” they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I know Richard Dawkins. I am at a meeting with Richard Dawkins.  I just discussed these accusations of accommodationism with Richard Dawkins.  And I can tell you, Chris, Sheril, and Josh, that Richard is not one of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I feel like Woody Allen in &lt;em&gt;Annie Hall&lt;/em&gt;. If you’ve seen the movie, you’ll remember that in one scene Allen standing in line with Diane Keaton, waiting to see a movie, and becomes annoyed by some pompous guy trying to impress his date by nattering on  about the work of Marshall McLuhan.  Allen goes behind a movie sign and pulls out McLuhan himself, taking him over to confront Mr. Pomposity.   McLuhan coldly eyes him and says, “Excuse me, but I am Marshall McLuhan, and I couldn’t help overhearing what you said. I have to tell you that you know &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; of my work!”  Allen turns to the camera and quips, “Don’t you wish life could be like this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I have a Woody moment now.  Nobody who has followed Dawkins’s work and writing could possibly think he’s an accommodationist. Since I’m here with Richard at at the Conclave of the Godless, I simply emailed him the links to Rosenau and Mooney-and-Kirshenbaum’s websites. Here is Richard’s email response to the claims that he’s an accommodationist; it’s posted here with his permission, and was verified in person:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How utterly ridiculous. All I was saying is that it is possible for a human mind to accommodate both evolution and religion because F. Collins’s mind seems to manage the feat (along with lots of vicars and bishops and rabbis). I also needed to make the point that TGSOE [&lt;em&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/em&gt;]  is not the same book as TGD [&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;] because many interviewers who are supposed to be interviewing me about TGSOE have simply ignored it and gone right back to assuming that it is the same book as TGD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sympathize with politicians who have to watch every syllable they utter for fear it will be misused by somebody with an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’’s your answer, Josh, Sheril, and Chris. I wish you weren’t so keen to validate your own  ideas that you need to distort the views of others in a desperate ploy to show that they agree with your accommodationism.  Really, you’ve read &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt; and, presumably, Dawkins’s other writings. Anybody with two neurons to rub together should &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that the man is not an accommodationist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Dawkins has verified this,  it would be nice to see Rosenau, Mooney, and Kirshenbaum correct their postings.  And  they need to stop pretending that the existence of religious scientists and religious people who accept evolution proves that science and faith are compatible. We settled that issue long ago.  The issue is &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; compatibility.  Is that really so hard for anyone to understand?&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve had a look at Pharyngula, and of course P.Z. has been doing a good job reporting on the salient events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the first time I’ve been in a group of fellow atheists (and I haven’t detected one sign of stridency or militancy), and it gives one a warm supportive feeling.  One of the functions of speaking at these meetings, even if one is preaching to the choir, is to give solidarity to the atheist community, many of whom feel isolated and alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharyngula reported on Robert Richert’s talk on his experiences in Vietnam, but what P.Z. didn’t mention is that Richert broke down in sobs at the end, while he was describing how one of his fellow soldiers bragged that he had been protected by God, while a Vietnamese woman wailed helplessly as the last blood pumped out of her infant son’s body (he had been hit by a grenade fragment).  “Where was &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; miracle?” asked Richert, with tears streaming down his face. It was an enormously moving moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.Z.’s talk was also good (it’s the first time I’ve heard him speak). Although he’s low key on the dais, his message is hard-hitting, and it was about how “design” can result from purely naturalistic processes.  Lots of jabs at Dembski et al.  P.Z. really shone in the long question session, where he handled the many questions with perspicacity and humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was great to finally meet Russell Blackford, a nice guy who gave a great talk on anti-religion “blasphemy” laws that are passing in various places, including one under consideration by the UN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a talk (and had breakfast with) William Dav is, better known as “The Cigarette Smoking Man” of X-Files fame.  Davis’s nominal topic was a response to Dawkins, who has criticized The X-Files for being inimical to reason (the supernatural explanation always won).  Davis’s response basically boiled down to “Well, we all knew it was fiction,” which I think is inadequate.  Davis also gave a bit of biography (I learned this morning that his X-Files cigarettes were herbal, and he had somebody else light them), and threw out a few bizarre statements, to wit: it might have been better not to fight against Hitler in WWII, and that perhaps democracy isn’t the best political system for the US (he feels that it’s inefficient at confronting our enormous global challenges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Maher’s award and talk on Friday were, as P. Z. noted, absolutely hilarious: Maher read from Rick Warren’s “Purpose Driven Life,” making spontaneous sarcastic comments throughout.  The guy is a hoot, despite his views on medicine (to which Richard did draw attention during his speech).  I sat next to Maher at the ceremony; he has a very young partner with an &lt;em&gt;Archaeopteryx &lt;/em&gt;fossil tattooed on her forearm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was “science day,” organized by the Dawkins Foundation.  Larry Krauss talked on cosmology.  Richard called him “The Woody Allen of Cosmology,” and that’s absolutely accurate. The talk was fantastic; one of the best popular talks on physics I’ve ever heard. Krauss is a riveting and hilarious speaker, who leavens his physics with plenty of bon mots (and, in this case, attacks on creationism).  I was a bit disappointed in Carolyn Porco’s talk, as I expected her to discuss her work on planet imaging. Instead, she talked about the compatibility of science and faith (she appears to be a bit of an accommodationist), and left the images and science to the very end. But do look at the website for some stunning pictures of Saturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Dennett talked about interviews with active priests and ministers who are atheists, and also mounted a hilarious attack on theologians like Karen Armstrong, who mouth pious nonsense like, “God is the God behind God.” Dennett calls this kind of language a “deepity”: a statement that has two meanings, one of which is true but superficial, the other which sounds profound  but is meaningless.  His exemplar of a deepity is the statement “Love is just a word.”  True, it’s a word like “cheeseburger,” but the supposed deeper sense is wrong: love is an emotion, a feeling, a condition, and not just a word in the dictionary.  He gave several examples of other deepities from academic theologians; when you see these things laid out — ripped from their texts — in a Powerpoint slide, they make you realize how truly fatuous are the lucubrations of people like Armstrong, Eagleton, and Haught.  Sarcasm will be the best weapon against this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my talk on the evidence for evolution went well, but I’ll let others be the judge of that.  Annoyingly, I was slated for a book-signing, and somebody forgot to order my book!!  Anybody who wants an autographed copy should feel free to order the book on Amazon, send it to me (with return postage please!), and I’ll sign it and send it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Richard read from the last chapter of &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/em&gt;, which is an exegesis of the famous last paragraph of &lt;em&gt;The Origin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugenie Scott, director of The National Center for Science Education, is speaking in an hour, and I’ll go to her talk (I may report on it later this evening) and take off for LAX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is written in haste, in a hotel lobby, so I apologize for any infelicities of grammar, misspellings, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bats in Peril?

&lt;p&gt;October 28, 2009                                                                                                                                                                                                         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:30 -10:00 am  with discussion beginning at 9, followed by Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: The Acro Cafe - 4th Floor of the Museum of Natural Sciences                                                      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen a bat flying around your house on a summer evening? Did you know that there are 17 different species of bats that live in North Carolina? Come to our breakfast café and learn about these amazing creatures and their biggest threat -- white-nose syndrome, a deadly white fungus that grows around the noses of hibernating bats. Since its discovery in 2007, hundreds of thousands of bats (perhaps a million) have died from the disease, making it one of the worst wildlife disasters ever seen in North America                                                                                                                                                                                     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the Speaker:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;/p&gt;

Millions of people died (by some estimates 4% of the world population), and the medical establishment worked feverishly to find a cause and a treatment.   There were many dead-ends in the search for the cause of the flu. One of the most enduring errors was the attribution of the pandemic to a bacterium called &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt;.  It turned out that the flu was actually caused by a virus rather than a bacterium, but &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=309"&gt;H. flu is still an important discovery&lt;/a&gt;.  The fight against influenza was in many ways successful (although too late for the 1918 pandemic)---it led to the discovery of influenza and many other viruses, and the development of effective influenza vaccines. It is analogous to the discovery of HIV and the advances in science and medicine pioneered by HIV researchers.  Influenza birthed the field of virology.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if we had stopped at one of our dead ends?  What if we had held to the belief that H flu caused influenza, or that HTLV-1 caused AIDS?  In science, dead-ends usually reveal themselves---eventually.  As new discoveries fail to appear, scientists re-examine their underlying assumptions.  H flu was found in many flu victims, but not all.   Other researcher found that fluids that were run through filters that stopped bacteria were still infectious (in human volunteers!), leading them to conclude that there must be an infectious particle smaller than a bacterium. A quarter of a century after the Great Influenza pandemic, effective vaccines against influenza were in production.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the world was torn by the first &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; war, and influenza destroyed military and civilian populations, doctors were trying everything that might help.  In the U.S., sera and vaccines against various agents such as pneumococcus were produced and used with some efficacy, but many other immunologic treatments were dead-ends.  One of these dead-ends was named &lt;i&gt;Oscillococcinum&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/petit_canard_grand_canard.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/petit_canard_grand_canard.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/p4iWoNu_YLw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254673238711"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1790">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3644aafd87b143f6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Prescriptivist Poppycock"/><category term="Syntax"/><category term="The language of science"/><category term="Usage advice"/><category term="Writing"/><category term="adjectives"/><title type="html">Invented facts from the Vicar of St. Bene't's, part 1</title><published>2009-10-04T16:09:36Z</published><updated>2009-10-04T16:09:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1790" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Thought for the Day" is a four-minute reflective sermon delivered each morning on BBC Radio 4 at about ten to eight by some representative of one of the country's many religious faiths.  On the first day of October the speaker was the Reverend Angela Tilby, Vicar of St Bene't's in Cambridge, England. (&lt;i&gt;Bene't&lt;/i&gt; is an archaic shortened form of &lt;i&gt;Benedict&lt;/i&gt;.) Developing a familiar theme from prescriptivist literature, she preached against adjectives.  It was perhaps the most pathetic little piece of inspirational prattle I have ever heard from the BBC (&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/thought/documents/t20091001.shtml"&gt;read the whole misbegotten text here&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Adjectives advertise,&amp;quot; claims the Rev. Tilby, and &amp;quot;brighten up the prose of officialdom&amp;quot;, but she was always &amp;quot;encouraged to be a bit suspicious&amp;quot; of them when she was a girl: &amp;quot;Rules of syntax kept them firmly in their place&amp;quot; (as if the rules of syntax left everything else to do what it wanted!). This was good, she seems to think, because &amp;quot;For all their flamboyance they don&amp;#39;t really tell you much.&amp;quot;  Adjectives &amp;quot;float free of concrete reality&amp;quot; like balloons, and are guilty of &amp;quot;not delivering anything except, perhaps, hot air.&amp;quot; Which aptly describes her babbling thus far.  But now, inflated with overconfidence, she risks some factual statements.  And steps from the insubstantial froth of metaphor into the stodgy bullshit of unchecked empirical claims about language use.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I shall deal with only one such claim in this post.  Another will be dealt with later.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because adjectives are so airy-fairy, the Rev. Tilby holds, &amp;quot;you don&amp;#39;t find many adjectives in scientific prose and when you do they are precise and exact.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m sure that Language Log readers will realize instantly that it is time for what Mark Liberman calls a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=%22breakfast+experiment%22"&gt;breakfast experiment&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, as I undertake the experiment, that in most kinds of English prose about 6% of the words are adjectives (see Douglas Biber et al., &lt;i&gt;Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English&lt;/i&gt;, London: Longman, 2002, p. 506).  In academic prose it's a little higher, around 8%.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to the home page of what is arguably the most important general science journal in the world, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, picked the second article title from the top of the page ("Cheater resistance is not futile", by Anupama Khare, Lorenzo A.  Santorelli, Joan E. Strassmann, David C. Queller, Adam Kuspa, and Gad Shaulsky, doi:10.1038/nature08472; it just looked somewhat more interesting to me than the first one), and did just a little bit of counting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that the last word of the title (&lt;i&gt;futile&lt;/i&gt;) happens to be an adjective, so that's 20% in the title.  The first word of the opening sentence of the abstract (&lt;i&gt;cooperative&lt;/i&gt;) is also an adjective, and so is the second, and so is the 5th (that's over 15% so far).  Here is the whole of the abstract, with the adjectives underlined (I've been very conservative, not counting many items that traditional grammars classify as adjectives: articles, demonstratives, numerals, other determinatives, genitive pronouns, or nouns functioning as attributive modifiers):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;u&gt;Cooperative&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;social&lt;/u&gt; systems are &lt;u&gt;susceptible&lt;/u&gt; to cheating by individuals that reap the benefits of cooperation without incurring the costs.  There are &lt;u&gt;various&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;theoretical&lt;/u&gt; mechanisms for the repression of cheating and many have been tested experimentally. One possibility that has not been tested rigorously is the evolution of mutations that confer resistance to cheating. Here we show that the presence of a cheater in a population of randomly mutated &lt;u&gt;social&lt;/u&gt; amoebae can select for cheater-resistance. Furthermore, we show that this cheater-resistance can be a &lt;u&gt;noble&lt;/u&gt; strategy because the resister strain does not necessarily exploit &lt;u&gt;other&lt;/u&gt; strains. Thus, the evolution of resisters may be &lt;u&gt;instrumental&lt;/u&gt; in preserving &lt;u&gt;cooperative&lt;/u&gt; behaviour in the face of cheating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's over 9% adjectives.  A bad sample?  I took the first paragraph of the text and did the same:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dictyostelium cells propagate as &lt;u&gt;unicellular&lt;/u&gt; amoebae in the soil. Upon starvation, they aggregate into &lt;u&gt;multicellular&lt;/u&gt; structures and differentiate into &lt;u&gt;viable&lt;/u&gt; spores and &lt;u&gt;dead&lt;/u&gt; stalk cells. Stalk-cell differentiation supports spore maturation and dispersal, but this &lt;u&gt;altruistic&lt;/u&gt; behaviour can be exploited by cheaters that make more than their &lt;u&gt;fair&lt;/u&gt; share of spores in &lt;u&gt;chimaeric&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;fruiting&lt;/u&gt; bodies. The &lt;u&gt;genetic&lt;/u&gt; potential for cheating is &lt;u&gt;high&lt;/u&gt; and cheaters abound in nature, but cheating behaviour can be restrained by &lt;u&gt;various&lt;/u&gt; mechanisms, such as &lt;u&gt;intrinsic&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;lower&lt;/u&gt; fitness of the cheater, pleiotropy of the cheater gene, &lt;u&gt;high&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;genetic&lt;/u&gt; relatedness in &lt;u&gt;natural&lt;/u&gt; populations, and kin discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s 16 adjectives in 97 words of that paragraph, or over 16%.  In total, the title and abstract and opening paragraph of the first scientific paper that I picked — genuinely a random choice — are nearly 13% composed of adjectives, well over double the frequency that you find in most prose.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I could check a few hundred more words, of course.  But wait: why me? Why am I doing the work for her?  What am I, an unpaid assistant curate of St. Bene&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;s? Did the Rev. Tilby do even as much elementary checking as I have done so far — glancing at a couple of hundred words in a random paper — before spouting her ridiculous remark?  Of course not.  Her method is a time-honored one in amateur writing on language: she just &lt;b&gt;makes stuff up&lt;/b&gt;.  On the basis of nothing but prejudice about science, she invented her data and went straight to the microphone with it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her suggestion that in science the adjectives are "precise" is further evidence of uninformed stereotyping.  There's nothing precise about the meanings of words like &lt;i&gt;cooperative&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;social&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;viable&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;altruistic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fair&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;lower&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;high&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;natural&lt;/i&gt;…  These are vague terms, in the classic technical sense: in any situation there will be clear cases for their application, but also a border area where the appropriacy of applying them is in doubt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is of course nothing wrong with vague terms, with denotations partly set through common sense and reference to context; we use them literally every minute that we speak or write.  Their logic and semantics can be studied with ruthless precision (see, for an example of the technical literature, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vagueness-Context-Stewart-Shapiro/dp/0199544786"&gt;Stewart Shapiro's lucid and masterful &lt;i&gt;Vagueness in Context). Science is replete with them, and has to be.  (Think of global warming, for heaven's sake: there's a truly vague concept.  How warm?  How global?  Yet it's an important one, and serious science is being done every day to flesh it out and give it clearer content.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is merely one more sign of the the Rev. Tilby&amp;#39;s contempt for truth, and cluelessness about science, that she thinks science is all precision.  Scientists live their lives floating in a probabilistic soup of uncertainty and unclarity, murky associations and ill-defined tendencies, statistical degrees and extents.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tilby sees herself as a minister of religion and thus a professional talker; and she therefore assumes (the crucial fallacy) that she is an expert on language; so she doesn't need to check a thing. As a vicar, she thinks she can go into the Radio 4 studio and simply invent her facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that she lied; it is worse than that.  Tilby didn't &lt;b&gt;know&lt;/b&gt; what the facts about adjectives in scientific prose were, and state untruths about them to mislead her audience: she simply didn't care whether she was uttering untruths or not.  It wasn't lies; it was &lt;b&gt;bullshit&lt;/b&gt;, in the sense defined by &lt;a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7929.html"&gt;Harry Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;. And as Frankfurt notes, the purveyor of bullshit is worse than a liar, in virtue of caring less about truth. The liar at least keeps track of what's true and recognizes its special status. (That is precisely why it is a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive: the committed liar has to attempt to remain consistent.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

At a conference of science journalists on 1 July he told delegates that lessons had been learned since MMR and repeats the assertion during a debate with Ben Goldacre &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/webcast.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Is he right to be so confident?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, he is praising science journalists and as Ben points out both in this debate and elsewhere, most of the serious scaremongering was not written by specialist science and health journalists but by general reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, less than a week after the conference , we have &lt;a href="http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/psts/view/112286/Doctor-s-MMR-fears"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;. in the Daily Express which continues to stoke fears of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Doctor's MMR Fears"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the first sentence informs us that there are "Fresh fears for the safety of MMR vaccinations". And this is by the Express's Health reporter, Lucy Johnston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have another way of testing Drayson's hypothesis. Over recent months the NHS has rolled out the HPV vaccine. The HP virus causes 70% of cervical cancers. Cervical cancer, despite screening, kills about one thousand women per year, its most famous victim this year was 'reality' star Jade Goody. This vaccine could thus save about 700 women per year. How have the press greeted this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With scare-mongering. As I pointed out &lt;a href="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/the-daily-mails-renewed-assault-on-vaccination/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the Mail &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1160516/Paralysis-epilepsy-blurred-vision-1-300-girls-reaction-cervical-cancer-vaccine.html"&gt;bigged up minor side effects&lt;/a&gt; and referred to the vaccine as the 'promiscuity jab'. The HP virus is sexually transmitted and social conservatives, such as the readers and writers of the Mail, believe that removing the fear of disease and death will encourage teenagers to have sex. There is not a shred of evidence to support this notion and since teenagers have been having illicit sex since time immemorial it is clear that the prospect of disease and death does not discourage them. Teenagers believe that they are immortal and that bad shit happens to other people. As anyone who has a teenager knows, they rarely  think about consequences at all. In other words, if they are contemplating sex then the HPV vaccination status of the girl concerned will not enter ino their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course when Natalie Morton died a few hours after receiving the vaccination they went to town and published a scare-mongering rant which relied heavily on quotes from Jackie Fletcher of JABS. When the post-mortem revealed that Natalie had in fact died of a chest tumour the on-line version of this article was extensively rewritten but the Mail did not formally retract their previous statements or indeed acknowledge their rewriting of history. One is reminded of the scene in &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; where Winston Smith rewrites archives to remove stories that the powers that be find inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, they still quote Richard Halvorsen &lt;a&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; saying that her death calls into question the vaccination program &lt;em&gt;even though her death is not vaccine related&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Express is even worse: in one headline it refers to the "cancer jab horror", see &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2510sx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Martin Robbins refers to this in a &lt;a href="http://badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=12069&amp;amp;start=150#p246853"&gt;twitter exchange with Drayson&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;mjrobbins:Is this what Lord Drayson meant by lessons learned? "PARENTS' REVOLT AFTER GIRL DIES IN CANCER JAB HORROR"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lorddrayson:Frankly? Yes. It says "most unlikely that the HPV vaccine is the cause of death"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today's Sunday Express, Johnston goes one better and &lt;a href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/131817/Jab-as-deadly-as-the-cancer-#"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccination is as deadly as the cancer it is intended to prevent. Really? Deaths that will be prevented by the vaccinr:700 per year. Deaths caused by the vaccine so far:0. Johnston's story is a blatant untruth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drayson seems to think that a reference to the Government/NHS "insisting" that the vaccine is safe makes this story ok. I find this attitude surprisingly naive for any adult, let alone one who has been a businessman and is now a Government Minister. Whenever the tabloids refer to this government "insistance" they never give the reasons for it. When this "insistance" is referred to after references to alleged side-effects of the vaccine, "insists" becomes a very emotionally-loaded term. What it means in this context is "keeps repeating despite our evidence". This is doubtless intentional because it suits these nespapers' real agenda which is to bash the Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest you think that I am exaggerating here, let me remind you of Martin Robbins' &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/507"&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt; that the Irish edition of the Daily Mail is attacking the Irish Government for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; rolling out the HPV vaccine. Clearly they do not believe what they are writing. If they want to knock the Government, that is their choice in a free society. It should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be open to them to achieve this aim by telling lies that, if believed, will kill hundreds of people per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned? Regrettably, I think not.  &lt;/p&gt;

I Don't Think So</title><published>2009-10-04T14:52:08Z</published><updated>2009-10-04T14:52:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/663" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lord Drayson seems convinced that the media has learned the relevent lessons over the MMR debacle. At a conference of science journalists on 1 July he told delegates that lessons had been learned since MMR and repeats the assertion during a debate with Ben Goldacre &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/webcast.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Is he right to be so confident?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, he is praising science journalists and as Ben points out both in this debate and elsewhere, most of the serious scaremongering was not written by specialist science and health journalists but by general reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, less than a week after the conference , we have &lt;a href="http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/112286/Doctor-s-MMR-fears"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; in the Daily Express which continues to stoke fears of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Doctor's MMR Fears"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the first sentence informs us that there are "Fresh fears for the safety of MMR vaccinations". And this is by the Express's Health reporter, Lucy Johnston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have another way of testing Drayson's hypothesis. Over recent months the NHS has rolled out the HPV vaccine. The HP virus causes 70% of cervical cancers. Cervical cancer, despite screening, kills about one thousand women per year, its most famous victim this year was 'reality' star Jade Goody. This vaccine could thus save about 700 women per year. How have the press greeted this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With scare-mongering. As I pointed out &lt;a href="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/the-daily-mails-renewed-assault-on-vaccination/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the Mail &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1160516/Paralysis-epilepsy-blurred-vision-1-300-girls-reaction-cervical-cancer-vaccine.html"&gt;bigged up minor side effects&lt;/a&gt; and referred to the vaccine as the 'promiscuity jab'. The HP virus is sexually transmitted and social conservatives, such as the readers and writers of the Mail, believe that removing the fear of disease and death will encourage teenagers to have sex. There is not a shred of evidence to support this notion and since teenagers have been having illicit sex since time immemorial it is clear that the prospect of disease and death does not discourage them. Teenagers believe that they are immortal and that bad shit happens to other people. As anyone who has a teenager knows, they rarely  think about consequences at all. In other words, if they are contemplating sex then the HPV vaccination status of the girl concerned will not enter ino their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course when Natalie Morton died a few hours after receiving the vaccination they went to town and published a scare-mongering rant which relied heavily on quotes from Jackie Fletcher of JABS. When the post-mortem revealed that Natalie had in fact died of a chest tumour the on-line version of this article was extensively rewritten but the Mail did not formally retract their previous statements or indeed acknowledge their rewriting of history. One is reminded of the scene in &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; where Winston Smith rewrites archives to remove stories that the powers that be find inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, they still quote Richard Halvorsen &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1217057/Dr-Richard-Halvorsen-Im-opposed-jabs-worries.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; saying that her death calls into question the vaccination program &lt;em&gt;even though her death is not vaccine related&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Express is even worse: in one headline it refers to the "cancer jab horror", see &lt;a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/130908"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Martin Robbins refers to this in a &lt;a href="http://badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=12069&amp;amp;start=150#p246853"&gt;twitter exchange with Drayson&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;mjrobbins:Is this what Lord Drayson meant by lessons learned? "PARENTS' REVOLT AFTER GIRL DIES IN CANCER JAB HORROR"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lorddrayson:Frankly? Yes. It says "most unlikely that the HPV vaccine is the cause of death"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today's Sunday Express, Johnston goes one better and &lt;a href="http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/131817/Jab-as-deadly-as-the-cancer-#"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccination is as deadly as the cancer it is intended to prevent. Really? Deaths that will be prevented by the vaccinr:700 per year. Deaths caused by the vaccine so far:0. Johnston's story is a blatant untruth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drayson seems to think that a reference to the Government/NHS "insisting" that the vaccine is safe makes stories such as this ok. I find this attitude surprisingly naive for any adult, let alone one who has been a businessman and is now a Government Minister. Whenever the tabloids refer to this government "insistance" they never give the reasons for it. When this "insistance" is referred to after references to alleged side-effects of the vaccine, "insists" becomes a very emotionally-loaded term. What it means in this context is "keeps repeating despite our evidence". This is doubtless intentional because it suits these nespapers' real agenda which is to bash the Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest you think that I am exaggerating here, let me remind you of Martin Robbins' &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/507"&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt; that the Irish edition of the Daily Mail is attacking the Irish Government for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; rolling out the HPV vaccine. Clearly they do not believe what they are writing. If they want to knock the Government, that is their choice in a free society. It should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be open to them to achieve this aim by telling lies that, if believed, will kill hundreds of people per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned? Regrettably, I think not.  &lt;/p&gt;

Neil Denny and I have been hustling to interview loads of awesome people here, including speakers and attendees. I’ll get some audio of that up on Skepchick soon, and you’ll be able to hear others on The Skeptics’ Guide and Neil’s show, Little Atoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Look, I don't know what else I can say. I didn't endorse Maher; if they'd run this decision by me months ago, I would have said, "Are you nuts?". But of course, I have no clout with the AAI. Dawkins consented to the award initially, because he didn't know much about the full views held by the crackpot; he would certainly have more clout than I do, but this was ultimately a decision by the AAI. I have discussed this with Dawkins one on one; he thinks Maher's views on alt medicine are absolute rubbish, and isn't happy himself...but he does still like the movie and thinks that that deserved an award. I have talked to members of the AAI committee that chose him, and expressed my displeasure without reservation.

&lt;p&gt;We don't think quackery is at all appropriate for atheism. The RDF is all about supporting reason and science, and they think Maher's views on medicine are ridiculous. What more do you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll also add that several people found Maher's personal behavior at the ceremony to be rude and pompous; while he gave a very funny acceptance speech, I got the impression he didn't like us much, either. Giving him the award was, in my opinion, a mistake, and I wish it could be retracted. But notice, please: I'm not the guy who decided to give it to him in the first place, nor do I have any power to take it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this peculiar argument that I'm somehow going soft on altie bullshit: when I told everyone to be civil and non-disruptive on our visit to the Creation "Museum", were you all interpreting that to mean I was going soft on creationism? I wish people would notice that I never advocate violence or actions that might interfere with other people's rights to speak and act (within reason) as they wish. This was more of the same. I was there making the same arguments against the choice of Maher that you are, with the people involved, but I wasn't going to rush the stage and tackle Maher at this event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been the case all along, there is a mixture of reasonable and not quite reasonable in PZ's words. There also seems to be a bit of revisionist history there. For example, the bit about the Creationist Museum strikes me as a wee bit disingenuous. PZ can correct me if I'm wrong, but the reason he wanted everyone to be polite was because he &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_creation_museum_has_given.php"&gt;didn't want to give the museum officials an excuse&lt;/a&gt; to kick anyone out or refuse the group entry to the museum.

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/02/variation-in-dog-coats/"&gt;a previous post on the genetics of dog coat variation&lt;/a&gt;, I stated that ‘dog “breeds” are an incredibly recent invention – less than 200 years’. In the discussion that followed,&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/02/variation-in-dog-coats/#comment-12634"&gt; David Burbidge commented &lt;/a&gt; that this wasn’t quite right. Citing  two 17th century examples (Shakespeare’s Macbeth and the King Charles spaniels) as proof, he wrote: “Major breeds like greyhounds, wolfhounds, mastiffs, and spaniels all go back much further than 200 years, though of course the modern pedigree breeds are not identical to their ancestors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two points here. First, he’s right, of course. There was indeed artificial selection for general dog shape/behaviour, presumably going back even before the 17th century. However, the point being made in the article (and in my post) is that contained in the final part of David’s comment. Pedigree breeds, with strict control of breeding, and the development of so many more kinds of dog breed, beyond the key hunting types, with a few pets thrown in (like the King Charles Spaniel), is indeed extremely recent. Most of the examples of coat variation described in the article have accumulated in less than 200 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, and more intriguing point, relates to what on earth all those dog breeders thought they were doing prior to the 19th century. For evolution by natural selection to occur, you need three conditions: characters need to be variable between individuals, some element of that variability needs to be inherited, and the variability must affect fitness (ultimately expressed in terms of the number of copies of the genes underlying the character that are present in the next generation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those three conditions, any set-up, be it organic life-forms or a computer model, will lead to evolution by natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of the second of these three conditions for evolution – heredity – seems completely obvious to us today. But less than 200 years ago, the concept of “heredity” in biological terms simply did not exist. In the 17th century, the great physician William Harvey tried to work out why some characters seemed to reappear in different generations, others seemed to “skip” a generation, some (like skin colour) appeared to be a mixture of  the parents, while others again (like sex) were either one or the other but never (or very rarely) a mixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he put it: “why should the offspring at one time bear a stronger resemblance to the father, at another to the mother, and, at a third, to progenitors both maternal and paternal, farther removed?” In the end, Harvey simply gave up – it was too complicated for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, this isn’t surprising. Genetics is complicated – there is not, at first sight, a common explanation for skin colour (blending inheritance), eye colour (dominance in most cases) and sex (chromosomal determination – in humans at least). Harvey couldn’t see a pattern because, on the surface, there isn’t one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that although “scientists” like Harvey didn’t get it, there must have been some general folk knowledge that “like breeds like”. Yes and no, is the answer. For example, in the second half of the first century CE, Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella summarized Roman agricultural knowledge in &lt;em&gt;De Re Rustica &lt;/em&gt;(‘On Rural Matters’). Problems associated with animal breeding take up only a few sentences, but Columella did note that, althought most coat colours were a mixture of the parental kinds, the grandsire’s coat colour could reappear in the second generation. What that meant, of course, was completely opaque. In other words, like does not always breed like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Furthermore, until the experiments of Francesco Redi and Jan Swammerdam in the mid-1660s, it was thought that insects and all other “bloodless animals” appeared from decay, rather than from mating between male and female. It took Redi’s careful experimentation, and Swammerdam’s observations, for them to come to the radical conclusion that “all animals come from an egg laid by a female of the same species”.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of the role of the male and the female in producing the offspring remained hugely contentious right up until the 1840s. Aristotle had argued that the male produced a “seed” (= “semen”), which the female nourished. Swammerdam, Steno and others turned this argument on its head and argued that the egg was the origin of all life – including in humans. Within a few years, matters became even more complicated when Antoni Leeuwenhoek observed spermatozoa in human semen. Leeuwenhoek thought that these sperm were the origin of life, and that the egg was simply food. Most people, however, argued they were parasitic worms (hence the name we still use today – “spermatoZOA”, or animal found in semen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the mechanics of what eventually became known as reproduction were finally worked out in the 1840s, in the middle of the 18th century people had begun to suspect that something else was going on. Two parallel sources of information helped gel the idea of heredity. Both involved large data sets – which is when the patterns of heredity start to become really clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transmission of polydactyly – having five or more fingers – in human families was separately studied by two French thinkers, Réaumur and Maupertuis, and they began to suspect that something was passing across the generations. Then, in the middle of the 18th century, Robert Bakwell, an entreprising English sheepfarmer, decided to make a better breed of sheep that would grow quicker and make him more money. By carefully selecting sheep in a very large flock, he soon produced his desired changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ideas were soon applied to the centre of the European wool industry, in Moravia, where local thinkers started to predict what plant hybrids would look like. In 1837, one of the leading intellectuals of the area, Abbot Napp of the Brno monastery, asked “what is inherited and how?” Six years later, he welcomed a new recruit to the monastery – Gregor Mendel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final certainty that there was such a thing as “heredity” came with French thinkers looking at patterns of disease. People knew that some diseases reappeared across the generations. For example, in the seventeenth-century, the philosopher Sir Francis Bacon wrote that: “Long Life, is like some Diseases,a Thing Hereditarie”. By the end of the 18th century, French physicians had become convinced that many human characteristics were “hereditary”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at this stage “heredity” did not exist, either as a concept or as a word. You won’t find the word in the first Edition of &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;, either, although the idea is fundamental for Darwin’s view of evolution. The English word was first used in print by Spencer in 1863, and Darwin used it in his notes at about the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that although Darwin knew there was a “force” of heredity, he did not understand how it worked (any more than Harvey did). Many of his ideas were wrong, and he recognised this was a major weakness in his theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the modern reader, what appears so surprising at first sight is that it took so long for something to be discovered that now appears so obvious. What this history in fact shows is that the facts of heredity are in fact remarkably complicated, and it required  a lot of work by some very smart people over a long period of time to finally work out what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;

I read from Chapter 1, about asteroid and comet impacts, and BABloggee Brandon Alexander recorded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the actual reading I talked about impacts as well as other disasters I cover in the book — including my favorite, gamma-ray bursts. It was a lot of fun, and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-urVr44nRXk"&gt;Brandon posted the video from it as well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;strong&gt;Myrna Cunningham&lt;/strong&gt;, a former church member:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Mothers and their newborns in an Oregon City church that practices faith healing routinely died during or shortly after birth because medical help was not sought…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why wasn’t medical help sought?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because church members were too busy praying for the unborn children to care about getting real help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then those children died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more damning is this excerpt about &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Larry Lewman&lt;/strong&gt;, who works with the state’s medical examiner’s office:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lewman studied the church in the late 1990s when three children died in a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were also during that period –- it wasn’t publicized much -– four perfectly healthy mothers, pregnant, who died during child birth from puerperal sepsis. That’s an infection that doesn’t even occur today,” Lewman said. “You read about it in the textbooks from the 1910s –- the pre-antibiotic era. &lt;strong&gt;None of these women should have died — three of their children died. It was all perfectly treatable, and they literally suffered for days.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all preventable by seeking proper medical help.  But children are dying because of irresponsible parents who thinking prayers and anointment with oil are more important than, well, science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/clackamascounty/index.ssf/2009/09/followers_of_christ_parents_fa.html"&gt;Oregon City sounds familiar&lt;/a&gt;, it’s because it’s the home of &lt;strong&gt;Raylene&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Carl Brent Worthington&lt;/strong&gt;.  Their &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/24/ava-worthingtons-parents-found-not-guilty-of-manslaughter/"&gt;daughter Ava died&lt;/a&gt; because of their negligence.  Both parents were found not guilty of second-degree manslaughter, though the father was convicted of “criminal mistreatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe these incidents will get potential jurors to take faith-healings more seriously.  Of course all these parents and church-members mentioned want what’s best for the child.  But as the saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Their intentions hurt the child and what they actively avoid — medical help — is what’s best for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro-life Christians who bend over backwards for the rights of the unborn should be up in arms over all of this.  Where are their statements condemning these parents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Jaysen&lt;/strong&gt; says something I haven’t been able to verify yet, but it only makes the church look worse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
News from a few folks who used to attend the church and some who have family in the church spoke out about &lt;strong&gt;the church requiring all members to give $5k to help the Worthington’s legal defense. Those who could not pay were to take out personal loans, and those who didn’t were shunned from the church.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting out of that church doesn’t sound like a bad option at all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img title="More generally, with great power comes great dEnergy/dt." src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/XkcdOhm.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the case of &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;, the original ordinary-language meaning is still dominant for most people, especially in a frame like "With great __ comes great __".  But it's easy to forget how recently words (and concepts) like &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005413.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;speed, distance,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;duration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; took on their current "literal" meanings as aspects of ordinary-language physics rather than as terms referring to prosperity, dissension, endurance, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physicists' sense of &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; as "work per unit time" seems to date from the early 19th century, and the specifically electrical sense, featured in this strip's caption, is somewhat later. But it was only a century or two earlier that today's meanings for words like &lt;em&gt;distance&lt;/em&gt; came into general use, replacing earlier meanings that (like &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;) had more to do with personal struggle than with physical interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254650503523"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/10/dear-bruce-springsteen-about-that-benefit-concert-for-autism-speaks.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/858259caab227db7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="autism"/><title type="html">Dear Bruce Springsteen, About That Benefit Concert for Autism Speaks</title><published>2009-10-04T09:28:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-04T09:28:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/10/dear-bruce-springsteen-about-that-benefit-concert-for-autism-speaks.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Evidently Bruce Springsteen will appear at a&lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/seinfeld_springsteen_concert.php"&gt; benefit concert&lt;/a&gt; for Autism Speaks on November 19th, 2009.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that Autism Speaks.  The one that has no persons with autism on its board.  The one that released a &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/09/i-am-autism-awareness-video-by-alfonso-cuar%C3%B3n-ransom-reprise.html"&gt;fundraising and &amp;quot;awareness video&amp;quot; that appalled many. &lt;/a&gt; The one that still thinks that there &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be a connection between autism and vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ari Ne&amp;#39;eman,the president of  The Autistic Self Advocacy Network
(ASAN --&lt;a href="http://www.autisticadvocacy.org"&gt; http://www.autisticadvocacy.org&lt;/a&gt;) posted this message at  &lt;a href="http://www.wrongplanet.net/"&gt;Wrong Planet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt108186.html"&gt;Tell Bruce Springsteen Autism Speaks Doesn't Speak For Us!

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are encouraging people to act immediately by joining ASAN in writing singer Bruce Springsteen, scheduled to participate in an Autism Speaks fundraiser in November, to end his newfound association with this organization that devalues our lives and speaks about us without us. You can contact Springsteen's publicist at mlaverty@shorefire.com or by phone at 718-552-7171. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At &lt;a href="http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/09/for-you.html"&gt;AspergerSquare8&lt;/a&gt;,  Bev has a moving, open letter to Bruce Springsteen -- how his music spoke for her, when words failed her, and how she sees Autism Speaks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a group claimed your voice, but allowed you no say. They used your name to spread propaganda, and this propaganda made your life harder, all the while they claimed to exist for your benefit. This is the truth about Autism Speaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Joe at Club166, the father of a child with autism, &lt;a href="http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/09/dear-mr-springsteen.html"&gt;also posted a letter to Mr. Springsteen.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bob Williams, former Commissioner of The Administration on Developmental Disabilities, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, wrote a letter to Springsteen, part of which was published with permission at Rethinking Autism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	
	I am writing to strongly urge you not to perform at the Autism Speaks benefit concert in November and ask that you withdraw your offer to do so in protest over its horrendous video, “I Am Autism”.  Watching it left me and others physically ill and deeply outraged much as a hard core porn video or one filled with racial, homophobic or other bigoted images and tirades would do.  Under the supposed guise of promotion a cure of all conditions along the Autism Spectrum, the video strips children and adults on the spectrum naked of their humanity – sowing the worst of stereotypes, fears and low expectations.  The message it senselessly projects is one of complete dread and utter disdain – not just of the disability but of those with it as well.

And yesterday was the first day of &lt;em&gt;TAM London 2009&lt;/em&gt;, the first TAM to be held outside the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were many highlights from a day when every single speaker and act was in very top form. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Brian Cox&lt;/strong&gt; described the importance of &lt;em&gt;curiosity-based science&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me, as a still-partly-cynical-ex-Tory, this curiosity-based science could mean a cunning way of diverting scarce money from taxpayers to inconsequential academic hobbyists. But Professor Cox took this argument face on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he did so in a most effective way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He started with an actual example of woeful management-speak, a ghastly powerpoint presentation of some science funding body, where the "Wow factor" was listed on some depressing slide as an afterthought bulletpoint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He then contrasted that slide with remarkable photographs of the Earth from Space, and - from Hubble - of Space from Earth: all of which prompt a Wow factor that a mere bulletpoint could never achieve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Cox then matched this wonder with a quote from (the indeed arch-conservative) TS Eliot:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;We shall not cease from exploration&lt;br&gt;And the end of all our exploring&lt;br&gt;Will be to arrive where we started&lt;br&gt;And know the place for the first time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To understand &lt;em&gt;as well as we can &lt;/em&gt;our place in the universe is a great and intellectually-liberating aim. As I watched, I could almost feel remnants of my naysaying Toryism falling away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course there is the issue of how we organise our scarce resources, where other priorities can be more immediate, but the point that there should be publicly-funded curiosity-based science is compelling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I may well have been a conference hall full of skeptics, but I don't think I have ever felt less cynical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This emphasis on being constructive was shared, but in a markedly different way, by another speaker, the journalist and campaigner &lt;strong&gt;Ariane Sherine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is a heroine of mine, for converting a couple of newspaper columns in to the entire Atheist Bus Campaign. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This campaign was a moment when atheism ceased to be intellectual honesty that dare not speak its name, and in a breezy and cheerful way became part of the nation's general conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atheism, of course, is not exactly the same as skepticism. A skeptic must, one supposes, admit the possibility of any truth, however bizarre, even the possibility of a god.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Atheist Bus Campaign sought to make people reconsider their views on this ultimate question, by showing there is another and life-enhancing side to the debate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/SshteIMIWKI/AAAAAAAAAM0/0n7kkowZ-54/s1600-h/IMG_1359.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:386px;height:400px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/SshteIMIWKI/AAAAAAAAAM0/0n7kkowZ-54/s400/IMG_1359.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The greatest highlight for me was &lt;strong&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/strong&gt; being presented with the &lt;em&gt;James Randi Award for Outstanding Contribution to Skepticism, UK&lt;/em&gt;, mainly for his defence in the current libel case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In someways, it was a strange award for skeptics to give: for so far Simon has lost a preliminary hearing in the High Court, and it really isn't very difficult to be the losing party in any litigation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyone can do that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Simon has used the misconceived libel case brought by the now discredited British Chiropractic Association to force major debates on two extremely important topics: the actual evidence bases for alternative medicine, and the repressive effect of English libel law on the public's access to critical information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To take a difficult legal case and to use it to generate not one but two public debates is a simply astonishing achievement. And to do so by standing firm, and by not being intimidated by the costs and demands of fighting an English libel case, and to keep smiling, is to make this achievement also a moral example of the very first order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Simon used his acceptance speech to make the happy announcement that he was to become a father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If it is a boy, I have suggested &lt;em&gt;David&lt;/em&gt; as a name, as it may just impress Sir David Eady, and so could well be Simon's best chance.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, TAM London demostrated that skepticism and critical thinking can be engaging, inspiring, and deeply practical. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In different ways, Brian Cox, Ariane Sherine, and Simon Singh, as well as all the other speakers and acts at TAM, were explaining and showing the value of pure inquiry and the search for evidence, and the value of contributing to and indeed creating debates where there can otherwise be easy and dangerous certainties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was indeed an amazing meeting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-1181495727127009919?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254642587170"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=4392">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/efa320a3da1c36a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="Scams"/><category term="Derren Brown"/><category term="Kat Akingbade"/><category term="psychic"/><category term="supernatural"/><title type="html">Science of Scams</title><published>2009-10-04T07:13:42Z</published><updated>2009-10-04T07:13:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/04/science-of-scams/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kat Akingbade and Derren Brown have united to bring you this new webseries called &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/scienceofscamsc4"&gt;Science of Scams:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PZ Myers also strongly disagrees with Maher’s stance on medicine &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/put_maher_in_the_hot_seat.php"&gt;but did previously defend the decision&lt;/a&gt;. Now Myers, who attended the convention, reported on the proceedings with regard to this particular issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news for all the critics of this choice is that Dawkins pulled no punches. In his introduction, he praised &lt;em&gt;Religulous&lt;/em&gt; and thanked Maher for his contributions to freethought, but he also very clearly and unambiguously stated that some of his beliefs about medicine were simply crazy. He did a good job of walking a difficult tightrope; he made it clear that the award was granted for some specific worthy matters, his humorous approach to religion, while carefully dissociating the AAI from any endorsement of crackpot medicine. It won’t be enough, I know, but the effort was made, and talking to Dawkins afterwards there was no question but that Maher’s quackery was highly objectionable. I also got the impression that he felt the critics of the award were making good and reasonable points, and that he felt the awkwardness of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that it is at least comforting to know that when Myers talked to his friend afterwards, Dawkins did express his strong disapproval of Maher’s medical position and agreed that critics of the decision had reasonable points. It’s also good to know he  did publicly comment on the controversy and make reference to his disagreement on these issues to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/final-thoughts-on-the-bill-maher-controversy/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/3WIhdCtY2hE/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, PZ Myers is right that it’s not quite enough.&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/a_report_from_the_field.php"&gt; Orac is less generous here than myself at this point&lt;/a&gt;, but I too still feel that it was indeed a bad call to put the atheist message above the rational and scientific one on this occasion. I think Orac makes an excellent point here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, this whole fiasco is pretty strong evidence that, if atheism and science come into conflict (unless, of course, that science happens to be the science of evolution, in which case I highly doubt that this controversy would have been so flippantly dismissed), for Richard Dawkins atheism wins hands down, and science-based medicine once again remains the poor, neglected stepchild of the so-called “reality-based” community. Atheism is clearly what’s more important to Dawkins now. As long as he bashes religion, Maher’s a-OK with him and only gets a brief remonstration for his promotion of quackery and anti-vaccine views. I’m the other way around. Quite frankly, I no longer care much about atheism; science and reason are my passion, which is why this fiasco got me so worked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m still a proud, card-carrying, banner-waving atheist, I can sympathize with Orac’s position. If Maher was as critical of evolutionary biologists as he was of the medical community, he would not be receiving this award. He wouldn’t because evolution is so much a part of the identity of the modern atheist “movement.” It seems almost like we’re falling into the trap Sam Harris (who incidentally still has no Richard Dawkins Award) warned us about by choosing to identify ourselves as “atheists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, what are we going to value more, creating converts or promoting science and reason? I think science and reason is the higher goal and that an atheist worldview naturally stems from that. But at the end of the day, I don’t really care whether an individual believes in a god or not just like I don’t really care if an individual believes in the Lock Ness Monster or not. What I care about is that they think critically, reject faith as a justification for poor beliefs, and avoid dogma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I enjoyed Maher’s film and much of his comedy, I don’t see him as a person who embodies those values, values which I think the atheist “community” should be honoring over ticket sales. And I certainly don’t see him as the person who best embodied those values in the past year. Past recipients of the award included James Randi, Ann Druyan, and Daniel Dennett, luminaries who each clearly embody those values and are able to put those values before their own political agendas. Sam Harris too embodies those values. As does Christopher Hitchens, PZ Myers, Michael Shermer, and many more who make far better choices, in my opinion, as recipients of the award than the star of Religulous. The former show they care more about seeking truth than being right whereas Maher more often than not goes the more Bill O’Reilly route of shouting out his beliefs and simply demanding everyone agree with them, lest they be called an idiot or a pinhead. He’s a loose canon that sometimes will point in the direction of the enemies of reason but may just as often be pointing at us. And I am beginning to wonder if Maher’s atheism stems less from rationalism than from his mere interest in being contrarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm at &lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org/"&gt;The Amazing Meeting London&lt;/a&gt;, an Old World instance of the skeptical conferences organised by the James Randi Educational Foundation. (Or more correctly, I am waiting for breakfast at my threadbare Bayswater hotel, where I sleep in a basement closet.) I came to London Friday night and started off with a few social hours with other Swedish skeptics at a pub. Yesterday was the first of two conference days, and I've been making acquaintances left and right. Apart from the locals, I've met a lot of Norwegians and Americans. Among the locals, these days, is Rebecca Watson. She promised me to get a decent broadband connection ASAP so the &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Skeptic's Guide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can go on undiminished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had excellent talks by Manchester physicist and UK TV celeb &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_%28physicist%29"&gt;Brian Cox&lt;/a&gt;, writer and film-maker &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Ronson"&gt;John Ronson&lt;/a&gt; (Of &lt;i&gt;Men Who Stare at Goats&lt;/i&gt; fame), science journalist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;, atheist bus campaign organiser &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_Sherine"&gt;Ariane Sherine&lt;/a&gt; and science writer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goldacre"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt;. James Randi, who had to stay home in Florida for medical reasons, fielded questions via Skype, psychologist Richard Wiseman emceed and did parlour tricks, and Simon Singh got the first UK JREF Award for his valiant fight against the frivolous chiropractic libel suit. Randi announced that the Million Dollar Challenge is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; getting closed down after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such luminaries presenting, I'm sort of relieved that there wasn't room for me on the roster. Though I could probably have put something reasonably good together about "Palaeolithic" diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we have &lt;a href="http://www.geologicrecords.net/"&gt;George Hrab&lt;/a&gt;, Glenn Hill, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Savage"&gt;Adam Savage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Minchin"&gt;Tim Minchin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Plait"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt; on.

Television viewers in the UK (&lt;i&gt;and perhaps most readers of this blog?&lt;/i&gt;) have been fortunate these past few weeks, since the BBC began airing the new documentary series &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/"&gt;"Last Chance to See"&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href="http://stephenfry.com"&gt;Stephen Fry&lt;/a&gt; joined zoologist &lt;a href="http://www.markcarwardine.com/"&gt;Mark Carwardine&lt;/a&gt; in retracing a journey the latter shared with the late &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams"&gt;Douglas Adams&lt;/a&gt; when they went around the world looking for species literally on the brink of extinction! Adams and Carwardine then wrote &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Chance-See-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345371984/?tag=reconciecolog-20"&gt;one of my favorite books about nature and wildlife conservation&lt;/a&gt;, full of delightful stories of strange animal behaviors and wry observations on the business of conservation in different parts of the world. Among the latter, my favorite was probably when they compared the govt. bureaucracies of post-colonial nations to headless chickens that continue to thrash around pointlessly even after being decapitated! Nevertheless, this snippet (and others like it on Youtube which is all that's available to those of us outside the UK)  from the new series suggests that 2 decades on since the original journey, some of these wonderful creatures are still hanging on, i.e., Carwardine did get more chances to see them. I hope our future generations do as well! And I hope we get to see this series on television in our part of the world soon also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we won't see ever again, unfortunately, is the like of Douglas Adams, who considered &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Chance-See-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345371984/?tag=reconciecolog-20"&gt;Last Chance to See&lt;/a&gt; as his own favorite book, even though it was something of a "runt of the litter" not selling quite as many copies as his other bestsellers! Here he is speaking about his experience writing the book, and about the oddities of animal behavior and evolution, in one of his last lectures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the similarity of HOX genes in so many animal phyla is actually a problem for neo-Darwinism: If evolutionary changes in body plans are due to changes in genes, and flies have HOX genes similar to those in a horse, why is a fly not a horse?&lt;/p&gt;

Television viewers in the UK (&lt;i&gt;and perhaps most readers of this blog?&lt;/i&gt;) have been fortunate these past few weeks, since the BBC began airing the new documentary series &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/"&gt;"Last Chance to See"&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href="http://stephenfry.com"&gt;Stephen Fry&lt;/a&gt; joined zoologist &lt;a href="http://www.markcarwardine.com/"&gt;Mark Carwardine&lt;/a&gt; in retracing a journey the latter shared with the late &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams"&gt;Douglas Adams&lt;/a&gt; when they went around the world looking for species literally on the brink of extinction! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adams and Carwardine then wrote &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Chance-See-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345371984/?tag=reconciecolog-20"&gt;one of my favorite books about nature and wildlife conservation&lt;/a&gt;, full of delightful stories of strange animal behaviors and wry observations on the business of conservation in different parts of the world. Among the latter, my favorite was probably when they compared the govt. bureaucracies of post-colonial nations to headless chickens that continue to thrash around pointlessly even after being decapitated! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this snippet (and others like it on Youtube which is all that's available to those of us outside the UK)  from the new series suggests that 2 decades on since the original journey, some of these wonderful creatures are still hanging on, i.e., Carwardine did get more chances to see them. I hope our future generations do as well! And I hope we get to see this series on television in our part of the world soon also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we won't see ever again, unfortunately, is the like of Douglas Adams, who considered &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Chance-See-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345371984/?tag=reconciecolog-20"&gt;Last Chance to See&lt;/a&gt; as his own favorite book, even though it was something of a "runt of the litter" not selling quite as many copies as his other bestsellers! Here he is speaking about his experience writing the book, and about the oddities of animal behavior and evolution, in one of his last lectures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to discover a bottle of OriginAle: Darwinian IPA and an imperial stout, Gudeløs, waiting for me when I checked in. The Danish contingent wants me to come out to their big meeting in June in Copenhagen…I am so there. Bribes were completely redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RDF is also giving the speakers bottles of merlot, nicely personalized with etching. Now I have to decide whether to drink it or save it…ah, I think I&amp;#39;ll drink it and save the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the non-drinkable category (really!

I spent the morning in heaven, which consists of a well-lit white screen in Southern California, trying to master my lines for a future Mr Deity episode. That stuff is harder than it looks. We went through many takes while my brain was freezing up at inopportune moments — there&amp;#39;s a reason not everyone is a movie star, that&amp;#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, "Lucy" and "Mr Deity" are actually Amy and Bryan, and they have a nice house with a couple of kids, two dogs, and a cat, and the episodes are filmed in the family room. I hope I haven't shattered any of your illusions. Amy made me pancakes, I think because she's very nice, but it might also have been to load up the klutzy professor's sputtering brain with carbohydrates so that &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt; he'd remember his lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it through it all, though, and I'm hoping that Mr Deity will be able to work a miracle and make me look good with some creative editing. You'll probably see the results next week. It can't possibly be worse than &lt;a href="http://expelledexposed.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, he mentioned that they&amp;#39;re hoping to build up the budget to make a half-hour pilot, which would be awesome — Mr Deity as weekly dose of broadcast irreverence for American living rooms would be an excellent and entertaining corrective. &lt;a href="http://www.mrdeity.com/"&gt;Support them&lt;/a&gt; if you can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver says Alex is constantly getting up while the bus is in motion and refuses to behave during transport. One part of us finds this hard to believe: Though Alex is certainly capable of disruptive behavior (our family holiday dinners being People’s Exhibit A), he is and always has been a model traveller. Never a whisper of a complaint from any bus company (never a whisper of a compaint from the airline whose planes he once travelled on, either). One part of me, however, believes he’s getting older and more willful, and I can well believe he might be getting up, which is of course unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to sit down on the bus!” we’ve barked and written in very dark ink (he responds well lately to written instructions). I wonder if the matron isn’t too quiet and perhaps more used to younger special needs kids. We’ve asked the school to confab with the bus crew.

&lt;p&gt;In Buffalo, N.Y., the Women &amp;amp; Children’s Hospital has announced the opening of an autism center — the &lt;a href="http://www.wchob.org/news/news_display.asp?artID=1873"&gt;Autism Spectrum Disorder Center of Excellence&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership with the University at Buffalo and the Children’s Guild Foundation — to provide quicker diagnosis and treatment. The center was established with a $585,000 grant over three years from the foundation. At an initial visit, each child will be seen by a developmental pediatrician, child neurologist and child psychologist, and the team will discuss the need for further testing, services and care. Start-up of the center is projected to cost $1.08 million. Other components of the program will include coordination of care, as well as collaboration with research projects and community groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state’s attorney general is siding with the family that’s suing their southwestern Illinois school district in hopes of allowing their autistic son to bring his service dog to school. Papers filed with the 5th District Appellate Court support the local family that claims that state law entitles their 5-year-old son to bring a service dog to their home school district. A county judge entered a preliminary injunction in late summer to let the boy bring his dog into his elementary school, an action the district says would harm at least one other student who’s allergic to animals.

I'm curious about that, seriously, because after reading their &lt;a href="http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1686"&gt;"review"&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;The Invention of Lying&lt;/i&gt;, it's difficult to imagine a group of more paranoid idiots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, in the movie, there's no religion - no lying equals no one inventing an invisible man in the sky to explain stuff - and when the main character makes up what is essentially "Heaven" to comfort another person, it implies that all religions are made up "lies".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because the writers are from what Bill Donohue and the reviewer would call "Christian" countries, the "lies" reflect those belief systems.  Wow.  Call &lt;a href="http://www.deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/klugman.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quincy M.D.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but don't be blowin' up any ballons, 'cause I'm going to die of not-surprise.  How would a crazy, paranoid group of Catholics react to this sort of humour, Sam?  Well, like this:&lt;blockquote&gt;...because this anti-religion—make that anti-Christian—film is laced with some romance and humor, the message it sends is all the more sinister.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The review of the film is by Jeff Field, policy analyst and editor of the Catholic League’s monthly journal, &lt;i&gt;Catalyst&lt;/i&gt;.  It's a lame, "they're picking on us &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;" whine.  Field complains about the, &lt;i&gt;"in-your-face assault(s) that Hollywood often serves up"&lt;/i&gt;, but that this movie is worse because it is *gasp* pernicious.  It &lt;i&gt;pretends&lt;/i&gt; to be a sweet story, but underneath lies an evil atheist agenda to mock religion, convert the faithful, have orgies, do drugs, overthrow the New World Order and take OVER THE PLANET!!.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, so that's not our &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; agenda.  There's a lot more sex and a little less overthrowing, but still.  Do you think that if the Catholic League had a smidge more...what's that word?  ...Faith.  That's it.  If they had a bit more faith in their message and religion, they wouldn't have to be upset about every time people poke them with a stick and laugh.  It's not like there's a shortage of films showing a "godless" person who regains their faith at the end, as though that were some sort of virtue.  Lame Christian films aren't, however, mainstream - because they're sentimental pappy crap.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So you Christians suck at two things - thinking, and making movies.  If you're going to focus on one, try the former.  Please.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

&lt;p&gt;For example, look at this recent article – which is, refreshingly, a good example of critical thinking in the modern media – concerning the question of polling public opinion on health care reform…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20090928/pl_politico/27640"&gt;Health care polls leave pols dizzy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legislators hoping to learn what their constituents think about the issue — and how to vote to keep them happy — face a dizzying deluge of hard-to-reconcile data, some of which suggests that voters are more than a little confused, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to make of it, for example, when one poll finds that 63 percent think “death panels” are a “distortion” or “scare tactic,” and only 30 percent think the issue is “legitimate,” while another finds that 41 percent believe that people would die because “&lt;a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/politico/pl_politico/storytext/27640/33543100/SIG=11m47po6k/*http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/27549.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;government panels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” would prevent them from getting the treatment they needed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or when one survey finds that 55 percent of Americans support the public option, while another says 79 percent favor one — but also notes that only 37 percent people surveyed actually knew what “public option” meant?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because there is such ambiguity in these polls, those with an agenda can usually &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Cherry-Picking"&gt;cherry-pick&lt;/a&gt; whatever data they want to make a case for their particular argument.  Even changing the wording of a particular question just slightly can have a huge impact…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surveys are seemingly so sensitive that sometimes one word can spark charges of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Speaker &lt;a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/politico/pl_politico/storytext/27640/33543100/SIG=11o3h243h/*http://topics.politico.com/index.cfm/topic/nancypelosi"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nancy Pelosi’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; office recently griped about an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that asked whether Americans favor a public option that would compete with &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;private insurance companies&lt;/span&gt;, rather than asking how important they felt it was to have the “choice” between a public option and private insurance, as they had before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wording tweak left the impression that support for the public option had dropped from 76 percent to 43 percent since June, critics argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have complained about a New York Times/CBS News poll that used a word with positive associations — “Medicare” — to describe the public option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an ABC News summary of the results of eight polls from late July through mid-August on “the public option” found that support for a public option ranged from 43 percent to 66 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those on one side of the issue will scream about how support for a public option in health care reform is plummeting, while those on the opposite side will holler that support for a public option is stronger than ever.  And with such manipulation, who the hell knows what to think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best thing to do is understand what it is that you believe, and then to advocate for your beliefs.  And when you are confronted by polling data, of any kind, you should ask yourselves the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Why is the poll being conducted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Who is conducting the poll?  Do they have an agenda?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Who is being polled? Is it a representative, randomize sample, or is it biased in some way?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. How is the poll conducted?  Is the wording of the questions meant to bias the results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Is the result of the poll consistent with other reliable polls?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="joel best book" src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QP03R37YL.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="475"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me take this opportunity to suggest that you read a wonderful book on this topic: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Damned-Lies-Statistics-Untangling-Politicians/dp/0520219783"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Damned Lies &amp;amp; Statistics&lt;/em&gt; by Joel Best.&lt;/a&gt; It is an amazing book which very clearly outlines how various groups – politicians, media outlets, interest groups, corporations, etc – use polling &amp;amp; statistics in an attempt to manipulate public opinion and further their own agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best expression of skepticism about polls was summed up by magician skeptics &lt;a href="http://pennandteller.com"&gt;Penn &amp;amp; Teller&lt;/a&gt; on their show &lt;em&gt;Bullshit&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/why-so-much-of-polling-is-b-s-fk-you-frank/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/If9EWDB_zK4/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, let me just say… F**k You, Frank!  &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The mirror box technique in which the subject has the experience of viewing their right hand, while in fact seeing their left hand reflected in a mirror.Sight modifies somatosensation, by either enhancing or diminishing the subjective intensity of touch (Kennett et al., 2001) and pain (Ramachandran &amp;amp; Altschuler, 2009), respectively. These phenomena provide fascinating and lesser studied examples of crossmodal integration, or how signals from one sensory modality are combined with those of another to produce a unified percept. In an elegant series of experiments by Longo and colleagues, subjects who could see their own hand (either in a mirror or the real thing) reported less pain when exposed to the heat of a laser.Laser ‘Pain Beam’ under development by the U.S. military. NOT used in the &amp;quot;elegant&amp;quot; laser evoked potential experiments.Furthermore, an electrophysiological marker of pain was attenuated. This was measured from the EEG, time-locked to the application of the painful laser heat. These stimuli elicit a specific type of EEG response, called laser evoked potentials (LEPs). A sequence of three LEPs is generated in rapid succession, within the first 400 milliseconds after laser stimulation. These responses are called the N1, N2 and P2 potentials. As described in a review by Plaghki and Mouraux (2005),Laser heat stimulators selectively activate Aδ and C-nociceptors [&amp;quot;pain receptors&amp;quot;] in the superficial layers of the skin. Their high power output produces steep heating ramps, which improve synchronization of afferent volleys and therefore allow the recording of time-locked events, such as laser-evoked brain potentials. Study of the electrical brain activity evoked by Aδ- and C-nociceptor afferent volleys revealed the existence of an extensive, sequentially activated, cortical network. These electrophysiological responses are modulated by stimulus-driven and, even more extensively, top-down processes.These top-down processes include things like attention, expectation, and perhaps input from other sensory modalities. One advantage of LEPs is that you can determine exactly when in the pain processing stream these influences are active. Of greatest interest in this context is the N2-P2 complex, recorded at 195 milliseconds and 375 milliseconds after stimulation.Fig. 5 (Longo et al., 2009). Grand mean LEPs recorded from electrode Cz in the three experiments and N2/P2 peak-to-peak amplitudes at Cz (bottom right). Error bars are 1 SEM.The results demonstrated a cool new form of visually induced analgesia:Looking at one&amp;#39;s hand produced significant reductions of subjective intensity and unpleasantness of laser pain and in the amplitude of the N2/P2 complex.... These effects were observed both when the illusion of looking directly at the hand was induced with a mirror box (Exps. 1 and 3) and when participants viewed their hand directly during stimulation (Exp. 2). The reduction was specific to seeing one&amp;#39;s own hand (Exp. 3). What is the mechanism of action for these effects? First it&amp;#39;s useful to know where in the brain the N2-P2 signals arise, because you can&amp;#39;t tell from EEG alone. Plaghki and Mouraux review evidence from dipole models and invasive recordings, which haveconsistently revealed the activation of an extensive bilateral cortical network, comprising the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), the insular cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex.It is noteworthy that the N1 response prior to the N2-P2 complex (not discussed here) is insensitive to the attentional and cognitive manipulations that affect the latter.But how does visual input influence pain processing in the insula and anterior cingulate? How does this crossmodal inhibition occur? This is tricky, because any coherent explanation would have to account for visual enhancement of touch perception. Longo and colleagues speculate that inhibitory GABA-containing neurons might be responsible:Could a common mechanism produce such divergent effects on touch and pain? One possibility would be a visually induced crossmodal activation of GABAergic interneurons. Injection of GABA antagonists increases the size of SI tactile receptive fields, suggesting that GABAergic interneurons function to sharpen tactile receptive fields, increasing tactile acuity. Conversely, GABA agonists are effective treatments for chronic central pain, suggesting that reduced GABAergic inhibition may be a major cause of chronic pain...Both the present results showing analgesic effects of seeing the body and previous findings showing tactile enhancement (Kennett et al., 2001) could therefore be explained by visual modulation of somatosensory GABAergic interneurons. This speculation is supported by multisensory influences on cortical inhibition in other physiological systems. For example, viewing a hand extends the TMS-evoked silent period compared with viewing a fixation cross.A related phenomenon was described by Mo Costandi in Distorting the body image affects perception of pain. Here, chronic pain patients viewed either magnified or &amp;quot;minified&amp;quot; versions of their affected arm while carrying out standarized motions. Subjective pain ratings were reported to be magnified or minified accordingly.Finally, looking at images other than of one&amp;#39;s own body can affect the perception of pain as well. For instance, viewing aesthically pleasing art during the application of laser heat stimuli reduced pain ratings and LEP amplitudes (de Tommaso et al., 2008), as covered by The Neurocritic in Pain &amp;amp; Paintings: Beholding Beauty Reduces Pain Perception and Laser Evoked Potentials.In conclusion, Longo et al. note their results have possible implications for non-pharmacological treatments for pain:First, the present results show an analgesic effect of vision of the body for acute, rather than chronic, pain. Second, several authors have suggested that mirror therapy may operate by promoting plastic reorganization within somatosensory map or by correcting a distorted body image through visual recalibration of propriocepti...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of U.S. high-school seniors surveyed recently thought Sodom and Gomorrah were a married couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty predictable consequence of the widespread failure to make &lt;a href="http://yrif.org/book/"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; required reading for all schoolchildren everywhere.  Nonetheless, it’s quite worrisome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids who think Sodom and Gomorrah were a married couple (not to mention the countless others who guessed “former WWE Tag Team Champions” and “tabletop strategy game” and “once-popular folk duo”) are surely unequipped to compete in today’s high-tech modern world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will they be responsible citizens if they’re not familiar with the story of how god destroyed both cities on account of their residents’ rampant &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah#Controversy"&gt;homoerotic behavior&lt;/a&gt;?  Can we trust them to figure out for themselves that a righteous man &lt;a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/19-8.htm"&gt;offers up his virgin daughters&lt;/a&gt; when he needs to placate an angry mob?  Will we fall economically farther behind Middle-Eastern countries where schools prepare kids with the knowledge that when god (or &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiOqHLVxZvA"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;) says “&lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2019:17-26&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;Don’t Look Back&lt;/a&gt;,” then if you don’t want to be turned into a pillar of salt you’d better listen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just me.  Professors of “Divinity” are also concerned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Divinity Professor Moore] identified a wide range of problems caused by a lack of religious understanding, including anti-Semitism and the equation of Islam with violence and terrorism. She said it also leads to the portrayal of religion as “obsolete, irrational and oppressive.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if the story of Sodom and Gomorrah doesn’t make people think of religion as &lt;i&gt;relevant&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;rational&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;congenial&lt;/i&gt;, then I don’t know what can!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254611129165"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=4568">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2ace77884cb430ab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="scams"/><category term="skepticism"/><category term="superstitions"/><title type="html">The Big Secret</title><published>2009-10-03T22:35:57Z</published><updated>2009-10-03T22:35:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/10/03/banana-readings-mmmmm/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title="CEMCAGEORJTCA3TTBG9CANTILKKCA1H8YVPCA2JKU0ICA8UF3Y0CAWRGMN9CAWFHPXRCABIVU0ICAN4KZGPCAQGC38MCAQCFGFFCAL2BE42CA6423BJCAFC1CIMCAHV7XGYCA6P2MOGCA23S0CNCA1680FY" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/CEMCAGEORJTCA3TTBG9CANTILKKCA1H8YVPCA2JKU0ICA8UF3Y0CAWRGMN9CAWFHPXRCABIVU0ICAN4KZGPCAQGC38MCAQCFGFFCAL2BE42CA6423BJCAFC1CIMCAHV7XGYCA6P2MOGCA23S0CNCA1680FY2.jpg" alt="CEMCAGEORJTCA3TTBG9CANTILKKCA1H8YVPCA2JKU0ICA8UF3Y0CAWRGMN9CAWFHPXRCABIVU0ICAN4KZGPCAQGC38MCAQCFGFFCAL2BE42CA6423BJCAFC1CIMCAHV7XGYCA6P2MOGCA23S0CNCA1680FY" width="178" height="150"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical banana&lt;br&gt;
Is gonna be a sudden craze&lt;br&gt;
Electrical banana&lt;br&gt;
Is bound to be &lt;em&gt;the very next phase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                  -Donovan,  &lt;em&gt;“Mellow Yellow”&lt;/em&gt; (1967)&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Yeah baby! Donovan was right! Guess what? &lt;em&gt;It’s possible to do an accurate psychic reading with any object imaginable just as long as you have a system that has become memorized and a mildly pleasing disposition to go with it.&lt;/em&gt; This concept in the delivery of so-called psychic readings is what I call &lt;strong&gt;“The Big Secret.”&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. And it’s the dirty little secret no self serving psychic wants you to know.So there it is: The Cat is out of the bag. More can be read about this concept and how to apply it in my book,&lt;em&gt; “Hand Springs,” b&lt;/em&gt;ut here’s a lenghty excerpt from that book. It’s an awesome concept. In fact, it’s not only totally awesome, it’s a totally &lt;em&gt;wholesome&lt;/em&gt; concept too:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;_________________________________________________&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Ues anything! It doesn’t matter what you say for all the hoopla in between or use as a focusing device as long as you work with an effective set framework or system that can fit any situation or individual and you are confident enough to jump in and get started. Just like before I knew any better, once you understand the fundamental groundwork of such concepts as The Projection Principle, pre-show work and other psychic methods, you can make up your own system. We can project learned verbiage toward reading virtually anything we like. If we have done our homework by constructing a persuasive and plausible system that makes sense and answers life’s complicated questions easily and leaves the sitter happy, it make absolutely no difference what is held up to get us there. Once you learn a basic system, …the sky is the limit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;div style="width:233px"&gt;&lt;img title="PC-0047" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/PC-00474-150x107.jpg" alt="You Can Forget All THAT Junk!" width="223" height="107"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You Can Forget All THAT Junk!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I had heard from a reliable source a true story of a skeptic in England who had gone to a psychic faire (that’s English for “fair” you know) and watched the psychic do a standard palm reading for his wife. Apparently, this particular reader wasn’t an especially gifted seer and after witnessing the reading, the husband was irritated by the gross generalities the psychic had laid on with a trowel. It’s possible that the psychic was just having a bad day. Hey, it happens. My guess is that the reading was just another parroting of yackety-yak by one of the dull drudges that populate the soft underbelly of the psychic marketplace. Either way, the skeptic took umbrage to the proceedings and feeling in a spirited mood, confronted the psychic.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anyone can do what you did. I can’t believe we paid for it,” he protested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychic shot back a pithy, “No sir. I doubt that. Palmistry is an ancient psychic tool that I am a gifted channel to work through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah? Bull! I could do what you did with anything. There’s no gift in any of it. It’s all in how you said what you told my wife and how she responded to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeptic happened to have a banana in his hand at the time. It had been his chosen snack that day. He decided to call the bluff of the psychic on her claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alright then, I’ll do a reading for you using this banana. How’s that sound?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The banana?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s right, the banana. Listen to this. The way you peel the banana will tell me about your past. The way you eat the banana will tell me what’s going on in your present, and the lines on the inside of the banana peel will tell me everything I need to know about your future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re joking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeptic challenged, “Now you don’t think much of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; psychic gift do you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alright, do it!” said the confident psychic, sure that anything as silly as a banana reading would all come to naught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the story goes, the skeptic went ahead and did a reading for the psychic using the banana and at its end, the psychic had to admit that the skeptic had been 95% accurate with everything he had spoken. The skeptic’s banter had likely consisted of general statements as well, but the psychic, being the trenchant shut-eye believer that he was and probably not wanting to lose any more credibility with the rest of his crowd, took it all as gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the most astounding part of this story is what transpired some years later when the skeptic apparently fell on hard times. After losing his job in the aerospace industry due to that all too real curse of the 80’s known as downsizing and desparate for gainful employment, his wife half-heartedly suggested he start doing private psychic readings to supplement their income. The rest is as they say history. He’s been a very successful reader ever since. He doesn’t refer to himself as a psychic, preferring to stay out of the limelight by referring to himself simply as a “spiritual advisor.” I’m not in any position to confirm or deny that he continued using bananas to claim his own rightful place among the luminaries of British psychical tradition, but who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This true tale of two worlds not only illustrates my point about the “anything goes” aspect of the gullible world we live in, but the skeptical sage of UK bananaisms also served to inspire my own fruitful shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, my days of working out of a seedy church environment as a paid “professional psychic” were becoming longer and longer and I was rapidly growing disillusioned with the whole depressing psychic-believer dynamic. Putting up with listening to so many nincompoops who showed no discernable rationality whatsoever was becoming less and less dynamic with each passing week. I had learned what I felt I needed to and arrived at a crossroad, deciding that dealing with half hour to hour palm reading sessions with borderline lunatics was causing me to lose far too much energy for what I was getting out of the experience. A healthy chunk of the sitters I had been doing palm readings for needed serious psychiatric help (not to mention the staff) and I wasn’t qualified to professionally analyze them or ready to go back to school and get a degree to learn how. Having absorbed and then regurgitated as much of the new age spiritualist movement as I thought I could stomach without permanently damaging my entire outlook on humanity, I needed a change. My conscience was beginning to get on my nerves. Deep down in that intuitive gut that I had learned to listen and pay attention to, I knew I was beginning to become lazily repetitive in my readings and generally complacent. This is not a healthy level for anyone, much less a “professional psychic” to descend to. I was losing sleep and taking in far too much of the over-hyped paranormal silliness that I had witnessed a bit too seriously for my own critically thinking good. This malaise was a bad sign and as the sayings go: be true to thyself and I knew I was either a part of the solution or a part of the problem. The sordid world I was being swept into didn’t feel like part of any great solution.  I needed to shake things up, realizing that it was just a matter of time before I was forced to quit or go bonkers. I was at the end of my tether or if you prefer astro-projectively speaking, at the end of my silken silver cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding myself in this weary frame of mind one gloomy Saturday morning as I pulled on my semi – eastern California swami garb and prepared to head out on the hour drive to another weekend of palm readings, I found I could barely summon the strength to climb into my car. I was one burnt out psychic suffering a bad case of the psychic blues. As I set out on my way to the lovely city of Anaheim to work my eight hours at Ye Olde Psychic Faire, I passed a busy Mexican grocery store. Sitting in the bright morning sun atop one of the fruit stalls was a gigantic bunch of ripe bananas…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="banana" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/banana1.jpg" alt="banana" width="170" height="93"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a thing of beauty thought I. Recalling the story I had heard about the British psychic, my mischievous side began to plot and my semi-dormant risk-taking circuits began firing off like road flares in my mind. I wondered what my fellow seers and charlatans would think if instead of my usual table set-up of crystals and other psychic gift shop crap, I cleaned everything off except a colossal bunch of bananas. What could they say or do? I had little to lose, having never heard of a psychic actually being fired for anything. I would probably have had to rob or kill someone to be asked to leave the sanctuary of the church I was working in. In that part of town, they needed psychics far more than we needed their venue. So I slid a twenty dollar bill into the hand of the grateful grocery man and filled the back seat of my car with the brilliantly ripe yellow fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving a little later in the morning than usual due to my unscheduled stop, I quickly carried in my new divination tools after everyone else had set-up and plopped the bunch down on my table. Everyone else was busy as usual with their bevy of anxious sitters and I casually sat down as if nothing was amiss. I didn’t see anyone so much as bat an eye in my direction. If anyone had taken notice of what I had entered and laid out on my table, they were playing it low key and wisely employed their practiced psychic eyes and chose not to react; either not caring (jaded lot as they were) or figuring Mark had finally gone round the bend, resisting any temptation to upset the normally discrete psychic vibrations that were ever present in the quietude of the church’s nave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Peter, the proprietor of the operation and finished chatting up a curious customer, he strolled over as casually as he could manage under the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hi Mark,” he said obliquely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey Pete. What’s goin on?” I replied nonchalantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “What’s with the bananas?” Peter was the type who knew how to cut right to the chase, especially when money was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bananas?” I asked as if confused by his question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, the bananas. I mean, …where’s your stuff?” He asked, looking around my table for a magnifying glass, Palmistry chart or hint of anything vaguely psychic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My stuff?  …Oh yeah well, I’m reading bananas today. It’s the latest thing in England you know. People really like it. They get to have a reading and eat a snack for the same price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re kidding aren’t you?” Peter looked worried. Suddenly people were turning their heads and tuning into Peter and my conversation. Several sitters were caught in a stultifying mid-reading silence, while their psychic sat momentarily dumbstruck as they watched and listened to Peter and I talk over a pile of bananas. It was a priceless moment of pure street performance art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, I’m not kidding. Would I kid you? The way they peel the banana tells me about their past. The way they eat it tells me about their present and the lines on the inside of the peel tell me about their future. You should try it sometime Peter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever Mark, but I predict you won’t be too busy today.” Peter quickly moved away from my table as if he might catch something from me if he stayed any longer and swiftly made his way back to the safety of his office. The fair then clicked seamlessly back into motion like clockwork and once again the room hummed with psychic buzzwords, filling every corner with alluring mystical vernacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so amazingly, once the word got around about what I was doing and the onlookers had a chance to see I was taking the whole thing quite seriously, I was busy all day. My instincts had told me that people might prefer something different now and then and enjoy a novelty proved true. I was definitely offering something new for a dollar a minute. Although I didn’t do quite as many readings as some of the other days where aI had worked like a dog at this psychic sweatshop, Peter’s prediction of a wash-out turned out to be wrong. As the day went by, I fared better than the average afternoon of the same-old-same-old palm readings. Any timed minutes I may have lost through the few sitters that chose someone else rather than my decidedly different lay out was actually made up for by adding on extra time for the sitters who had to chew their bananas. After all, this was only common courtesy and I had to be patient with their eating habits. People laughed out loud and had a really good time too, rather than the usual stoop shouldered averted eyes and downtrodden moods so commonly seen in seriously metaphysical habitats. The poor mans’ therapy had been magically transformed into a carnivaleque fun zone for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of my regular sitters came by for their weekly readings and one lady I had sat with dozens of times refused to eat her banana. It was all just too much for her, poor thing. I hadn’t figured on the possibility that someone might dislike bananas. I still managed to tell her what she needed to hear, which hadn’t changed that much since we had first met years earlier. My new divination method didn’t matter a bit to her. She remained unruffled and took it all in stride as if it was no different than tea leaves or tarot cards. With the banana augury system , I said the same things I had told her for years, sticking to my guns and holding a straight face to keep it all real as I gestured and pointed out the various archetypal lines on her banana peel. She paid the same money for exactly the same words and wisdom, only this time she held a banana instead of me holding her hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added up, I counted out just about the usual cash take in by day’s end, give or take a buck or two. Any small amount of difference was more than made up for by the fact that had enjoyed a hilarious afternoon I will never forget. I’m confident many of the sitters will remember that day too. For the many overweight sitters that frequented the fair, it was a healthy alternative to the pizza shack next door. The office staff never mentioned anything odd or unusual to me about that day or brought to my attention any momentary lapse of my reason. Why should they as long as they got paid their cut of the action? They had probably seen much stranger things in their years of conning the public. I probably stretched the limits as far as my credibility went with a few folks by doing this stunt, but I often wonder if anyone ever asks for a banana reading after I left that venue. I have never felt the need to repeat this performance. Bananas can be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;And if you don’t believe that bananas can be put to prophetic use just as easily as a tarot card or a crystal ball, (or even a cat turd if you are an ancient Egyptian seer) watch me do a banana reading at a session I did on The Amazing Cruise with Randi and company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello dear readers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely spiffing news today for those that aren’t blessed with my incredibly saccharine nature: According to recent research, children who eat sweets and chocolates every day are more likely to be violent later in life! At last, a solution to every concerned Atheist with children who has ever asked the question “What if my kids just aren’t cut out for Atheism?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Cardiff University] found that 69 per cent of those who had a conviction for a violent offence by the age of 34 had eaten sweets and chocolates daily, compared to just 42 per cent of those without such a conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we are able to induce violent, psychopathic behaviour in our wonderful children, we need to think about how to get those conviction rates down – don’t forget that the term “criminal” only applies to those that get caught!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so-called “constructive” ways to do this. You could take up martial arts, listen to heavy metal, maybe even join the EDL. But why corrupt the joy of spreading chaos and mayhem with an agenda when you can appreciate immoral conduct in its own right. After all, one of the Atheists best-loved slogans is “Just be good for goodness’ sake”. Be good at expressing your anger because YOU want to be, don’t hide it because some “deity” tells you it’s naughty. And be rational about the sort of crimes you want to get involved in. Always remember that if you are serious about being a long-term atheist, you need to think about the bigger picture. Missing out on a juicy chance to injure today may be wise in order for you to grab that golden opportunity tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the foreseeable future, I will be here to help solve any Atheist problems you may be struggling with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you sometimes wonder if it’s more productive to have an abortion, or smoke whilst pregnant? Is there a god-botherer in your local area that just won’t shut up about “being a nice person”? What’s the best resource for indoctrinating innocent children with balanced and philosophical discourse so that they turn into intelligent, mature, and better looking adults? &lt;/p&gt;

Ardipithecus ramidus, or ‘Ardi’ for short has been the name given to a particular female specimen. You may have heard of this find recently, as the story has been doing the rounds with print press and online media. However, what you might not have heard, thankfully, is the slightly ridiculous coverage of Ardi from some outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press (AP) writers are well known for mistakes in public science reporting, and these mistakes are to be expected, even with a big find like Ardi. From Yahoo news though, &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091001/ap_on_sc/us_sci_before_lucy"&gt;you get this rather strange quote&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This older skeleton reverses the common wisdom of human evolution, said anthropologist C. Owen Lovejoy of Kent State University. Rather than humans evolving from an ancient chimp-like creature, the new find provides evidence that chimps and humans evolved from some long-ago common ancestor — but each evolved and changed separately along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this quote bizarre is that surely this was already common knowledge? That chimps and humans evolved had a very distant common ancestor, but apparently this reverses the common wisdom of human evolution? Not particularly sure what the writer there was getting at there.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you get the National Geographic website, which one would assume to be a more respectable area of science reporting, describing the find as ‘disproving’ the missing link. Anyone who is familiar with the scientific understanding of the evolution of humans, has to endure frustration every time a so called ‘missing link’ is mentioned. The term ‘missing link’ is used nearly every occasion a new species is discovered, they can’t all be the missing link surely. This is due to the nature of evolution being more of a lattice of evolutionary branches. To imply that we are going to discover one fossil in particular that fills all the gaps in the fossil record is preposterous, every fossil is a missing link, fills it’s niche gap, but at the same time creates two gaps either side of the gap you just filled. Evolution is a slow process. We will most likely never discover every single species of ape over millions of years, in a nice perfectly laid out chronological line, leading to our particular brand of African Ape Homo Sapiens. Fossils are hard to come by, and you could say we are lucky to have found any at all.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, the science reporting only gets worse, up to the point of full out evolutionary denial. The well known biologist blogger extraordinaire PZ Myers (of the blog Pharyngula), brought attention to an article by Metro News in Canada. Metro news declare that the find of Ardi, shows that man did not descend from apes. Which of course is a pretty bold statement, considering that we are a class of african apes. Instead Metro ‘news’ states this as one of many controversial new theories, implying that instead that our knuckle dragging cousins evolved from “us”, or human like creatures. This of course is going to drive creationists wild with excitement, at the thought of disproving evolution. The comments below the article show two comments from Muslim creationists, proclaiming that this shows the Koran as being the truth when it comes to matters of human origins.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;the worst of the news reporting on Ardi, by the middle eastern news agency Al-Jazeerah&lt;/a&gt;. An arabic fan of Richarddawkins.net, reported that Al-Jazeerah had reported in arabic, that the new find of Ardi ‘disproves’ Charles Dawins theory of evolution. A quick read of the translated article, shows just about the worst science reporting from a major news agency I have ever seen, or will probably ever see. Apparently Ardi forces out the old assumption of man being evolved from a monkey. Who knew.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zaghloul El-Naggar, an apparent ‘professor’ of geology in a number of Arab universities, exclaims that Westerners had come to their senses &lt;i&gt;“after they were dealing with the origin of man in terms of material and the denial of religion.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good ‘professor’ of geology goes on to say that the age of Ardi at 4.4 million years old, is incorrect as well, as the age of the earth does not exceed 400,000 years. The madness continues with another proclamation that apparently this proves that humans could not have possibly evolved from monkeys or gorillas. In a round about way the ‘professor’ is right, humans could not have possibly evolved from monkeys or gorillas. It’s a good job then that no scientist has ever claimed that. The term ‘common ancestor’ is completely lost on these people.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ardi is an important find, and it does fit into current evolutionary knowledge quite nicely thank you. Ardipithecus ramidus just reinforces currently widely accepted theories of hominid lineage, that the common ancestor we seek with chimpanzees is further back then 4.4 million years (6-7 million years being the most commonly accepted time), which was never a controversial view to start with.  &lt;/p&gt;

And of course, owing to the piles of smoking rubble that constitute our budget at the state universities right now, there are no funds at present for graders.&lt;/p&gt;

Like many religious holidays, it carries a mandate for charity.  During this time, it is traditional to build a temporary structure called a &lt;i&gt;sukkoh&lt;/i&gt; and to do as much living as possible there.  It is also traditional to invite guests.  In the ancient mythology, some of those guests are the ancestors of the Jewish people such as Abraham, Sarah, Issac, Leah, Rebbekah, Jacob, Rachael, and others.  European Jewish mythology is filled with folktales of the Ancestors coming to the &lt;i&gt;sukkoh&lt;/i&gt; in disguise to sample the hospitality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jewish traditions hold many levels of charity, traditionally described by Moses Maimonides.  Especially valued are anonymous contributions that help people help themselves, although any gift is a &lt;i&gt;mitzvah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is by way of asking you to either &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=24230"&gt;give to DonorsChoose&lt;/a&gt; or help spread the word.  The projects I'm trying to help are needy classrooms in Michigan, and every little bit helps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/donorschoose---what_is_charity.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/PmOryMn0o4s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254594069340"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/10/eu_panel_spanks_some_specious.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bebd96865071620a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Altie Meds"/><title type="html">EU Panel Spanks Some Specious Claims</title><published>2009-10-03T16:35:34Z</published><updated>2009-10-03T16:35:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/1J4L3SPehWk/eu_panel_spanks_some_specious.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/10/eu_panel_spanks_some_specious.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal's Matthew Dalton &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125443734896257649.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;European scientific authorities Thursday rejected dozens of health claims made by food companies, in a sign of how tricky it will be for them to get some of their most popular claims past a European Union drive to bring scientific rigor to the health foods.

&lt;p&gt;A panel of the European Food Safety Authority issued nearly a hundred opinions on health claims, about two-thirds of which were negative. The rejections included claims on special bacteria that are supposed to aid digestion and boost the immune system, beta carotene additives for sunscreen and shark cartilage for healthy joints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel rejected two-thirds of the claims, and half of these were rejected because the substance in question wasn't adequately described, the EFSA said in a statement. The claims that were accepted related mainly to vitamins and minerals known to promote health, dietary fiber, fatty acids for lowering cholesterol and sugar-free gum that is good for the teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has posted these opinions, and a survey of them shows an interesting regulatory model.  Information online includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"General Function" health claims such as "calcium is good for your bones" are defined by article 13.1 of the Regulation. These claims are based on generally accepted scientific evidence. A consolidated list of these claims is currently being evaluated by EFSA.

&lt;p&gt;"New function" health claims defined under Article 13.5 of the Regulation are based on new scientific evidence and/or for which protection of proprietary data is requested. They require applicants to provide scientific evidence substantiating the claim proposed for a specific product or substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claims regarding disease risk reduction and child development or health. These kinds of claims, defined under Article 14 of the Regulation, require applicants to provide scientific evidence substantiating the claim proposed for a specific product or substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criteria for setting nutrient profiles. Nutrient profiles are nutritional requirements that foods must respect in order to bear nutrition and health claims. Nutrient profiles are established by the European Commission and Member States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd love to hear what ScienceBloggers think of the EFSA's process and work.  The opinions are all online &lt;a href="http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale-1178620753812_1178621456747.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/10/eu_panel_spanks_some_specious.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/1J4L3SPehWk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254593225208"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/going_rogue_an_american_life.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b82813009c954f1c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Palin"/><title type="html">Going Rogue: An American Life</title><published>2009-10-03T18:18:53Z</published><updated>2009-10-03T18:18:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/DOGUJ8KdYbI/going_rogue_an_american_life.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/going_rogue_an_american_life.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061939897?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwgregladenc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061939897"&gt;Going Rogue: An American Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwgregladenc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0061939897" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt; is the name of Sarah Palin's new book, due out on November 17th.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Crossing the Line?  Biomedical Technology in Sports

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, October 20, 2009&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:30-8:30 pm with discussion beginning at 7:00 followed by Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: Tir Na Nog 218 South Blount Street, Raleigh, 833-7795&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it was a split second rather than an International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) ruling that kept double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius from competing in the Beijing Summer Olympics. He didn't hit the 400-meter qualifying time of 45.55 seconds, despite running a personal best 46.25 on his carbon-fiber prosthetic legs at a track meet in Lucerne, Switzerland. In this talk, National Humanities Center digital media specialist Phillip Barron explores ways that advances in biomedical science and technology are challenging our traditional notions of acceptable sports practices and offers some suggestions for how we can create rules of sport that sustain these technological innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the Speaker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phillip Barron works as a Digital Media Specialist at the National Humanities Center in Durham, where he is managing editor of the "On the Human" project. He is also the sole proprietor of the digital media design company, nicomedia, LLC. Trained in analytic philosophy, Barron is a scholar and award-winning digital media artist. His writings and photography have appeared in newspapers, magazines and academic journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main finding is that both factual beliefs and religious beliefs are processed in our brain the same way.  Whether we think Xenu brought people to Earth on his spacecraft (a belief) or that 2 + 2 = 4 (fact), the information is treated identically by the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Miller&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/216551"&gt;summarizes the study in &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Our believing brains make no qualitative distinctions between the kinds of things you learn in a math textbook and the kinds of things you learn in Sunday school. Though the existence of God will never be proved — or disproved — by an fMRI scan, science can study a thing or two about the neurological mechanisms of belief. What Harris’s study shows is that when a conservative Christian says he believes in the Second Coming as an undeniable fact, he isn’t lying or exaggerating or employing any other rhetorical maneuver. If a believer’s brain regards the Second Coming the way it does every other fact, then debates about the veracity of faith would seem — to the committed believer, at least — to be rather pointless.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the debates won’t end even if no one is likely to change their mind.  Because apparently, we all enjoy seeing the other side torn to shreds, and we also enjoy proving attacks on us wrong.  As the researchers say in their paper,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… there were several regions that showed greater signal in both groups in response to “blasphemous” statements (i.e. those that ran counter to Christian doctrine). The ventral striatum signal in this contrast suggests that decisions about these stimuli may have been more rewarding for both groups: &lt;strong&gt;Nonbelievers may take special pleasure in making assertions that explicitly negate religious doctrine, while Christians may enjoy rejecting such statements as false.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any hope for compromise, common ground, or for people to change their minds?  Conversions do happen often, after all…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a slight chance, says Miller.  According to the research, while the religious people treated beliefs and factual information the same way in their heads, they did hesitate a bit before saying the religious statement was true for them.  The atheists also hesitated when saying a religious belief wasn’t true.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the brain may treat the info the same way, we may not be as &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; about religious beliefs as we are undeniable facts.  That leaves some room for atheists to spread seeds of doubt into the minds of religious friends and family members.  It also gives the religious reason to think we can be coerced into God belief…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other implications do you see from this research?&lt;br&gt;

His simplistic tactic is to claim that Beck and Limbaugh haven't won the GOP any elections.  If elected positions were the only important facts in a democracy, he might have a point.  But Beck, Limbaugh, and their allies don't care about elections.  They represent a fundamentally anti-democratic philosophy of "if you can't get there democratically, do it the other way."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are these "other ways"?&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.poligazette.com/2009/10/01/female-suffrage-a-mistake-john-derbyshire/"&gt;Women have apparently screwed up democracy&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of us (that is, the rest of us with phalluses), and if we could just fix the whole suffrage problem &lt;a href="http://themoderatevoice.com/48080/nros-john-derbyshire-opposes-voting-rights-for-women/"&gt;we wouldn't have these pesky Democratic wins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elections not being what they once were (Republican), it's time for the military to correct our "mistakes" and &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2009/09/30/newsmax_statement/"&gt;install a &lt;i&gt;junta&lt;/i&gt; in Washington&lt;/a&gt;.  I shit you not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encouraging the idea that&lt;a href="http://fabulousflatulence.wordpress.com/2009/09/14/rush-spews-goat-shit-and-the-idiotariat-eats-it-up/"&gt; the elected leadership of this country is some sort of fascist coup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing to de-legitimize the democratically-elected leadership via smears---if "fascist" doesn't stick, &lt;a href="http://fabulousflatulence.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/do-they-still-lock-up-crazy-folks-glenn-do-they/"&gt;try "communist"&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deny the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; history of fascism to help bolster claims that the current democratically-elected administration is really a bunch of fascist/communist pretenders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Brooks probably understands but wants to deny is that the far right loudmouths aren't &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; to win elections---they are trying to subvert them. And in this, they are succeeding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/brooks_is_wrong_on_beck---very.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/V67ayMgP2JM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254583326992"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/science_friday_has_a_new_arts.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d4cc5125423f0b6c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Science Friday has a New Arts and Science Blog (Pass it around!)</title><published>2009-10-03T15:24:08Z</published><updated>2009-10-03T15:24:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/2ZSBoqj0_vU/science_friday_has_a_new_arts.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/science_friday_has_a_new_arts.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/arts/"&gt;Which is here.  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The good news for all the critics of this choice is that Dawkins pulled no punches. In his introduction, he praised &lt;em&gt;Religulous&lt;/em&gt; and thanked Maher for his contributions to freethought, but he also very clearly and unambiguously stated that some of his beliefs about medicine were simply crazy. He did a good job of walking a difficult tightrope; he made it clear that the award was granted for some specific worthy matters, his humorous approach to religion, while carefully dissociating the AAI from any endorsement of crackpot medicine. It won't be enough, I know, but the effort was made, and talking to Dawkins afterwards there was no question but that Maher's quackery was highly objectionable. I also got the impression that he felt the critics of the award were making good and reasonable points, and that he felt the awkwardness of the decision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good. I daresay he wasn't made to feel uncomfortable enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; feel the awkwardness of the decision to give an anti-medical science loon an award that bears his name. Although the AAI screwed up, Dawkins is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; blameless. He brought it on himself with his airly dismissive attitude when these concerns were first brought up. I can only hope Dawkins learns from this experience. Maher's views are far worse than a simple political disagreement, such as the example of Dawkins disagreeing with Christopher Hitchens but remaining able to work with him on other issues. Maher is a medical crank, who is demonstrably wrong about vaccines, HIV, and cancer, among other things, as I documented in a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/here_are_those_inconvenient_questions_fo.php"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; listing many of the posts about Maher I and others have done over the years to describe just how far into quackery he is. It also didn't help that the AAI apparently &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_time_has_come.php#comment-1976811"&gt;posted signs around the auditorium threatening&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com"&gt;expel&lt;/a&gt; (word choice intentional) anyone who "disrupts" the meeting. Clearly, the AAI was feeling the heat. Unfortunately, they attacked a straw man. No one that I'm aware of, least of all me, was advocating "disrupting" the awards ceremony.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/a_report_from_the_field.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/a_report_from_the_field.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/aexAVezcc7w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254579455098"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=4360">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1b2219dc3280280</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random"/><category term="ants"/><category term="atta"/><category term="costa rica"/><category term="la selva"/><category term="leaf-cutter"/><category term="work"/><title type="html">Whoops</title><published>2009-10-03T13:21:57Z</published><updated>2009-10-03T13:21:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/whoops/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/08/24/things-ive-learned/"&gt;late August&lt;/a&gt;, I thought things would slow down for me in September.

&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Here’s what I’ve been doing for the last couple of months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work work work.&lt;/strong&gt; Still putting in those 60 hr weeks, but a few big projects are finishing up with happy (mostly) resolutions.  If you manage people and aren’t hip to &lt;a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics"&gt;Manager Tools&lt;/a&gt;, then get with the podcast program!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I WENT TO &lt;a title="La Selva Station" href="http://www.ots.ac.cr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=163&amp;amp;Itemid=348"&gt;COSTA RICA&lt;/a&gt; AND IT WAS AMAZING. &lt;/strong&gt;I saw &lt;a href="http://www.sasionline.org/antsfiles/pages/bullet/bulletbio.html"&gt;bullet ant&lt;/a&gt;s. I saw &lt;a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Atta_sexdens.html"&gt;leaf-cutter ants&lt;/a&gt;. I saw howler monkeys and &lt;a title="smaller than I expected!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3953765901/"&gt;poisonous frogs&lt;/a&gt;.  I quadrupled my &lt;a title="Photos from Panama, but you get the idea" href="http://10000birds.com/birds-of-panama-photo-gallery.htm"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; life list in 4 days.  I had massive bad hair days in the humidity, was almost killed multiple times by rickety bridges and crazy drivers, and had a wonderful, wonderful time.  Costa Rica during the “green” (i.e, rainy) season was just heaven for a biologist.  I spent 4 days running around yelling &lt;a title="These are my people" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3951173963/"&gt;“OMG W00t OMG!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did I mention that I saw leaf-cutter ants?&lt;/strong&gt; Did I mention how GEEKED OUT I was about that?  These little animals are the dominant herbivores in this ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Ollie" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/ollie.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=334" alt="Ollie" width="500" height="334"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s Caturday Felid is one of my cats, Ollie. Last year, Jerry came over to the UK to go to a conference and give talks. I invited him up to Manchester, where he gave a special lecture to our First Year students on “Evolution and the New Creationism”, which went down very well. What also went down well were the pints of beer we drank at the &lt;a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/15/1519/Marble_Arch/Manchester"&gt;Marble Arch Inn &lt;/a&gt;in Manchester. Before we went out, Jerry came round to my house to see our two cats, Ollie and Pepper. I held Ollie (who’s a bit skittish), and as Jerry peered at him, Ollie lashed out and scratched The Great Man’s Nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t quite like &lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_uzU4-m_CMB8/SRriUSp8TiI/AAAAAAAAELs/7AYn_6L2W6w/s200/chinatown.jpg"&gt;Jack Nicholson in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_uzU4-m_CMB8/SRriUSp8TiI/AAAAAAAAELs/7AYn_6L2W6w/s200/chinatown.jpg"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, but it was still pretty uncomfortable for Jerry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point of all this is: why do cats like to sit in boxes? (Or in this case, a laundry basket.)&lt;/p&gt;

Let me try to reason with them. &lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other Christians argue against such tactics. Christians on both sides of the fence can defend their views here, because there are Biblical stories and verses that support both sides, just as Christians disagree about the relationship of the church to the culture. See H. Richard Niebuhr's classic book, &lt;em&gt;Christ and Culture&lt;/em&gt;, where he shows there are six different ways Christians have sought to engage in their culture, all based upon something said in the Bible. Christians see a different Jesus in the New Testament texts. Jesus fits all sizes doesn't he? But to think that the NT contains different and even contradictory approaches to handling unbelievers is something they would never think of accepting. Many times the Jesus that a Christian sees is based upon his own personality type. Not only are interpretations of the Bible historically conditioned, but they are also conditioned by what personality types we already have before coming to the Bible. I maintain that the side a Christian takes with regard to how to treat false teachers is more likely to be based upon his or her own personality type. Hateful, self-righteous, know-it-all, competitive, arrogant and angry people will simply have the strong tendency to interpret the Bible the way they do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians who use these tactics are ignorant. Using these tactics is based upon imitating some ancient superstitious people, like Elijah, Jesus and Paul, whom they hold no candle to. Charles Sheldon's 1896 book, &lt;em&gt;In His Steps&lt;/em&gt; asked, "what would Jesus do?" in order to spur Christians on to imitate his behavior. This book has been widely criticized by Christian thinkers because Christians cannot do what Jesus did, since they are not Jesus. Can we perform miracles? Should we overturn the money changers’ tables and thrash them with a whip? Jesus also shunned a Canaanite woman and called her and her people “dogs,” because he said his mission was limited to the “lost sheep of Israel” (Matthew 15:21-28). There are a host of things these Christians wouldn’t try to imitate, like telling women to be silent in the churches as Paul did (I Cor. 14:34), selling all and giving it all to the poor (Luke 18:22; Yes, Jesus really meant this because his ethic was an "interim ethic" until the Kingdom of God came, which the NT writers believed was imminent in their lifetimes), or sending a slave back to his master (Philemon), or even be an itinerant preacher like Jesus with no place to rest his head (Matthew 8:20). These Christians merely pick and choose what they want to imitate based upon what they want to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if Jesus, Paul and Elijah did what was right in taunting and demeaning their detractors, there is a difference that makes all of the difference. They supposedly knew with a much greater certainty than these Christians will ever know that they were right. These Christians do not have the same assuredness they did, to do what they did. Are you Jesus? No? Then you don't have the right to do as he did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same hermeneutics these Christians use to interpret and apply the Bible in dealing with false teachers, was also used to justify southern slavery. Get and read William Swartley's book, &lt;em&gt;Slavery, Sabbath, War &amp;amp; Women &lt;/em&gt;(Herald Press, 1984). This Christian book is really about hermeneutics. Its main thesis is that there are two different ways of interpreting the Bible with regard to these four different ethical issues. On the one hand you have the literalists, and on the other hand you have those who stress Biblical principles over some of the literal statements in the Bible. And guess what? The literalists defended southern slavery, while those who stressed Biblical principles (like Galatians 3:28) were against it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem here is that Christians who berate and ridicule false teachers because Jesus did, argue based upon the same interpretive principles as those Christians who defended southern slavery. Other Christians stress Biblical principles like loving the way the Good Samaritan did, who was considered an outcast, a half-breed, and a worshipper at a false temple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact there are two good reasons for treating those who disagree politely, like we do here at DC: 1) People will listen to you, which is the goal, isn't it? 2) You might learn something in the interchange of these ideas, since no one has a corner on the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Certainty is unattainable when it comes to such issues, so it's best to at least tone down the rhetoric. But on they go. They are right about everything. Everyone else, even many other Christians are wrong, which is another personality induced my-way-or-the-highway attitude of what an apologist is supposed to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually we apostates can consider ourselves lucky. In a previous era they would have tortured us and burned us alive. Atheists don't deserve apologies because they are less than human. And once you demonize your opponent you can do anything you want to them, and Christians have done just that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many people listen to what we say here at DC because we say it respectfully. Think about it. Many people cannot hear what these other Christians say because they can't hear their words above the loud screams of their attitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if these Christians are right about Jesus, Paul, and Elijah, who cares? We live in an opinionated society; one that values the free expression of ideas and where educated and intelligent people realize we will not all agree. That's the difference that makes all the difference. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;These Christians should adjust their views, just like they’ve done with their liberal views on women when compared to Christians of earlier centuries. They should adjust, just like they've done by condemning racism and slavery, unlike those who justified these things in the American South. They should adjust, just like they do with their liberal views of hell when compared to the Middle Ages. They should adjust, just like they do with regard to their liberal and heretical ideas of a free democracy when compared to earlier times of the divine rights of kings. They should adjust, just like Christians have done who longer think the Bible justifies killing people who disagree. They should adjust or die trying to kick against the goads.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exapologist has said to these Christians:&lt;blockquote&gt;You're missing the point about the relationship between civility and inquiry. It's not to prevent from hurting others' feelings, but rather to prevent obstacles to finding the truth. People who care about gaining/sustaining true beliefs and avoiding/discarding false ones realize that a free and open exchange of ideas contributes greatly to that end. It's a way for ideas to be scrutinized and refined through careful peer review. When this sort of exchange is at its best, it's a thing of immense value. It's a process that drastically increases the probability of acquiring truth and avoiding error.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, this invaluable process -- which isn't even allowed in many places -- is extremely fragile: it's very easy to stifle. For example, if someone enters into this process and starts attacking others, then people start to shut down, or they start a shouting match, or... Thereby drastically reducing the probability of getting truth from the process -- or shutting down the process entirely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So you see, the reason why people don't like it when you start attacking them is not primarily because it's unpleasant (although it is, but most grown-ups can handle that), but rather because you're stifling the free and honest exchange of ideas, which in turn stifles their inquiry into the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now there are places that you can go that are against the free and democratic exchange of ideas, and would prefer the unquestioned adherence to the dogmas of a particular religion, silencing all dissent with violence -- e.g., societies in which the Taliban is in control (or Calvin's Vienna). But the people you attack aren't into that, for some strange reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, if you yourself are interested in increasing the probability of gaining true beliefs and avoiding false beliefs, then (in addition to taking some courses in critical thinking and logic) you need to acquire certain intellectual virtues, such as the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-intellectual humility: "you know what? I don't know everything, and in fact some of my beliefs might actually be false or otherwise unjustified."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A closely related virtue is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-intellectual charity: "perhaps I should listen to and internalize the views of others, and not unfairly characterize them to myself or others -- even those whose views are diametrically opposed to mine. I should be able to explain and defend their views before I evaluate them. After all, that way I can be relatively confident that I'm not rejecting a view that turns out to be true."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- intellectual honesty and tentativeness: "I *think* that my views about x are true and reasonable, but sometimes I have my doubts about it. For example, there's this one argument Y that's pretty decent, and I don't know what to say about it. What do you think?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you put these into practice and develop them, the probability of your believing true propositions goes up dramatically.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here’s what a Christian named Touchstone wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;It isn't that we can't handle it. It just looks bad for Christian apologists to come off that way. I don't agree with William Lane Craig on a lot of things, but I think he has a good sense of his obligations as a representative of Jesus Christ in how he acquits himself. He's clear and firm, but generous, and projects an authentic air of good will in the works I've read from him. In his debate with Ehrman he even went so far as to do a little treatment of "Bart's Blunder" if I recall. It was actually a well made point, but very much done in a charitable, if pointed way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why "mock" people who say Christianity is "clearly false"? Why not simply point out their missteps dispassionately? Maybe you don't owe this to the unbeliever at all. Maybe it is well within your rights to laugh like Elijah did with the prophets of Baal or how God "sits in the heavens laughs [and] . . . scoffs at [unbelievers]." (Psalm 2:4). Fine, but that doesn't mean that you must exercise that right. Doesn't your Bible say that Jesus "felt a love" for an unbeliever ("the rich young ruler"--Mark 10:21--Although, this might be the only such reference in the Bible)? Is "mocking" and "laughing at" indicative of this? What do you hope to accomplish by mocking and laughing at an unbeliever? Will this help the unbeliever accept what you are saying? Will this help other Christians feel better about their faith? Does this honor God more than dispassionate reasoning?&lt;/blockquote&gt;In my book I revealed that I had an affair eighteen years ago as of this writing, and some Christians seem to berate me for it. They seem to think it discredits my arguments. Not so at all!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s what a Christian named Jeff said in response to JP Holding's constant personal attacks on me:&lt;blockquote&gt;We are constantly told that the insulting personal rhetoric that is used so readily in some circles…is justified because it accomplishes a larger strategic goal, namely to publicly shame opponents of the Gospel so that (a) they will be quiet and (b) they will be discredited in the eyes of the "audience". Now both of these seem like very flimsy justifications insofar as (a) never actually happens, and (b), I think, overestimates the size of the putative audience and underestimates its intelligence, but nevertheless, ok, fine, I'll accept it for argument's sake. But what, exactly, is the rhetorical advantage that is gained by criticizing and condemning someone for having sinned? It seems to me that to argue that John has sin in his past says nothing more or less than that he is human like the rest of us, and it's far from clear how that in some way discredits his arguments. Can you imagine, in a debate between, say, Witherington and Ehrman, if Ehrman were to finish a lengthy case for his view and Witherington's response was "unfortunately, Bart, your position has no merit because I have hidden-camera footage that shows you kicking a puppy!" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good grief, people. If you want to argue vehemently against John's position, by all means do so, and if you think that calling him a moron or a poopypants somehow puts you on the lofty pinnacle of unassailable intellectual rigor, go ahead and indulge your belief in the validity of that notion. But don't suppose for a second that because his sins have been publicly disclosed and yours have not, that you are somehow justified in presuming to stand on some sort of moral high ground and wield his sin as a debate broadsword with which to win an argument. Even if you could win a debate that way (and you can't), your victory would be hollow, because with your own words against him you convict yourself -- just replace his sin with yours in your epithet, and you'll find your sword turns in your hand to stab its master with alarming speed and accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When someone is transparent enough to disclose personal information, particularly when it is potentially embarrassing to them, it's a betrayal of that person's trust to then throw that admission back in their face; to use it as a polemical barb is intellectually bankrupt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;A final note. I'm not opposed to using ridicule. Sometimes there is nothing left to do when all else has been said and done. Sometimes we must vent and laugh at what can only best be described as a ridiculous position, like Voltaire did this in his book &lt;em&gt;Candide&lt;/em&gt;.

The age of Nymphalidae butterflies has been the subject of longstanding confusion but according to this new study Nymphalids first evolved 90 million years ago which suprisingly coincides with the global rise of the angiosperms at about 100 million years ago.Based on  sequences of 10 genes and 235 morphological characters for exemplars of 400 of the 540 valid Nymphalid genera representing all major lineages of the family authors have created a robust phylogenetic tree for the Nymphalidae butterfly family which represents the phylogenetic relationships of 400 genera of Nymphalidae based on a maximum likelihood analysis, along with outgroups.                      Clades representing subfamilies are coloured. (Image Copyright © The Royal Society 2009 )Interestingly the rate of diversification of the family tree or appearance of  new Nymphalid species came to a slowdown around the 64 million years ago which coincides with the Cretaceous–Tertiary (KT) event leading to massive extinction of  Nymphalid  lineages and different species including non-avian dinosaurs. The ancestors of 10–12 lineages of the Neotropical and Oriental regions survived in KT event leading to subsequent elevated speciation rates in the Tertiary. Extinction, which according to many scientists was caused by a massive  catastrophic bolide  impact, have been further compounded as a result of widespread extinctions of angiosperm host plants in the same period, disrupting obligate butterfly–plant interactions.Reference:Wahlberg, N., Leneveu, J., Kodandaramaiah, U., Pena, C., Nylin, S., Freitas, A., &amp;amp; Brower, A.

The programme is available &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8286000/8286445.stm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on iPlayer and an unverified transcript is available &lt;a href="http://evidencematters.posterous.com/r4-today-halvorsen-and-finn-on-natalie-morton"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
At one point in the interview (4 minutes 06 seconds to 4m 39s), Dr Halvorsen refers to the introduction of the HPV vaccine as being "rushed". Halvorsen appears to believe that not only has the vaccine been introduced prematurely, but that hype and marketing campaigns by Big Pharma are partly responsible for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... the new HPV vaccine was rushed on at a very fast rate. Partly because of the huge hype by the drug manufacturers to market the vaccine. They've been widely criticised for their marketing campaign. They paid doctors' organisations, patients' organisations, doctors. And in fact, they were congratulated for their vaccine as being the Brand of the Year by a marketing campaign for making a market out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This criticism of what Dr Halvorsen sees as "huge hype" and a successful marketing campaign is interesting when contrasted with some of Halvorsen's other comments in the same interview. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run a Baby Jabs and Immunisation Clinic. I run an immunisation clinic. [...] my book, The Truth About Vaccines [...] yet again, I run a vaccine clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halvorsen's book and clinic were also both mentioned by the presenter in the introduction to the show. Like the Today show, the Daily Mail article written by Dr Halvorsen had a plug for his book, and there was a also a reference to Halvorsen's clinic in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his opening comments, Dr Halvorsen states that "the initial reaction is one that certainly the vaccine has to be a suspect cause to the problem. And to think otherwise would be unreasonable". It may be worth pointing out that, as &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/news/2009/09September/Pages/Cervical-cancer-vaccine-QA.aspx"&gt;NHS Choices&lt;/a&gt; remark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No link should ever have been made. However, the girl died on the same day as receiving her vaccination and this led to associations being drawn between the jab and her death. This happens largely through misinterpretation of probabilities. Unfortunately, young people do die suddenly of natural causes. Although such events are rare, they are statistically much more common than fatal reactions to routine medical treatments.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that it is more common for young people to die suddenly of natural causes than to suffer a fatal reaction to a routine medical treatment, it does not seem unreasonable to me to think that a vaccine does not have to be a suspect cause. Perhaps Dr Halvorsen was unaware of the probabilities involved, or misinterpreted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halvorsen (1m 06s to 1m 30s) goes on to argue from personal incredulity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think clearly it does not appear to be the primary cause though it's interesting that a tumour of the, a malignancy a tumour, a cancer that could apparently kill her at any time sounds very bizarre when apparently she was well one hour beforehand, well enough to have a vaccine. Yet she has a malignancy that could have killed her at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a girl due to be vaccinated may have a tumour that could kill at any time may sound bizarre to Dr Halvorsen, but that does not give us any reason to doubt the veracity of the claim that Natalie Morton had such a tumour. We should not assume that a claim is untrue simply because somebody finds it surprising and Dr Halvorsen provides no reasoning to support his suprise. If Halvorsen considers the findings of the post mortem to be implausible, it would be helpful if he could explain why he holds this belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the two-minute mark, Dr Halvorsen claims that "The risks of vaccines are downplayed and in fact, the risks of the diseases that are meant to be protected by vaccines are also exaggerated" - fortunately, Adam Finn responds to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think that we have to be a bit careful that we use evidence rather than opinion in these kind of conclusions.&lt;br&gt;
The epidemiology of vaccine-preventable disease provides a very solid base for the programmes that we use. All of which, in this country, are very carefully scrutinised for cost benefit as well as for health benefit. So, I think it's important to recognise that the opinions that Dr Halvorsen expresses today and in the Daily Mail put him in a very small minority amongst GPs who are equally well qualified to comment and who don't agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenter then remarks: "And the point, Adam Finn, that you make, is that we don't know - we don't meet - we don't see on the front pages - the people who are protected by vaccines." For every death or adverse event that is linked to vaccination, whether correctly or spuriously, there are many lives saved. The problem is that any deaths will be highly visible, whereas the lives saved are unseen - as Adam Finn puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... stories such as this story this week, and this poor girl, are very powerful. They have very powerful effects on us. But what we don't see, and are not really aware of, are the vast armies of people who are walking around healthy, unmaimed, and 'not dead' today because of the vaccines we've been using for the last 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The system works by measuring interference between nodes of wireless devices. When someone walks through the field, the change in resistance is detected and plotted by a central computer. &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/10/researchers-see-through-walls-with-wireless-mesh-gear.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss"&gt;Ars technica&lt;/a&gt; reports:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The basic idea behind the work is the assumption that transmissions between any two IEEE 802.15.4 devices travel within an ellipse centered on a straight line between those points. It's not possible to know which path a given transmission took, as different paths will be subject to different interference conditions. But it is possible to figure out when something along the paths changes position, because the signal strength of a subset of the paths will change as a result of the altered interference.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;To get any significant resolution requires a mesh of devices and some very clever maths. However, as WiFi devices become ever cheaper and more commonplace in homes and offices, the potential of using them as a spy system grows. For example, I could see this being used as an integrated motion-detector system in home or office environments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just remember: it can't see you if you don't move...&lt;br&gt;

It wasn't very ceremonious at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down first to watch a live video stream of Bill Maher's show, with special guest Richard Dawkins. It was good, it was funny, it was abrasive, and Maher didn't say anything crazy at all. Dawkins did not get much of an opportunity to say much, again; that's a problem with some of these shows, like Colbert, where the personality of the host leaves little room for the guests. Dawkins acquitted himself well, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Maher show, we got to listen to &lt;a href="http://www.mrdeity.com/"&gt;Mr Deity&lt;/a&gt;. This was pretty darned cool; not only did he show video clips, but the whole cast was there, and they recreated a couple of the episodes live. We learned that Lucy is, in real life, married to Mr Deity, which would seem to mean that Satan is actually Mrs Deity. The theological implications of this revelation were not discussed, but should have been. Mr Deity is also an ex-Mormon, yet another bit of theological dynamite that will no doubt shake all of organized religion to its core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher and Dawkins arrived near the end of Mr Deity's talk, and I know that's what everyone wants to hear about. I was seated at the same table with Maher, but sadly, there was no opportunity to have a conversation with him. Dawkins introduced him, he gave a short speech, he got surrounded by a photograph-taking mob, he left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news for all the critics of this choice is that Dawkins pulled no punches. In his introduction, he praised &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt; and thanked Maher for his contributions to freethought, but he also very clearly and unambiguously stated that some of his beliefs about medicine were simply crazy. He did a good job of walking a difficult tightrope; he made it clear that the award was granted for some specific worthy matters, his humorous approach to religion, while carefully dissociating the AAI from any endorsement of crackpot medicine. It won't be enough, I know, but the effort was made, and talking to Dawkins afterwards there was no question but that Maher's quackery was highly objectionable. I also got the impression that he felt the critics of the award were making good and reasonable points, and that he felt the awkwardness of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher's talk was hilarious, too. He's definitely one of us in his opposition to religion's influence on the culture, if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, and just to make you all jealous, I went out to dinner afterwards with Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennett. If it makes you feel better, Dan had some criticisms of my talk — I was arguing that it&amp;#39;s a mistake to talk about design in evolution, Dan wants to salvage the word from the hands of creationists and thinks we can talk about design without implying intent at all. I am not convinced, but he does make an interesting case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bisheff was discussing Tom Paine, that fascinating patriot and rabble-rouser of the American Revolution. Atheists love the guy; he wasn't one of us, since he was a deist, but he was a real firebrand in his opposition to organized religion. I think a historical analysis of this important figure in American history is the kind of thing we ought to encourage in freethought meetings; we aren't all about finding contradictions in the Bible and going rah-rah for science, you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this was a very academic talk, following the convention of formal papers in many branches of the humanities: he stood up there at the podium and read from a paper. Yikes. He lost a lot of people early, who just walked out of him in boredom, I'm sorry to say. I'm especially sorry since they missed the weird turn it took later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bisheff wanted to emphasize that Paine was not an atheist (which was fine, since he wasn&amp;#39;t), and went on to discuss some of his ideas about science, and nature, and god, and the afterlife. Again, not a problem, since he had those ideas…except that Bisheff seemed to want to regard them uncritically, as good ways of looking at the world, and he seemed to be enjoying taking a few potshots at atheists. And I&amp;#39;m sorry, but Paine, as described here, had some wacky beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tried to justify some of the 'spiritual' views by claiming that they were like the premises of mathematics, lacking an empirical foundation and not susceptible to proof by materialists, because they reside in a plane outside of mere worldly matters. That was annoying enough in its lack of connection to reality, but then he proceeded to tell us about true science and scientists. Apparently, a true scientist of the future (we aren't ready for this yet) will incorporate the mystical as well as the natural in his vision of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That woke me up from the snooze of the talk format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually asked him a few questions. I suggested that science is a rather pragmatic and methodological practice, so I'd like to know &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; we were to study the mystical. I also told him that while I didn't disagree that Paine had these spiritual views, it would be truer to the freethought that he endorsed if we did not simply accept the opinions of Tom Paine, but that a &lt;i&gt;critical&lt;/i&gt; analysis would be far more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a rather rambling reply back. Apparently Tom Paine was a proponent of transcendental science, whatever that was. Bisheff tried to give an example, and talked about a study of baby babbling that showed that some fraction weren't actually babbling, but were speaking in the tongue of some ancient Buddhist sect. We just weren't ready to comprehend this fact, and scientists run away from such a phenomenon that we can't explain. Yeah, we were somehow talking about reincarnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person next to me wondered if we'd somehow wandered into a Templeton seminar. I have to agree, it was crazy inappropriate. However, I would like to be the first to endorse the award of a posthumous Templeton Prize to Thomas Paine, hero of the American Revolution. It seems only fair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/aai_maurice_bisheff.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/vfAw4RZp5lY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254555285202"><id gr:original-id="http://scepticsbook.com/?p=2046">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aef405b6529acfb8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><category term="anti-vaccination"/><category term="bad journalism"/><category term="cervical cancer"/><category term="defamation"/><category term="HPV vaccine"/><category term="libel"/><category term="Natural News"/><title type="html">Natural News skates on legal thin ice over girl’s death</title><published>2009-10-03T06:48:56Z</published><updated>2009-10-03T06:48:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/10/03/natural-news-skates-on-legal-thin-ice-over-death/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scepticsbook.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, 14 year old Natalie Morton &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6236699/14-year-old-dies-after-being-given-cervical-cancer-jab.html"&gt;died just hours after receiving the HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports say she felt faint, passed out at school, and was unable to be revived by paramedics. Autopsy results released this week, reveal that &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE5905EN20091001"&gt;she died from a malignant tumour&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the cause of death was unrelated to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind that these are the facts being presented to us, the anti-vax lobby have latched onto this death as evidence that the HPV vaccine kills. They have even gone so far as to  call the autopsy report fake and the pathologist who conducted the autopsy a liar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This from &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/027151_cancer_cervical_cancer_Natalie_Morton.html"&gt;NaturalNews dot com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, the mainstream media is reporting an obviously-fabricated explanation for her death. A pathologist is declaring that Natalie died from a “malignant chest tumor” that just coincidentally and suddenly killed her within hours after she received the cervical cancer vaccine. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opinion piece, written by Mike Adams, goes onto suggest that the explanation is purely a cover up to protect the billion dollar vaccine industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The continuation of global cervical cancer vaccination programs — which generate billions in profits — absolutely required blaming Natalie’s death on something other than the vaccine. Blaming it on cancer is very easy to do, since every person living today has cancerous micro-tumors in their body right now. All the pathologist had to do was locate such a micro-tumor in Natalie’s body, then dismiss the vaccine altogether.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a lawyer friend of mine pointed out, these statements constitute serious defamation against the pathologist, in particular this statement;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“But why would a pathologist cover up the true cause of Natalie Morton’s death?..”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then this statement about the executives of the vaccine manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It takes a real cold-hearted CEO to watch your product potentially kill a 14-year-old girl in mere hours and then continue to recommend that same product to millions more”. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in an even more preposterous link, the author suggests a statement by a GSK spokesperson which says “GSK’s deepest sympathies lie with the parents at this very sad time” is merely a Freudian slip since it contains the word “parents” and “lie”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editors of Natural News would be wise to fact check their stories and ensure they are not putting themselves at risk of defamation suits by allowing their contributors to make such accusations. Mind you, they don’t have a reputation for fact checking before publishing stories, as is evidenced by their recent publication about an alleged lawsuit challenging compulsory vaccination in the USA, which turned out to be a hoax. The retraction can be read &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/026818_vaccination_vaccines_flu_vaccine.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or is reproduced below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(NaturalNews) Editor’s Note: It has come to our attention that the following article is factually incorrect. It was written by a contributing writer, then approved by an in-house editor who did not catch the significant errors in this article. As a result of these significant errors, and due to our commitment to publishing only true and accurate information to the best of our ability, we have made an editorial decision to reject further articles from this author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NaturalNews deeply regrets this unintentional error, and we are brainstorming new ways to put in place tighter fact-checking oversight so that the same mistake does not happen again in the future. We thank all those who have brought this important matter to our attention, and we pledge to increase our efforts to reject stories that contain factual inaccuracies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the record, what was factually incorrect about the story (which we confirmed by phone with a clerk of United States District Court of Trenton, New Jersey) is that no such injunction has been filed. Thus, the entire premise of the story was factually incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here at NaturalNews, we strive to bring you accurate, honest information on these topics, and we deeply regret the unintentional publishing of the inaccurate information that previously appeared in this article space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also resulted in the AVN publishing and distributing an incorrect press release, which was never retracted, despite several people politely suggesting that this would be the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mate even suggested that if the editors of Natural News have any money they might soon be separated from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would expect if you are accusing pharmaceutical companies of cover-up and fraud you would sure to  have amassed buckets of evidence and conducted precise research. Because one thing’s for sure, Big Pharma are certainly not lacking in money, legal muscle or time.&lt;/p&gt;

Richert was an atheist who fought in Viet Nam, and a lot of the talk was a rather rambling reminiscence with photos of the war; I didn't quite see the point. At the end, though, it was very affecting. He talked about incidents that made an impression on him: a friend who survived a harrowing firefight, and attributed his survival to a beneficent god; and a few days later, an innocent Vietnamese baby who was killed by shrapnel from a grenade. He made the point that there was no loving god who could have so cruelly thrown away the life of a child, while granting survival to a soldier fighting in the country. Sad stuff with some real emotional punch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are atheists in foxholes. And they seem to be a little more appreciative of the tragedy of war than the blithe Christians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/aai_robert_richert.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/54Y3j73kCQY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254554088667"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/aai_toni_marano.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e187bc8c84dbae0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">AAI: Toni Marano</title><published>2009-10-03T07:44:58Z</published><updated>2009-10-03T07:44:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/OI-jNazXiY8/aai_toni_marano.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/aai_toni_marano.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As soon as you walk into the conference hall, you can't miss the big posters of a semi-nude &lt;a href="http://tonimarano.com/"&gt;Toni Marano&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Along similar lines, I'm seeing more young people and more women in attendance; not enough of either, but still a good sign of a healthy, growing movement.&lt;/p&gt;

I have to be brief, unfortunately; tomorrow is &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; busy day, which will be starting with a session with Mr Deity, so I need to get some sleep sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Russell Blackford! He's a very nice fellow, especially since he gave a talk I could agree with 100%. He was discussing the virtues of blasphemy; he actually made an argument that we have a kind of &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/10/tale-of-three-generations-cfi-and.html"&gt;moral responsibility to blaspheme&lt;/a&gt;. He addressed a couple of ideas, actually; one was the issue of how we know whether religious beliefs aren't true (quickly dismissed; religion is incompatible with the results of rational inquiry), and spent more time with the question of why we atheists should regard it as urgent to loudly say that religious beliefs aren't true. He discussed the recent attempts by the UN to add special protections to religious belief, which actually contradict personal liberties, and also showed that existing UN guidelines already compromise free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You people should be reading &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/"&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;, you know.

Comedy Tour’s Christian loses his faith</title><published>2009-10-03T05:43:11Z</published><updated>2009-10-03T05:43:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/02/coexist-comedy-tours-christian-loses-his-faith/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/coexist2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/coexist2.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="309"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/11/25/the-coexist-comedy-tour/"&gt;The Coexist? Comedy Tour&lt;/a&gt;, which began a few years ago, had a pretty novel concept. It was a collection of touring stand-up comedians, each representing a different religion (or lack thereof), their own. And their routines too were focused particularly on their religions. It was a rather great idea that promoted tolerance in the marketplace of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, one interestingly little nugget is that John Ross, Coexists’ former Christian representative has announced that &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/02/christian-comic-loses-faith/"&gt;he is not a Christian anymore&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a surprising admission from a man known as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Christian in the &lt;em&gt;Coexist? Comedy Tour&lt;/em&gt;, a troupe of stand-up comedians who tell jokes about religion. Halfway through his two-year stint with Coexist, Ross began asking tour co-founder [and atheist] Keith Lowell Jensen, “So, hypothetically speaking, say your Christian wasn’t a Christian anymore?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Ross is no longer with the tour, or with Christianity, he insists &lt;em&gt;Coexist&lt;/em&gt; is not the reason he lost faith. “I had issues with my faith way before I even did comedy,” he said. “Even in the midst of being a Christian, I still struggled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did he lose his faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Coexist&lt;/em&gt; was a safe place to poke fun at my own religion,” he said. “There’s not really a place to do that in church. It’s always like you’re trying to destroy someone’s faith by asking a rational question. They think it’s loaded with an evil spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, you can see John Ross performing at the Coexist? Comedy Tour (beginning at the 5:25 mark):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;July 22 1941. The girl next door is getting married. Anne Frank is leaning out of the window of her house in Amsterdam to get a good look at the bride and groom. It is the only time Anne Frank has ever been captured on film. At the time of her wedding, the bride lived on the second floor at Merwedeplein 39. The Frank family lived at number 37, also on the second floor. The Anne Frank House can offer you this film footage thanks to the cooperation of the couple. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really want to know is what happened. I can't be in L.A. this weekend.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000203" title=""&gt;Circadian and Social Cues Regulate Ion Channel Trafficking&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Excitable cells, such as neurons and muscle cells, control behavior by generating action potentials, electrical signals that propagate along the cell membrane. Action potentials are generated when the cell allows charged molecules (ions) such as sodium and potassium to move across the membrane through specialized proteins called ion channels. By changing the number of ion channels in the plasma membrane, excitable cells can rapidly remodel their functional characteristics, potentially causing changes in behavior. To gain an understanding of how environmental events cause the remodeling of excitable cell membranes and the resulting behavioral adaptations, we studied the electric communication/navigation signals of an electric fish, Sternopygus macrurus. High amplitude signals facilitate communication and electrolocation, but are energetically costly and more detectable by those predators that can detect electrical signals. We found that Sternopygus increase signal amplitude at night, when they are active, and increase signal amplitude rapidly during social encounters. Electrocytes, the cells that produce the signal, rapidly boost the signal amplitude when they allow more sodium to cross the cell membrane, thereby generating larger action potentials. To increase sodium currents during the action potential, electrocytes rapidly insert additional sodium channels into the cell membrane in response to hormones released into circulation by the pituitary. By adding new ion channels to the electrocyte membrane only during periods of activity or social encounters and removing these channels during inactive periods, these animals can save energy and reduce predation risks associated with communication.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007336" title=""&gt;It's not too Late for the Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja): High Levels Of Genetic Diversity and Differentiation Can Fuel Conservation Programs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) is the largest Neotropical bird of prey and is threatened by human persecution and habitat loss and fragmentation. Current conservation strategies include local education, captive rearing and reintroduction, and protection or creation of trans-national habitat blocks and corridors. Baseline genetic data prior to reintroduction of captive-bred stock is essential for guiding such efforts but has not been gathered previously. We assessed levels of genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history for harpy eagles using samples collected throughout a large portion of their geographic distribution in Central America (n = 32) and South America (n = 31). Based on 417 bp of mitochondrial control region sequence data, relatively high levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity were estimated for both Central and South America, although haplotype diversity was significantly higher for South America. Historical restriction of gene flow across the Andes (i.e. between our Central and South American subgroups) is supported by coalescent analyses, the haplotype network and significant FST values, however reciprocally monophyletic lineages do not correspond to geographical locations in maximum likelihood analyses. A sudden population expansion for South America is indicated by a mismatch distribution analysis, and further supported by significant (p&amp;lt;0.05) negative values of Fu and Li&amp;#39;s DF and F, and Fu&amp;#39;s FS. This expansion, estimated at approximately 60 000 years BP (99 000-36 000 years BP 95% CI), encompasses a transition from a warm and dry time period prior to 50 000 years BP to an interval of maximum precipitation (50 000-36 000 years BP). Notably, this time period precedes the climatic and habitat changes associated with the last glacial maximum. In contrast, a multimodal distribution of haplotypes was observed for Central America suggesting either population equilibrium or a recent decline. High levels of mitochondrial genetic diversity in combination with genetic differentiation among subgroups within regions and between regions highlight the importance of local population conservation in order to preserve maximal levels of genetic diversity in this species. Evidence of historically restricted female-mediated gene flow is an important consideration for captive-breeding programs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007289" title=""&gt;Spread of Avian Influenza Viruses by Common Teal (Anas crecca) in Europe&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the recent spread of highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 subtypes, avian influenza virus (AIV) dispersal has become an increasing focus of research. As for any other bird-borne pathogen, dispersal of these viruses is related to local and migratory movements of their hosts. In this study, we investigated potential AIV spread by Common Teal (Anas crecca) from the Camargue area, in the South of France, across Europe. Based on bird-ring recoveries, local duck population sizes and prevalence of infection with these viruses, we built an individual-based spatially explicit model describing bird movements, both locally (between wintering areas) and at the flyway scale. We investigated the effects of viral excretion duration and inactivation rate in water by simulating AIV spread with varying values for these two parameters. The results indicate that an efficient AIV dispersal in space is possible only for excretion durations longer than 7 days. Virus inactivation rate in the environment appears as a key parameter in the model because it allows local persistence of AIV over several months, the interval between two migratory periods. Virus persistence in water thus represents an important component of contamination risk as ducks migrate along their flyway. Based on the present modelling exercise, we also argue that HP H5N1 AIV is unlikely to be efficiently spread by Common Teal dispersal only.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000515" title=""&gt;Novel Vaccines to Human Rabies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rabies, the most fatal of all infectious diseases, remains a major public health problem in developing countries, claiming the lives of an estimated 55,000 people each year. Most fatal rabies cases, with more than half of them in children, result from dog bites and occur among low-income families in Southeast Asia and Africa. Safe and efficacious vaccines are available to prevent rabies. However, they have to be given repeatedly, three times for pre-exposure vaccination and four to five times for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). In cases of severe exposure, a regimen of vaccine combined with a rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) preparation is required. The high incidence of fatal rabies is linked to a lack of knowledge on the appropriate treatment of bite wounds, lack of access to costly PEP, and failure to follow up with repeat immunizations. New, more immunogenic but less costly rabies virus vaccines are needed to reduce the toll of rabies on human lives. A preventative vaccine used for the immunization of children, especially those in high incidence countries, would be expected to lower fatality rates. Such a vaccine would have to be inexpensive, safe, and provide sustained protection, preferably after a single dose. Novel regimens are also needed for PEP to reduce the need for the already scarce and costly RIG and to reduce the number of vaccine doses to one or two. In this review, the pipeline of new rabies vaccines that are in pre-clinical testing is provided and an opinion on those that might be best suited as potential replacements for the currently used vaccines is offered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007312" title=""&gt;Drugs Associated with More Suicidal Ideations Are also Associated with More Suicide Attempts&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), some drugs, including CB1 antagonists for obesity treatment, have been shown to cause increased suicidal ideation. A key question is whether drugs that increase or are associated with increased suicidal ideations are also associated with suicidal behavior, or whether drug-induced suicidal ideations are unlinked epiphenomena that do not presage the more troubling and potentially irrevocable outcome of suicidal behavior. This is difficult to determine in RCTs because of the rarity of suicidal attempts and completions. To determine whether drugs associated with more suicidal ideations are also associated with more suicide attempts in large spontaneous adverse event (AE) report databases. Generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event (AE) Reporting System (AERS) data from 2004 to 2008. A total of 1,404,470 AEs from 832 drugs were analyzed as a function of reports of suicidal ideations; other non-suicidal adverse reactions; drug class; proportion of reports from males; and average age of subject for which AE was filed. Drug was treated as the unit of analysis, thus the statistical models effectively had 832 observations. Reported suicide attempts and completed suicides per drug. 832 drugs, ranging from abacavir to zopiclone, were evaluated. The 832 drugs, as primary suspect drugs in a given adverse event, accounted for over 99.9% of recorded AERS. Suicidal ideations had a significant positive association with suicide attempts (p&amp;lt;.0001) and had an approximately 131-fold stronger magnitude of association than non-suicidal AERs, after adjusting for drug class, gender, and age. In AE reports, drugs that are associated with increased suicidal ideations are also associated with increased suicidal attempts or completions. This association suggests that drug-induced suicidal ideations observed in RCTs plausibly represent harbingers that presage the more serious suicide attempts and completions and should be a cause for concern.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000152" title=""&gt;Ensuring Integrity in Comparative Effectiveness Research: Accentuate the Negative&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In recent weeks, PLoS Medicine has published several research papers that challenge current health care practices.

&lt;p&gt;One study found that a campaign to promote solar drinking water disinfection did not substantially decrease rates of childhood diarrhea [1]. Another found more than a doubled risk of hospitalization for bradycardia in older people taking cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat cognitive impairment [2]. A systematic review failed to find any randomized trials that support the internationally recommended retreatment regimen for tuberculosis [3]. Finally, a study of one of the main international registries for clinical trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, found that requirements to register clinical trials have not resulted in high publication rates [4].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study that questions the accepted or desired way of doing things can be at least as important as one that supports a new approach. Physicians mindful of Hippocrates' vow to "first do no harm" should take a keen interest in such studies, for while a new intervention that proves efficacious in clinical trials may pass slowly, if at all, through practical barriers to effective implementation, the demonstration that an existing practice is ineffective or potentially harmful can (or should) prompt a rapid change in research agendas, policy, and clinical care. Knowing what doesn't work is particularly useful in efforts to control medical spending, where redirecting limited resources away from ineffective interventions is of obvious benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000665" title=""&gt;Public Access to Genome-Wide Data: Five Views on Balancing Research with Privacy and Protection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just over twelve months ago, PLoS Genetics published a paper [1] demonstrating that, given genome-wide genotype data from an individual, it is, in principle, possible to ascertain whether that individual is a member of a larger group defined solely by aggregate genotype frequencies, such as a forensic sample or a cohort of participants in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). As a consequence, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Wellcome Trust agreed to shut down public access not just to individual genotype data but even to aggregate genotype frequency data from each study published using their funding. Reactions to this decision span the full breadth of opinion, from "too little, too late--the public trust has been breached" to "a heavy-handed bureaucratic response to a practically minimal risk that will unnecessarily inhibit scientific research." Scientific concerns have also been raised over the conditions under which individual identity can truly be accurately determined from GWAS data. These concerns are addressed in two papers published in this month's issue of PLoS Genetics [2],[3]. We received several submissions on this topic and decided to assemble these viewpoints as a contribution to the debate and ask readers to contribute their thoughts through the PLoS online commentary features.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000668" title=""&gt;Needles in the Haystack: Identifying Individuals Present in Pooled Genomic Data&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this report, we evaluate a recently-published method for resolving whether individuals are present in a complex genomic DNA mixture. Based on the intuition that an individual will be genetically "closer" to a sample containing him than to a sample not, the method investigated here uses a distance metric to quantify the similarity of an individual relative to two population samples. Although initial applications of this approach showed a promising false-negative rate, the accuracy of the assumed null distribution (and hence the true false-positive rate) remained uninvestigated; here, we explore this question analytically and describe tests of this method to assess the likelihood that an individual who is not in the mixture is mistakenly classified as being a member. Our results show that the method has a high false-positive rate in practice due to its sensitivity to underlying assumptions, limiting its utility for inferring the presence of an individual in a population. By revealing both the strengths and limitations of the proposed method, we elucidate situations in which this distance metric may be used in an appropriate manner in forensics and medical privacy policy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hede is a freelance writer in Chapel Hill and has contributed before to Science Careers, particularly with this article on the challenges of women MD-PhDs and another on why so many of us have crappy interpersonal and lab management skills.

The current article focuses primarily on the medical profession given its placement in the clinical/translational section but these issues are true for PhD trainees as well:

Depression among medical trainees is well-documented. A recent large-scale survey of medical students and residents at six major medical schools revealed that one in five have mild to severe depression, a rate 15% to 30% higher than the general public. One out of every 17 even said they had thought about suicide. The study, reported in the journal Academic Medicine in February, brought to the fore the problem of depression among students immersed in the rigors of medical training.

"Certainly, medical school, residency, Ph.D. training, all those kinds of advanced degrees are set up with a lot of expectations, and by and large the people that are doing them are driven," says Deborah Goebert, a psychiatrist at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, and lead investigator of the study. These stressors, along with lack of sleep, financial concerns, and family pressures, can push people into an episode of clinical depression, she says.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine should be subject to statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry to the register should normally be through a Bachelor degree with Honours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007"&gt;Consultation opens on the Pittilo report&lt;/a&gt;: help stop the Department of Health making a fool of itself &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043"&gt;Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health consultation shuts on November 2nd.  If you haven’t responded yet, please do.  It would be an enormous setback for reason and common sense if the government were to give a stamp of official approval to people who are often no more than snake-oil salesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I emailed my submission to the Pittilo consultation to the Department of Health, at &lt;a href="mailto:HRDListening@dh.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;HRDListening@dh.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The submission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent the following documents, updated versions of those already posted earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submission to the Department of Health, for the consultation on the Pittilo report [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/pittilo-consultation-response.pdf"&gt;download pdf&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is taught in degrees in herbal and traditional Chinese medicine?  [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Pittilo-consultation-What-is-taught.pdf"&gt;download pdf&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also completed their questionnaire, despite its deficiencies. In case it is any help to anyone, this is what I said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The questionnaire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q1: What evidence is there of harm to the public currently as a result of the activities of  acupuncturists, herbalists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners? What is its likelihood and severity?&lt;/p&gt;
 Harm
 No Harm
 Unsure
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comment &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major source of harm is the cruel deception involved in making false claims of benefit to desperate patients. This applies to all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of herbal and TCM there is danger from toxicity because herbal preparations are unstandardised so those that do contain an active ingredient are given in an unknown dose. This is irresponsible and dangerous (but would not be changed by the proposals for regulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition TCM suffers from recurrent problems of contamination with heavy metals, prescription drugs and so on. Again this would not be the business of the proposed form of regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q2:   Would this harm be lessened by statutory regulation?  If so, how?&lt;/p&gt;
 Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed form of regulation would be no help at all.  The HPC has already said that it is not concerned with whether or not the drug works, and, by implication, does not see itself as preventing  false health claims (just as the GCC doesn’t do this). False claims are the responsibility of Trading Standards who are meant to enforce the Consumer Protection Unfair Trading Regulations (May 2008),  though they do not at present enforce them very effectively. Also Advertisng Standards. The proposed regulation would not help, and could easily hinder public safety as shown by the fact that the GCC has itself been referred to the Advertisng Standards Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions of toxicity and contamination are already the responsibility of Trading Standards and the MHRA. Regulation by the HPC would not help at all. The HPC is not competent to deal with such questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q3: What do you envisage would be the benefit to the public, to practitioners and to businesses, associated with introducing statutory regulation?&lt;/p&gt;
 Significant benefit
 Some benefit
 No benefit
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question is badly formulated because the answer is different according to whether you are referring to the public, to practitioners or to businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public would be endangered by the form of regulation that is proposed, as is shown very clearly by the documents that I have submitted separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of practitioners and businesses, there might be a small benefit, if the statutory regulation gave the impression that HM and TCM had government endorsement and must therefore be safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also one way that the regulation could harm practitioners and businesses. If the HPC received a very large number of complaints about false health claims, just as the GCC has done recently,  not only would it cost a large amount of money to process the claims, but the attendant bad publicity could harm practitioners. It is quite likely that this would occur since false claims to benefit  sick people are rife in the areas of acupuncture, HM and TCM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q4: What do you envisage would be the regulatory burden and financial costs to the public, to practitioners, and to businesses, associated with introducing   statutory regulation? Are these costs justified by the benefits and are they proportionate to the risks? If so, in what way?&lt;/p&gt;
 Justified
 Not Justified
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly not justified. Given that I believe that the proposed form of regulation would endanger patients, no cost at all would be justified. But even if there were a marginal benefit, the cost would  be quite unjustified. The number of practitioners involved is very large. It would involve a huge expansion of an existing quango, at a time when the government is trying to reduce the number of quangos.   Furthermore, if the HPC were flooded with complaints about false health claims, as the GCC has been, the costs in legal fees could be enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q5: If herbal and TCM practitioners are subject to statutory regulation, should the right to prepare and commission unlicensed herbal medicines be restricted to statutorily regulated practitioners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it would make much difference. The same (often false) ideas are shared by all HM people and that would continue to be the same with or without SR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q6: If herbal and TCM practitioners are not statutorily regulated, how (if at all) should unlicensed herbal medicines prepared or commissioned by these practitioners be regulated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could carry on as now, but the money that would have been spent on SR should instead be used to give the Office of Trading Standards and the MHRA the ability to exert closer scrutiny and to enforce more effectively laws that already exist. Present laws, if enforced, are quite enough to protect the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q7: What would be the effect on public, practitioners and businesses if, in order to comply with the requirements of European medicines legislation, practitioners were unable to supply manufactured unlicensed herbal medicines commissioned from a third party?&lt;/p&gt;
 Significant effect
 Some effect
 No effect
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;European laws,especialliy in food area, are getting quite strict about the matters of efficacy.  The proposed regulation, which ignores efficacy, could well be incompatible with European law, if not now, then soon. This would do no harm to legitimate business though it might affect adversely businesses which make false claims (and there are rather a lot of the latter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q8: How might the risk of harm to the public be reduced other than by orthodox statutory regulation? For example by voluntary self-regulation underpinned by consumer protection legislation and by greater public awareness, by accreditation of voluntary registration bodies, or by a statutory or voluntary licensing regime?&lt;/p&gt;
 Voluntary self-regulation
 Accreditation of voluntary bodies
 Statutory or voluntary licensing
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with the premise, for reasons given in detail in separate documents. I believe that ‘orthodox statutory regulation’, if that means the Pittilo  proposals, would increase, not decrease, the risk to the public. Strengthening the powers of Trading Standards, the MHRA and such consumer protection legislation would be far more effective in reducing  risk to the public than the HPC could ever be.  Greater public awareness of the weakness of the evidence for the efficacy of these treatments would obviously help too, but can’t do the job on  its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q10: What would you envisage would be the benefits to the public, to practitioners, and to businesses, for the alternatives to statutory regulation outlined at Question 8?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on which alternative you are referring to. The major benefit of enforcement of existing laws by Trading Standards and/or the MHRA would be (a) to protect the public from risk, (b) to protect   the public from health fraud and (c) almost certainly lower cost to the tax payer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q11: If you feel that not all three practitioner groups justify statutory regulation, which group(s) does/do not and please give your reasons why/why not?&lt;/p&gt;
 Acupuncture
 Herbal Medicine
 TCM
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of them. The differences are marginal. In the case of acupuncture there has been far more good research than for HM or TCM.  But the result of that research is to show that in most cases the  effects are likely to be no more than those expected of a rather theatrical placebo. Furthermore the extent to which acupuncture has a bigger effect than no-acupuncture in a NON-BLIND comparison, is  usually too small and transient to offer any clinical advantage (so it doesn’t really matter whether the effect is placebo or not, it is too small to be useful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of HM, and even more of TCM, there is simply not enough research to give much idea of their usefulness,  with a small handful of exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a conclusion that DH seems to have ignored in the past. It makes absolutely no sense to talk about “properly trained practitioners” without first deciding whether the treatments  work or not. There can be no such thing as “proper training” in  a discipline that offers no benefit over placebo. It is a major fault of the Pittilo recommendations that they (a) ignore this basic principle and (b) are very over-optimistic about the state of the  evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q12: Would it be helpful to the public for these practitioners to be regulated in a way which differentiates them from the regulatory regime for mainstream professions publicly perceived as having an evidence base of clinical effectiveness? If so, why? If not, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
 Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might indeed be useful if regulation pointed out the very thin evidence base for HM and TCM but it would look rather silly. The public would say how can it be that the DH is granting statutory regulation to things that don’t work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q13: Given the Government’s commitment to reducing the overall burden of unnecessary statutory regulation, can you suggest which areas of healthcare practice present sufficiently low risk so that they could be regulated in a different, less burdensome way or de-regulated, if a decision is made to statutorily regulate acupuncturists, herbalists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners?&lt;/p&gt;
 Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stated above, the.only form of regulation that is needed, and the only form that would protect the public, is through consumer protection regulations, most of which already exist (though they are enforced in a very inconsistent way). Most statutory regulation is objectionable, not on libertarian grounds, but because it doesn’t achieve the desired ends (and is expensive). In this case of folk medicine, like HM and TCM, the effect would be exactly the opposite of that desired as shown in separate documents that I have submitted to the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q14: If there were to be statutory regulation, should the Health Professions Council (HPC) regulate all three professions? If not, which one(s) should the HPC not regulate?&lt;/p&gt;
 Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HPC should regulate none of them. It has never before regulated any form of alternative medicine and it is ill-equipped to do so. Its statement that it doesn’t matter that there is very little evidence that the treatments work poses a danger to patients (as well as being contrary to its own rules).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q15: If there were to be statutory regulation, should the Health Professions Council or the General Pharmaceutical Council/Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland regulate herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners?&lt;/p&gt;
 HPC
 GPC/PSNI
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither. The GPC is unlikely to care about whether the treatments work any more than  the RPSGB did, or the GCC does now. The problems would be exactly the same whichever body did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q16: If neither, who should and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I have said repeatedly, it should be left to Trading Standards, the MHRA and other consumer protection regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q17:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Should acupuncture be subject to a different form of regulation from that for herbalism and traditional Chinese medicine? If so, what?&lt;/p&gt;
 Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;p&gt;b) Can acupuncture be adequately regulated through local means, for example through Health and Safety legislation, Trading Standards legislation and Local Authority licensing?&lt;/p&gt;
 Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(a) No -all should be treated the same. Acupuncture is part of TCM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Should the titles acupuncturist, herbalist and [traditional] Chinese medicine practitioner be protected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) If your answer is no which ones do you consider should not be legally protected?&lt;/p&gt;
 Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. It makes no sense to protect titles until such time as it has been shown that the practitioners can make a useful contribution to medicine (above placebo effect). That does not deny that placebos  may be useful at times. but if that is all they are doing, the title should be ‘placebo practitioners’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q19: Should a new model of regulation be tested where it is the functions of acupuncture, herbal medicine and TCM that are protected, rather than the titles of acupuncturist, herbalist or Chinese medicine practitioner?&lt;/p&gt;
 Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. This makes absolutely no sense when there is so little knowledge about what is meant by the ” functions of acupuncture, herbal medicine and TCM”.Insofar as they don’t work (better than placebo), there IS no function. Any attempt to define function when there is so little solid evidence (at least for HM and TCM) is doomed to failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q20: If statutory professional self-regulation is progressed, with a model of protection of title, do you agree with the proposals for “grandparenting” set out in the Pittilo report?&lt;/p&gt;
 Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. I believe the Pittilo report should be ignored entirely. The whole process needs to be thought out again in a more rational way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q22: Could practitioners demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements and communicate effectively with regulators, the public and other healthcare professionals if they do not achieve the standard of English language competence normally required for UK registration? What additional costs would occur for both practitioners and regulatory authorities in this case?&lt;/p&gt;
 Yes
 No
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. It is a serious problem, in TCM especially, that many High Street practitioners speak hardly any English at all. That adds severely to the already considerable risks. There would be no reliable  way to convey what was expected of them. it would be absurd for the taxpayer to pay for them to learn English for the purposes of practising TCM (of course there might be the same case as for any other  immigrant for teaching English on social grounds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q23: What would the impact be on the public, practitioners and businesses (financial and regulatory burden) if practitioners unable to achieve an English language IELTS score of 6.5 or above are unable to register in the UK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant impact&lt;/p&gt;
 Some impact
 No impact
 Unsure
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is not relevant. The aim of regulation is to protect the public from risk (and it should be, but isn’t, an aim to protect them from health fraud). It is not the job of regulation to promote businesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q24: Are there any other matters you wish to draw to our attention?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have submitted three documents via &lt;a href="mailto:HRDListening@dh.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;HRDListening@dh.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;. The first of these puts the case against the form of regulation proposed by Pittilo, far more fluently than is possible in a questionnaire.&lt;br&gt;
Another shows examples of what is actually taught in degrees in acupuncture, HM and TCM. They show very graphically the extent to which the Pittilo proposals would endanger the public, if they were  to be implemented..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">DC&amp;#39;s Improbable Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254523409917"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/dara_obriain_sets_the_record_s.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9bb975a06114a1e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Dara O'Briain sets the record straight</title><published>2009-10-02T23:31:10Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T23:31:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/PnELSkwiGbo/dara_obriain_sets_the_record_s.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/dara_obriain_sets_the_record_s.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Put them all in a sack and hit them with a stick!&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the thing, he had sex with a 13 year old girl in 1977 after drugging her with quaaludes and champagne.  Then he sodomized her.  Just to make it clear what the guy did, here are the links to the specific pages of the documents from the case.  Try to read them and imagine that the girl is your sister, daughter or someone you know and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the "I knew she was 13" link to Smoking Gun page - &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0928091polanskiplea10.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the "Roman got the 13 year old champagne" page - &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0610081polanski13.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the "Roman gave a drunk 13 year old a quaalude" page - &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0610081polanski19.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the "Roman tells the drugged, drunk 13 year old to get naked in the jacuzzi" page - &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0610081polanski23.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the "Roman gets naked and joins the drunk, drugged 13 year old in the jacuzzi" page - &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0610081polanski24.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the "13 year old asks to go home and Roman says no" page - &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0610081polanski27.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the "Roman ignores the 13 year old's pleas to take her home and to not touch her" page - &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0610081polanski28.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the "Roman performs oral sex, vaginal sex, and anal sex on a crying, unwilling, drunk, drugged 13 year old who wants to go home" page - &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0610081polanski29.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the "Roman lies to a woman about orally, vaginally, and anally raping a 13 year old girl, then rapes her again, then she leaves, crying" page - &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0610081polanski30.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm glad that Samantha Geimer has dealt with what happened to her, but her recovery is not the point here.  Also, Polanski's pregnant wife was murdered by members of the Manson family in August of 1969 and I can't imagine what that must have been like, but that's not relevant either.  You don't recover from a tragedy by doing what he did to this girl.  Regardless of what Geimer says now, regardless of what happened before the crime took place, Polanski is responsible for his actions and for subsequently running away from those responsibilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can do the, "well, it's different in Europe - girls who are 13 can be treated differently...they're more adult and make those decisions" dance, but the fact remains that Polanski wasn't in Europe when he committed this crime.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All you need to think of is this: If his name was Ray Pollard and he was from San Bernadino, would anyone be defending him?  The one and only correct answer is, "no".  Case closed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry, one more thing.  Here's Whoopi Goldberg saying that what Polanski did wasn't "rape-rape", and that she doesn't know if it was "consensual".  Thanks for being a tremendous failure for women the world over, Whoopi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/gIOE6-9nQ0o%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The View&lt;/i&gt;: for only being really against "rape-rape", not just "rape".  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should pat Joy Behar, Melissa Gilbert, and...boy, this pains me, but it is required, Sherri Shepard on the back for standing up to the stupidity that was dribbling out of Whoopi's mouth.  Good job, ladies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Edit Follow-Up: Now it seems that Polanski agreed to pay $500,000 to Geimer in a settlement agreement, but may have &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/polanski-agreed-to-500000-payment-in-civil-suit/article1310653/"&gt;never actually paid the money.&lt;/a&gt;  Nicely done, sir.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dead Soul Tribe, "Goodbye City Life"&lt;/b&gt;: mediocre prog metal. Not bad,
   but nothing special either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dave Matthews Band, "Lying in the Hands of God"&lt;/b&gt;: I know, lots of people think
   I'm crazy to like DMB. But I do. And I find this song terribly depressing. One of the
   members of the DMB was an amazing saxaphone player named LeRoi Moore. Moore's 
   saxaphone play was absolutely fantastic - incredibly skillfull, tasteful, with a huge
   range. Moore was killed in an auto accident, and his place was taken in live shows
   by Jeff Coffin from the Flecktones. Coffin is, in my opinion, a godawful
   gimmicky player with no taste, no style, and who knows one volume setting: way too
   loud. This track uses old samples of Moore from before he died - the last time we'll
   get to hear his beautiful playing.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marillion, "The Space" (electric)&lt;/b&gt;: this one is actually a double. I just got 
   the digital version of Marillions new album, which consists of acoustic rewrites
   of a selection of their old songs. This is one of the tracks that they chose. 
   The original version is from "Season's End", the band's first recording with Steve
   Hogarth as the lead singer. It's a great song - one of the best from that album. The
   original version is very interesting - because it's recognizably Marillion, and yet
   there's a huge difference to the sound of the song compared to the stuff they'd been
   performing with Fish on vocals - and that basic difference emerged all at once on
   this album, and stayed with them through the dozen albums since. Like I said,
   it's classic Marillion, with beautiful transitions, elegant instrumental
   breaks, intricate structure. A lovely song, which is carried by Hogarths vocals,
   Kelly's keyboards, and Rothery's electric guitar.
   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marillion, "The Space" (acoustic rewrite)&lt;/b&gt;: An amazing difference. From an
   incredibly dense electric song, to a sparse, intimate acoustic. It's not just an
   acoustic remix, but a really deep rewrite of the song. The rhythm of the vocals has
   changed. The main vocals are now sung mainly against acoustic bass guitar and
   a but of rythmic chunking on the guitar. Everything is much more syncopated. It's
   hard to believe it's the same song. I need a few more listens - but I think I actually
   prefer this newer version - the rhythmic changes and the sparse arrangement just
   increase the emotional impact of the song. It's really quite impressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;IQ, "Breathtaker"&lt;/b&gt;: Bit of a jarring change after the acoustic version of
   "The Space". But IQ is one of the very best neo-progressive bands out there. Like
   Marillion, they started off as a Genesis sound-alike, but grew into their own sound.
   Great song, from "Subterranea", &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; IQ album to buy if you've never heard 
   them before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isis, "From Sinking"&lt;/b&gt;: Post-rock, from one of the harder/louder post-rock
   bands. Isis is a bit of a harder listen for many people, because they include 
   death-metal-style screeched vocals, which can really grate. But their overall
   sound is brilliant - it's worth getting over the vocals to enjoy them.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Three, "Feral"&lt;/b&gt;: Another big transition, but still post-rock. Dirty
   three is a mostly-acoustic post-rock ensemble from the more classical end of the
   spectrum. Their compositional style is much more minimalistic than a lot of others. 
   But it's beautiful stuff. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Flower Kings, "Flight 999 Brinstone Air"&lt;/b&gt;: What can I say about the
   Flower Kings that I haven't said before? THey're a neo-progressive band that's
   fit to drop the neo - they could stand up well next to pretty much any of the
   original wave of prog in both quality and creativity. This is a typical
   instrumental track from them. If you've never listened to the Flower Kings,
   give them a try. It's pure brilliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isotope 217, "New Beyond"&lt;/b&gt;: This is hard to classify. It might be sort-of
   progressive rock. It might be sort-of odd Jazz fusion. I just don't even know where
   to put it. It's a recent acquisition, and to be honest, I haven't formed a firm opinion
   of it yet. (That could be good or bad. Much of my favorite music is stuff that I wasn't
   sure about at first. I tend to like things that challenge me as a listener, and so
   that sometimes means listening a few times to absorb it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abigail's Ghost, "d_letion"&lt;/b&gt;: Abigail's Ghost was recommended to me by 
   a reader as an American neo-prog band that I'd probably like. Unfortunately, I'm really
   not wild about it. I don't know if this album is typical of their sound. But I really
   don't like this one.&lt;/li&gt;

But equally important, they need to avoid making connections with themselves.Unfortunately, the chance of this happening is rather high. As a neurone grows and branches out in all directions, many of the branches will inevitably come into contact with others from the same cell. They&amp;#39;re right next to each other.So, how do brains achieve self-avoidance? The answer, according to a new Nature paper building on previous work, is a clever mechanism involving a single protein, Dscam1. The DNA code which produces it contains three sections (exons), which can each vary in several ways. There are 12 variants of exon 4, 48 of exon 6, and 33 of exon 9.That means that Dscam1 can end up in 12 x 48 x 33 = 19,008 different configurations (isoforms). It&amp;#39;s as if whenever the protein is formed, it rolls a 12 sided dice, a 48 sided dice, and a 33 sided dice, and then ends up signalling the result. The diagram illustrates this nicely. The clever part is that each developing neurone expresses only a few isoforms, entirely at random.If a growing neuronal branch encounters another branch with the same Dscam1 isoform, the two identical proteins interact and the branches repel each other. Because every part of any given cell expresses the same &amp;quot;fingerprint&amp;quot;, this produces self-avoidance. But the chance that another neighbouring cell will have the same protein is very small. There are billions of neurones in the brain, so many will share the same protein, but the chance of a cell encountering another nearby with the identical fingerprint is tiny.In this paper, the authors genetically engineered fruit flies (Drosophila) so that they had fewer than the normal 19,008 Dscam1 variants. (Previous work suggests that the system is similar in mammals.) Flies with 4,752 variants developed normally, but with only 1,152, problems arose: neurones got repelled from other nearby neurones because they shared the same protein. With 576, 24, or 12 isoforms, the problem became progressively worse, as the chance of two cells having the same isoform rose.So, in order to avoid tying themselves in knots, brains need somewhere between about one thousand and five thousand Dscam1 variants. It&amp;#39;s an elegant solution to the problem of neurite self-avoidance, and a lovely example of evolution at work.Hattori D, Chen Y, Matthews BJ, Salwinski L, Sabatti C, Grueber WB, &amp;amp; Zipursky SL (2009).

Comedy Tour&lt;/a&gt; was making the rounds — a collection of comedians from many religious (and non-religious) backgrounds told stories and jokes about their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Ross&lt;/strong&gt; was the “Christian” in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key words there is “was”… &lt;a href="http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content?oid=1281488"&gt;Ross is a Christians no more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s a surprising admission from a man known as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Christian in the &lt;em&gt;Coexist? Comedy Tour&lt;/em&gt;, a troupe of stand-up comedians who tell jokes about religion. Halfway through his two-year stint with Coexist, Ross began asking tour co-founder [and atheist] Keith Lowell Jensen, “So, hypothetically speaking, say your Christian wasn’t a Christian anymore?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Ross is no longer with the tour, or with Christianity, he insists &lt;em&gt;Coexist&lt;/em&gt; is not the reason he lost faith. “I had issues with my faith way before I even did comedy,” he said. “Even in the midst of being a Christian, I still struggled.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What caused the change?  In part, it was the fact that he felt like he could never ask challenging questions in church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“&lt;em&gt;Coexist&lt;/em&gt; was a safe place to poke fun at my own religion,” he said. “There’s not really a place to do that in church. It’s always like you’re trying to destroy someone’s faith by asking a rational question. They think it’s loaded with an evil spirit.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross still attends church with his family — probably out of habit if nothing else — but his faith is on the way out.  It’s a far cry from the youth group leader who dons a Jesus tattoo on his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seems to be handling the change of faith well.  It helps that he has a great support network around him.&lt;/p&gt;

Today I’m repaying the favor by posting for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was away for a looooooong time. On the road with &lt;a href="http://www.scottsigler.com"&gt;Scott Sigler&lt;/a&gt;, helping promote his new book &lt;a href="http://www.scottsigler.com/therookie"&gt;THE ROOKIE&lt;/a&gt;, which I helped publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to visit Elyse, and met a lot of Skepchick fans along the way! I even signed a few books along the way when folks realized I was “A the Skepchick.”  Most, most awesome.  I totally blew it in Houston and missed a chance to see Sam because I simply didn’t have time to think “hey, Sam lives nearby, I should call.” Dammit, dammit, dammit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love a road trip. Reminds me of when I was in college and TheRealBoy took me all over the Midwest to see the sites. Crappy food, bad jokes, good music.  Even so, I could have used an assist to stay entertained on the longer drives when Sigler was &lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/h7rm4"&gt;napping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your favorite thing to do to pass the time on a long road trip?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Any “Rules of the Road” you can share with me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He works in immunology, specifically as related to two major mycoses (Aspergillosis and Cryptococcosis). Rationality and skepticism have been his long-standing interests, which led him into science- and evidence-based medicine. This is his first contribution to this blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html"&gt;Quackademic ‘Medicine’*&lt;/a&gt; is a collective of pseudoscientific, data-free, evidence-less, nonsensical therapeutic modalities (the so-called “alternative” therapies) – otherwise known as “complementary and alternative” medicine (CAM) or integrative or holistic medicine. These include, among other things, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/medical_ethics_children_and_chelation.php"&gt;chelation therapy&lt;/a&gt; (for autism and cardiovascular diseases); &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?cat=4"&gt;chiropractic&lt;/a&gt;; use of  random nutritional supplements; abuse of various prescription drugs; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1430"&gt;coffee enemas&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=415"&gt;naturopathy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?cat=5"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?cat=6"&gt;energy  healing&lt;/a&gt; that invokes manipulation of ‘life force’ or &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?cat=8"&gt;acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=135"&gt;‘healing touch’&lt;/a&gt;, and intercessory prayer – the list goes on, since there is essentially no limit to human stupidity and no depth that the human mind cannot plumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualified  professionals – those who are in the business of doing the hard work of  science  to gather critical evidence regarding the action of a therapy, as well  as those  who implement those modalities routinely and save lives – may perhaps  find it  easy to dismiss the proponents of quackademic medicine as an  ill-informed,  misguided, or downright lunatic, fringe. However, much like a bad case  of  household mold infestation, this community with its myrmidons continues  to  thrive and grow, impervious to reason, immune to evidence, unable to  comprehend  the danger they pose (and the harm they cause) to themselves, their  children  and millions of others on the planet. As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_price_of_anti-vaccine_fanaticism_par_1.php"&gt;discussed  in the science blog &lt;em&gt;Respectful Insolence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  a large part of  that  harm  derives from their promotion of unfounded (and &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/09-06-03"&gt;repeatedly proven to be untrue&lt;/a&gt;)  fears of vaccines causing autism, discouraging a lot of parents from  vaccinating their children and prompting many of them to seek quack  treatments  (some of which are potentially dangerous) to try to ‘cure’ autistic&lt;br&gt;
children. But  still another part – a far more pernicious and pervasive one – has to  do with  the growing presence (and, it seems, acceptance) of quackademic  pseudoscience  in establishments of mainstream academic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most holistic medicine systems (of which CAM, in its current avatar, forms a part) were developed in pre-scientific cultures at a time when  important tenets of modern medicine were not around, such as the germ  theory of infectious disease (the basis for myriads of successful  public health measures), in-depth knowledge of anatomy, physiology and  biochemistry, and most importantly, the scientific method, including  basic research, evidence-based medicine and clinical trials. Modern  medicine emerged in the late 19th century, after much struggle with the  existing alternative therapeutic practices. In modern times, much of  the holistic medical systems have directly borrowed from outmoded,  outdated, often incorrect, and mostly ideology- or religious  faith-based concepts from the pre-modern medicine days; but a  signficant part of the CAM movement has taken a different approach,  euphemistically called ‘biomedical treatment’. This term has caught the  fancy of the alternative medicine crowd, particularly those of the ‘vaccine-causes-autism’ flavor. In this approach, they take various  substances of biological or biochemical origin at random – such as  various amino acids (or chemical modifications thereof), vitamins, chelators of divalent cations (such as EDTA), enzymes and other  nutritional supplements, probiotics, and so forth – and put them into  the body of the so-called patients (including autistic children)  through various routes. Of course, not only there isn’t a shred of  evidence that any of this, alone or in combination, actually works to ‘cure’ anything (including autism), this approach unerringly reveals a  profound ignorance of physiology and biochemistry of any healthy or  diseased systems, as well as an egregious lack – on part of the CAM  practitioners – of caring and empathy with the recipients, who are  nothing less than victims of negligence and abuse, for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/11/the_complaint_against_dr_roy_kerry_kille.php"&gt;unregulated alternative medical practices can turn  quite deadly&lt;/a&gt;. And for the conspiracy theorists amongst the CAM crowd who insist that  all medical research is sponsored the evil pharmaceutical companies  whose only goal is taking people’s money, CAM therapies of various  flavors can easily run upto thousands of dollars every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If  CAM is all holistic medicine, why this insistence on using biochemical  substances of doubtful provenance? Ah, therein lies the nub of the affair.  All form of CAM practitioners, all purveyors of pseudoscientific  nonsensical modalities, crave, above all, the veneer of legitimacy and respectability. They have been steadily pushing for that for quite some  time now. The CAMsters desire to camouflage their ignorance and weird  beliefs with science-y sounding ideas and concepts, so that their  quackery is considered science without them having to go through the  hard, often ill-remunerated, work that is the scientific method. As &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1723"&gt;David Gorski has indicated in his post&lt;/a&gt;, the CAM crowd starts by co-opting and corrupting the language of  science, resulting in scientifically untenable concepts (such as chelation therapy, and ‘detoxication’, an extremely popular term with  the CAM followers), unethical practices (such as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/the_price_of_antivaccination_fanaticism.php"&gt;injection of untested stem cells into cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;), oversimplified theories (such as  gluten-free/casein-free diet fixing a “leaky gut”, when, in reality,  the “leaky gut” is an extreme and potentially lethal stage in the progression of Celiac disease, a genetic condition), and so on. Next step in pushing CAM is to produce and publish in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=99"&gt;journals  that appear to contain science, but not quite&lt;/a&gt;,  as if an article in print were an automatic ascension to credence and  respectability. And now to complete the circle, the CAMsters are  holding meetings that have all the trappings of a scientific meet; this  includes a recent meeting of a vaccine-denying, autism  -pseudoscience-promoting group, that is &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1723"&gt;to  be held at the University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;,  an institution with a rich history of quality medical education and  research (&lt;em&gt;see below&lt;/em&gt;). This begs the questions: (a) Is the University of Toronto a willing accomplice to this woo-mongering, or has it been duped? (b) Is there a growing acceptance of pseudoscience at premier medical centers in North America? To answer, first a small history lesson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though  modern medicine began its steady journey in the late 19th century,  institutionalization of medical education and teaching in the United  States did not commence until after 1910. Prior to that, medical  education and practice in the US left a lot to be desired, with poor  standards of training, understaffed and inadequate medical schools,  wide disparity in their curricula, methods of assessment, and  requirements for admission and graduation. In 1908, the Council on  Medical Education of the American Medical Association commissioned the  Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching to survey the state  of American medical education and suggest reform measures wherever  necessary. The job was entrusted to Abraham Flexner, a professional  educator with the Carnegie Foundation, with experience of the education  system in continental Europe. He visited all of 155 medical schools in  existence in North America at that time, and &lt;a href="http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/elibrary/docs/flexner_report.pdf"&gt;compiled a report&lt;/a&gt; in 1910, which  made several  bold recommendations (discussed &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/291/17/2139"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that forever changed the  structure and  practices of American medical education and medicine in general. In his  report, Flexner came down hard on various forms of ‘alternative’  medicine whose scientific validity was questionable, even  recommending closure or loss of accreditation and underwriting support  for such medical schools as offered training in those. On the other  hand, several schools received praise for excellent performance,  including the Harvard Medical School, Case Western Reserve University, McGill University, University of Toronto, and especially the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine – the latter being described as ‘model for medical education’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to re-emphasize at this point that we are talking about premier medical education and research institutions, institutions that should necessarily distance themselves from pseudoscientific approaches on doubtful provenance and non-existent efficacies, or at least provide truthful information (&lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/alternative-medicine/SA00078"&gt;as the Mayo Clinic has done&lt;/a&gt;). These are the institutions that should additionally recognize that ideology- or faith-based approaches to medicine, lacking evidence or any kind of rational justification, often engender false hope, leading the patients, their friends and family members through a deplorable waste of time, effort, energy, as well as of money. Therefore, we can perhaps reasonably expect them to be at the forefront of the scientific community’s battle against the  proliferation of ignorance, delusions and pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo, can’t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erm… No, &lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/2008/01/09/embracing-alternative-care_print.htm"&gt;it appears&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a thoughtfully presented &lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/2008/01/09/embracing-alternative-care_print.htm"&gt;report in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, the US News and World Report mentioned that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 18 hospitals on U.S. News’s 2008 “America’s Best Hospitals” superselective Honor Roll provide CAM of some type. Fifteen of the 18 also belong to the three-year-old Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, 36 U.S. teaching hospitals pushing to blend CAM with traditional care… Each center has its own notion of CAM and how best to fit it into the medical mix, which can be challenging. “There is rarely a consensus among CAM experts on the optimal product, dose, or intended users,” states a report from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, an arm of the National Institutes of Health charged with doling out research funds and tidying the thicket of therapies deemed to fall within CAM’s broad reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also observed that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one extreme are found techniques such as yoga and massage, acknowledged by the most hard-line skeptics to have some benefit, if only to lower stress and anxiety. At the other are therapies that even many who applaud CAM’s new-found academic popularity call “woo-woo medicine” because of the sheer implausibility of their rationale. Homeopathy, which involves remedies often lacking a single molecule of active substance, is the poster child; some would add energy therapies such as healing touch. The broad middle takes in acupuncture, herbal medicine, and other CAM approaches that seem to benefit some people with certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the mid-1990s, most academic centers treated CAM like a pack of scruffy mutts, noisy and unworthy of notice. A large pot of federal and foundation research funds—now close to $250 million per year just from NCCAM and the National Cancer Institute, plus tens of millions more from private donors such as the Bravewell Collaborative—helped turn that sniffy attitude into solicitous attention, says longtime CAM commentator Donald Marcus. “The funding gave them respect from the medical school community,” says Marcus, a professor of medicine and immunology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, where he has long taught a CAM course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, many of the premier universities of the US now sport Centers for studying “integrative medicine” or CAM. Most of these centers are engaged in legitimate research work dealing with some psychological studies among HIV positive patients and yoga-breathing techniques for alleviation of chronic fatigue in cancer patients (&lt;a href="http://www.osher.ucsf.edu/"&gt;The Osher Center for Integrative Medicine of the University of California at San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;); chronic pain management (as in cancer patients), including animal modeling and mechanistic studies related to genesis, metastasis and treatment of cancer (&lt;a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/cam/index.html"&gt;Johns Hopkins Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt;), and so forth. But not all. At the Cleveland Clinic, for example, NIH money has been poured into a clinical trial to investigate the effect of &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, an “energy therapy”, in reduction of stress and anxiety in prostate cancer patients. The integrative medicine program at Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the principal pediatric teaching hospital for Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, is involved in various types of unconventional therapy, and David Steinhorn, MD, a pediatric intensivist and medical director of the hospital’s CAM program, indicates that several privately funded trials are underway or in the works. According to the US News &lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/2008/01/09/embracing-alternative-care_print.htm"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, Steinhorn is a passionate champion of investigating CAM therapies, no matter how unlikely, if he believes they may help patients and are safe. “I’m a very serious, hard-core ICU doctor, but I have seen these therapies benefit my patients, even if I don’t know how,” he says. Other elite centers like the Mayo Clinic, Duke University Medical Center, the University of California San Francisco, University of Maryland School of Medicine, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and others now offer acupuncture, massage, and other CAM services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often claimed in CAM literature that a few CAM treatments have demonstrated at least modest results. Massage shows promise for relieving postoperative pain. Studies were done demonstrate that acupuncture is somewhat effective at relieving nausea from chemotherapy or surgery and discomfort from dental procedures. It is used at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, among others, for relief of chemotherapy-related nausea, and at many centers for chronic pain – from arthritis, for example. Clinical trials are &lt;a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00892216"&gt;still going on&lt;/a&gt; to determine the efficacy of acupuncture in a variety of different situations involving post-operative nausea and vomiting. However, analyses of reported studies on acupuncture/acupressure, as well as subsequent studies, have demonstrated (a) no effects on the natural history of any disease, (b) disappointing results in acute and chronic pain management, and (c) no evidence for a specific peri-operative antinausea or antiemetic effect (extensively reviewed &lt;a href="http://www.sram.org/0802/acupuncture.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=492"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1518"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is a matter of great irony that schools named in the Flexner report of 1910 as paragons of virtues in medical education have all now embraced pseudoscientific, evidence-free therapeutic systems with great alacrity. I wrote above how University of Toronto seems to have bought into the autism-pseudoscience business. Harvard employs amongst its faculty Dr. Martha Herbert, who is known for her grandiose claims (completely unsupported by any evidence) that neuroinflammation is a major cause of autism, and that molds and other environmental influences trigger it; she is also very popular amongst the anti-vaccination crowd. McGill University of Canada, by far the sanest of all these, recently launched a searchable database of outcome measures intended for CAM researchers – the IN-CAM Outcomes Database – as a collaboration between its Health Centre Research Institute and the University of Calgary. &lt;em&gt;Interestingly, Eric Fombonne, MD, the Head of the Division of Child Psychiatry at McGill and Director of the Department of Psychiatry at the Montreal Children’s Hospital, and a leading authority on Autism Spectrum Disorders, is the author of studies that showed (a) no difference in mercury levels between autistic children and the general population, thereby invalidating the entire chelation therapy business, and (b) no link between MMR-vaccine and autism, but one doesn’t – of course – find a mention of these studies in autism-pseudoscience  literature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was particularly outraged by the description of a severe woo-woo infestation at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. Their Spring 2007 magazine was quite illuminating (the PDF of the issue &lt;a href="http://www.son.jhmi.edu/jhnmagazine/spring2007/spr07pdfs/JHUN_Spr07_part2.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to broaden their methods for healing, Johns  Hopkins nursing faculty and students are increasingly looking outside the scope of conventional training to explore Complementary and Alternative Therapies… techniques like massage therapy, acupuncture, meditation, yoga, herbs, Reiki, aromatherapy, and others that fall under a broad category of healing systems and methods called Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)… At the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, the Introduction to Complementary and Alternative Healthcare has become a popular choice among students since it was first introduced in 1998…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an evidence of the extent to which CAM has been institutionalized, faculty and students of the JH School of Nursing may also attend lectures and workshops (’at reduced rates’) at the Tai Sophia Institute, in Laurel, Maryland, which offers courses and master’s degree programs in acupuncture, herbal medicine, and applied  healing arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says Lori Edwards, MPH, RN, APRN, BC, who teaches the Introduction to CAM course, “Nursing students should be learning about CAM because the patients nurses are working with are using these modalities.” However, rather than discouraging these unproven, unscientific practices, the nurses are encouraged to “…teach patients how to blend alternative practices with conventional medical care…”  In her course, Edwards discusses the four categories of CAM, as designated by the NCCAM: mind-body methods (such as meditation, yoga, and prayer); biologically-based methods (such as the use of herbs or homeopathy); manual healing methods (massage,  acupuncture, and chiropractic care); and energy therapies (Reiki).  Nursing School Faculty member  Carol Libonati, MS, APRN, BC, CS-P, is a practitioner of Reiki, and uses a series of hand positions done either just above or directly on the body to restore “the normal energy flow”. According to her, “a subtle energy flows from the practitioner into the client, and the energy creates a healing effect.” Let me emphasize that: &lt;em&gt;Prayer as medicine, Homeopathy, reiki – all under official sanction&lt;/em&gt;. The fact that there is an absolute lack of evidence that any of this works, ever, seems to have been conveniently dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also turns out that according to a US Government report (from the NCCAM, no less), &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE56T6MN20090730"&gt;Complementary and alternative medicine such as acupuncture, herbal supplements and meditation are big business in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, totaling nearly $34 billion in  out-of-pocket spending annually (giving the complete lie to the ‘pharma shill’ gambit that CAM proponents like to use to denigrate scientists working in mainstream medical research). And that is hardly surprising, considering how the Senate working groups on prevention and public health (Sen. Tom Harkin, D-IA) – yes, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1551"&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tom  Harkin – and health care quality (Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-MD) are &lt;em&gt;tirelessly working&lt;/em&gt; to institute a system  that rewards health promotion, wellness and quality in health care delivery in order to restore the vitality of American lives and also save money, which is why they invited two acupuncturists from the Tai Sophia Institute in Laurel, MD, to testify before the Senate Committee on Heath, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) and “&lt;a href="http://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=31932"&gt;share their recommendations for policy changes to help put the American health care system on the path to wellness&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the insanity of it all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/us/20shaman.html"&gt;recent article in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reported on how the Mercy Medical Center in Merced, CA, has been employing Hmong Shamans for the benefit of their large Hmong (from Northern Laos) patient populations. Because many Hmong rely on their spiritual beliefs to get them through illnesses, the hospital’s new Hmong shaman policy, the country’s first, formally recognizes the “cultural role of traditional healers, inviting them to perform nine approved ceremonies in the hospital, including “soul calling” and chanting in a soft voice.” Traditionally, the Hmong fear Western medicine; in their belief system, surgery, anesthesia, blood transfusions and other common procedures are taboo. Therefore, the new Shaman-liaison program has been devised to defuse that fear and to provide a culturally sensitive context. The shamans are allowed to perform healing rituals, going into trances for hours, negotiating with and warding off evil spirits, and protecting the patient’s soul from being kidnapped by some dead near-relative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit I felt uneasy about this. Granted, not many would see a huge problem with this. The Hmong are being given the same access as their clergy as with other religions. To many it would seem a rather reasonable compromise to get patients in sooner for proper care through scientific medicine, and that is being equitable to the people of this culture. I am just not sure that the best interest of the Hmong is  served this way in the long run; perhaps it would serve the Hmong better to train their Shamans to dispel the fear and distrust about modern medicine and procedures amongst the Hmong community. My concern, upon reading that NY Times article, was more generalized, more to do with the fact that unreason and irrationality, in various forms, have crept in (and are continuing to do so) our hospitals and medical institutions, and general institutional policy seems to be restricted to encouraging that – not taking proactive steps so as to ensure that people (not just the patients, but ‘prospective’ patients as well) are not held in thrall to the said unreason and irrationality. Consider the instances of the &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; and Prayer Healing performed by nurses in some hospitals, including the Johns Hopkins. The patients obviously want those, and the nurses justify those pseudoscientific&lt;br&gt;
procedures as ‘connecting’ to those patients through their cultural beliefs. And therein lies the slippery slope. I guess the question is: if and when a so-called cultural belief is mired in superstition, misinformation and  ignorance, how far should an institutional policy go to pander to such a belief just because it is considered culturally appropriate? Where to draw the line?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake about it: irrationality is like a cancer. Unless diagnosed early and treated aggressively, it will eventually overwhelm the system. The science-based medicine community must take cognizance of the potentially harmful effect of pseudoscience on humanity, and fight it at every step with reason, and evidence, and a heaping helping of scorn that it rightfully deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* – The first time I came across this &lt;a href="http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html"&gt;fantastic and apt term was in RW Donnell’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. If he has indeed coined it, a tip of my hat to him for a job well done!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orangutans make music. &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/animals/090810-orangutan-instrument.html"&gt;It's a fact&lt;/a&gt;, say researchers at the University of Utrect in the Netherlands. Hanging high in a tree, orangutans strip leaves off a nearby twig, cup them in their hand, like using a blade of grass as a reed, and blow to make sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, unlike kids messing around on a sunny day, they don't do it just for fun. Orangutans make noise to ward off predators, as you might expect. Birds, whales, dolphins and other animals also use sound--to signal danger, to identify food, or just to say hi. So, what's with the researchers' surprising claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers associated with this study make a surprising proposition--they say the orangutan's musical whistling is the first evidence of "culture" in animals. But, what does culture actually mean? Can it be defined simply as using a tool for communication or does it mean something more? If it means something more, do the orang's activities meet that criteria?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/culture"&gt;Culture &lt;/a&gt; in humans means the capacity for symbolic thought, social learning, and a set of shared goals and behaviors within a group. I see how orangs might be using social learning and shared goals/behaviors, but what about symbolic thought? An example of symbolic thought in humans is, of course, mathematics, but religion and history/tradition can also be examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Without symbolic thought, it seems like orangutan "culture" would be very 2 dimensional, if you can call it that at all. Im not sure this study really fully explores the definition of culture. But, what do i know?&lt;/p&gt;

But this ability comes at a cost - the electric field is generated continuously throughout life, so consumes a great deal of energy, and it can also attract predators which are sensitive to it. Electrogenic fish species therefore utilize various strategies to save energy and to minimize the likelihood of being detected. Some generate irregular pulses of electrical discharges whose rate can be modulated; others can also modulate the strength of the electric field.

A beautiful study published in the open access journal PLoS Biology now reveals the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying one of these behavioural adaptations. It shows that in one species of electric fish, circadian cues and social encounters regulate the movements of proteins called voltage-gated sodium channels - which are crucial for generating the electric field - in cells of the electric organ. At night, low light levels and social interactions drive the insertion of sodium channels into the cell membranes, leading to a dramatic increase in the strength of the electric field.

Sadly, that feeding was delayed on account of the elder Free-Ride offspring's teacher having jury duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeding the classroom snake, apparently, is not a task you leave to a substitute teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, since then, Ziggy has enjoyed a couple of feedings.  Here, the elder Free-Ride offspring tells me about yesterday's feeding.&lt;br&gt;

It is believing in something without evidence—or worse, believing in something despite evidence to the contrary. This is not an endeavor to which I aspire in any circumstances, but it seems a great deal of effort has been expended trying to convince people to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/skeptiquote"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, I have the account "SkeptiQuote" which I use solely to tweet a single skeptical quote each day. While I'm searching for appropriate quotes, I come across quotes that just appall me. I'll share some with you here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Reason is the enemy of faith"&lt;br&gt;Martin Luther, father of the Protestant Reformation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That about sums it up right there, and while skeptics agree with this sentiment, they've chosen the opposite side of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Faith is a knowledge within the heart, beyond the reach of proof."&lt;br&gt;Kahlil Gibran an early 20th century Lebanese-American philosopher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the heart has immutable gray matter that I'm unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Faith, to my mind, is a stiffening process, a sort of mental starch."&lt;br&gt;E.M. Forster, English Author&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe Forster intended this to be a criticism, but I found it on a site of "inspirational quotes."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254504305662"><id gr:original-id="656 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b55e8a7798a92156</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="vaccination" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/367"/><category term="vaccine" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/216"/><category term="vaccines" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/103"/><title type="html">Halvorsen on the Today Programme</title><published>2009-10-02T17:18:09Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T17:18:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/656" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having been given space by the Daily Mail to write a &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/652"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; on vaccination two days ago, Dr Richard Halvorsen has today been given air-time by Radio 4. The programme is available &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8286000/8286445.stm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on iPlayer and an unverified transcript is available &lt;a href="http://evidencematters.posterous.com/r4-today-halvorsen-and-finn-on-natalie-morton"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
At one point in the interview (4 minutes 06 seconds to 4m 39s), Dr Halvorsen refers to the introduction of the HPV vaccine as being "rushed". Halvorsen appears to believe that not only has the vaccine been introduced prematurely, but that hype and marketing campaigns by Big Pharma are partly responsible for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... the new HPV vaccine was rushed on at a very fast rate. Partly because of the huge hype by the drug manufacturers to market the vaccine. They've been widely criticised for their marketing campaign. They paid doctors' organisations, patients' organisations, doctors. And in fact, they were congratulated for their vaccine as being the Brand of the Year by a marketing campaign for making a market out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This criticism of what Dr Halvorsen sees as "huge hype" and a successful marketing campaign is interesting when contrasted with some of Halvorsen's other comments in the same interview. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run a Baby Jabs and Immunisation Clinic. I run an immunisation clinic. [...] my book, The Truth About Vaccines [...] yet again, I run a vaccine clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halvorsen's book and clinic were also both mentioned by the presenter in the introduction to the show. Like the Today show, the Daily Mail article written by Dr Halvorsen had a plug for his book, and there was a also a reference to Halvorsen's clinic in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his opening comments, Dr Halvorsen states that "the initial reaction is one that certainly the vaccine has to be a suspect cause to the problem. And to think otherwise would be unreasonable". It may be worth pointing out that, as &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/news/2009/09September/Pages/Cervical-cancer-vaccine-QA.aspx"&gt;NHS Choices&lt;/a&gt; remark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No link should ever have been made. However, the girl died on the same day as receiving her vaccination and this led to associations being drawn between the jab and her death. This happens largely through misinterpretation of probabilities. Unfortunately, young people do die suddenly of natural causes. Although such events are rare, they are statistically much more common than fatal reactions to routine medical treatments.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that it is more common for young people to die suddenly of natural causes than to suffer a fatal reaction to a routine medical treatment, it does not seem unreasonable to me to think that a vaccine does not have to be a suspect cause. Perhaps Dr Halvorsen was unaware of the probabilities involved, or misinterpreted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halvorsen (1m 06s to 1m 30s) goes on to argue from personal incredulity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think clearly it does not appear to be the primary cause though it's interesting that a tumour of the, a malignancy a tumour, a cancer that could apparently kill her at any time sounds very bizarre when apparently she was well one hour beforehand, well enough to have a vaccine. Yet she has a malignancy that could have killed her at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a girl due to be vaccinated may have a tumour that could kill at any time may sound bizarre to Dr Halvorsen, but that does not give us any reason to doubt the veracity of the claim that Natalie Morton had such a tumour. We should not assume that a claim is untrue simply because somebody finds it surprising and Dr Halvorsen provides no reasoning to support his suprise. If Halvorsen considers the findings of the post mortem to be implausible, it would be helpful if he could explain why he holds this belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the two-minute mark, Dr Halvorsen claims that "The risks of vaccines are downplayed and in fact, the risks of the diseases that are meant to be protected by vaccines are also exaggerated" - fortunately, Adam Finn responds to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think that we have to be a bit careful that we use evidence rather than opinion in these kind of conclusions.&lt;br&gt;
The epidemiology of vaccine-preventable disease provides a very solid base for the programmes that we use. All of which, in this country, are very carefully scrutinised for cost benefit as well as for health benefit. So, I think it's important to recognise that the opinions that Dr Halvorsen expresses today and in the Daily Mail put him in a very small minority amongst GPs who are equally well qualified to comment and who don't agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenter then remarks: "And the point, Adam Finn, that you make, is that we don't know - we don't meet - we don't see on the front pages - the people who are protected by vaccines." For every death or adverse event that is linked to vaccination, whether correctly or spuriously, there are many lives saved. The problem is that any deaths will be highly visible, whereas the lives saved are unseen - as Adam Finn puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... stories such as this story this week, and this poor girl, are very powerful. They have very powerful effects on us. But what we don't see, and are not really aware of, are the vast armies of people who are walking around healthy, unmaimed, and 'not dead' today because of the vaccines we've been using for the last 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My objection to Blasphemy Day is that it can be rather sophomoric; particularly the holding of a contest to see who come up with the most pithy forms of blasphemy. I have consistently said that if we are to be taken seriously, we need to provide the best scholarly and scientific examination of claims. &lt;strong&gt;I have also forthrightly defended “the right to blaspheme;” but there are different ways of doing this, and I submit that poking fun at ones opponents is counterproductive.&lt;/strong&gt; I do not think that “in your face” atheism will get us very far. I have defended the right of the Danish newspaper to publish cartoons critical of Muslim suicide bombers, and I am not unilaterally opposed to the use of cartoons, particularly where there is a political or social point that needs to be made. But this is different from purposely seeking to blaspheme to gain public notoriety.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/30/should-we-blaspheme-not-always/"&gt;what I said before&lt;/a&gt;.  You want to respect people even if you don’t respect their beliefs.  And to that end, I do believe there are ways of blaspheming that are counterproductive.  It’s not a censorship issue — you can say whatever you’d like — but I do believe there are some thoughts that backfire when uttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t agree with everything Kurtz says, though.  Once again — and on purpose this time — he brings up the “atheist fundamentalists”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In my view, the main failure of “atheist fundamentalists” — and they do exist — is that they often are so eager to criticize theistic religions that they ignore the need to develop a genuine moral compass and the principles of personal morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are indeed two different visions of the Center for Inquiry: The first insists that there ain’t no God. And that people who believe in him are foolish. The second agrees that there is insufficient evidence for God, but that humans have the opportunity to realize the fullness of life for themselves and society. The second vision is affirmative and constructive in scope, and has proven enormously successful thus far. It would be a tragedy of monumental proportions to abandon it now.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is it one or the other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can criticize religious beliefs while still affirming your own personal morality.  Just because some people get off on cutting religious people down to size doesn’t mean everyone criticizes them maliciously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many of us — myself included — do buy into Kurtz’s second vision, while at the same time, thinking there is foolishness in religious thought.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure the current administration of the Center For Inquiry feels the same way.  Yes, they tried to drum up some publicity with a not-so-friendly idea (I’m thinking of the &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/cfi_blasphemy_contest/"&gt;Blasphemy Contest&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=50200339561"&gt;Blasphemy Day&lt;/a&gt; itself), but they’re usually doing very positive things in defense of critical thinking and scientific inquiry.  Kurtz knows that, he helped pioneer it.  To attack his own organization for a misstep or two seems counterproductive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, you can just read &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/10/01/ardipithecus-we-meet-at-last/"&gt;Carl Zimmer's excellent summary&lt;/a&gt; to find out what's cool about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a summary of a summary: it's another transitional fossil in our lineage. &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus&lt;/i&gt; is old, 4.4 million years or so — so it&amp;#39;s well before Lucy and the australopithecines. The latest result is a thorough analysis of a large number of collected specimens that shows it is an interesting mosaic of traits: it was bipedal, but not quite so well adapted to terrestrial locomotion as we are, and it had feet with an opposable big toe. And of course it had a small brain, only a little larger than a chimpanzee&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/10/ardipithecus_ramidus/ardipithecus_skull.jpeg" width="425" height="590" alt="ardipithecus_skull.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital representations of the Ar. ramidus cranium and mandible. (A to D) The ARA-VP-6/500 and downscaled ARA-VP-1/500 composite reconstruction in inferior, superior, lateral, and anterior views (in Frankfurt horizontal orientation). (E) Individual pieces of the digital reconstruction in different colors. Note the steep clivus plane intersecting the cranial vault on the frontal squama (as in Sts 5 and not apes). (F and G) Lateral and superior views of the ARA-VP-1/401 mandible (cast). (H and I) Lateral and superior views of the ARA-VP-6/500 left mandibular corpus with dentition.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; is clearly different from (but related!) to us, and it's also very different from a chimpanzee. One thing I'm finding baffling in all the commentary is the argument that this somehow shows that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees would have been very unchimpanzee-like, and perhaps closer in morphology to us than to modern chimps. I'm not buying it. Has anybody actually ever suggested that chimpanzees have been in a state of relative stasis for 6 million years? Chimps have evolved in parallel with us for all of that time, so that argument is addressing a non-controversy, or at least, an argument that should have been recognized as silly all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're also going to have to push the fossil record back another couple of million years to get to that last common ancestor, and there's no reason to presume that Ardi's ancestors weren't also rather different from Ardi. We also need to know more about the breadth of the primate family tree at that time; was Ardi a weirdly specialized sub-branch, or actually representative of a wider trend in the ape species that would lead to us? I think this image is a nice way to illustrate &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt;'s place in the family tree.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/10/ardipithecus_ramidus/ardi.jpeg" width="450" height="184" alt="ardi.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evolution of hominids and African apes since the gorilla/chimp+human (GLCA) and chimp/human (CLCA) last common ancestors. Pedestals on the left show separate lineages leading to the extant apes (gorilla, and chimp and bonobo); text indicates key differences among adaptive plateaus occupied by the three hominid genera.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong: &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent addition to our family album, and the author's of the multiple papers that have come out have done a very impressive job of analysis and documentation. We can all jump up and down with joy at these new data, and we can rightly point to this species and say, "Transitional form! Boo-ya, creationists!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I'm also seeing the press mangling the story already. National Geographic says, &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/10/091001-oldest-human-skeleton-ardi-missing-link-chimps-ardipithecus-ramidus.html"&gt;Oldest &amp;quot;Human&amp;quot; Skeleton Found—Disproves &amp;quot;Missing Link&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which is annoying. The article itself isn't bad, but can we just kill the "missing link" nonsense altogether? It's as if the only way some science journalists can grasp a new discovery is by relating it to a misbegotten misconception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize for the very worst coverage has to go to Metro News and the Torstar News Service (is that from the Toronto Star?). They put up an article titled &lt;a href="http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/work/article/328102--new-theory-may-answer-missing-link-question"&gt;New theory may answer missing link question&lt;/a&gt;, which opens with the bizarre assertion, &lt;span&gt;Man didn't descend from apes.&lt;/span&gt; There is no new theory here. There is new evidence and further data documenting the details of one lineage's descent. And if you put the phrase "missing link" in your headline any more, we're going to have to put a silly hat on your editors and make them sit in a corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the very worst part is this misinterpretation of the suggestion that the LCA of humans and chimps would have had characters we consider human-like. I guarantee you that this will be the core of the creationist response to Ardi in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four-foot, 110-pound female's skeleton and physiological characteristics bear a closer resemblance to modern-day humans than to contemporary apes, meaning they evolved from humanlike creatures -- not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brace yourself, gang. The creationists are going to be claiming that this shows humans were created first, and all of these other hairy beasts the paleontologists are digging up are just degenerate spawn of the Fall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/ardipithecus_ramidus.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/PydeL1KFdwg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254502899713"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4429">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a4190db68e2269f8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="evolution"/><title type="html">Ardi is a million years older than Lucy</title><published>2009-10-02T16:26:13Z</published><updated>2009-10-14T19:25:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/10/ardi-is-a-milli.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week’s &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; has a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/ardipithecus/" rel="external "&gt;special issue&lt;/a&gt; devoted to the fossil hominid &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus&lt;/em&gt;.

I've mocked 
lots and lots of christians, a few muslims, some Jews, some newagers, and even one

&lt;p&gt; Today, I'm doing something that's probably going to get me into trouble
with a lot of readers. I'm going to mock a very well-known atheist. No, not PZ.
As much as I disagree with PZ, as far as I can tell, he's consistent about his
worldview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Over at Bad Astronomy, Phil Plait has been a major voice for skepticism and
a vocal proponent of atheism. He has, quite rightly, gone after people of all stripes
for foolishness and silly supernaturalism. He's frequently talked about how silly he
thinks religion is. All well and good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But Phil just &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/01/i-object/"&gt;really

The two smallest planets, one of them was distant, icy, and raw, and the other was close in, speedy, and overcooked.  One of them had the &lt;a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/"&gt;New Horizons&lt;/a&gt; mission planned for it, and the other had the &lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/"&gt;Messenger&lt;/a&gt; mission.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one of them is still a planet, but Messenger just passed by Mercury for the third (and final) time.  In early 2011, Messenger will settle into orbit around Mercury.  Until then, you'll have to content yourself with these brand new images -- many just released &lt;i&gt;today&lt;/i&gt; -- from Messenger's flyby of Mercury over this past week.  Click all images to see them full-size.  First, the approach using both the wide angle camera (top) and the narrow angle camera (bottom):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/WAC_NAC_web.png"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/WAC_NAC_web.png" width="500" title="I like the narrow one better, but who doesn&amp;#39;t?" alt="WAC_NAC_web.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you fly a little closer, you can take a great look at Mercury's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(solar)"&gt;Terminator&lt;/a&gt;, which is my favorite name for the border between day and night.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/CN0162744111M_RA_3_web.png"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/CN0162744111M_RA_3_web.png" width="500" title="The craters are all perfect circles; the distortion is due to the curvature of Mercury." alt="CN0162744111M_RA_3_web.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a world where days and nights are comparable to years, where the atmosphere is about one atom thick.  Mercury is the second densest planet in the Solar System, behind only Earth!  (In your face, Hermes!)  Some areas are relatively young and crater-free:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/youngwrinkled_162744209.png"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/youngwrinkled_162744209.png" width="500" title="I said it&amp;#39;s young, but check out the wrinkles!" alt="youngwrinkled_162744209.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other areas are so old and so heavily bombarded that they have crater upon crater upon crater!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/File5.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/File5.jpg" width="500" title="Check out the giant &amp;#39;double crater&amp;#39; just hanging out here." alt="File5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, no planetary fly-by would be complete without the mandatory &lt;i&gt;lookout towards the horizon&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/File3.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/File3.jpg" width="500" title="What, no Earthrise?" alt="File3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing how &lt;b&gt;black&lt;/b&gt; space is when you don't have an atmosphere to contend with, isn't it?  There are a few more pictures available as well:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/File2.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/File2.jpg" width="248" alt="File2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/File4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released/File4.jpg" width="248" alt="File4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these images were taken from the &lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/"&gt;Messenger web site&lt;/a&gt;, and you should check them out; they've got a live-update mission clock and odometer (!) on their site.  Messenger is the first mission to Mercury &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/mercury/missions.html"&gt;in my lifetime&lt;/a&gt;, and only the second one &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt;, so I hope you enjoyed getting a rare glimpse of this baked, barren world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(And I've always wondered, it's named Mercury, but wouldn't &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus"&gt;Icarus&lt;/a&gt; be more appropriate?  Too close to the Sun, wings melted, death, etc.?)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/new_images_of_mercury_released.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254497633241"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/a_tale_of_two_news_stories_the_hpv_and_f.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/08a7696dbc1de7db</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">A tale of two news stories: The HPV and flu vaccines and why it's so easy to confuse correlation with causation</title><published>2009-10-02T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/BJegSkJQgYI/a_tale_of_two_news_stories_the_hpv_and_f.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/a_tale_of_two_news_stories_the_hpv_and_f.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;And so it begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it hasn't really just begun. In fact, it's been going on a long time. I'm talking about confusing correlation with causation when it comes to vaccines. For example, the "vaccines cause autism" variety of the anti-vaccine movement blatantly confuses the correlation with the beginning of the increase in autism diagnoses in the 1990s with the expansion of the vaccine schedule that occurred at roughly the same time. The same sort of thing is going on regarding the HPV vaccine. It began first with the credulous referring to reports of reactions to the &lt;a href="http://vaers.hhs.gov/"&gt;Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System&lt;/a&gt; (VAERS) database. Yet, as we have seen before, anyone can report anything to this database, whether it's plausibly related to vaccines or not, and activist groups and lawyers have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/01/how_vaccine_litigation_distorts_the_vaer.php"&gt;manipulated the database&lt;/a&gt; by encouraging reports of vaccines causing autism. Similarly, there have been a lot of reports of reactions to the VAERS database for the HPV vaccine, but a careful examination shows reports of these reactions to be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/why_medscape_why.php"&gt;no more than would be expected&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/woo_and_antivaccinationism_in_mainstream.php"&gt;random chance alone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was this &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/sep/28/hpv-cervical-cancer-vaccine-death"&gt;story three days ago&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/a_tale_of_two_news_stories_the_hpv_and_f.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/a_tale_of_two_news_stories_the_hpv_and_f.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/BJegSkJQgYI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254497591322"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=6723">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3830ddf4bf624e0b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Crime"/><category term="Disability Rights"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="abuse"/><category term="autism"/><category term="court case"/><category term="pdd-nos"/><category term="trial"/><title type="html">All the News?</title><published>2009-10-02T14:45:53Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T14:45:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/all-the-news/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;More on Sylvia Tagle, the special ed teacher convicted of putting hot sauce in soda and allowing a child to drink it: Did she do it? Tagle has defenders who describe her as a caring and committed teacher. Was she? I am having a hard time getting a complete picture because the coverage of this story was so skimpy. I can understand why there wasn’t much space devoted to it. It just doesn’t seem like that big a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/soda-can.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/soda-can.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of yaybiscuits123 (flickr.com)" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of yaybiscuits123 (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless it’s your kid, of course, or like us you are interested in stories of abuse in the world of special needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help thinking that reduced newsroom staff is having an effect on reporting stories like this one as well as other stories. The &lt;em&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt; had a 17 % staff cut in June 2008. In &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=7056361"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;, the 240.000-circ. paper cut  another 175 positions, including 33 in the newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2009/08/more_layoffs_miami_herald_to_c.php"&gt;announced in August&lt;/a&gt; it would eliminate another 34 positions, some in the newsroom. The Miami &lt;em&gt;Sun-Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2008/06/buyouts_coming_at_sunsentinel.php"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; some 60 positions last year, according to &lt;em&gt;New Times-Broward Palm Beach&lt;/em&gt;. These papers had just two stories on Tagle: one to report that the trial was taking place, the second to report her conviction on one count of abuse (the hot sauce in the soda). There are a couple of &lt;a href="http://cbs4.com/services/popoff.aspx?categoryId=5&amp;amp;videoId=83552@wfor.dayport.com&amp;amp;videoPlayStatus=false&amp;amp;videoStoryIds=83552@wfor.dayport.com,83537@wfor.dayport.com&amp;amp;videoTime=30.798&amp;amp;stationName=WFOR&amp;amp;"&gt;local TV news&lt;/a&gt; clips, but nothing with much detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about Sylvia Tagle in &lt;em&gt;El Nuevo Herald &lt;/em&gt;either, a Spanish daily in Miami published by the McClatchy Corp., which also owns the Miami &lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt;. (Circulation of &lt;em&gt;El Nuevo Herald&lt;/em&gt; is about 80,000). Management and staff at &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=7056361"&gt;El Nuevo Herald&lt;/a&gt; have also been slashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy’s father &lt;a href="http://www.justnews.com/news/21062762/detail.html#comment-17147765"&gt;commented &lt;/a&gt;on a site called Justnews.com (scroll down to “Fatherofvictim”), and he mentions what he calls irresponsible reporting by &lt;a href="http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/weird/Teacher-Put-Hot-Sauce-in-Soda-to-Teach-a-Hard-Lesson-60331842.html"&gt;NBC’s Todd Wright&lt;/a&gt;. But nowhere online do I see the comment he refers to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on this story may come out; Tagle’s sentencing is October 7. But who will do the digging? In a health field rife with controversy and emotion to begin with, where hucksterism often travels as objective news and we all scramble for any information to help our children or illuminate their situation, it’s important to recognize how and by whom news is gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News-gatherers come in all forms these days. If anyone in the Miami area wants to get hold of the court transcripts, we will be happy to wade through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are those incompatible positions: to believe in God and to believe in evolution?&lt;/strong&gt;No, I don’t think they’re incompatible if only because there are many intelligent evolutionary scientists who also believe in God—to name only Francis Collins [the geneticist and Christian believer recently chosen to head the National Institutes of Health] as an outstanding example. So it clearly is possible to be both. This book more or less begins by accepting that there is that compatibility. The God Delusion did make a case against that compatibility in my own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wonder whether you might be more successful in your arguments if you didn’t convey irritation and a sense that the people who believe in God are not as smart as you are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is a certain justified irritation with young-earth creationists who believe that the world is less than 10,000 years old. Those are the people that I’m really talking about. I do sometimes accuse people of ignorance, but that is not intended to be an insult. I’m ignorant of lots of things. Ignorance is something that can be remedied by education. And that’s what I’m trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. No more denouncing the “Neville Chamberlain school of evolutionists”; rather, Dawkins now stands up for Francis Collins! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenau has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/10/richard_dawkins_accommodationi.php"&gt;more discussion&lt;/a&gt; of whether or not this represents a real change of position–but assuming Dawkins is being quoted correctly, then it appears he is espousing the basic stance that we, and NCSE, have long been arguing for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, if Richard Dawkins is moving to this ground, there’s reason to rejoice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254497078632"><id gr:original-id="http://www.obesitypanacea.com/2009/10/obesity-and-car-crashes-does-fat.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5aaec07b5e910aee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Obesity and car crashes - does fat provide a protective cushion against injury?</title><published>2009-10-02T10:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T10:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/DirxPu2LXDg/obesity-and-car-crashes-does-fat.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.obesitypanacea.com/2009/10/obesity-and-car-crashes-does-fat.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">While Travis and I often focus on the cardiometabolic and sometimes psychological complications of obesity, the consequences of carrying excess weight reach far beyond these two areas.

Take for example automobile collisions.

By and large, most cars on the road today are not built specifically to be driven by obese drivers. More importantly, the US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety regulations and New Car Assessment Program testing uses a crash test dummy with a BMI of ~25.5 kg/m2 to gauge how safe a given car, and what type of damage may be sustained by a passenger or driver of that car upon collision. Unfortunately, it is very likely that given the same type of vehicle and mode of collision, the mechanics of the trauma incurred by the driver and passenger will vary greatly when the BMI of these parties is 45 kg/m2 rather than 25.

Indeed, previous studies have found that increasing weight is associated with a greater mortality risk from a car crash, even when other factors such as seatbelt use, age, gender, seating position, and car weight are accounted for. Such a finding, however, does not allow us to deduce whether obese individuals are more injury prone given the same crash or simply if given the same injury sustained, obese people are more likely to die from complications....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I was lucky enough to be taken in and taught by the close-knit deaf community at the Center, and my eyes were opened to the special challenges of deafness in a hearing world.  This was before instant messages, when we would set a phone on a coupling device to use the TDD.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also learned about the special health challenges in the deaf community---doctor visits without interpreters, lack of access to real medical information, especially about HIV.  At the time, HIV was hitting the deaf community hard, partly because of communication difficulties between the deaf community and the hearing medical community.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that one of the DonorsChoose projects in my state is called &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=307196&amp;amp;challengeid=24230"&gt;"Touching Sounds Through Play"&lt;/a&gt; and is trying to purchase supplies to help deaf children with their language skills.  Without early intervention in language skills, many deaf children will have a hard time completing school, working, and staying healthy.  Why don't you consider sending a few bucks their way?&lt;/p&gt;

It was predictable that the death of a girl shortly after receiving an HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer would attract the immoral agents of the anti-vaccine movement. Like zombies to brains, they descend on the tragedy, ready to consume it and gain strength.  And just as zombies will eat anything cerebral, even Dana Ullman's brains, the fact that the vaccine didn't cause the death won't slow them down a bit. (Have I finished straining the zombie analogy?

Take a peek at this new image from Europe’s &lt;a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=16"&gt;Herschel&lt;/a&gt; space telescope, which peers at the Universe’s far-infrared light:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stfc.ac.uk/resources/image/jpg/Fig_3_SPIRE_PACS.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2457/3973868329_c6ef87d9ae_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[As usual, click it to embiggen.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very pretty! This image is a composite of five separate images taken with two cameras (PACS and SPIRE), which together cover a wavelength range of light of 70 out to 500 microns — and, bearing in mind the reddest wavelength the human eye can see is about 0.8 microns, you can see that this is way, &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; out in the infrared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’re seeing here are cold dust clouds in the constellation of Crux, the Southern Cross. It was thought these regions would be fairly smooth on these scales, but Herschel is revealing that in fact they’re pretty turbulent. You can see ribbons and filaments of material here, caused by stars forming deep in these dense clouds. You can the odd proplyd or two; small (well, much bigger than our solar system but small-looking here) disks of matter, very dense clouds with stars forming in their cores. &lt;em&gt;Proplyd&lt;/em&gt; is short for protoplanetary disks, because these structures are in the process of forming solar systems much like ours. And you can also see long fingers of material; towers of matter where newly-born stars are eroding and blowing away the dust with their stellar winds. In a sense, these are like cosmic sandbars, material being sculpted by fluids flowing past them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Star formation can take place in such thickly-choked regions, but visible light cannot penetrate them; even to Hubble this would be dark material and we could only see the very surface of these clouds. But Herschel sees the kind of infrared light that passes right through the dust, so astronomers can look into the hearts of these areas and learn about star formation. We know quite a bit already, but there are still gaps in our knowledge because these clouds are so thick and difficult to study.

Unfortunately, they seem to be limited in how they can advertise. When they tried to do the common campus practice of chalking — putting messages on the sidewalks to let students know what they were up to — they got an &lt;a href="http://www.cw.ua.edu/alabama-atheists-and-agnostics-chalking-erased-1.1932344"&gt;unfortunate response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we were chalking somebody dumped water on what we were chalking, somebody spat at us," Sloan said. "But really, overall, most people were polite."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At approximately 6 p.m., AAA finished their chalking, Sloan said. By midnight, all the chalking had been erased and scrubbed clean by what appeared to be an organization's effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that there were other groups, &lt;i&gt;Christian&lt;/i&gt; groups, that were chalking at the same time, and that the atheists were writing inoffensive messages like "You can be good without god" and suggestions to look them up on facebook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess they'll have to settle for advertising on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all you University of Alabama students, join &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2234029305"&gt;Alabama Atheists and Agnostics&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; Alabamians should join. It's accessible to the whole of the internet, so people all around the world can sign up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other atheist groups in Alabama want a plug? Send me a note, and I'll add them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa. There are &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of atheists in Alabama. Try these organizations out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;This blog normally (and rightly) gives pride of place to cats, but this post will be about dogs. I trust Jerry will forgive me when he returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Hidden away in the same issue of Science that deals with Ardi, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/326/5949/150"&gt;there’s an article by a host of researchers from the US and France&lt;/a&gt; (you’ll need a subscription to get past the abstract), looking at the genetics of dog coat variation. Amazingly, it turns out that most of the massive range in coat phenotypes we can see between “pure breeds” and mongrels can be accounted for by mutations in just three genes. (If I were one of the authors, I’d be pretty peeved – all the media attention will be focused on Ardi; in a “normal” week, they could be sure of making the TV, press and radio…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors studied three characteristics of the canine coat: (i) the presence or absence of “furnishings” (growth pattern marked by a moustache and eyebrows seenin wire-haired dogs); (ii) hair length; and (iii) the presence or absence of curl. To find the genetic bases of these characters, they created three genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets, based on a) 96 dachshunds showing three coat varieties (wire-haired with furnishings, smooth, and long-haired without furnishings); b) 76 Portuguese water dogs showing the curl phenotype and c)  903 dogs from 80 breeds representing a wide variety of phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that variability in three genes, coding for R-spondin–2, fibroblast growth factor–5, and keratin-71, accounts for most of the different kind of coats that can be observed (“these three mutations in various combinations explain the observed pelage phenotype of 95% of dogs sampled”) . They summarise their findings in the following figure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="326_150_F3" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/326_150_f3.jpeg?w=500&amp;amp;h=338" alt="326_150_F3" width="500" height="338"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they conclude “None of the mutations we observed were found in three gray wolves or the short-haired dogs, indicating that short-haired dogs carry the ancestral alleles (table S1). Our finding of identical haplotypes surrounding the variants in all dogs displaying the same coat type suggests that a single mutation occurred for each trait and was transferred multiple times to different breeds through hybridization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, although they open their article by pointing out that dogs and humans have lived together for around 15,000 years, they point out in their conclusion that dog “breeds” are an incredibly recent invention – less than 200 years. Inother words, in a couple of hundred year, artificial selection on just three genes has produced an incredibly variety of phenotypes. Furthermore, that selection may have focused on different characters, such as aggressivity or size, the genes for which may be linked to the coat genes. They conclude, “Consequently, in domesticated species, the appearance of phenotypic complexity can be created through combinations of genes of major effect, providing a pathway for rapid evolution that is unparalleled in natural systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, was also Darwin’s insight (although he did not put it in these terms). Artificial selection by 19th century breeders provided him with the key to understanding natural selection as the force that could generate apparently directed evolutionary change. And that is a much more powerful explanation than anything the creationists can come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I’m not talking about the wife of Perseus from Greek mythology (although the actress who played her in the Clash of the Titans movie was something to behold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also not talking about the Andromeda class attack cargo ship from World War 2 (yes…a cargo ship that could also attack).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I’m not talking about Mount Andromeda in Canada (there’s also one in Antarctica but I don’t think anyone from there reads this blog).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am talking about of course is the beautiful galaxy known as Andromeda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Andromeda" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/andromeda-300x225.jpg" alt="Andromeda" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it has other names but M31 and NGC 224 are so boring and plain compared to Andromeda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s so much more to Andromeda than a pretty name though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know?….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a distance of 2 1/2 million light-years, Andromeda is the closest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way. In fact, the two of us are the heavy-weights in our Local Group of 30 galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andromeda is the farthest thing visible to the naked human eye. To see it unaided though, you’ll need not only good eyesight but a very clear night and minimal light pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this light you see started its 15 quintillion mile journey (give or take…), Homo Sapiens were still more than 2 million years in the future. In fact, the genus Homo hadn’t even split off from the Australopithecines yet. I wonder if an Australopithecus ever looked at that fuzzy patch of light and wondered what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is the deep past of this galaxy interesting, the deep future is pretty cool too.&lt;br&gt;
In about 4 billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide in spectacular fashion as only colliding galaxies can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an artist’s conception of what this event may look like from earth (if it still existed at that time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/galaxycollision1-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="329"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the simulations I’ve seen are worth their salt, the first collision will likely be just a glancing blow, like a kiss before a punch to the head. The second collision many millions of years later will be much more direct resulting in a complete merger of the Milky Way and Andromeda including the super-massive black holes we each have at our cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jexMl2SO6_I&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;Bad day for the Milky Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of what’s left of our solar system seems to depend on which side of the galaxy we’re on when things go all nasty. If we’re on one side, then we could be thrown out of the galaxy never to return. If we’re on the other side then we could be hurled into the maelstrom of the colliding black holes towards the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that we won’t be Andromeda’s first meal either. A &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,557707,00.html"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; huge scan of Andromeda revealed that it has had as many as half a dozen small galaxy snacks over the course of its life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Study lead author Alan McConnachie of the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,557707,00.html#" style="border-bottom:1px dotted darkgreen!important;font-weight:normal!important;font-size:100%!important;text-decoration:none!important;padding-bottom:0px!important;color:darkgreen!important;background-color:transparent!important;background-image:none;padding-top:0pt;padding-right:0pt;padding-left:0pt"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in British Columbia said:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What we’re seeing right now are the signs of cannibalism, We’re finding things that have been destroyed … partly digested remains.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scale and proximity of this carnage is what distinguishes Andromeda’s appetite from other observed galactic mergers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These other meals though have consisted primarily of dwarf galaxies…mere aperitifs. I don’t think Andromeda has faced a full 2 course meal before like the Milky Way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope I’m around to see this event &lt;img src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If I am, I think a re-naming would be called for considering the scale of this meal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; I’ll call it/us The Andromeda-Way&lt;br&gt;

At first, there were bombs everywhere. Then over time the bombs were revealed as hoaxes (there were three of them) but not until after this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Students were sent home, businesses were evacuated and large portions of town were cordoned off as local, county and federal authorities investigated. None of the three devices detonated, but some of the five "chemical reaction devices" (authorities called them "MacGyver bombs" after the TV character who improvised explosives) popped while authorities were busy at the first three scenes.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/princeton_bomb_swarm_the_lates.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/princeton_bomb_swarm_the_lates.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/_ipnJnX4TgQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254493284730"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/the_atheists_guide_to_christma.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fca24a2e3e0d5340</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">The Atheist's Guide to Christmas</title><published>2009-10-02T15:00:50Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T15:00:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/vUT4Wz8W8bM/the_atheists_guide_to_christma.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/the_atheists_guide_to_christma.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0007322615?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwgregladenc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0007322615"&gt;The Atheist's Guide to Christmas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwgregladenc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0007322615" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt; is now available!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.momlogic.com/images/biblebanner.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.momlogic.com/images/biblebanner.jpg" title="CheerBible" width="433" height="307"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, ripping through the word Christ helps you win games?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know that’s illegal.  You can’t endorse religion like that at a public school event.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former class president of the school (and current youth pastor) &lt;a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2009/sep/29/cheerleaders-religious-signs-draw-fire/"&gt;doesn’t seem to understand&lt;/a&gt; the legal problems here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The cheerleaders are not trying to push a religious cause, to shove religion down someone’s throat,” said local youth minister Brad Scott, who was LFO High’s class president in 2004. “The cheerleaders are just using Scripture to show motivation and inspiration to the players and the fans.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a complaint was lodged last week, the school board banned the Christian banners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fort Oglethorpe Mayor &lt;strong&gt;Ronnie Cobb&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2009/sep/29/cheerleaders-religious-signs-draw-fire/"&gt;doesn’t seem to understand&lt;/a&gt; the legal problems here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… Cobb vehemently disagrees with the ban and said he’ll call on the City Council to support the cheerleaders and their signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs don’t infringe on anyone’s religious rights and are good for school spirit, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m totally against them doing away with it,” Mr. Cobb said, adding that the cheerleaders’ rights are being abused.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor doesn’t seem to give a shit about any of the students who are not Christians, or the students who are too afraid to come out as non-Christians, or the Christians who don’t see a need to ram their faith down everyone else’s throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian Law Association’s &lt;strong&gt;Barbara J. Weller&lt;/strong&gt; is trying to advise students on &lt;a href="http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_159917.asp"&gt;how to subvert the system&lt;/a&gt; in a legal way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… there is another way around this problem. The students themselves have free speech rights at the school, including the right to discuss religion. Therefore, if the students themselves make other banners with Bible verses that are not part of their official cheerleading activities or an official banner for the game, these student banners would be protected free speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have been advising those who call us that while the students may not continue to put Bible verses on the banners they have been making officially for the games, the students have the right to make other banners with Bible verses on them, as long as they make the banners away from the school and bring them to the games to display on their own, without the school’s approval, permission or participation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the official school banners merely used the words, ‘Power, Love, Self Discipline’ on the official banners without reference to the Bible verse that includes them, this would not be religious expression and would not serve as the basis for a potential lawsuit.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there’s a lot of controversy surrounding these banners, the school board made the right decision.  The school must remain religiously neutral and not endorse a particular faith.  Whatever kids want to do on their own regarding faith is their decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size:10px"&gt;Have you seen this person?&lt;br&gt;
Why the hell not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post to say that I’m in Burbank, California for the Atheist Alliance International Convention!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re here too, let me know!  For the most part, I’ll be at the Secular Coalition for America table in the exhibit hall, so I shouldn’t be difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been told the wireless at the  Mermaid Centre (the venue for TAML) is good, so I’ll be &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;live tweeting&lt;/a&gt; the whole thing as I can as well. &lt;/p&gt;

It has been a microcosm for our understanding of evolutionary history itself – we tend to start with simple A leads to B leads to C stories which may be parsimonious but do not reflect the tendency for chaos inherent in evolution. Over time we find a complexly branching bush, and our simple linear storylines fall away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took a course on human evolution under Pat Shipman 24 years ago Ardipithecus was not known, now it is the oldest known member of the branch of primates that led to humans. I cannot say that it is the oldest human ancestor because because we do not yet know if it is a direct ancestor or a side branch. But if it is a side branch, it is still very close to our branching point with chimpanzees, and is likely very similar to our contemporary ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists led by Tim White &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8285180.stm"&gt;have completed a 17 year&lt;/a&gt; excavation, assembly, and assessment of specimens of Ardipithecus ramidus from about 36 individuals, including men, women, and children. The fossils come from the Awash region of Ethiopia – a location that has been a huge source of hominid fossils for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis shows that Ardipithecus were fully upright bipeds, although lacked foot arches, and they showed no adaptations for knuckle walking, but did have adaptations for tree climbing. This supports other research which concluded that human ancestors were never knuckle-walkers, which seems to be a later development in chimps and gorillas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, contrary to prior thought, our ancestors developed bipedalism while still living in the trees part time, and they were living in a wooded region – not on the open savanna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teeth of Ardipithecus reflect an omnivorous diet. Later Australopithecines had specialized molars for grinding hard food, like nuts and grains.  This also reflects the fact that hominids were not evolving on a straight line to modern humans, but each genus and species were specializing to their niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fossils date to about  4.4 million years ago. Australopithecus species (including the famous Lucy) date to as late as 4.0 million year. Ardipithecus is also more primitive than Australopithecus – closer to our common ancestor with chimps – in fact, so much so that our current specimens are probably late examples of a group that goes back even further (another reason why we need more fossils to make definitive judgments about how to draw the evolutionary lines). It is also possible that there was a rapid spurt of evolution between Ardipithecus and Australopithecus, but again, this is not a necessary hypothesis at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of interest is how different Ardipithecus is from modern chimps. This has a bearing on how close Ardipithecus is to the common ancestor between humans and chimps – a species that has not yet been discovered. This could mean that the branching point between humans and chimps, thought to be about 6 million years ago, might be further back than that. Or it could simply reflect how far chimps have evolved themselves since that branching point. Our human biases lead to the tendency to imagine that the common ancestor between humans and chimps was very chimp-like, but chimps are just as far from that ancestor as we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent fossil find and analysis that reflects 17 years of painstaking work by scientists. It adds to the growing evidence for the evolution of humans from primates that were common ancestors with modern great apes. It is also a beautiful transitional species – fully upright but lacking some adaptations for walking, with a chimp-like brain of 300-350 cc, retaining some adaptations for tree-climbing, but also with uniquely human features. This is the very definition of a transitional species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition it demonstrates how new fossil finds can simultaneously reinforce our big-picture conclusions (evolution itself, and that humans and apes have a common ancestor) while surprising us in the details (humans probably evolved bipedalism in wooded areas and not on the savanna).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all ways a beautiful addition to the human family tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW – if you want to see the worst science news reporting I found on this topic look&lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-10272-Dallas-Christian-Living-Examiner~y2009m10d1-Oldest-human-skelton-disproves-missing-link-theory"&gt; here at the Christian Living Examiner&lt;/a&gt;. At first I thought it was just the nutty headline writer, but the body of the article itself is just crap. Chris Esparza writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of the missing link is that somewhere way back when, there was a primate who almost seemed to be half monkey and half human, proving that there was at some point an evolutionary split. A recent discovery in Ethiopia disproves that theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Chris also gets a simple fact wrong, saying the specimen is 3.2 million years old when it is 4.4 – but that is just basic fact checking. But the bigger problem here is that the journalist obviously does not understand the first thing about evolutionary theory. They also completely misrepresented the scientist they quoted – essentially coming to the opposite conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sloppy and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Is the usage "I can't speak to the Iranian situation" as opposed to "I  can't speak [about/regarding] the Iranian situation" relatively recent  (or at least recently accelerating), as I perceive it to be? I feel as  though I first noticed it about a decade ago, and found it very  strange. I'm now almost accustomed to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no question that "speak to (a topic)" is quite a bit more recent than "speak of (a topic)", and somewhat more recent than "speak about (a topic)". But Rick is probably not old enough to have noticed the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the OED's entry for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;speak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the sub-entry &lt;strong&gt;II.11.a. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speak of&lt;/em&gt;, which is glossed "To mention, or discourse upon, in speech or writing", is cited from about 825:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c825&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vesp. Psalter&lt;/em&gt; cxviii. 46 [Ic] sprec of cyðnissum ðinum in ᵹesihðe cyninga. &lt;strong&gt;c950&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lindisf. Gosp.

Hom.&lt;/em&gt; 73 Of þe halie fulht spec ure drihten on oðer stude. &lt;strong&gt;c1200&lt;/strong&gt; ORMIN 6784 Goddspellboc ne spekeþ þ nohht Off all þatt oþerr genge. &lt;strong&gt;c1340&lt;/strong&gt; HAMPOLE &lt;em&gt;Pr.

Eng.&lt;/em&gt; II. viii. 481, I shall haue occasion to speake againe of these heretiks in the next chapter. &lt;strong&gt;1730&lt;/strong&gt; A. GORDON &lt;em&gt;Maffei's Amphith. &lt;/em&gt;58 The Theatre..is spoke of by Martial. &lt;strong&gt;1818&lt;/strong&gt; SCOTT &lt;em&gt;Br. Lamm.&lt;/em&gt; xviii, ‘And speaking of red-game,’ said the young scape-grace, interrupting his father. &lt;strong&gt;1884&lt;/strong&gt; tr. Lotze's &lt;em&gt;Metaph.&lt;/em&gt; 43 A common-place with every philosophy which spoke of Things at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the sub-entry &lt;strong&gt;II.14.e.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Speak to&lt;/em&gt;, glossed "To treat of or deal with, to discuss or comment on, (a subject) in speech or writing", is only cited from 1610, almost eight centuries later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1610&lt;/strong&gt; J. DOVE &lt;em&gt;Advt.

II. 110 A lawyer, who speaks to a cause, when the matter hath been almost exhausted by those who spoke before. &lt;strong&gt;1778&lt;/strong&gt; EARL MALMESBURY &lt;em&gt;Diaries &amp;amp; Corr.&lt;/em&gt; I. 166 Unprepared as he was for such a proposition, he could not, he said, off-hand, speak to it accurately. &lt;strong&gt;1869&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Daily News&lt;/em&gt; 28 Apr., The report..was spoken to by the Most Rev.

&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;Speak about&lt;/em&gt; (sub-entry &lt;strong&gt;II.8&lt;/strong&gt;), it's cited back to 1300 or so, validating Rick's sense of its antiquity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a1300&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cursor M.&lt;/em&gt; 24795 For to spek abute sum pais. &lt;strong&gt;1605&lt;/strong&gt; SHAKES. &lt;em&gt;Macb.&lt;/em&gt; I. iii. 83 Were such things here, as we doe speake about?&lt;strong&gt; 1671&lt;/strong&gt; H. M. tr. &lt;em&gt;Erasm. Colloq.&lt;/em&gt; 263 He falls on speaking about the success of their business. &lt;strong&gt;1737-&lt;/strong&gt; [see 14b]. &lt;strong&gt;1843&lt;/strong&gt; J. H. NEWMAN &lt;em&gt;Lett. &lt;/em&gt;(1891) II. 430 Sermons which speak more confidently about our position than I inwardly feel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick also asks, "I'm also curious which side of the Atlantic this usage may have sprouted from." It seems clear from the OED entry that all the early action was on the British side of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More seriously, it's quite possible that there's been a recent &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;-ward change in the balance of usage among the prepositions used with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;speak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to express topic (which include at least &lt;em&gt;of, about, regarding, on, upon,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;, of course with somewhat different shades of meaning and structural distributions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it's going to be a chore to test this quantitatively. One obvious problem is that there may be various things between the verb and a prepositional phrase expressing topic, e.g. "Mr. Pettijohn spoke at length regarding the Rocky Top Road issue". Another, more serious, problem is that in most instances of "speak to", the object of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the audience, not the topic  ("Palin Speaks to Investors in Hong Kong"). So (lacking an automatic classifier with adequate performance), you'd have to get a suitable random sample of instances of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;speak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; over time, and classify each one by hand. This is likely to take more work than will fit into one Breakfast Experiment™, at least with the resources now available to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note that the specific pattern "speak to the * situation" is apparently not common enough to support a trend analysis. For example, it has apparently only occurred &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/alternate/query?query=%22speak+to+the+*+situation%22&amp;amp;st=fromcse"&gt;once in the NYT news archive since 1981&lt;/a&gt;. So the net would have to cast more broadly in order to spot a trend, I think.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254482933242"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=3054">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8cc8c436f4f6fe5b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Getting Ready for Some Top Notch Guest Bloggers!</title><published>2009-10-02T10:44:19Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T10:44:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/02/getting-ready-for-some-top-notch-guest-bloggers/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear “Intersection Readers”: As some of you already know, I’m fortunate enough to be a fellow this year in MIT’s &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/knight-science/"&gt;Knight Science Journalism Program&lt;/a&gt;. In this, I have 11 distinguished “&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/knight-science/fellows/current.html"&gt;classmates&lt;/a&gt;“: Other mid career science journalists (actually I may be the youngest) who are taking classes at Harvard and MIT to broaden their skill set. It’s a time of deep transition in science journalism, so we’re all glad to be getting a breather–and learning new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the latter project goes, one important aspect of the program is to venture into new and unknown media realms; I, for example, want to learn more about visual media. But at the same time, as I am kinda the blogger of the class, I’ve offered to my colleagues the opportunity to see what online science communication is like via this blog. They have carte blanche to be guest posters, and indeed, we already have one cool Knight Fellow guest post in the pipeline (for Monday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this post, I simply want to get you ready for some new voices–please welcome them!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254482000778"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16675">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e7de4c7b698ec412</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Sports"/><title type="html">Mike Blowers’ “Amazing” Call Debunked</title><published>2009-10-02T11:00:14Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T11:00:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/02/mike-blowers-amazing-call-debunked/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: Some of you take this waaaay too seriously &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   I’m not going back on what I wrote below — I don’t think Blower’s call is as impressive as it has been made out to be.  It just so happens that many things (that I find relatively predictable) came together all at once.  That is pretty cool — I’m not denying it — but it’s not all that unusual.  If we took stock of all predictions, with this degree of specificity, made by broadcasters, I suspect we’d find that just about all fall short.  But a few will get several points right, as Blowers did.  He’s not a psychic, nor did he claim to be.  I’m not attacking &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just saying the hype over the call is overblown.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I state below, people always tend to remember the hits and forget the misses.  In this case, we’re making a big deal out of a hit (that is indeed &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; to occur once in a long while).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget that events having a one-in-a-million chance of happening still occur &lt;em&gt;thousands of times a day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/265657-dear-hemant-mehta-your-being-right-doesnt-make-mike-blowers-less-awesome/show_full"&gt;this is one of the better responses&lt;/a&gt; to this posting.  It’s by &lt;strong&gt;Sixty Feet, Six Inches&lt;/strong&gt; at Bleacher Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headlines read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re all referencing an “amazing” predicted call made by Seattle Mariners commentator &lt;strong&gt;Mike Blowers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before a game last week against the Toronto Blue Jays, Blowers predicted several things about rookie &lt;strong&gt;Matt Tuiasosopo&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)  He would hit his first major-league home run that day…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)  … off of pitcher &lt;strong&gt;Brian Tallet&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7)  … in left center field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And guess what happened…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/b494dinhd4Y%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26start%3D88%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems pretty amazing, right?  (You can &lt;a href="http://mynorthwest.com/?nid=374&amp;amp;sid=218287"&gt;hear high quality audio of the prediction being made and the actual play’s call here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s far from an “amazing prediction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s step back for a second.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed predictions like this are made all the time by sports broadcasters.  There are several &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; predictions every week regarding the final score, the quarterback’s accuracy, and a certain player’s rushing yards, etc. for every football game in the country.  Just about every one of those predictions is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never talk about those, though, because &lt;em&gt;humans are wired to remember the hits and forget the misses&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blowers’ call seemed to get a lot of hits, though… so let’s examine them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1)  He would hit his first major-league home run that day…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not an unusual prediction to make for a promising rookie.  I do wonder if Blowers ever made this prediction anytime before… but let’s give him credit here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s 1 for 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
2)  … off of pitcher &lt;strong&gt;Brian Tallet&lt;/strong&gt;…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Tallet was the starting pitcher.  It doesn’t take a baseball expert to know Taller will be pitching for most of the game, barring a really bad day.  Blowers doesn’t get credit for this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s 1 for 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
3)  … during his second at-bat of the game…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice, specific prediction, right?  Not really.  There’s a good reason he made that particular call.  &lt;a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090930&amp;amp;content_id=7247054&amp;amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;amp;fext=.jsp&amp;amp;c_id=mlb"&gt;Blowers said&lt;/a&gt;, “I thought he would take some pitches in his first at-bat, because he’s a rookie.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, players are less likely to swing early in the game so they can see more pitches, get a feel for the pitcher’s style, and take advantage of it all later.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s 1 for 3.  (Though this one is arguable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
4)  … on a 3-1 count…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blowers gets no credit for this one.  Typically, a pitcher will make difficult pitches early in the count to see if anything works against the batter.  But if the batter doesn’t swing, a 3-1 count (3 balls and 1 strike) isn’t out of the question.  Not only that, but pitcher Tallet was known to be “a little wild” according to Blowers himself.  That is to say, he’d work himself into a 3-1 count more often than other pitchers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the count gets to 3-1, a batter can expect to see something hittable.  You can assume pitchers don’t want to walk a player with a 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ball, so they try to throw something in the strike zone.  Indeed, a 3-1 count is known as a “hitter’s count.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s 1 for 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
5)  … it would be a fastball…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a 3-1 pitch, one would expect to see a fastball.  As stated a little bit ago, the pitcher doesn’t want to walk the batter.  He’s not going throw a curveball or a slider that could get away from the plate.  A fastball has the best chance of fooling the batter… in fact, the &lt;a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090930&amp;amp;content_id=7247054&amp;amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;amp;fext=.jsp&amp;amp;c_id=mlb"&gt;commentators even say&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;right before the pitch&lt;/em&gt; “It’s going to be a fastball.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside to this for the batter is that he knows what’s coming and he prepares to swing fast and hard at the ball.  I don’t have the stats in front of me, but I would suspect the number of home-runs hit on 3-1 fastballs are higher than you would find for just about all other pitches and counts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s 1 for 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
6)  … and the ball would land in the second deck of the Blue Jays’ stadium…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one just didn’t happen.  &lt;strong&gt;Rachel Maddow&lt;/strong&gt; was actually wrong in the clip above when she said Blowers nailed every prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s 1 for 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
7)  … in left center field.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuiasosopo is a right-handed batter.  Most of his balls are going to be hit toward the left side of the field.  Blowers doesn’t get credit for pointing out the obvious.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s 1 for 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 for 7 isn’t impressive in the least.  Plenty of people have had better accuracy when playing the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s not make Blowers’ call a big deal.  It was entertaining, but it wasn’t impressive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From rabbits to night-club bouncers, there&amp;#39;s a whole cast of nocturnal characters who come out to play. It&amp;#39;s a similar story with the brain. When we disengage from the outside world, the brain doesn&amp;#39;t go to sleep. Rather, there&amp;#39;s a suite of neural regions, known collectively as the &amp;quot;default mode network&amp;quot;, that spring to life. Over the last decade, this recognition of the brain&amp;#39;s intrinsic functioning has led neuroscientists to perform numerous studies in which they scan the brain during rest, looking for areas that correlate with each other in the rise and fall of their activity.We now have maps of &amp;quot;intrinsic connectivity networks&amp;quot; and findings showing how these patterns are affected by ageing and illness. But not everyone is happy. Many psychologists are concerned that this field reflects a &amp;quot;decognitivisation&amp;quot; of neuroscience, and that studies of a person&amp;#39;s brain at rest are, almost by definition, poorly controlled (see &amp;quot;the Resting Brain&amp;quot; in this month&amp;#39;s Psychologist magazine).It is against this backdrop that Zarrar Shehzad and twelve co-authors have examined the reliability of resting-state networks across multiple brain scans, separated by up to 16 months. They say this is the first time the test-retest reliability of these networks has been explicitly tested. Their finding is that the functioning of a resting brain may well be unconstrained, but that some of the intrinsic networks that emerge are nonetheless stable over time.The researchers scanned the brains of 26 participants three times. An initial scan was performed and then 5 to 16 months later, scans two and three were performed within 45 minutes of each other. Each scan lasted about five minutes during which time the participants were told to rest with their eyes open, whilst before them was a black background with the word &amp;quot;relax&amp;quot; written in white.Shehzad&amp;#39;s team focused on three regions of interest including those areas previously identified as the &amp;quot;default mode network&amp;quot; and its opposite number, the &amp;quot;task positive network&amp;quot;. As in previous resting-state studies they found ample evidence of correlations in neural activity across various regions of the brain. What&amp;#39;s more, these patterns of correlation tended to be moderately to robustly stable across the three scans. Stability of linkage between regions was greatest for those that were positively correlated (when one goes up, the other goes up), rather than negatively correlated (when ones goes up, the other goes down). The researchers also found that intrinsic correlations were particularly stable within the &amp;quot;default mode network&amp;quot;, which extends from the prefrontal cortex along the midline to the parietal and medial temporal lobes.Intrinsic correlations within the &amp;quot;task positive network&amp;quot;, which is anti-correlated with the &amp;quot;default mode network&amp;quot; and which tends to be more active during extrinsic tasks, were less stable over time. The researchers said this probably reflects the fact that the task positive network is a superordinate system consisting of numerous sub-networks.&amp;quot;Our findings support the audacious hypothesis that intrinsic connectivity networks, which are readily observed during resting state fMRI studies (as well as during task-based studies), reflect the fundamental self-organising properties of the brain,&amp;quot; the researchers said._________________________________Shehzad, Z., Kelly, A., Reiss, P., Gee, D., Gotimer, K., Uddin, L., Lee, S., Margulies, D., Roy, A., Biswal, B., Petkova, E., Castellanos, F., &amp;amp; Milham, M.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California (CA) Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) has an informational booklet on Acupuncture and Asian Medicine that besides depicting many New Age fantasies about prescientific medicine, also makes the unfounded claim that based on a 1997 consensus panel, the NIH formally “endorses” the use of acupuncture for a set of specific conditions, and that there is “clear evidence” that it is effective for some of them. This booklet is available at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.acupuncture.ca.gov/pubs_forms/consumer_guide.pdf"&gt;http://www.acupuncture.ca.gov/pubs_forms/consumer_guide.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering about this “clear evidence,”  I wrote a letter a few months ago to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and asked for a clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their candid response explicitly stated that the CA booklet “misstates the purpose of the 1997 consensus panel on acupuncture.” The NCCAM also added that as a “Federal research agency, the NIH does not endorse any product, service or treatment, nor are NIH consensus documents statements of policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found out that the NIH Consensus Development Program’s website has now a disclaimer concerning the 1997 consensus statement on acupuncture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This statement is more than five years old and is provided solely for historical purposes. Due to the cumulative nature of medical research, new knowledge has inevitably accumulated in this subject area in the time since the statement was initially prepared. Thus some of the material is likely to be out of date, and at worst simply wrong.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore wrote to the CA Acupuncture Board to inform them of their misstatements. Not receiving an answer, I took the matter to Secretary Fred Aguiar, the Director of CA State and Consumer Services Agency, which oversees the DCA and the Acupuncture Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where things went from error and misstatement to persistence in ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response letter I finally received from the DCA indeed stated that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Board and its legal counsel, LaVonne Powell, concur that the consumer’s guide does not contain erroneous statements on the efficacy of acupuncture.  The Board states that the 1997 consensus statement released by the NIH, a part of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, clearly states that “there is clear evidence that needle acupuncture is efficacious for adult postoperative and chemotherapy nausea and vomiting and probably for the nausea of pregnancy.”  In addition to other supporting statements, the report stated that continued access to qualified acupuncture professionals for appropriate conditions should be ensured.  The report concluded that there was sufficient evidence of acupuncture’s value to expand its use into conventional medicine and to encourage further studies of its physiology and clinical value.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the Board acknowledges that the 1997 NIH consensus statement does not specifically state that they “formally endorse” the use of acupuncture, supporting statements in the report could be defined as an endorsement.  However, prior to reprinting the consumer’s guide, the Board will contact the NIH for their input concerning this issue.  If warranted, appropriate changes will be made to the consumer’s guide prior to printing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, while the NCCAM (one of the institutes that make up the NIH) maintains that the NIH does not endorse any product, service or treatment, and that it is a misstatement to say that the 1997 NIH consensus panel of scientists has found clear evidence of efficacy, CA bureaucrats and their attorney insist it is otherwise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it seems safe to presume the Board and DCA have remained willfully blind to the well-conducted research since 1997 that has found very little evidence of efficacy, if any, for the purported indications that are listed in the above-mentioned Consumer’s Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, while science- and evidence-based medicine has gradually became the basis for international, national, and regional public health policies, here in CA the world of healthcare is going backwards, and pseudo-science combined with sectarian politics seem to play an increasingly important role in public health policies on CAM. Any scientific evidence against the efficacy of a dubious modality, such as traditional acupuncture, is therefore deliberately shed or replaced with the biased views of individuals who are part of a “consumer protection” agency, but do not have any knowledge of biomedical sciences and evidence-based medicine; and who persistently place special interest politics–e.g., CA acupuncture training programs’–before the public’s health, safety and welfare. The CA DCA and its Acupuncture Board thus remain woefully inept in assisting the consumer in distinguishing between scientifically proven therapies and unproven modalities that are based on a combination of voodoo-science and a set of New Age fantasies about Eastern civilizations, and their mythical science and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

We memorize the signs and symptoms and collaborate methods of treatment. This conundrum continues on and on in the academic system only to leave us just as adequate as those which have thought us. It’s easy to fall into this spiral and often at times forget to challenge yourself or the opinions of others.     Let’s stop for a minute and think what do we know about back pain? The list of causes can go on and on such as a herniated disc, arthritis or even spondylolisthesis. Maybe there are other culprits such as trigger points, infections and even forms of cancer.      We have now taken things and put them in a nice categorical term. Patients have something to search for when they go home on the internet and insurance companies can make their claims. However, how often do we probe deeper and forget to trace back to what caused the pain in the first place.     If we don’t attempt to understand the origin of pain in the low back we will merely stay at a plateau and not progress as a profession. The key to understanding diagnosis is breaking things down to the specific structure that is causing the pain. No spectrum of symptoms lumped into a group can always answer this question. We merely need to rely on anatomy, histology, chemical processes and pain right down to the cellular level. Not easy is it..?     Bogduk &amp;amp; April being experts in studying pain explore this idea. A list of criteria can be met in order to answer your question. 1. Could it be a source of back pain?     Basically is it actually feasible that a structure can generate pain. To answer this question you have to know does it have a nociceptive nerve supply.  Before the 1980’s the disc was not rendered a source of back pain. It wasn’t until studies started to show its nerve supply that the idea of discogenic pain started to evolve. Now studies are looking more thoroughly into discogenic pain (2,3,4).  Anatomical studies have rendered muscles, ligaments, vertebrae, synovial joints, intervertebral disc and even fascia as structures with a nociceptive nerve supply.2. Can it be a source of back pain?     Just because it’s possible for me to run a marathon doesn’t mean I will. Ok stupid analogy but although structures have the capability to produce pain doesn’t mean they will. After all there is no correlation to degenerative disc disease found on a radiograph and the amount of pain experienced by the patient. Furthermore, finding a pars defect to indicate spondylolysis doesn’t always mean it’s what causes the patients pain. Therefore the structure has to be shown to produce pain in a normal non-symptomatic person in order to fulfill this second criterion.3. Is it ever a cause of back pain?      To understand this question you have to look at things in an epidemiological manner. Think of something you diagnosed a patient with that had low back pain. Now ask yourself..is it possible for an asymptomatic patient to have this problem?? Can a non symptomatic patient have degenerative disc disease or spondylolisthesis?? The answer is yes. 4. Is it ever a source of back pain?     Bogduk &amp;amp; April discuss how pain cannot be seen, cannot be photographed and is subjective. Back pain is barley a lethal cause of death so we never really explore it at the microscopic and molecular level. Consider that we are often left with forms of imaging that look at macroscopic pathologies.  Although, we see degenerative disc disease on an xray it doesn’t show things on the cellular level. It may be that we just have to take this diagnosis and look at it more microscopically to see it as a source of pain. Even if a spondylolysis is evident on radiographs we order a SPECT after to see if the pars defect is active or inactive.     Their opinion is with the use of diagnostic blocking and provocation discography the essence of pain can be explored.  However, this form of diagnosis is hard to come by and can be extremely painful. So although we may not have such tools in our office these forms of diagnosing are helping to set the foundation of where pain is coming from. So the next time someone comes in to you with a problem and asks you “Doctor where is the pain coming from”..go ahead try to answer them.1. Rehabilitation of the Spine: A Practitioner’s Manual 2ed.

&lt;p&gt;This has already made big news in the mainstream press but deserved a few weeks here. &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091001/ap_on_sc/us_sci_before_lucy"&gt;A new hominid fossil, Ardi, has stolen the oldest human ancestor crown away from Lucy&lt;/a&gt;. Ardi lived 4.4 million years ago in what is now Ethiopia. For those keeping track, that’s 4,394,000 years before the existence of the entire universe, according to Young Earth Creationists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let the name fool you though. It stands for Ardipithecus. Ardi’s actually female. Was I the only one who was picturing this guy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:IN8mTQ0R3wPVgM:http://witz.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/artielange.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:IN8mTQ0R3wPVgM:http://witz.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/artielange.jpg" alt="" width="89" height="130"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 110-pound, 4-foot female roamed forests a million years before the famous Lucy, long studied as the earliest skeleton of a human ancestor.This older skeleton reverses the common wisdom of &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;human evolution&lt;/span&gt;, said anthropologist C. Owen Lovejoy of &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Kent State University&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than humans evolving from an ancient chimp-like creature, the new find provides evidence that chimps and humans evolved from some long-ago common ancestor — but each evolved and changed separately along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

Living in Hawaii, it&amp;#39;s tough to afford the round trip to North Carolina all by me onesies, so here&amp;#39;s my attempt at getting the funds!When Good Genes Go BadWe tend to think of evolution as a directional process, whether its from simplicity to complexity or &amp;#39;less fit&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;more fit.&amp;#39; Even the classic images of evolution, like the evolution of man, reveal our inherent bias. But that is not always the case; species all over exhibit a variety of traits which damage their reproductive fitness despite the best-laid plans of genes and evolution. You see, times are always changing, and what might be good for you one day could be disastrous the next (just imagine if the flock of seagulls haircut was genetic, and you can see what I mean). The big problem is that even if a trait was once adaptive or even just neutral, it can later become maladaptive as pressures shift. And that, unfortunately, is what has happened to the Hawaiian Akepa.Akepas (Loxops coccineus) are one of native species of Hawaiian honeycreeper that lives in the upper elevations of Hawaii&amp;#39;s forests. They&amp;#39;re stunning birds, with the males turning bright red when they reach adulthood and females remaining a pretty green. For centuries, they&amp;#39;ve used they&amp;#39;re specialized, crossed bills to eat caterpillars and other bugs and drink nectar from the native Koa and Ohi&amp;#39;a trees. Like other native species, they took a hit when people arrived. Habitats were leveled for farming, invasive plants overtook native trees creating less food and habitat, and invasive birds began to take what little was left. However, they dodged a bullet that is devastating some of their closest kin by living too high up for the introduced mosquitos and avian malaria to attack their blood. Sure, the loss of their habitat due to farming was tough, but we&amp;#39;ve started fixing that, so they&amp;#39;re primed to re-expand back into their native range.That is, they would be primed to, if they could start producing enough young to expand back into the forests we&amp;#39;re restoring. Despite the relatively long breeding season they have in which to produce young, which lasts from early spring until winter, they just don&amp;#39;t seem to have the reproductive rate they need to bounce back. But it isn&amp;#39;t that they don&amp;#39;t have enough young akepas. The females are pumping out baby birds like it&amp;#39;s their job when they can, but the breeding rate is still dangerously low. What&amp;#39;s going wrong?Well, it all starts with these invasive Japanese White-Eyes I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before. They&amp;#39;re up in the Akepas forests, eating their food, and putting stress on breeding mothers. The competition doesn&amp;#39;t help, and its lowering the overall fitness of the breeding birds, hampering their survival rates. But the white-eyes aren&amp;#39;t entirely to blame: they breed later in the year, so the competition is only really bad during the later half of the breeding season, which still leaves an entire early breeding season to make babies - and the akepa do. But the population numbers just aren&amp;#39;t growing. Something else is going wrong.Blame evolution. You see, the akepas have evolved a trait which is dooming their population.Once upon a time, before the white-eyes moved in, the Akepa populations were booming. There were a lot of males fighting for a good number of females, and it worked out that the bigger, healthier males managed to get laid far more often than smaller ones. It also worked out that those mothers who nested earlier got more food and had bigger, healthier babies. Somehow, a genetic switch was turned on, and the akepa started biasing their young&amp;#39;s sex, in a process called Sex Allocation. It&amp;#39;s a phenomenon you&amp;#39;ve probably heard about in context with deer. Female deer, when healthy and well fed, are more likely to have males. The theory goes that because in deer society only the best males reproduce, to produce a weak male is a waste of reproductive effort. Girls, on the other hand, are always welcome in a top male&amp;#39;s harem, so small, weaker girls still can still pass on genes.Something similar occurs in akepas. The females who produced males earlier in the breeding season were rewarded with strong, dominant boys that had lots of kids because, in general, males are able to have more offspring than females (the whole sperm versus egg thing). Somehow, through the magic of natural selection and genetics, it became the rule. Breed early, have a boy, breed later, have a girl.It&amp;#39;s a battle over resources, and the white-eyes are winning. Photos c/o AAASThen the white-eyes made the Hawaiian forests their home. They breed later in the year, and consequently, compete far more voraciously for food and nesting sites with the akepas during the later half of the breeding season. During that time, akepas that breed have trouble getting a good nest site and enough food to feed their young, meaning that few of the later-breeding akepa chicks survive. Since competition is lower in the early season, the chicks born then do just fine. The problem is, they&amp;#39;re almost all males.From 1987, when white-eyes were few and far between, to 2005, after a major explosion in the white-eye populations, the sex ratio of male to female akepas shifted from close to 50-50 males-females (57% female) to only 13% female. In the early years, from 1987-1999, 32 female chicks and 24 male chicks survived to adulthood. From 2000-2006, 27 male chicks made it, but only four female chicks did. FOUR females.What was once an adaptive strategy - producing mostly males earlier in the breeding season - has become dangerously maladaptive. And, unfortunately, there&amp;#39;s no evidence to suggest that evolution is coming to their rescue and dismantling the seasonal variation in sex allocation. The now-endangered species appears to have little hope unless serious management practices dramatically increase the survival rates of akepa chicks in the later months of their breeding season. In the akepa, good genes have gone bad, and the species is likely to go extinct from it.Leonard A. Freed, Rebecca L. Cann, &amp;amp; Karl Diller (2009).

Not only does packing heat fail to help in the event of an armed robbery,... individuals in possession of a gun were 4.46 (P &amp;lt; 0.05) times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not in possession. Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist, this adjusted odds ratio increased to 5.45 (P &amp;lt; 0.05).That&amp;#39;s right, carrying a gun increases the odds that you&amp;#39;ll be shot by an armed assailant. It also increases the odds that you&amp;#39;ll be shot fatally, by about 4.23 times. The authors interviewed 677 gun assault victims in Philadelphia, from between 2003 and 2006, with 648 interviews drawn from the general population in the same period as a control. (If you can&amp;#39;t get to the paper on the journal website, Mudede links to a ScienceDaily article about the result that gives more detail.)

Here&amp;#39;s empirical evidence that returning violence with violence (or having the ability to do so) doesn&amp;#39;t lead to better outcomes -- unless, of course, you&amp;#39;re of the school of thought that it&amp;#39;s better to be shot than to lose your wallet or your pride. I doubt this will have much impact on the U.S. political conversation about guns and gun control, because as I&amp;#39;ve noted before, this is not a subject about which people think rationally. Nevertheless, it&amp;#39;s a statistic I intend to remember for the next time I&amp;#39;m asked to defend the ethics of nonresistance.

It turned out that it was possible to spot the religious women in the sample from their faces alone.Now interpreting this was a little tricky, because the non-religious &amp;#39;typical face&amp;#39; was smiling, and the religious one wasn&amp;#39;t. Which suggests that, in the UK at least, you can spot religious people because they don&amp;#39;t smile.But here&amp;#39;s a new study, from the US this time, that gives a radically different slant. Laura Naumann (UCB) and colleagues got a group of students and took whole-body (clothed!) photographs, first unposed and then after asking hem to stand in a standard pose.They also assessed personality by asking the subjects to rate their own personality and also asking them to nominate three friends to rate them. This is the &amp;#39;gold standard&amp;#39; of personality assessment – because often your friends are a better judge of your personality than you are.The also asked them whether they were religious, and their political orientation.Then they asked a second group of students to assess the subjects personality based on photos alone. Basically, individuals are pretty poor at judging personality. In the standardized pose, they were just about able to pick up on extraversion. In the unstandardized pose, there was a hint towards being able to spot the religious.Things got better when the researchers took a &amp;#39;wisdom of crowds&amp;#39; approach. This uses a kind of democratic approach, averaging the individual estimates to see what the consensus opinion is.  The crowd was able to pick out a religious person just over 60% of the time (you&amp;#39;d expect 50% by chance alone). It was a little bit easier to spot them in the unposed photos, but not much (62% vs 64% - small, but statistically significant).So, it seems that there is something about how the religious people looked that enabled the raters to pick them out. So the question is, what was that?Well, the researchers marked all the photos according to several criteria, and rated these against personality. On average, the religious people were more likely to be energetic, relaxed and, importantly, smiling.Yes, that&amp;#39;s right, in this sample of US students, you can pick out the religious because they&amp;#39;re smiling. In the UK sample (of New Scientist readers) they were less likely to be smiling.What&amp;#39;s happening here? It could be an age effect, or it could be the different social status of religion in the USA and the UK. To be part of the mainstream in the USA means to be religious, whereas the opposite applies in the UK (for most people in the UK, religion is unimportant, even if they aren&amp;#39;t exactly atheists).In the US, unlike the UK, being non-religious is linked to social exclusion.It&amp;#39;s interesting to compare the characteristics of religious people in the sample with popular people. They&amp;#39;re pretty similar. You can see from the graph that, like religious people, people with high self-esteem or who are likeable are more likely to smile and to look energetic and relaxed.Unlike popular people, though, religious people aren&amp;#39;t more likely to look healthy, ordinary, or stand with their arms behind their backs. I&amp;#39;m not too sure what to make of these differences!Here&amp;#39;s another interesting nugget from the study. The first graph show the actual, objective characteristics that are linked to religion and other traits. But their data also let them assess the extent to which their raters used these characteristics as cues.In other words they could compare what their observers thought characterized religious people, with what actually did. The results are shown in the second graph.The first thing to note is that the &amp;#39;What people think&amp;#39; bar tends to be longer than the &amp;#39;Actual&amp;#39; bar. What this means is that people think it&amp;#39;s easier to spot religious people than it actually is.The other interesting thing is the discrepancies. The raters thought they could pick out the religious people by picking those who were healthy, ordinary and, most especially neat. But in fact the religious people weren&amp;#39;t really any of these things.The curious thing is that the raters didn&amp;#39;t expect religious people to look relaxed. Whereas, in fact, looking relaxed was a key attribute of the religious.So there you have it. They expected religious people to be neat, but in fact they were relaxed! Why should this be? I suspect it&amp;#39;s simply because the raters didn&amp;#39;t realise that, in their community, religious people are simply the popular people._______________________________________________________________________________________Naumann LP, Vazire S, Rentfrow PJ, &amp;amp; Gosling SD (2009).

One of the most direct and straightforward ways to do this is through Donors Choose, which facilitates direct contributions to primary and secondary classrooms (alas, for the moment only in the United States). The projects are described in detail, and one knows exactly why and how the funds will be used. Your gift has a clear and discernible impact, emphasized by the personal handwritten thank you notes you receive from the students.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=23711"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/10/SocialMediaFinal2_725c.jpg" alt="Donors choose social media challenge" title="Donors choose social media challenge" width="600" height="105"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To further incentivize readers, Donors Choose runs a yearly &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/motherboard.html?motherboardId=8"&gt;Social Media Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, where blogs compete to win fame and (give away) fortune. Last year we handidly trounced the folks over at ScienceBlogs. Over 100 CV readers donated a total of almost $9,000, impacting 1,700 students across the nation. We’re truly proud; our readers came through big time! This year we’re once again throwing our hat in the ring. &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=23711"&gt;Donate here&lt;/a&gt;. Tax deductible. Other bloggers are encouraged to set up their own challenges, or advertise ours (and we’ll happily list you at the top of our Donors Choose page). And although that warm feeling in your heart from helping needy children will certainly be sufficient, we’ll also post a list of all who contribute more than $100 (unless you request anonymity, of course). This is an incredibly direct way to improve the state of science and math education. Donations start as low as $5! And our schools need all the help they can get.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>daniel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254457098380"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/tweetlinks_10-01-09.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91a1db1018045799</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Tweetlinks"/><title type="html">Tweetlinks, 10-01-09</title><published>2009-10-02T04:32:03Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T04:32:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/f8-lXSO2rXI/tweetlinks_10-01-09.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/tweetlinks_10-01-09.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Follow &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BoraZ" title=""&gt;me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to get these, and more, in something closer to Real Time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, of course that I'm a big fan of &lt;a href="http://donorschoose.org/"&gt;DonorsChoose&lt;/a&gt;.  And you'll recall that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/01/naked_chicks_in_peta_ads_the_e.php"&gt;PETA's tactics make them a problematic organization as far as I'm concerned&lt;/a&gt; regardless of what your views on animal welfare or animal rights might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a new twist on a story that &lt;a title="The dangers of monolingualism" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1157"&gt;our legal desk covered&lt;/a&gt; back in February: at the annual &lt;a href="http://improbable.com/"&gt;Ig Nobel awards ceremony&lt;/a&gt; earlier tonight, the Prize for Literature was awarded to the Garda Síochána na hÉireann (i.e. the Irish Police Force) for the 50 or more speeding tickets they've issued in the name "Prawo Jazdy", Polish for "driver's license."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as if that wasn't enough onomastic excitement, the 2009 Ig Nobel Prize for Veterinary Medicine was awarded for work reported in Bertenshaw, C. and Rowlinson, P., &lt;em&gt;Exploring Stock Managers' Perceptions of the Human-Animal Relationship on Dairy Farms and an Association with Milk Production&lt;/em&gt;, Anthrozoos: A Multidisciplinary Journal of The Interactions of People and Animals 22:1, pp. 59-69, 2009. Specifically, Dr. Bertenshaw and Dr. Rowlinson share the prize for their demonstration that (and here I quote from the article's abstract): &lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;On farms where cows were called by name, milk yield was 258 liters higher than on farms where this was not the case (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all this groundbreaking research leaves me with more questions than answers. What is the causal direction behind the correlation? And if my cow produced 238 liters too little milk, would I admit to the researchers the names I used for her? And how much milk can an Irish policeman get from a speeding Polish cow?&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.baevents.com/rasnaheireann/IrishCow.gif" alt="Cow" title="Polish cow on Irish vacation" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Beaver</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254455637861"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/thursday_afternoon_jam_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/019eecd8c19b2362</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Thursday Afternoon Jam...</title><published>2009-10-02T03:01:51Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T03:01:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/Pz5b-Ai6wHE/thursday_afternoon_jam_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/thursday_afternoon_jam_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I heard this while listening to my blip.fm and heard this song.

There was much rushing in and out of the house looking for flashlights and other tools to help get the job done. After the neighbor left, Jim wanted to drive somewhere and couldn't find the keys. Clearly he had just had them because he was working on the car. Where could they be? We searched up and down throughout the house, but we couldn't find them and eventually had to use a spare set.

The next morning as I was getting ready to leave for our school carpool in our other car, I found them sitting on a workbench in the garage, just a few feet from the car! Why couldn't we find them when we needed them? Everyone's experienced a similar problem at some point, whether it's trying to find the remote for the TV or the olives in the fridge. Why are objects so hard to find sometimes and at the tip of our fingers other times?

One part of the answer is a phenomenon called "contextual cuing." Basically, this means we're good at finding things in places we've found them before, but bad at finding them elsewhere. The more often we see an object in a certain place, the quicker we are at finding it there. It doesn't take long to train people to locate new objects in this way. For example, a researcher might ask people to search for the letter "T" or "L" in an array of letters. Most of the time, the array is completely new, and the T or L is in a different place. But if occasionally the same array appears, people are quick to recognize it and find the letter much faster. It even works if only the portion of the array around the target letter stays the same and the rest of it changes.

So the question then becomes this: what are they key elements of the area you're searching? If I usually leave my keys on the kitchen counter, will I still be able to find them if Nora has cluttered it up with a baking project? In one contextual cuing study, the researchers showed viewers scenes filled with distractor objects that were either black or white, and asked them to search for a target. After they had learned to find the target object quickly among a particular pattern of distractors, the experimenters changed the distractors from black to white (or vice-versa). The advantage of contextual cuing disappeared.

Is the color of the surrounding environment really an important part of how we find objects? Krista Ehinger and James Brockmore suspected that in more realistic environments, color may not matter as much. They showed volunteers images like this and asked them to search for a tiny letter T or L:

Can you spot it? How about in this picture? Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Its not something I really thought I would ever do, but I have to say I realy enjoyed meeting these folks. The good part was that it was a group of very intelligent people, each with different stories of how they dropped their religion or never had any. Its a good group of people, and to be honest I look forward to going to other gatherings. I rather happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;However I did find, what I would consider a somewhat prevalent sense of spite toward religion that many of them had, almost a pettiness with regard to religion. I have to say I'm an atheism, but I'm not 'into' atheism. I didnt go to this to strengthen my lack of beleif, I went to it jsut to meet some like minded people. So there were a number of things that sort of put me off. For example, as we were paying, one of the member crossed off "in God we Trust" form each and every bill she was handing in. That just seems like a petty act that really doesnt do anything -even if it were legal. There were also few skeptics there. So we are talking about a group of people with a significant percentage of Bill Maher type atheists. But I think it as a relatively minor number of peopel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;That said, someone in the group posted on our discussion board the following Argument From Gravity. I kind of liked it an thought I would share. I modified it a bit to improve it some more. Give it a shot next time you have some Jehovah's Witnesses or mormons at your door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I was in a coffee shop web surfing on my notebook when I was approached by a godbot, who offered me a bible. I said I have one and politely declined his. He then asked if I was “saved” and I replied “No, I’m an Atheist” He then launched into a diatribe designed to convert me….which I politely interrupted and asked him what the most powerful and grand force in the universe is…..&lt;br&gt;He thought about it a few seconds and then said (predictably) that god is&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I said OK, physics has defined 4 natural forces at work in the universe:&lt;br&gt;THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE&lt;br&gt;The strong nuclear force binds together the protons and neutrons that comprise an atomic nucleus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE&lt;br&gt;The weak nuclear force causes the radioactive decay of certain particular atomic nuclei.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE&lt;br&gt;The electromagnetic force determines the ways in which electrically charged particles interact with each other and also with magnetic fields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GRAVITY&lt;br&gt;Gravitation is a force of attraction that acts between each and every particle in the Universe and is the weakest of the 4 forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gravity is so weak that a baby, picking up a toy, has overcome the gravitational pull of an 8000 mile diameter ball of nickel-iron. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I said there is a theory that states: An unsupported object, at rest, in a gravitational field will fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point I took a penny from my pocket, and dropped it several times in my outstretched hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I then said to him, for a total instrumentation cost of one red cent, I can, any time, anywhere, conclusively demonstrate the existence of weakest force in the universe, you theists have had thousands of years and trillions of present day dollars and they still haven't come up with a lick of convincing evidence that could show me this most powerful force “god” of yours….&lt;br&gt;And until you can, I suggest you go away and stop bothering me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Nice. To the point and I would love to hear the theists response to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/26613182-193248602425009775?l=techskeptic.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Techskeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Effort Sisyphus</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254448577497"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/baucus_continues_to_screw_the.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc5d252e7b08dfc3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Health"/><title type="html">Baucus continues to screw the health care pooch</title><published>2009-10-02T02:49:53Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T02:49:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/Vt7wak3t72k/baucus_continues_to_screw_the.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/baucus_continues_to_screw_the.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Olberman's overview: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/baucus_continues_to_screw_the.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/baucus_continues_to_screw_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/Vt7wak3t72k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254446987574"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/an_envious_fever_of_pale_and_b.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe9505f47ca7e511</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Absurd medical claims"/><title type="html">An envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation...</title><published>2009-10-01T21:04:14Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T21:04:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/Exr_t3xFB-M/an_envious_fever_of_pale_and_b.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/an_envious_fever_of_pale_and_b.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fever is a fascinating phenomenon.  The biochemistry and physiology of it is fairly well understood (sort of), but historically and presently, it is endowed with great teleologic power.  The nearly magical ability of the body to heat up dramatically was noted by the earliest physicians.  In the Hippocratean school, fever was often viewed within the humoral framework as an excess of yellow bile and was seen to be beneficial, although it was also recognized that some fevers were a grave sign.  Later in the history of medicine, fever was equated with infection as was thought to be "a bad thing" and fought with whatever means were available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern medicine, fever is not seen as a good or bad thing, but as a sign of "a commotion in the blood".  The same careful observations that the ancients made were made again in the context of science, and the physiology of fever was teased out.  Certain substances (such as endotoxin) were found to reliably reproduce fever, and observations such as this helped us understand what fever is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fever as a therapy in and of itself was explored by Dr. Wiliiam Coley in the early 20th century when he noticed that cancer patients who contracted and survived erysipelas infections sometimes had regression of tumor.  He developed an early form of immunotherapy whereby he gave people a dose of "toxins" inducing a sepsis-like response.  In modern times, interleukin-2 is used to treat some cancers and makes people appear similarly septic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout much of the last century, though, fever has generally been seen as a "bad thing" because of it's association with illness.  Fevers are often associated with discomfort, and medications that lower fever make people feel better.  This may be because of the lowering of the fever, or it may be because the medication reduces the production of substances that cause both the fever and the discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has long been suspected, and some animal models have borne it out, that fever can be beneficial in helping improve some parameters of infection.  No good studies, however, have shown any significant benefit in humans to allowing a fever to "run its course", and in children, fevers can cause seizures.  In the hospital we often hold off on treating fevers in order to observe the course of a disease, but more often then not, we treat fevers to make people feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/epidemic-of-fever-phobia_b_305615.html"&gt;if you're a doctor-wannabe&lt;/a&gt;, you may look at this long history, ignore all of modern immunology, and take a child-like view of fever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/an_envious_fever_of_pale_and_b.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/an_envious_fever_of_pale_and_b.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/Exr_t3xFB-M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254445020214"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-9149899330840180238">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6be4c68d8d422903</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="My World" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Genealogy" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Emma Hale Is My (Distant) Cousin</title><published>2009-10-02T00:18:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-02T00:18:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/10/emma-hale-is-my-distant-cousin.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/9149899330840180238/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=9149899330840180238" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> You&amp;#39;re probably wondering who the heck is Emma Hale?

&lt;p&gt;What is FBB?  As the site says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Foundation Beyond Belief is a 501(c)(3) charitable and educational foundation created (1) to focus, encourage and demonstrate humanistic generosity, and (2) to support a nationwide education and support program for humanist parents.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Full disclosure: I’m on the board of directors)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say pre-launch because, come January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, the full website will be available to use (including a social network, discussion forum, a list of beneficiaries to support, etc).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do right now, though?  You can &lt;a href="http://www.foundationbeyondbelief.org/user/register"&gt;sign up for membership&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.foundationbeyondbelief.org/node/18"&gt;nominate charities&lt;/a&gt; we might feature and give money to in the future, apply to &lt;a href="http://www.foundationbeyondbelief.org/node/19"&gt;be a volunteer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.foundationbeyondbelief.org/node/20"&gt;donate to the cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s Executive Director &lt;strong&gt;Dale McGowan&lt;/strong&gt; explaining what FBB is all about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/5xLrfVV76rU%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had the privilege to be on ground zero of two organizations as they formed from scratch.  The first one was the &lt;a href="http://secular.org"&gt;Secular Coalition for America&lt;/a&gt; and you’ve all witnessed the phenomenal rise of that group.  This is the other one.  Just as I was with SCA, I’m *very* excited about the potential this group has.  Finally, there’s an organized way to get Secular Americans to donate to good causes.  It’s a perfect example of how Humanism works in action and how “immoral” atheists can indeed do very ethical things.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check out the site, &lt;a href="http://www.foundationbeyondbelief.org/contact"&gt;leave a comment&lt;/a&gt; if you have one, and &lt;a href="http://www.foundationbeyondbelief.org/user/register"&gt;sign up to become a member&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Since the program I enrolled in is, of course, degree granting and I am 3/4 time,  I assumed this would qualify. I received a letter in the mail today informing me that my request for deferment was denied because I “have graduated with a Bach. degree or higher” and thus do not qualify. It would seem that I now have to find a job rather quickly and withdraw from school because I received incorrect information. I’m still dwelling on my options at this point, but it’s pretty annoying when a company gives you completely incorrect information resulting in a decision which would not have been made with accurate information.&lt;/p&gt;

His observations aboard the HMS &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; led to this seminal work, as Darwin voyaged across the planet observing plants and animals in various environs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In honor of that, why not read Darwin’s &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; diaries… &lt;a href="http://www.thebeaglevoyage.com/"&gt;as a blog?&lt;/a&gt; This is a very clever idea. The entries are posted in blog form, with geocaching and images to help you see what’s what. It’s actually very engaging and wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long said that science is a process as well as a compendium of information. Here is your chance to see it not only as a process, but a very human one, and to see how the observations of science changed the human who made them, and the rest of us as well.&lt;/p&gt;

When I say “eaten,” I don’t actually mean consumed. Several of these things didn’t quite make it past the highly classified lips and mouth test. For instance, that meatball. He had it in his mouth for a few seconds; he made a very unhappy face, and soon the offending object was carefully removed and deposited in a parent’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/cucumber-slice.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/cucumber-slice.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of viZZZual.com (flickr.com)" width="500" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of viZZZual.com (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided it’s high time for Alex to expand his horizons — and I wouldn’t be surprised if he agreed. He’s getting older; he’s getting bigger. Sometimes a couple of hot dogs isn’t quite enough to fill him up. He needs more food. And the answer isn’t just upping the number of hot dogs. Since Alex isn’t the most willing participant in this, we went for the age-old parental technique of bribery and threat. “Eat this, or no cookies!” we say brightly. “Eat this, or no crackers!” And you know what? It works. Kind of. This past summer he ate watermelon willingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to make one dinner each night. One dinner for four people. Not one dinner for three people followed by sauteing hot dogs for the fourth person who is unwilling to eat anything else. In the last few years Alex has eaten spaghetti and rice. He’s eaten Chinese food. At school we hear he eats muffins. So there’s no earthly reason he can’t eat what we are eating when we eat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Last year, I famously got $6,000 in contributions by offering to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2008/11/dance_like_a_monkey.php"&gt;dance like a monkey&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm not sure what would follow that. So,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What should I offer to do if I manage to reach the overall challenge goal of several thousand dollars in total contributions?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm obviously not going to do anything illegal or immoral, but I'm willing to sacrifice a little dignity for a good cause, as you can see at the link above. So, what can I offer to do that would get you to donate money to help school kids through DonorsChoose?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2009/09/donors_choose_2009_what_would.php"&gt;discussion of Chad's big reward&lt;/a&gt; is still ongoing.  (I'm rooting for a recreation of a great dispute in physics with hand puppets.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Chad is not the only one with a DonorsChoose challenge to fund, nor is he the only one willing to put his dignity on the line to help public school students get the resources and experiences they need.  So let's talk about what you'd like &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt; to do.&lt;br&gt;

I think we&amp;#39;d do well to steal the best parts of European culture, and use them to replace the creaky embarrassing bits of ours…and that means religion should go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_do_love_to_see_the_trembling.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ffrZqHFXQxs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254428825923"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/help_out_michigan_classrooms.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e8001fb277dc9be0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Donors Choose"/><title type="html">Help out Michigan classrooms!</title><published>2009-10-01T20:16:53Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T20:16:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/w2zHRRpZGUc/help_out_michigan_classrooms.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/help_out_michigan_classrooms.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I really like this &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=24230"&gt;DonorsChoose&lt;/a&gt; thing.

Woot!&lt;br&gt;
There are going to be some amazing speakers, Pz Meyers, Eugenie Scott, Daniel Denett and Carolyn Porco just to name a &lt;img src="http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/1618/dawkinsandmahersmall.jpg" alt="Dawkins and Maher" width="400" height="400"&gt;few. Do click on the link above for a full list of all the fantastic speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headlining speaker and man of the hour is of course, Richard Dawkins. Many skeptics attending the event are especially interested in an award being presented by AAI in Richards Dawkins’ name. The “Richard Dawkins Award” to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Richard Dawkins Award will be given every year to honor an outstanding atheist whose contributions raise public awareness of the nontheist life stance; who through writings, media, the arts, film, and/or the stage advocates increased scientific knowledge; who through work or by example teaches acceptance of the nontheist philosophy; and whose public posture mirrors the uncompromising nontheist life stance of Dr. Richard Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the award is being presented to Mr. Bill Maher. Yes, Religulous was a funny movie and I enjoyed it but to present an award with the above quoted criteria to a man who doesn’t believe in germ theory, who thinks that all disease is caused by mystery toxins and who says things on twitter like, (sic) “If u get a flu shot ur an idiot.” &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; who doesn’t even claim to be an atheist is a bit odd. I direct your attention to an in-depth summery of the Dawkins and Maher debacle here on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/here_are_those_inconvenient_questions_fo.php#more"&gt;Orac’s Scienceblog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you approve or disapprove of AAI’s decision to award Mr. Maher with the Richard Dawkins Award, one thing is for sure, it’s going to be a very interesting weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Amy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254427352259"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/donorschoose_day_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bcde60b8b95195f0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">DonorsChoose Day 1</title><published>2009-10-01T20:33:35Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T20:33:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/WpWWYsv_a-M/donorschoose_day_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/donorschoose_day_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yay!

Marii Doroty Majewskiej, który miał stanowić odpowiedź na &lt;a href="http://modnebzdury.blogspot.com/2009/02/polskie-towarzystwo-wakcynologiczne.html"&gt;list protestacyjny&lt;/a&gt; Polskiego Towarzystwa Wakcynologii. PTW zarzuciło prof. Majewskiej brak obiektywności i wprowadzanie w błąd pacjentów i rodziców dzieci odnośnie zasadności i bezpieczeństwa szczepień.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;List, który miał być odpowiedzią na te zarzuty - moim zdaniem - jedynie pogrąża jeszcze bardziej panią profesor i udowadnia, że jest ona wysoce niewiarygodnym źródłem informacji na temat szczepień. Sprawa jest o tyle istotna, że z lektury for i portali internetowych, na których rozpowszechniana jest publicystyka prof. Majewskiej można wnioskować, że są osoby (w tym także rodzice), które podejmują decyzje o charakterze medycznym w oparciu o jej poglądy. Fora i portale, na których spotykają się i dyskutują osoby negatywnie nastawione do szczepień traktują artykuły prof. Majewskiej jako bardzo wiarygodne i ostatecznie rozstrzygające kwestię zasadności i bezpieczeństwa szczepień.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dzieje się tak z wielu powodów. Po pierwsze, czego nie można zanegować, prof. Maria Dorota Majewska jest naukowcem, jej tytuły pochodzą z wiarygodnych uczelni i współpracowała z instytucjami, które trudno oskarżać o brak wiarygodności. Dla wielu osób nadaje to jej poglądom szczególnej wagi i sprawia, że jej zdanie może przez niektórych być odbierane jako reprezentujące cały świat nauki i medycyny. Taki pogląd - jak się przekonamy - jest błędny.  Drugim powodem, dla którego jej publicystyka jest tak przekonywująca dla wielu osób to fakt, że jej styl miesza dwa porządki - naukowy i dziennikarski. Ten pierwszy przejawia się m.in. powoływaniem się na prace i autorytety naukowe, odnośnikami do prac naukowych, przypisami, terminologią naukową itd. Wielu ludzi automatycznie postrzega taki tekst jako bardziej wiarygodny i przekonywujący. Magia tytułów naukowych, trudnych do zapamiętania i wymówienia nazw chemicznych i  przypisów odwołujących się do artykułów naukowych robi swoje. Laik będzie pod wrażeniem. "Ona odrobiła swoje lekcje. Wie o czym mówi" - pomyśli. Ta naukowa baza jest jednak tłem do dziennikarskiej nadbudowy. Kiedy mówię o dziennikarskim porządku w publicystyce prof. Majewskiej mam na myśli mieszankę stylu dziennikarstwa śledczego (odkrywanie prawdy, najczęściej skrywanej przed opinią publiczną) i stylu bulwarówki (krzykliwa i kontrowersyjna treść, odwoływanie się do emocji czytelnika, radykalne sądy moralne).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taka narracja pozwala zbudować prof. Majewskiej przekonywującą na pierwszy rzut oka wizję świata, w którym mała grupa dzielnych i niezależnych naukowców oraz rodziców odkrywa ogromny spisek przygotowany przez agencje rządowe, międzynarodowe organizacje pozarządowe, skorumpowanych naukowców i wszechmocny przemysł farmaceutyczny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;W najbliższym czasie postaram się omówić kilka fragmentów listu prof. Majewskiej do PTW. Postaram się wykazać, że jej poglądy na kwestię szczepień są mało wiarygodne i należy podchodzić do jej publicystyki w sposób bardzo ostrożny, szczególnie podejmując decyzje o charakterze medycznym.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Słowa "publicystyka" używam celowo. Należy rozróżnić wypowiedzi prof. Majewskiej, które można znaleźć w mediach i Internecie od jej pracy czysto naukowej. W swojej pracy nad wpływem rtęci na zdrowie na dzień dzisiejszy prof. Majewska opublikowała &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6SYR-4X66S64-2&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=b29a8c84b0d217dc0b58b22ea290fccc"&gt;jeden artykuł&lt;/a&gt; naukowy w oparciu o badania na szczurach. Wiem, że zespół prof. Majewskiej przygotowuje też następny artykuł. Mam nadzieję, że te publikacje zostaną w przyszłości omówione przez osoby, które są posiadają odpowiednie kompetencje.

However, almost nothing seemed to be known about how graduate students in science perceive evolution or how well they understand it.  At least, until a student and I did a study at our own university, which is now out in the journal &lt;a href="http://www.bioone.org/loi/bisi"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;BioScience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a press release on it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Science Students Could Brush Up On Darwin, U of G Study Finds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;October 01, 2009 - News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even students pursuing advanced degrees in science could brush up on their knowledge of evolution, according to a new study by University of Guelph researchers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The finding reveals that there is room for improvement in how evolution is taught from elementary school up, said Ryan Gregory, a professor in Guelph’s Department of Integrative Biology, who conducted the research with former student Cameron Ellis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The study was published today in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aibs.org/bioscience"&gt;BioScience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It’s particularly timely, given that this year is the bicentennial of Charles Darwin’s birth and the 150th anniversary of publication of On the Origin of Species, which underpins understanding of the diversity of Earth’s organisms and their interrelations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Misconceptions about natural selection may still exist, even at the most advanced level,” Gregory said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re looking at a subset of people who have spent at least four years, sometimes even six or seven years, in science and still don’t necessarily have a full working understanding of basic evolutionary principles or scientific terms like ‘theories.’”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many previous studies have assessed how evolution is understood and accepted by elementary, high school and undergraduate students, as well as by teachers and the general public, Gregory said. But this was the first to focus solely on students seeking graduate science degrees. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The study involved nearly 200 graduate students at a mid-sized Canadian university who were studying biological, physical, agricultural or animal sciences. About half of the students had never taken an evolutionary biology course, which is often not a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the vast majority of the students recognized the importance of evolution as a central part of biology. Overall, they also had a better understanding of evolutionary concepts than most people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That was encouraging, especially because it was across several colleges — it wasn’t just the biology students,” Gregory said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But when the students were asked to apply basic evolutionary principles, only 20 to 30 per cent could do so correctly, and many didn’t even try to answer such questions. Of particular interest to Gregory is the finding that many students seem less than clear about the nature of scientific theories.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This is telling us that traditional instruction methods, while leading to some basic understanding of evolution, are not producing a strong working knowledge that can be easily applied to real biological phenomena.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gregory has studied evolution-related topics for years and recently co-organized a workshop designed to improve how the subject is taught in public schools. He is also associate editor of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/120878"&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a journal written for science teachers, students and scientists.  He recently created &lt;a href="http://www.evolverzone.com/"&gt;Evolver Zone&lt;/a&gt;, a free online resource for anyone interested in evolutionary biology.&lt;/p&gt;  He is also helping bring an evolution-inspired art exhibit to U of G this month. “&lt;a href="http://arts.uoguelph.ca/eayd2009"&gt;This View of Life: Evolutionary Art in the Year of Darwin, 2009&lt;/a&gt;” highlights diverse artists’ views of Darwin’s ideas and evolution in general. It runs Oct. 9 to 30 in the science complex atrium.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Overall, the students did well on multiple choice questions, and their acceptance of evolution was very high.  But it seems we could do a better job at providing students with the capability to actually use evolutionary concepts to explain phenomena.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-8376230347694418103?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/vgwh8eLzFK0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254425659176"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-7000550669952229660">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/22ebd9ea4eb683e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Media" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Humans vs. chimps -- neither is an offshoot.</title><published>2009-10-01T16:14:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T17:30:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/3NS36s_8Cu0/humans-vs-chimps-neither-is-offshoot.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=7000550669952229660" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/10/humans-vs-chimps-neither-is-offshoot.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://i.usatoday.net/tech/_photos/2009/10/01/ardix.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:245px;height:313px" src="http://i.usatoday.net/tech/_photos/2009/10/01/ardix.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tomorrow's &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/ardipithecus/"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;will be a special issue reporting tons of new information on the fossil hominid &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus &lt;/i&gt;("Ardi"), which is really exciting (though not as much as &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Darwinius&lt;/span&gt;, which was "&lt;a href="http://www.revealingthelink.com/"&gt;like a meteor hitting the Earth&lt;/a&gt;" or whatever).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8285180.stm"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/oct/01/fossil-ardi-human-race"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of course, including one at &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2009-10-01-human-chimp-fossil_N.htm"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; that I want to comment on briefly:&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The analysis of &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus&lt;/i&gt; (it means "root of the ground ape"), reported in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, changes the notion that humans and chimps, our closest genetic cousins, both trace their lineage to a creature that was more like today's chimp. Rather, the research suggests that their common ancestor was a walking forest forager more cooperative in nature than the competitive, aggressive chimp...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[So far, so good, but then...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...and that &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;chimps were an evolutionary offshoot&lt;/span&gt; of this creature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nope.  Neither humans nor chimps are offshoots of this creature, they are (if the phylogenetic assumption is correct) both descendants of a creature similar to this (but probably not this one &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;per se&lt;/span&gt;).  Otherwise it's like arguing that your cousin is an offshoot of your grandmother and you're not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, one of the authors is quoted as giving a more reasonable interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;So that could mean that while humans didn't diverge much from their evolutionary ancestors, "chimps and gorillas look like really special evolutionary outcomes," says &lt;i&gt;Science &lt;/i&gt;study author Owen Lovejoy of Ohio's Kent State University.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Right.  This would make many of the obvious traits of chimps derived rather than primitive, and many classically human traits primitive rather than derived.  (It doesn't really matter in one sense, because every species is a mixture of primitive and derived traits, but it sure would destroy those evolutionary lineups with chimps at one end and humans at the other).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much to no one's surprise, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/10/01/ardipithecus-we-meet-at-last/"&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; presents a good story on the topic:&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chimpanzees may be our closest living relatives, but that doesn’t mean that our common ancestor with them looked precisely like a chimp. In fact, a lot of what makes a chimpanzee a chimpanzee evolved &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; our two lineages split roughly 7 million years ago. &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; offers strong evidence for the newness of chimps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only after our ancestors branched off from chimpanzees, Lovejoy and his colleagues argue, did chimpanzee arms evolve the right shape for swinging through trees. Chimpanzee arms are also adapted for knuckle-walking, while &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; didn’t have the right anatomy to lean comfortably on their hands. Chimpanzees also have peculiar adaptations in their feet that make them particularly adept in trees. For example, they’re missing a bone found in monkeys and humans, which helps to stiffen our feet. The lack of this bone makes chimpanzee feet even more flexible in trees, but it also makes them worse at walking on the ground. &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; had that same foot bone we have. This pattern suggests that chimpanzees lost the bone after their split with our ancestors, becoming even better at tree-climbing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chimpanzees do still tell us certain things about our ancestry. Our ancestors had chimp-sized brains. They were hairy like chimps and other apes. And like chimps, they didn’t wear jewelry or play the trumpet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then again, humans turn out to be a good stand-in for the ancestors of chimpanzees in some ways–now that&lt;em&gt; Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; has clambered finally into view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;See also:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/1001/1"&gt;ScienceNOW&lt;/a&gt; (and watch the video)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://anthropology.net/2009/10/01/the-4-4-million-year-old-ardipithecus-ramidus/"&gt;Anthropology.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/01/welcome-to-ardi-a-new-member-of-our-family/"&gt;Why Evolution is True&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-7000550669952229660?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/3NS36s_8Cu0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254424686129"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7498">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a473304b289b52dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Soda Name Fun &amp;amp; Brand Loyalty</title><published>2009-10-01T19:00:54Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T19:00:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/ai-soda-name-fun-brand-loyalty/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry to be off topic with today’s AI, but I’ve been busy with some other kick ass projects that you will see here soon (stay tuned), and didn’t have a chance to come up with something smart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a little “Stop and Rob” store near my house where I pop in on occasion to get myself a nice, refreshing fountain drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course the soda is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; item in the store I will buy, because purchasing anything there requires a loan application and a credit check. But I’ll gladly pony up a dollar fifty for a large bucket of brown carbonated sugar water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like fountain drinks. In my book, they’re the best way to simultaneously consume a half pound of sugar and enough caffeine to re-animate Marlon Brando. I don’t favor diet or caffeine-free sodas, so if you ever meet me on the street and my teeth are rotted out and my heart explodes right in front of you, you’ll know it was from the fountain drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But aside from &lt;a href="http://www.7-eleven.com/"&gt;7-Eleven&lt;/a&gt;, the various Grab ‘n Dash stores don’t really market their sodas. They don’t seem to be concerned with giving their fountain drinks cool names. Most of the ones I see are simply named for the quantity of liquid they hold. The cup dispensers are loaded with containers marked 20 oz, 32 oz, 44 oz, and yes, even 64 oz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeez, these aren’t just measuring devices. They’re pick-me-ups. They are identifiers that signify social status as well as thirst level. They are symbolic of our American ideal for over-consumption, as well as of our right to be unhealthy. They are screaming out to be the objects of a brand loyalty war. They should be emblazoned with bold print on the cup, and swirling day-glo colors that can be seen from space, and yet . . . the world is littered with plain white Styrofoam cups with &lt;em&gt;32 oz&lt;/em&gt; written on them in a sterile, block font.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So . . . .&lt;/p&gt;

Porco trailblazed was part of the team that analyzed data from the Voyager spacecraft in the 1980s, making her one of the young up and coming "rock stars" of space science.  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mentored by Carl Sagan, among others, Porco now heads the camera team for the Cassini spacecraft, currently orbiting Saturn (as it has been for the last five years), which recently released some gorgeous new images of the ringed planet. Porco has a colorful background. The daughter of an Italian immigrant who drove a bread truck, she went to the State University of New York at Stony Brook and spent two years as a chanting Buddhist, complete with a pilgrimage to Japan to be a majorette in a Buddhist marching band. She moved on from Buddhism, but not from music: she played guitar and sang with fellow scientists and science writers in the Titan Equatorial Band.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She caught her first glimpse of Saturn at age 13 through a neighbor's rooftop telescope and went on to earn graduate degrees from Caltech, writing her thesis on how the gravitational effects from tiny moonlets helped shape Saturn's rings. She "demonstrated a knack for picking out important things," according to her thesis advisor, Peter Goldreich.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Porco is also actively involved in science communication and outreach, both through the usual channels, and via Hollywood. She was a consultant on the film&lt;i&gt; Contact&lt;/i&gt;, and more recently, for J.J. Abrams' summer blockbuster, &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;. Remember when the Starship Enterprise materialized inside clouds around Titan? That was Porco's contribution, and it made the cover of Cinefex, a publication devoted to special effects in the movies. "She helped us feel connected to what [series creator] Gene Roddenberry had been trying to do. This is our future," Abrams told the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt;. Her favorite movie, though, is Stanley Kubrick's classic, &lt;i&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"To my mind, most people go through live recoiling from its best parts," Porco told The New York Times. "They miss the enrichment that just a basic knowledge of the physical world can bring to the most ordinary experiences. It's like there's a pulsating, hidden world, governed by ancient laws and principles, underlying everything around us -- from the movements of electrical charges to the motions of planets -- and most people are completely unaware of it. To me that's a shame."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-963273660480038836?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

One of the reoccurring issues with these neutralizing antibodies is that the ones identified so far are very specific against the strain which infected that particular individual. Antibodies in general tend to be very, very selective against a particular target, which is desirable for antibody-based medicines, since it reduces the risk for unwanted off-target activity, but not so desirable if you are trying to target something like HIV, where you are dealing with multiple, constantly evolving strains.Also, with most antibodies, once the selectivity goes down, so does the potency.Having said that, what makes this article noteworthy is the fact that now for the first time they succeeded in isolating &amp;quot;broad and potent neutralizing antibodies&amp;quot;. The two antibodies identified showed potency against 127 and 119 different strains of HIV, out of a total of 162 strains they were tested against.So this looks very promising and might open the door for antibody-based treatments for people infected with HIV.To follow-up on the vaccine story, the details of the article show how difficult it is going to be to use this as the basis for an AIDS vaccine:When the team looked into what made these antibodies so potent against such a broad array of HIV strains, they found that the antibodies did not work at all when exposed to isolated proteins from the surface of the HIV virus. They only worked against a trimer that is formed by three proteins on the surface of the HIV virus. This is going to make it hard to use these findings for an AIDS vaccine, since you can&amp;#39;t tell the human body &amp;quot;Go make exactly this antibody&amp;quot;. You can only take something you want the immune system to react to, put it into a vaccine, and let the immune system come up with a way to deal with this. In this case, even if you put the 3 proteins, or pieces of the proteins, into a vaccine, there is no telling exactly against which part of the overall protein surface the immune system is going to produce antibodies against.In the article some initial work was already done to identify exactly where and how the antibodies bind to that trimer, let&amp;#39;s hope that this can be used to synthesize a protein fragment that would trick the immune system into producing the right antibodies.And hope HIV is not going to quickly mutate its way around this, as it has done before.Ref.:Walker LM, Phogat SK, Chan-Hui PY, Wagner D, Phung P, Goss JL, Wrin T, Simek MD, Fling S, Mitcham JL, Lehrman JK, Priddy FH, Olsen OA, Frey SM, Hammond PW, Protocol G Principal Investigators, Miiro G, Serwanga J, Pozniak A, McPhee D, Manigart O, Mwananyanda L, Karita E, Inwoley A, Jaoko W, Dehovitz J, Bekker LG, Pitisuttithum P, Paris R, Allen S, Kaminsky S, Zamb T, Moyle M, Koff WC, Poignard P, &amp;amp; Burton DR (2009).

Humanist? Even (gasp!) atheist? Or are you any one of the thousands of other non-Christian religions peppering the planet? And yet, do you celebrate Christmas every year, reveling during the moment, but feeling shamed and guilty on Boxing Day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then do so no longer. It’s OK to be non-Christian and celebrate Christmas. And for proof, you can read the 42 essays comprising the book  &lt;a href="http://www.atheistbus.org.uk/the-atheists-guide-to-christmas-aka-the-atheist-book-campaign/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atheist’s Guide to Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, edited by Ariane Sherine (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Atheists-Guide-Christmas-Ariane-Sherine/dp/0007322615/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1252064471&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atheists-Guide-Christmas-Ariane-Sherine/dp/0007322615/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1254089648&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Amazon US&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="http://www.arianesherine.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Ariane Sherine&lt;/a&gt;, the one who created the Atheist Bus Campaign in the UK. Ariane is a humor writer and a journalist, and is also a genuinely wonderful human being who is upset by the way nonbelievers are portrayed in the media, and decided to do something about it. The bus campaign was her first organized effort, and this book is the second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She found 45 comedians, scientists, philosophers, story tellers, and artists — all of whom find the stories associated with Christmas to be, well &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt; — and asked them to write a short essay about what the holiday means to them. The result is a collection of funny, warm, and interesting journeys into the mostly secular festivities of the world’s most maligned demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note that one essay in the book — &lt;em&gt;Starry Starry Night&lt;/em&gt; — was written by none other than myself. I was flattered and honored that Ariane would ask me to write for the book, where my musings would sit along side those of Richard Dawkins, Derren Brown, Simon Le Bon (yes, from Duran Duran!), my friend Brian Cox, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us who wrote for the book were paid in any way (well, I got a free copy). All of us who contributed donated all proceeds to the UK HIV charity &lt;a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/"&gt;Terrence Higgins Trust&lt;/a&gt;, a secular group that provides information, advice, and support for HIV positive people in the UK. It’s a very good cause, and one that fits the reason for the season, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of the book is pretty interesting, too, and Ariane has been blogging about how she got this project started; &lt;a href="http://arianesherine.blogspot.com/2009/09/atheist-book-campaign-part-1.html"&gt;Part 1 is here&lt;/a&gt; and the other parts are linked in her sidebar. She is a funny and warm writer, busting a lot of stereotypes about atheists as the spawn of Satan. After all, just look at this picture of these two notorious examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Ariane_Sherine_and_Richard_Dawkins_at_the_Atheist_Bus_Campaign_launch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/ariane_dawkins_bus.jpg" alt="ariane_dawkins_bus" title="ariane_dawkins_bus" width="610" height="394"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t Ariane just radiate evil?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go buy this book. Give a copy for Christmas, or just get one for yourself. You’ll be helping a good cause, and maybe, just maybe, you’ll find out that Christmas really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

A little while ago, Mark &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1737"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that reporting the differences by means of generic plurals ("Asians have a more collectivist mentality than Europeans do") promotes misunderstanding and proposed that such generic language be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comments, Mark noted that changing the language of popular science reporting is not by itself going to fix an inclination to essentialist thinking (which is all over the place), though it might be a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark looked at groups X and Y with respect to property P, focussing on statistical differences between X and Y. Let's say that members of X tend to have P to a greater degree than members of Y. Then there's a statistical association (perhaps a very weak one) between X and P. And most people have as much trouble understanding statistical association as they do statistical differences. Here, the characteristic error in reasoning is treating the association as invariant: all Xs have P (and no non-Xs do). Again, the error is all over the place, often showing up in objections to claims of statistical association. As in the following case from a September 30 &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; story "Dementia Risk Seen in Players In N.F.L. Study" by Alan Schwarz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The story begins with a report of an apparent statistical association:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study commissioned by the National Football League reports that Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease or similar memory-related diseases appear to have been diagnosed in the league&amp;#39;s former players vastly more often than in the national population — including a rate of 19 times the normal rate for men ages 30 through 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the study has a variety of shortcomings, and the association can't be taken as demonstrated. but for the moment let's take things at face value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What especially interests me in the story (though I have a long-standing interest in dementia and related conditions) is the reaction of NFL spokesman Greg Aiello, who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;said in an e-mail message that the study did not diagnose dementia, that it was subject to shortcomings of telephone surveys and that "there are thousands of retired players who do not have memory problems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Memory disorders affect many people who never played football or other sports," Mr. Aiello said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiello's response addresses (and rejects) claims not made in the report: that all retired players have memory problems (all Xs have P), and that no other people have memory problems (no non-Xs have P). That is, Aiello chose to treat the association as invariant, when that was clearly not what the report said. I don't see how the reporter could have averted this misunderstanding by more careful wording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such misunderstandings — occasioning objections much like Aiello&amp;#39;s — arise even when claims are not couched as statistical associations. Quantified statements like &amp;quot;many Xs have P&amp;quot; will do, eliciting objections like &amp;quot;but I&amp;#39;m an X and don&amp;#39;t have P&amp;quot;. People reason like this all the time, and that&amp;#39;s why there are Critical Thinking courses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254416747920"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=5500">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7293779414ef4998</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Welcome to Ardi, a new member of our family!</title><published>2009-10-01T16:14:38Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T16:14:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/01/welcome-to-ardi-a-new-member-of-our-family/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Matthew Cobb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a big day for the evolution of our species! &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/current/"&gt;Tomorrow’s issue of Science&lt;/a&gt; contains 11 – yes eleven – papers describing the fossil skeleton of &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="border-collapse:collapse;background-repeat:no-repeat;margin:0;padding:0"&gt; a hominid from 4.4 million years ago – the oldest such fossil ever found. As I write, the articles aren’t on line yet (and will probably require a subscription to read them completely), but &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8285180.stm"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/oct/01/fossil-ardi-human-race"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; both have substantial pieces on the discovery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="_46476758_ardi-composite" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/46476758_ardi-composite.jpg?w=466&amp;amp;h=300" alt="_46476758_ardi-composite" width="466" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="border-collapse:collapse"&gt;Briefly, a partial skeleton has been found of one female, together with bits and bobs of another 30 or so individuals,in Ethiopia. “Ardi”, as the female has been called, was about the same size and weight as a modern chimpanzee, but looked very different – many components (such as its hand) are more primitive than that of a chimpanzee,. This shows that the modern chimp hand is not the ancestral condition, but rather a highly evolved form.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="border-collapse:collapse"&gt;&lt;span style="border-collapse:separate"&gt;Amazingly, the fossils were first found in the early 1990s, and it has taken 17 years to fully investigate them. It appears that Ardi could climb, but also &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;walked on her knuckles &lt;/span&gt;[EDIT: no, she didn&amp;#39;t - she was BIPEDAL; mea culpa, and thanks to posters for pointing this out] walked on both legs; she ate fruit, plants and small mammals. Neither the males nor females had large canines – like us, but not like chimps. This suggests that strong male-male competition, which occurs in chimps, did not occur in our common ancestor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="border-collapse:collapse"&gt;However, despite the hype that will inevitably surround this amazing discovery (surely much more justified than the hoo-haa over Ida, the 47my old primate fossil), Ardi was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that common ancestor. Unfortunately, The Guardian calls her “our long lost mother”, but it is not yet clear exactly where she fits into our family tree. She may be an ancestor of Australopithecus – the species to which “Lucy” belonged. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian has &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/video/2009/oct/01/fossil-ardi-human-ancestors-discovery"&gt;this video snippet&lt;/a&gt; describing the discovery (upcoming from the Science website, I think) and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/audio/2009/oct/01/fossil-ardi-common-ancestor?popup=true"&gt;this 10 minute MP3  file &lt;/a&gt;in which Tim White describes the link between Ardipthecus and the link with our last common ancestor with chimpanzees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here’s a question – how will the creationists get out of this one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Science have just announced that all the papers, plus their magazine articles, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/ardipithecus/"&gt;will be available free here&lt;/a&gt;, later on today.&lt;/p&gt;

Gosh I love this town, its &lt;a href="http://www.regulatorbookshop.com/"&gt;bookstore&lt;/a&gt;, newspapers (&lt;a href="http://www.heraldsun.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Making+science+prominent%20&amp;amp;id=3717428-Making+science+prominent&amp;amp;instance=homesixthleft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A398273"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who came out and participated in a terrific discussion about science, education, the Internet, politics, and literacy in America. I left re-energized to finish the final edits on my next book and even managed to turn in the manuscript on time today.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re reliant on tithes/donations, private school tuition fees, and a stable worshiper base.  All of those areas are getting hit hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090928/ap_on_bi_ge/us_rel_meltdown_religion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rachel Zoll&lt;/strong&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Organized religion was already in trouble before the fall of 2008. Denominations were stagnating or shrinking, and congregations across faith groups were fretting about their finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great Recession made things worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s further drained the financial resources of many congregations, seminaries and religious day schools. Some congregations have disappeared and schools have been closed. In areas hit hardest by the recession, worshippers have moved away to find jobs, leaving those who remain to minister to communities struggling with rising home foreclosures, unemployment and uncertainty.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the churches want to survive in this climate, they’ll have to adapt and change their old ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t help matters that Americans are &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/23/the-unhelpful-data-found-in-american-nones-profile-of-the-no-religion-population/"&gt;trending away from organized religion&lt;/a&gt;.  Bad for them, anyway.  Good for the rest of us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can non-theists capitalize on this?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way is to provide former-churchgoers with a community for them to join — one that offers friendship, a safe place for discussion, and honesty about the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For so many people, the church is just a means to an end.  They go there because they can’t find that tight-knit community anywhere else, and if religion comes along for the ride, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tremendous opportunity for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I present to you: &lt;strong&gt;Skeptic North &lt;a href="http://www.skepticnorth.com/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skepticnorth.com/"&gt; http://www.skepticnorth.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only imagine great things to come from this blog. I mean, there’s a whole list of awesome people contributing, for crying out loud. The list includes some (but not all, so if I didn’t include you, I’m sorry! The love is there, promise):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Thoms: ( of Some Canadian Skeptic)&lt;br&gt;
Scott Gavura (of Science-Based Pharmacy)&lt;br&gt;
Kimbo Jones  (of Skeptigirl)&lt;br&gt;
Desiree Schell (of Skeptically Speaking)&lt;br&gt;
Jonathan Abrams (of Ottawa Skeptics)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the kick-off to the website, so why don’t you click the link, take a gander and show them some love? Because as wonderful as Canada is, we sorely need a more involved skeptical community. And this website is going to make that happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets my seal of approval!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human condition is relative from human to human and culture to culture. But there are scientific truths outside and independent of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought my meaning was clear. What might be moral in one culture may not be in another, and in many cases that’s OK. Cultures are different. But in the objective reality of the Universe, such relativism may fall apart. Physical laws have an objective reality; we may interpret them, but they continue to do what they do whether our interpretation is correct or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to a discussion of the meaning of things, and that I think is the important issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A follower on Twitter &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Citizen_Gkar/status/3251554036"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gravity may well exist. But if we can’t describe it, it’s hardly objective. And we can’t possible know it’s [sic] meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is completely wrong. It’s objective whether we can describe it or not. &lt;strong&gt;Gravity exists&lt;/strong&gt;. Since the Earth has been orbiting the Sun for 4.55 billion years —  a good 4.549 billion years before humans were around — we can be pretty sure gravity is objective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s the last word he used that got me really scratching my head. &amp;quot;Meaning?&amp;quot; Of gravity? Why should gravity have a &lt;em&gt;meaning?&lt;/em&gt; It’s a law of nature, not a piece of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look for meaning in the Mona Lisa, or a sonnet, or in a child’s smile. You can argue over the meaning with someone else, and you can both disagree and yet both be right. When something is created with artistic intent — or just simply created by the human with or without that intent — it’s open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Universe itself as a physical object isn’t like that. You can look for meaning if you’d like, but the Universe is a semi-random collection of energy and matter, and based on all the evidence I have seen was not created with intent. A nebula is beautiful in form and color, but is simply a collection of particles, photons, fields, and motions. It has no &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; outside of your personal interpretation of it. But whether you think it has emotions and is alive or not, it will still do what it does: make stars. Nebulae have been doing this for billions of years before us, and will continue to do so long after we are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might even ascribe purpose to a nebula: its job is to create stars. But that’s what’s called the Pathetic Fallacy: ascribing human characteristics to inanimate objects. The nebula doesn’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do anything. It just does things according to the laws of physics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to use the same reductionist reasoning on humans too, and say we are nothing more than machines and have no free will, no choice but to obey whatever laws of physics command us. And I cannot discount that, but I suspect we are richer than that. The laws of physics are not binary; they don’t say to us &amp;quot;Behave this way or that.&amp;quot; There are huge, perhaps even uncountable numbers of choices that lie before us. It’s not just a matter of cranking all our atomic states and field equations through a black box and determining what we must perforce do; there are probabilities involved, so that our actions may be predictable in a sense but are not fundamentally determined in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the difference between us and a nebula. We can choose. And that’s why a post-modernist relativism can work when describing Mozart, but will fail when applied to a black hole. The event horizon of a black hole cares not what we think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, saying that the Universe is meaningless doesn’t imply there’s no reason to live. What I am saying is that there is no direction to the Universe, no intent, no internal morals or purpose or meaning. But we still exist. People look for meaning in everything, even when it isn’t there, and it can lead them astray. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2005/03/18/halo-how-ya-doin/"&gt;Don’t ask what a halo around the Sun means&lt;/a&gt;, using it as a sign or an omen or a symbol. Look at it, enjoy it, gasp at its beauty and the wonder that such a thing exists. Know that the Universe obeys a set of laws, and that those laws are knowable without meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, don’t ask what I think the meaning or purpose of life is. I think it has neither, but that makes it no less magnificent or joyous to me. I know what I want &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; life to be like, and I have enough real questions to keep me busy for a thousand lifetimes.

Apparently everything we’ve done in our entire careers is a “&lt;a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100011716/how-the-global-warming-industry-is-based-on-one-massive-lie/" rel="nofollow"&gt;MASSIVE lie&lt;/a&gt;” (sic) because all of radiative physics, climate history, the instrumental record, modeling and satellite observations turn out to be based on 12 trees in an obscure part of Siberia. Who knew?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, according to both the &lt;a href="http://planetgore.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Y2Q5ZGExZTc3ZTlmMTA5OTdhOGRjNzdlNmU4N2M4ZTg=" rel="nofollow"&gt;National Review&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100011716/how-the-global-warming-industry-is-based-on-one-massive-lie/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;  (and who would not trust these sources?), even Al Gore’s use of the stair lift in An Inconvenient Truth was done to highlight cherry-picked tree rings, instead of what everyone thought was the rise in CO2 concentrations in the last 200 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.czerniec.com/2007/04/27/an-inconvenient-truth.jpg" alt="Al Gore apparently confusing a CO2 curve for a tree"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who should we believe? Al Gore with his “facts” and “peer reviewed science” or the practioners of “&lt;a href="http://denialdepot.blogspot.com/"&gt;Blog Science&lt;/a&gt;“? Surely, the choice is clear….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pubs/hantemirov2002/riverbank-sm.jpg" align="right" alt="Yamal sub-fossil larch trees in river sediment" width="45%"&gt;More seriously, many of you will have noticed yet more blogarrhea about tree rings this week. The target de jour is a particular compilation of trees (called a chronology in dendro-climatology) that was first put together by two Russians, &lt;a href="http://hol.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/12/6/717"&gt;Hantemirov and Shiyatov&lt;/a&gt;, in the late 1990s (and published in 2002). This multi-millennial chronology from Yamal (in northwestern Siberia) was painstakingly collected from hundreds of sub-fossil trees buried in sediment in the river deltas. They used a subset of the 224 trees they found to be long enough and sensitive enough (based on the interannual variability) supplemented by 17 living tree cores to create a “Yamal” climate record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preliminary set of this data had also been used by &lt;a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/people/briffa/qsr1999/"&gt;Keith Briffa in 2000&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://post.queensu.ca/~biol527/Briffa%20and%20Keith%202000.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) (processed using a different algorithm than used by H&amp;amp;S for consistency with two other northern high latitude series), to create another “Yamal” record that was designed to improve the representation of long-term climate variability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since long climate records with annual resolution are few and far between, it is unsurprising that they get used in climate reconstructions. Different reconstructions have used different methods and have made different selections of source data depending on what was being attempted. The best studies tend to test the robustness of their conclusions by dropping various subsets of data or by excluding whole classes of data (such as tree-rings) in order to see what difference they make so you won’t generally find that too much rides on any one proxy record (despite what you might read elsewhere). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So along comes &lt;a href="http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=7168" rel="nofollow"&gt;Steve McIntyre&lt;/a&gt;, self-styled slayer of hockey sticks, who declares without any evidence whatsoever that Briffa didn’t just reprocess the data from the Russians, but instead supposedly picked through it to give him the signal he wanted. These allegations have been made without &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; evidence whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McIntyre has based his ‘critique’ on a test conducted by randomly adding in one set of data from another location in Yamal that he found on the internet.  People have &lt;a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/pubs/thesis/2004-melvin/"&gt;written theses&lt;/a&gt; about how to construct tree ring chronologies in order to avoid end-member effects and preserve as much of the climate signal as possible. Curiously no-one has ever suggested simply grabbing one set of data, deleting the trees you have a political objection to and replacing them with another set that you found lying around on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/people/briffa/yamal2000/"&gt;statement from Keith Briffa&lt;/a&gt; clearly describes the background to these studies and categorically refutes McIntyre’s accusations. Does that mean that the existing Yamal chronology is sacrosanct? Not at all – all of the these proxy records are subject to revision with the addition of new (relevant) data and whether the records change significantly as a function of that isn’t going to be clear until it’s done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is clear however, is that there is a very predictable pattern to the  reaction to these blog posts that has been discussed &lt;a href="http://n3xus6.blogspot.com/2007/08/truth-shall-set-you-free.html"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2007/08/global_warming_totally_disprov.php"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;. As we said &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/08/1934-and-all-that/"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; there was such a kerfuffle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, there is clearly a latent and deeply felt wish in some sectors for the whole problem of global warming to be reduced to a statistical quirk or a mistake. This led to some truly death-defying leaping to conclusions when this issue hit the blogosphere.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus ça change…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timeline for these mini-blogstorms is always similar.  An unverified accusation of malfeasance is made based on nothing, and it is instantly ‘telegraphed’ across the denial-o-sphere while being embellished along the way to apply to anything ‘hockey-stick’ shaped and any and all scientists, even those not even tangentially related. The usual suspects become hysterical with glee that finally the ‘hoax’ has been revealed and congratulations are handed out all round. After a while it is clear that no scientific edifice has collapsed and the search goes on for the ‘real’ problem which is no doubt just waiting to be found. Every so often the story pops up again because some columnist or blogger doesn’t want to, or care to, do their homework. Net effect on lay people? Confusion. Net effect on science? Zip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, it does appear that McIntyre did not directly instigate any of the ludicrous extrapolations of his supposed findings highlighted above, though he clearly set the ball rolling. No doubt he has written to the National Review and the Telegraph and Anthony Watts to clarify their mistakes and we’re confident that  the corrections will appear any day now…. Oh yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But can it be true that all Hockey Sticks are made in Siberia? A RealClimate exclusive investigation follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with the original MBH hockey stick as replicated by &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/07/the-missing-piece-at-the-wegman-hearing/"&gt;Wahl and Ammann&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/WA_RC_Figure1.jpg" width="60%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm… neither of the Yamal chronologies anywhere in there. And what about the hockey stick that &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/03/worldwide-glacier-retreat/"&gt;Oerlemans derived from glacier retreat since 1600&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/oerlemans.jpg" width="60%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, no Yamal record in there either. How about &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/02/a-new-take-on-an-old-millennium/"&gt;Osborn and Briffa’s results&lt;/a&gt; which were robust even when you removed any three of the records?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/OB06.jpg" alt="Osborn and Briffa (2006) Supplemental Material" title="OB06" width="60%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or there. The hockey stick from &lt;a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwarming/pollack.html"&gt;borehole temperature reconstructions&lt;/a&gt; perhaps? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwarming/images/smpollackrecon.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. How about the hockey stick of CO2 concentrations from ice cores and direct measurements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cses.washington.edu/cig/figures/ipccar4co2.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Err… not even close. What about the the impact on the &lt;a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pubs/kaufman2009/"&gt;Kaufman et al 2009&lt;/a&gt; Arctic reconstruction when you take out Yamal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/kaufman_noyamal.jpg" width="95%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. The hockey stick you get when you &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/09/progress-in-millennial-reconstructions/"&gt;don’t use tree-rings&lt;/a&gt; at all (blue curve)? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/M08.jpg" alt="M08" title="M08" width="60%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Well what about the hockey stick blade from the instrumental record itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/had.jpg" width="60%/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, no. But wait, maybe there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something (Update: &lt;a href="http://rankexploits.com/musings/2009/baby-name-ometery/"&gt;Original idea by Lucia&lt;/a&gt;)…. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/name.jpg" width="60%/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nah…. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that some things go without saying, but apparently people still get a key issue wrong so let us be extremely clear. Science is made up of people challenging assumptions and other peoples’ results with the overall desire of getting closer to the ‘truth’. There is nothing wrong with people putting together new chronologies of tree rings or testing the robustness of previous results to updated data or new methodologies. Or even thinking about &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/01/what-if-the-hockey-stick-were-wrong/"&gt;what would happen if it was all wrong&lt;/a&gt;. What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; objectionable is the conflation of technical criticism with unsupported, unjustified and unverified accusations of scientific misconduct. Steve McIntyre keeps insisting that he should be treated like a professional. But how professional is it to continue to slander scientists with vague insinuations and spin made-up tales of perfidy out of the whole cloth instead of submitting his work for peer-review? He continues to take absolutely no responsibility for the ridiculous fantasies and exaggerations that his supporters broadcast, apparently being happy to bask in their acclaim rather than correct any of the misrepresentations he has engendered. If he wants to make a change, he has a clear choice; to continue to play Don Quixote for the peanut gallery or to produce something constructive that is actually worthy of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer-review is nothing sinister and not part of some global conspiracy, but instead it is the process by which people are forced to match their rhetoric to their actual results. You can’t generally get away with imprecise suggestions that something might matter for the bigger picture without actually showing that it does. It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter whether something ‘matters’, otherwise you might as well be correcting spelling mistakes for all the impact it will have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go on Steve, surprise us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update: Briffa and colleagues have now responded with an extensive (and in our view, rather convincing) &lt;a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/people/briffa/yamal2009/"&gt;rebuttal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>group</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254408013531"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/?p=1902">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bd7842822c0e7a9e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><category term="The Tangled Bank"/><title type="html">Ardipithecus: We Meet At Last</title><published>2009-10-01T14:30:26Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T14:30:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/10/01/ardipithecus-we-meet-at-last/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="ardi recon440" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/09/ardi-recon440.jpg" alt="ardi recon440" width="283" height="493"&gt;Meet &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This introduction has been a long time coming. Some 4.4 million years ago, a hominid now known as &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus&lt;/em&gt; lived in what were then forests in Ethiopia. Fifteen years ago,&lt;a href="http://ib.berkeley.edu/research/interests/research_profile.php?person=245"&gt; Tim White&lt;/a&gt; of Berkeley and a team of Ethiopian and American scientists published&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/371306a0"&gt; the first account&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt;, which they had just discovered. But it was just a preliminary report, and White promised more details later, once he and his colleagues had carefully prepared and analyzed all the fossils they had unearthed. “Later,” it turned out, meant 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned before how unfashionable &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/22/aids-and-the-virtues-of-slow-cooked-science/"&gt;this slow-cooked style of science&lt;/a&gt; can be. But sometimes, it’s the only way to do things right. Getting clues about HIV by observing sick chimpanzees in the wild takes years.  And so does reconstructing a fossil–particularly one as delicate as &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; happened to be. Today, the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/ardipithecus"&gt;handed many of its pages&lt;/a&gt; over to White and his colleagues, who have filled them with lots of details about &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt;, plus a couple excellent articles by writer Ann Gibbons. &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus &lt;/em&gt;has gone from being an enigmatic collection of bones to a new touchstone for our early hominid ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To appreciate the importance of this new look of &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt;, you have to step back into the history of hunting for hominid fossils. In the early 1970s, Tim White was part of a research team that found what was, at the time, the oldest hominid known: a 3.2 million year old fossil of &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/em&gt;. What made their discovery particularly spectacular was that they found a fair amount of a single &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt; individual, whom they named Lucy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with other&lt;em&gt; A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt; fossils, paleonthropologists got a pretty decent picture of what hominids looked like. Lucy was a chimpanzee-sized ape with a brain that was only a little bigger than a chimp’s. She still had long arms and curving hands and other traits hinting that she could still climb in trees. But she also had feet with stiff, forward-facing toes, an adaptation for walking on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So things stood for about 20 years. But then, with the discovery of &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; and a few other hominid fossils, the record of our ancestry got pushed back millions of years. The oldest fossil that’s been identified as a hominid, &lt;em&gt;Sahelanthropus tschadensis&lt;/em&gt;, dates back between 6 and 7 million years old. But scientists have only found pieces of the &lt;em&gt;Sahelanthropus&lt;/em&gt; skull. Another species, &lt;em&gt;Orrorin tugenensis&lt;/em&gt;, is 6 million years old; it’s represented by little more than a leg bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have learned a lot from these pre-Lucy hominid fossils, but before now they weren’t able to make very detailed reconstructions of these creatures. Only about halfway along the journey from the first hominids to us did hominids come into full-bodied focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="ardi cover220" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/09/ardi-cover220.jpg" alt="ardi cover220" width="220" height="280"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus&lt;/em&gt; was yet another scrappy pre-Lucy fossil. The first report offered details about part of a 4.4 million-year-old jaw bone–a remarkable jaw bone, but just a jaw bone nonetheless. Soon after, White’s team found more fossil bones, from the hominid’s hand, skull, pelvis, feet, and on and on–110 pieces all told. But finding these pieces was just the start of the team’s labors. They picked away at the bits of rocks surrounding the fragile bits of fossils. They used a computer to manipulate CT-scans of the fossils to figure out how crushed fragments had originally fit together as a skull or a pelvis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this happened in strict secrecy. Some of us science writers knew a little about what the scientists were up to, but we could only guess when they’d finally finish working on the fossil. Sometimes when I’d speak to White, I’d inquire, and he’d politely say he wasn’t done yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the papers out today in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, you can see that they’ve been very busy. I won’t even try to offer an all-encompassing account of their new results. In many cases, it wouldn’t actually be worth the effort, because these papers are just the first salvo in what will be a fascinating debate about how our ancestors evolved. I was speaking to University of Wisconsin paleoanthropologist &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog"&gt;John Hawks &lt;/a&gt;yesterday on another subject, and he was giddy about the papers’ imminent publication. “Tomorrow’s Christmas!” he said. (His young son overheard him on the phone and got very excited and confused. I had to give Hawks a few minutes  to explain the nature of metaphor. Not sure how well that went over.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I’ll point out a few of the results on &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; that are particularly intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice Guys With Little Teeth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you reading this post that have a Y chromosome have canine teeth that are about the same size as those of my XX readers. The same rule applies to the teeth of some other primate species. But in still other species, the males have much bigger canines than the females. The difference corresponds fairly well to the kind of social lives these primates have. Big canines are a sign of intense competition between males. Canine teeth in some primate species get honed into sharp daggers that males can use as weapons in battles for territory and for the opportunity to mate with females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men have stubby canines, which many scientists take as a sign that the competition between males became less intense in our hominid lineage. That was likely due to a shift in family life. Male chimpanzees compete with each other to mate with females, but they don’t help with the kids when they’re born. Humans form long-term bonds, with fathers helping mothers by, for example, getting more food for the kids to eat. There’s still male-male competition in our lineage, but it’s a lot less intense than in other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White and his colleagues  found so many teeth of different &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; individuals that they could compare male and female canines with some confidence. The male teeth turn out to be surprisingly blunted. This result suggests that hominids shifted away from a typical ape social structure early in our ancestry. If this was a result of males forming long-term bonds with females and helping raise young, this shift was able to occur while hominids were still living a very ape-like life. Ardipithecus existed about 2 million years before the oldest evidence of stone tools, suggesting that technology was not the trigger for the evolution of nice hominid guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Walking, Of A Sort; And Climbing, Of A Sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dept.kent.edu/anthropology/lovejoy.html"&gt;C. Owen Lovejoy&lt;/a&gt; of Kent State University spearheaded the studies on how &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; moved. He and his colleagues argue that its pelvis could support its upper body during bipedal walking. It wasn’t a fabulous walker, and was probably a terrible runner. Nevertheless, it had some of the same anchors for muscles that we have on our pelvis, and which chimpanzees and other apes lack. Its pelvis was, in other words, a mosaic. Lucy, we now can see, represents a later step in the journey towards out own walking-adapted anatomy.&lt;img title="ardipithecus side view440" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/09/ardipithecus-side-view440.jpg" alt="ardipithecus side view440" width="440" height="778"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt;’s feet were mosaics too. The four little toes were adapted for walking on the ground. Yet the big toe was still opposable, much like our thumbs. This sort of big toe helped &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; move through the trees much more adeptly than Lucy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ardipithecus could not climb through trees as well as, say, chimpanzees. Chimpanzees have lots of adaptations in their arms and shoulders to let them hang from branches and climb vertically up trees with incredible speed. &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; had hands were not stiffened enough to let them move like chimpanzees. &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; probably moved carefully through the trees, using its hands and feet all at once to grip branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just a Reminder: We Didn’t Evolve From Chimpanzees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimpanzees may be our closest living relatives, but that doesn’t mean that our common ancestor with them looked precisely like a chimp. In fact, a lot of what makes a chimpanzee a chimpanzee evolved &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; our two lineages split roughly 7 million years ago. &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; offers strong evidence for the newness of chimps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after our ancestors branched off from chimpanzees, Lovejoy and his colleagues argue, did chimpanzee arms evolve the right shape for swinging through trees. Chimpanzee arms are also adapted for knuckle-walking, while &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; didn’t have the right anatomy to lean comfortably on their hands. Chimpanzees also have peculiar adaptations in their feet that make them particularly adept in trees. For example, they’re missing a bone found in monkeys and humans, which helps to stiffen our feet. The lack of this bone makes chimpanzee feet even more flexible in trees, but it also makes them worse at walking on the ground. &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; had that same foot bone we have. This pattern suggests that chimpanzees lost the bone after their split with our ancestors, becoming even better at tree-climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimpanzees do still tell us certain things about our ancestry. Our ancestors had chimp-sized brains. They were hairy like chimps and other apes. And like chimps, they didn’t wear jewelry or play the trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, humans turn out to be a good stand-in for the ancestors of chimpanzees in some ways–now that&lt;em&gt; Ardipithecus&lt;/em&gt; has clambered finally into view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's always bittersweet to return to sites you've dug. I guess I'm particularly susceptible to this nostalgia since I tend to feel it very shortly after moving on from anything or any place. And since I usually only dig during the sunny season I remember my old excavations as summer country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days ago I checked in with the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/11/skamby_boat_grave_paper_publis.php"&gt;boat inhumation cemetery at Skamby&lt;/a&gt; in Kuddby parish, Östergötland. Me &amp;amp; Howard Williams and his students dug there in 2005. The turf and flora have regenerated nicely over our trench and a flock of broad-snouted sheep now grazes on the cemetery hill. They seem to like lazing in the boat-shaped grassy hollow we reconstructed in the grave. When someone re-excavates it they&amp;#39;ll find neat drystone walls to the boat depression. They weren&amp;#39;t there originally, but team member Bryn Morris (a PhD student and big gamer) had grown up on a Welsh farm and knew how to build field walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was kind of an important day for the Skamby dig. I drove to the museum stores in Tumba and handed over the finds (except the gaming pieces, which are &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/05/skamby_gaming_pieces_on_displa.php"&gt;on display&lt;/a&gt; in Linköping) to the Museum of National Antiquities. Finally I'm rid of those &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2005/12/burnt-daub-and-ghost-of-wattle.html"&gt;18.1 kg of burnt daub&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of my Sciblings have &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html?category=111" title=""&gt;already set up their challenges&lt;/a&gt; and a few more will add theirs soon, I know. There will be a healthy competition with some other blogging networks, of course ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find my challenges at &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=24271&amp;amp;category=111" title=""&gt;Classroom Science Around The Clock&lt;/a&gt;, look at the projects - all coming from 'High Poverty' schools in North Carolina - and donate whatever you can. If many people pitch in a little bit each, these projects will get funded and kids will get supplies they need to learn science and math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widget, below, will be on my left sidebar throughout the month of October, so take a look there every time you visit my blog, see how the challenges are doing, and add a little where needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, many of my SciBlings explain this better than I do, so check their intro posts out: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/donorschoose_2009_social_media.php" title=""&gt;Janet&lt;/a&gt; (and more &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/donorschoose_2009_social_media_1.php" title=""&gt;Janet&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2009/10/donors_choose_2009_help_kids_w.php" title=""&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencewoman/2009/10/announcing_sciencewomens_donor.php" title=""&gt;Sciencewomen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/10/donorschoose_2009.php" title=""&gt;Razib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/10/science-up_the_schools_with_do.php" title=""&gt;DrugMonkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/an_open_letter_19.php" title=""&gt;Dr.Isis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2009/10/october_is_donorschoose_month.php" title=""&gt;Grrlscientist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/donors_choose.php" title=""&gt;Pal MD&lt;/a&gt; and a geobloggers collective, comprised of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/eruptions/2009/10/october_is_donors_choose_month.php" title=""&gt;Erik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/stressrelated/2009/09/geobloggers_take_on_donorschoo.php" title=""&gt;Kim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/highlyallochthonous/" title=""&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/donorschoose_-_classroom_scien.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/AGlkmFP624I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254407448838"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/todays_carnivals_434.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0e9def21cb3a20dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-10-01T13:55:22Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T13:55:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/K0g73jv3IuY/todays_carnivals_434.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/todays_carnivals_434.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Change of Shift: Vol. 4, Number 7 is up on &lt;a href="http://www.emergiblog.com/2009/09/change-of-shift-vol-4-number-7.html" title=""&gt;Emergiblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/todays_carnivals_434.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/K0g73jv3IuY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254406845911"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=18945">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/67baec8bc07cadb9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">The Road Well-Traveled</title><published>2009-10-01T13:40:34Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T13:40:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/the-road-well-traveled/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">It's a well-documented truth that long commutes are bad for both the environment and emotional well-being of the commuter.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;My only comment here is not on the Bayesian inference but rather on the idea that "managers" are dweeby Dilbert characters who talk using management jargon. I was thinking about it, and I realized that I'm a manager. I manage projects, hire people, etc. But of course I don't usually think of myself as a "manager" since that's considered a bad thing to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For another example, Liberman considers a "spokesperson for a manufacturer of sex toys" as a manager. I don't know what this person does, but I wouldn't usually think of a spokesperson as a manager at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LL posts in question were "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1768"&gt;Moving low-hanging fruit forward at the end of the day&lt;/a&gt;", 9/26/2009;  "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1769"&gt;Memetic dynamics of summative cliches&lt;/a&gt;", 9/26/2009; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1771"&gt;'At the end of the day' not management-speak&lt;/a&gt;", 9/26/2009; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1775"&gt;Another nail in the ATEOTD=manager coffin&lt;/a&gt;", 9/28/2009; and "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1778"&gt;Memetic dynamics of low-hanging fruit&lt;/a&gt;", 9/30/2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Andrew's comment is very much to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1768"&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; on Scott Adams&amp;#39; strip, I used scare quotes in referring to &amp;quot;a despised minority, in this case &amp;#39;managers&amp;#39;&amp;quot;; and in a later post, I referred to &amp;quot;the hypothesis that it&amp;#39;s especially likely to be used by &amp;#39;managers&amp;#39;, however we define that much-maligned class&amp;quot;.  Those phrases were meant as a note to myself to come back to this curious phenomenon of anti-managerial prejudice — but Andrew beat me to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should start with a confession: like Andrew, I&amp;#39;m a manager. I&amp;#39;ve been one at least since 1980 or so, when I became a group supervisor at Bell Labs; and when I became a department head there, in 1987,  it was no longer possible to look the other way.   At my first &amp;quot;three-level meeting&amp;quot; — involving department heads and their bosses and their bosses&amp;#39; bosses — &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan"&gt;Brian Kernighan&lt;/a&gt; looked across the conference table to me and said "Welcome to the land of the brain-dead". The fact that I left industry for academia didn't save me: the organizations that I now (at least nominally) manage employ several times as many people as the Linguistics Research Department at Bell Labs did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that as long as there have been hierarchies, bosses have sometimes been feared, resented, and disliked.  But I think it's a new phenomenon that in large areas of modern culture, managers are stereotypically regarded as stupid.  Andrew Gelman's employees surely don't think that he's stupid, and I hope that most of mine don't think I'm stupid either. But Brian's little joke reflected a now-widely-shared concern that the role of manager, like the role of parent, inevitably causes a sort of tragic cluelessness, in which you become the object of all of your own earlier upward-facing attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mixed up with a different idea, namely that official pronouncements are likely to be bland and even empty. This might mean that the people who craft them are actually especially crafty, but  the idea that corporate statements tend toward vacuity seems to  reinforce the idea that leaders are empty-headed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[It&amp;#39;s for that reason that I was disposed to accept corporate spokespersons as &amp;quot;managers&amp;quot; in the Dilbertian sense — well, that and the fact that otherwise there would otherwise have been no examples at all in the 400-million-word COCA database of &amp;quot;managers&amp;quot; using the cliche under study.  And the sex-toy company spokesperson whose &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1775"&gt;quote I accepted&lt;/a&gt; as a possible example of manager-speak actually was a &amp;quot;senior buyer&amp;quot; — check out the original article &lt;a href="http://www.emagazine.com/view/?4348"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However we decide to define "manager", this group is certainly now the object of a complex of negative stereotypes. When and how did this start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know, and I welcome suggestions.  These attitudes may be connected to the antique European aristocratic disdain for those who are "in trade", and to the (I think related) modern intellectual disdain for the world of business.  These attitudes seem to have been imported from the intelligentsia into  industry through the medium of engineers and especially programmers, who (at least at lower levels) maintain a very different culture from the "suits" in finance, marketing, product planning, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;manager&lt;/em&gt; has been around for a long time, with something close to its current meaning. With the gloss "A person who organizes, directs, or plots something; a person who regulates or deploys resources", the OED gives citations from around 1600 onwards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1598&lt;/strong&gt; J. FLORIO &lt;em&gt;Worlde of Wordes&lt;/em&gt;, A manager, a handler. &lt;strong&gt;1598&lt;/strong&gt; SHAKESPEARE &lt;em&gt;Loves Labours Lost&lt;/em&gt; I. ii. 173 Adue Valoure, rust Rapier, be still Drum, for your manager is in loue. &lt;strong&gt;1600&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midsummer Night's Dream&lt;/em&gt; V. i. 35 Where is our vsuall manager Of mirth? What Reuels are in hand?&lt;/span&gt; SHAKESPEARE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the slightly more specific sense of  "A person who manages (a department of) a business, organization, institution, etc.; a person with an executive or supervisory function within an organization, etc.", the citations start about a century later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1682&lt;/strong&gt; A. WOOD &lt;em&gt;Life &lt;/em&gt;22 Nov., The Duke of York hath gained the point as to the penny post against Docuray the manager of it. &lt;strong&gt;1705&lt;/strong&gt; J. ADDISON &lt;em&gt;Remarks&lt;/em&gt; Italy 443 The Manager opens his Sluce every Night, and distributes the Water into what Quarters of the Town he pleases. &lt;strong&gt;1740&lt;/strong&gt; S. RICHARDSON &lt;em&gt;Pamela &lt;/em&gt;II. 341 Said he, I think that little Kentish Purchase wants a Manager. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of the early citations in the OED, nor the quotes that I find in LION, seem to reflect the modern Dilbertian managerial stereotype.  That stereotype clearly predates Dilbert — but when did it arise? and where did it come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, we have to return to Andrew&amp;#39;s question: What is a manager, anyhow?  By now, I suppose that the Dilbert empire employs a certain number of people, whom Scott Adams in some sense manages — does he thereby consider himself a &amp;quot;manager&amp;quot; in the relevant sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fuzzy referential boundaries of the managerial stereotype, it seems to me, are a characteristic of social stereotypes in general. This is related to the "some of my best friends are Xs" excuse, and all the other excuses that shift the range of the prejudice away from apparent counterexamples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.medgadget.com/archives/img/nobel-medicine.jpg" alt=""&gt;Next Monday, the Nobel Foundation will announce the winner(s) of this year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In the following two days, two more Nobels will be revealed: in Physics and in Chemistry.  Because of the success of last year’s inaugural Guess-A-Nobel Contest, we decided we’ll repeat this event annually until there is no more science worthy of the prize.  This year we’re giving out three &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/"&gt;8GB Apple iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; devices to those who correctly guess in each of the three science categories.  Because we profile a good deal of apps for the iPhone/Touch platform, we thought this might be a useful tool beside all the fun it can provide on the off time.  Furthermore, if someone does manage to guess all three correctly, he or she will be getting the souped-up 64 GB version of the iPod device with all the trimmings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.medgadget.com/archives/img/bbabbbab.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="319"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here are the rules of the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Anyone can enter by writing a comment to this post. Please make sure you leave your email address  in the form so we can get in touch with you.  Your entry will be invalid without a proper email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Identify either  &lt;strong&gt;the scientist(s) or discoveries&lt;/strong&gt; in Medicine, and/or Physics and/or Chemistry, for your chance to win an iPod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. If we have multiple people who guessed correctly, the winner in each category will be chosen randomly. The lucky person who guesses all three will automatically win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. If a winner lives outside the US, Canada, or EU, instead of sending the prize, we’ll transfer an equivalent amount of ca$h via a PayPal account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Deadline for entries is Midnight Pacific Standard Time on Saturday Oct. 3, 2009 AD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck to all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The endgame is in sight. At the end of this post is a list of questions for Bill Maher tomorrow (if the opportunity presents itself), the vast majority of which you, my readers, thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's backtrack a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I learned that an award named after Richard Dawkins was being given to someone who was so radically, unbelievably unworthy of such an honor, that I likened giving the Richard Dawkins Award to Bill Maher to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_gets_the_richard_dawkins_awar.php"&gt;giving a public health award to Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. (In deference to Professor Dawkins, perhaps I'll now liken it to giving such an award to MMR anti-vaccine crank Andrew Wakefield.) The reason I became so incensed was because of the criteria for the Richard Dawkins Award, which were described thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Richard Dawkins Award will be given every year to honor an outstanding atheist whose contributions raise public awareness of the nontheist life stance; who through writings, media, the arts, film, and/or the stage advocates increased scientific knowledge; who through work or by example teaches acceptance of the nontheist philosophy; and whose public posture mirrors the uncompromising nontheist life stance of Dr. Richard Dawkins.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said at the time, my first reaction was: WTF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, it's only one criteria out of three, but Maher violates it by not just a little. In fact, he flagrantly, joyously violates it--nay, shreds it!--with science-free conspiracy mongering rants against the flu vaccine, big pharma, and a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/billmaher/status/4403617471"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago (screenshot above) saying, "If u get a swine flu shot ur an idiot." (Which got &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/dougbremner/status/4496503500"&gt;re-Tweeted&lt;/a&gt; by Doug Bremner, by the way. Moron.)  After my initial post, I was gratified to discover there were in fact a lot of people who agreed with me or mostly agreed with me. On the other hand, I was very disappointed that there were &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_and_anti-science.php"&gt;defenders of Maher among people who &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; know better&lt;/a&gt;. Or so I thought. One thing I did know, and that was that, even though I had stirred the pot a bit, the pot &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; needed more stirring. So I took my inspiration from P.Z. Myers, who suggested &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/put_maher_in_the_hot_seat.php"&gt;putting Maher in the hot seat&lt;/a&gt; thusly:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/here_are_those_inconvenient_questions_fo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/here_are_those_inconvenient_questions_fo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/ZTlypmvgfCE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254405726011"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/donorschoose_2009_social_media_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f25562ca2b9e5900</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogospheric science"/><title type="html">DonorsChoose 2009 Social Media Challenge: Did I mention fabulous prizes?</title><published>2009-10-01T13:13:56Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T13:13:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/eogtnia6iBs/donorschoose_2009_social_media_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/donorschoose_2009_social_media_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/donorschoose_2009_social_media.php"&gt;already know&lt;/a&gt; that we're working with &lt;a href="http://donorschoose.org/"&gt;DonorsChoose&lt;/a&gt; to raise some money for public school teachers who are trying to give their students the engaging educational experiences they deserve (and who, owing to dismal state and local budgets, need our help more than ever). You also know that our benevolent overlords at &lt;a href="http://www.seedmediagroup.com/"&gt;Seed&lt;/a&gt; will be randomly selecting some donors to receive nifty prizes (details about this to be posted as soon as I get them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, helping public school teachers deliver the education their students deserve is it's own reward, but that doesn't mean you might not want a little something to recognize your donation.  So, as I did &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2008/10/fabulous_prizes_for_your_donat.php"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, I'm going sweeten the deal by offering some incentive to &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; who donates to &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=23315&amp;amp;category=111"&gt;my challenge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because money seems to be tight for almost everyone, I've knocked down the level of some of the donations needed to get particular thank-you swag, and I've added a "crafty" new incentive this time around.

I've just been getting an unusually large volume of mail lately, and it's about evenly split: half are saying "Yay, I'm going to read your blog every day!" and the other half are "You're going to burn in hell!" It seems appropriate, then, to at least acknowledge this flood by posting one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nate is trying to pull a Ray Comfort on me. There's a reason why people call Comfort "Raytard", so he really isn't the right person to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Paul,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The ten commandments:&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;1.     No other God&amp;#39;s…. even yourself.&lt;br&gt;
2.     No idols… none!&lt;br&gt;
3.     Take God&amp;#39;s name in vain…. Never.&lt;br&gt;
4.     Keep the Sabbath day… every week!&lt;br&gt;
5.     Honor you father/mother…?&lt;br&gt;
6.     You shall not murder… Jesus said to hate your brother is to murder…. Ever hate anyone?&lt;br&gt;
7.     You shall not commit adultery… Jesus said to lust after a woman is the same… Lust?&lt;br&gt;
8.     No stealing… ever stole anything.. even minor?&lt;br&gt;
9.     Bear false witness?&lt;br&gt;
10.  No coveting… ever!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;How did you do?  If you are like everyone else you probably failed to keep 8-10 of these.  Not a good sign for anyone that believes in God.  I guess for now the easier thing to do would be to put him out of our lives.  Of course in the end we will have to face the music no matter what we believe… or maybe Jesus faced the music for those who do believe.  He can change your life as he has many.  God is calling you.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;How did you do with the ten commandments?&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;With love,&lt;br&gt;
 
Nate Stead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa. Slapped down with the Ten Commandments. No one has ever tried to do that to me before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only do I have no &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; gods, I have no gods, period. I ace this one and deserve extra credit. Score: 1½.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idols, are you kidding me? Of course not. No idols, no fetishes, no funny costumes or hats, no rituals, no hymns, no saints. I'm &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; free of that nonsense. Score: 2½.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no god, so no name to take in vain. And what does that mean, anyway? When I say, &amp;quot;Jesus was a deluded kook whose suffering does not excuse anyone&amp;#39;s sins&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m not taking his name in vain at all. Score: 3½.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Keeping the sabbath&amp;quot; is another nonsensical idea. Sure, I keep it; it&amp;#39;s a day on the calendar, it&amp;#39;s awfully hard to lose. But if you mean I have to be like those crazy fundamentalist Jews who don&amp;#39;t even flip a light switch on Sunday, no. I hope this guy isn&amp;#39;t serious about wanting to establish that kind of principle for everyone. I&amp;#39;m gonna give this one to myself. &amp;quot;Keeping&amp;quot; a day is so vaguely defined and even Christianist kooks differ in what it means. Score: 4½.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course I honor Mom and Dad. I love &amp;#39;em to pieces. Easy. Score: 5½.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have never murdered anyone. Never even killed anyone. And the commandments specifically say &amp;quot;murder&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;hate&amp;quot;, so I reject your redefinition. Score: 6½.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likewise, I&amp;#39;ve never committed adultery. And once again, you don&amp;#39;t get to redefine the commandment to mean, &amp;quot;Think Raquel Welch looked hot in that wetsuit&amp;quot;. Score: 7½.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, I haven&amp;#39;t stolen anything, either. I make a reasonable wage, have relatively few material requirements, and haven&amp;#39;t needed to steal. I know, this wanker is probably going to redefine stealing to mean &amp;quot;Watched Indiana Jones snatch away a jeweled idol in a movie and thought it was cool&amp;quot; to mean I broke both #2 and #8, but I reject that fatuous word game, too. Score: 8½.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, I don&amp;#39;t lie, either. It&amp;#39;s so much easier to tell the truth. Oh, there were probably a few negligible childish fibs once upon a time, but I&amp;#39;ve never harmed people with a lie, or tried to use a lie to get away with something. Score: 9½.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uh-oh, caught me. Yes, I covet stuff all the time. I walk into bookstores and lust after so much stuff; I've got a long Amazon wish list, and I like my computer gadgets. So? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I score 9½ out of 10, and most Christians, by Nate&amp;#39;s admission, score 0-2. That has to sting; here he&amp;#39;s dreaming of someday watching the heathen burn in torment from a ringside seat in heaven, but I do better at following the commandments than he does!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, I know Ray Comfort's schtick, so I know what comes next. God has given us these 'laws' that are virtually impossible to keep, so everyone breaks them at some time, but it's OK, because if you accept Jesus in your heart, it gives you license to break all these laws, and &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; get into heaven. If you're a Christian, you can lie, steal, commit adultery, and even murder, and still get divine approval. And if you follow every single one of the ten commandments, but don't love Jesus, you still get sent to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what good are these commandments? The people who think the source is credible also get carte blanche to break them, and the only people who are expected to stick to them are the ones who reject the Bible…and they are damned anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Nate, I suggest you take your ten commandments and stuff them up your nether orifice. Sideways. No lube. And look! There's no commandment against it!&lt;/p&gt;

In total, I took something like 20 flights, mostly to speak for skeptic groups around the country. (Hello Boston, Syracuse, Houston, Atlanta, New Hampshire and Phoenix!) I stare at things during that uncomfortable time when I'm separated from life-giving electronics (such as this Mac), and a thought occurred to me... this plane is woo-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are any number of strange (to me) objects on a plane, and over time I've learned to identify a few of them. There's a tiny vertical strip of metal on the wing that's used for safety lines so maintenance workers don't fall off. The fins at the tips of the wings are there to reduce drag and thus increase fuel efficiency. And yes, the arm rests on the aisle-side of the seats go up if you can find the latch-a handy trick for getting out of your seat without putting the tray up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;But I don't see anything that I could find in a New Age shop. No crystals, amulets, sigils, or red string. Heck, we didn't even start with a prayer service.</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254403024173"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9604">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/39659289988c067f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 10.1</title><published>2009-10-01T13:15:42Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T13:15:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/skepchick-quickies-10-1/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

When the creationists are campaigning to impose their ideology on science education, for example, they will garner my blogging attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the hottest media science topics today is the swine flu/H1N1 pandemic and upcoming vaccine, and the anti-vaccine movement in general. This is a perfect storm of quackery, sensationalism, misinformation, and public concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of the anti-vaccine movement is that those who are proponents for an unscientific medical modality are keen to criticize science-based medicine because they are their competitors (ideological and/or financial). The same is true generally of pseudoscience – in order to promote your pseudoscientific claims you have to simultaneously attack the real scientists who are likely to point out that your claims are bunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/homeopathy/"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; and vaccines. Homeopathy, as &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=556"&gt;I have written many times before&lt;/a&gt;, is about as close to pure pseudoscience as you get. They have their own pre-scientific magical notions of health and illness which are incompatible with modern knowledge of biology and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.a-r-h.org/NewsandEvents/21%2009%2009%20Swine%20Flu%20Vaccine.pdf"&gt;recent press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance of Registered Homeopaths simultaneously claim that the H1N1 vaccine is dangerous and not effective, while homeopathic treatments are proven effective. This, of course, is the opposite of the truth. They are essentially saying – don’t use that science-based treatment which doesn’t work, use our absurd snake oil instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release is not completely devoid of media savvy, which means they know when to be coy. They write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst the seriousness of contracting swine flu seems to be limited, the potential adverse reactions of this new, and hastily tested vaccination, cannot be fully known at this stage. This leads to the important question; are adverse reactions to the vaccination likely to be worse than the potential dangers of the illness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art of implication – how to say that the vaccine is not safe without directly claiming it’s not safe. They then go on to – anecdotes – saying that reports have raised concerns, again without having to be tied down to any specific factual claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim that the seriousness of H1N1 is limited is more uncertain than that safety of the vaccine. So far the overall virulence of this flu strain is no worse than the seasonal flu – but &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/keyfacts.htm"&gt;the seasonal flu &lt;/a&gt;puts 200,000 people in the hospital and kills 36,000 people in the US every year. Also, while the regular seasonal flu tends to kill the old and the sick, H1N1 kills young and healthy individuals as well as pregnant women. There is probably a genetic susceptibility in about 1% of the populations that get a particularly deadly version of the flu from this H1N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is the possibility, like with the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, that as this flu strain sweeps around the world it will mutate into a more virulent strain. So it could get worse – we just won’t know until it happens, which is why we have to be prepared before it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trashing the flu vaccine the press release goes on to make these astounding claims, quoting Steve Scrutton, Director of ARH:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Homeopaths have been successfully treating people suffering from influenza for over two centuries. The remedies homeopaths frequently prescribe to treat influenza, such as Gelsemium, Bryonia Alba and Eupatorium Perfoliatum, are both highly effective and entirely safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No references were given for these claims. So I did a PubMed search on Gelsemium and Influenza, yielding zero results. I then searched Gelsemium alone which yielded 61 results, none of which were studies of homeopathic Gelsemium and flu or any infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryonia Alba alone yielded 93 results, no studies of the substance in treating flu or viral illness. I did find a double-blind controlled trial of the ability of &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11934908?ordinalpos=21&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;dowsing homeopaths to tell homeopathic Bryonia &lt;/a&gt;from placebo – dead negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eupatorium Perfoliatum resulted in 11 results. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17015193?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;One was an unblinded study&lt;/a&gt; of malaria in mice. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7195723?ordinalpos=9&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; was an unblinded comparison with aspirin for symptomatic treatment of the common cold. The study found no difference, which they interepreted as meaning that both treatments are equally effective. But this study could also mean that the two are equally ineffective, or that the study was not powerful enough or adequately designed to detect an effect or difference (there was no control group to calibrate the study). There were no studies of Eupatorium Perfoliatum and flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then did a search on homeopathy and influenza, which yielded 24 results. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19588329?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;The first hit &lt;/a&gt;was a Cochrane review of homeopathic Oscillococcinum, which concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current evidence does not support a preventative effect of Oscillococcinum-like homeopathic medicines in influenza and influenza-like syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting that Oscillococcinum was not mentioned in the press release, but is a common homeoapthic prescription for flu. It is also silliness squared, because it is a homeopathic prepration of a nonexistent delusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11503856?ordinalpos=13&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;another review of homeopathic remedies&lt;/a&gt; in general and flu, which concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis stressing the poor methodological quality of trials of homeopathic preparations in influenza concludes that there is no proven preventive or curative effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did not find are any studies to support the claims being made in this press release, which probably explains the absence of references to such evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of any actual scientific evidence that homeopathy works for anything, let alone specifically influenza, or even that homeopathic “remedies” are anything but water, the ARH resorts to crappy evidence, namely completely unreliable historical data. They write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Homeopathy’s success at treating the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918 is well documented, especially in the USA. The medical records of hospitals across the country consistently show a mortality rate of above 28% in sufferers treated conventionally, as opposed to a mortality rate of just over 1% of those treated with homeopathy”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse than anecdotal evidence? Century old anecdotal evidence. All we know is that homeopaths reported lower mortality rates. This is worthless data. We have no idea how these patients were actually treated, if they also received standard medical care, how sick they were, were they comparable to those not treated with homeopathy, etc. This is a  mess of uncontrolled variables – worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these historical claims of homeopaths were anywhere close to the truth, then it should be a trivial matter to document with a modern randomized placebo controlled trial. And yet they have no evidence to back up these astounding claims. The bigger the therapeutic effect of a treatment, the easier it is to demonstrate in a clinical trial. Where is the evidence? It doesn’t exist because homeopathy is a dangerous fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also – if homeopathic treatment for the flu were as effective as homeopaths claim then it would be their duty to study it in such a way that they would convince the scientific community and thereby bring their effective treatment to the masses. They have not done this – either way they are guilty of malfeasance. There is simply no excuse for promoting a treatment for a century without ever bothering to research it in an accepted and compelling way to find out if it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeopaths are dangerous quacks. They promote treatments which not only cannot possibly work based upon the laws of physics and chemistry, the clinical data shows that they in fact do not work. But in order to promote their snake oil they are telling the public that the H1N1 flu is not that bad (which is false) and they are fearmongering about the upcoming vaccine, which is safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The degree to which the public actually listens to the absurd claims of homeopaths is directly proportional to a resulting increase in suffering and death from treatable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254397181644"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16652">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/70dbe1aa80344b2f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Alabama Atheist Group Advertises with Chalk… Only to See It Get Erased</title><published>2009-10-01T11:00:59Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T11:00:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/01/alabama-atheist-group-advertises-with-chalk-only-to-see-it-get-erased/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the University of Alabama this past weekend, the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2234029305"&gt;Alabama Atheists and Agnostics&lt;/a&gt; group decided to &lt;a href="http://www.cw.ua.edu/alabama-atheists-and-agnostics-chalking-erased-1.1932344"&gt;advertise their upcoming meeting by chalking the campus&lt;/a&gt; (the link goes to an article in the campus paper… but the page is freezing up my browser.  You’ve been warned).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They inscribed the following messages around the school along with info about their next meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“You don’t need God to be Good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re not alone if you don’t believe in God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those who believe in absurdities commit atrocities”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, they offended someone because the reaction was swift and harsh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“While we were chalking somebody dumped water on what we were chalking, somebody spat at us,” [group vice-president Peter] Sloan said. “But really, overall, most people were polite.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a span of six hours, all the chalkings had been “erased and scrubbed clean.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who was the culprit?  At the moment, it’s unknown, but an eyewitness says the erasers “did not believe in the organization.”  (Which makes no sense to me.  I mean, the group really does exist…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I did not think that this would be the reaction,” Sloan said. “This is uncivil, undemocratic and does not speak well to those who did it. They feel like they have to silence dissenting ideas instead of being involved in active debate.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in college, a member of my campus group told me that, as he was putting up flyers advertising an atheist speaker on our campus, someone else was ripping them down a few seconds later.  She was basically stalking my atheist friend so she could “undo” his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, some students taped paper along the main hallway for a Humanities project.  Each paper had a word on it — GAY, QUEER, LESBIAN, HOMOSEXUAL, etc.  During passing periods, someone in the group would stand at a distance and record how many of those signs were ripped down in the span of a few minutes.  Whatever the number was, it was too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the vandalism that’s so scary, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Peter says, what’s sad about this story is that there are people who are afraid of hearing from someone who disagrees with them, who might challenge their beliefs, who might get the audience to think critically and rationally about religion.  Instead of hearing that person out and responding in a civilized way, the culprits try to prevent &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; from hearing the dissenting opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same mindset that thinks it’s ok to ban books from public schools and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College is precisely the time when you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be hearing differing opinions from what you’re used to.  Be challenged.  It’d be great if the students who are ripping these signs or erasing the chalkings came to the advertised meeting and asked good, tough questions to the speaker.  That’s what most atheists do when a Creationist or Intelligent Design proponent comes to give a talk on campus.  We relish the debate and we know we have the facts on our side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess when you know you’re on the losing end of the debate, you’d rather no one witness it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

Full disclosure: the final essay in the book is my husband’s, so I’m rather biased. Other contributors include Derren Brown, Simon Singh, Josie Long, Ben Goldacre, Richard Dawkins, Robin Ince, Phil Plait, and Brian Cox, so Sid’s in very good company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Photo-28.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Guide To Xmas" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Photo-28-300x225.jpg" alt="Guide To Xmas" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The essays are alternately touching and hilarious, and together they serve a very useful purpose: to offer a rational response to the new annual tradition of TV talking heads screeching about a nonexistent war on Christmas. The angry, Christmas-hating atheist is, at this point, an absurd characterture created by a ratings-hungry media, similar to the man-hunting shark and the ever-lurking pedophile. It’s a relief to have a book that publicizes the views of the many nonbelievers who are perfectly happy to celebrate Christmas as a time for love, family, goodwill, and rampant consumerism, and who don’t burst into tears at the mention of Jesus or virgin births or whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is now available at &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007322615"&gt;Amazon.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;. Americans &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0007322615"&gt;can go here&lt;/a&gt; and request an email when the book becomes available in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

And, it’s true: Trust me, I know. But that thick skin is not necessarily needed to fend off promoters of pseudoscience; just as often, you need it for public attacks launched by those who purport to be your allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently someone with a skeptical blog wrote an article criticizing me for two different things (both of which were wrong, incidentally; obviously this person didn’t care to check). I didn’t know the person, and browsed around on the blog for a few minutes. It was a generally skeptical blog, but all too often, it seemed the blogger was less interested in attacking the charlatans than in stroking their own ego by going after just about every prominent skeptic: “I’m smart because Novella, Randi, Shermer, Plait, Nickell, Klass, Radford, Dunning, (the list goes on), are wrong.”&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liken the drivers of the critical thinking movement to paddlers in a giant canoe. Some are more influential and paddle hard, others less so. But we’re all paddling. Every little bit helps. We’re paddling because what we’re doing is important and we believe in it. I welcome everyone who comes aboard to help, no matter the size of their paddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s frustrating for me when I see people who represent themselves as paddlers, but really all they’re doing is disparaging those who actually do paddle. Oh, occasionally they may stick their paddle into the water and steer or give a little push or two, but every time they stop to lambaste the contributors, they’re dead weight; and when they shout to other boats what horrible paddlers their shipmates are, they are actively counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our fellow Skeptologists here on SkepticBlog is renowned for his Libertarian politics, and frequently criticized for mixing that into his science communication. Similarly, another is renowned for his Democratic politics, and frequently criticized for mixing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; science communication. What their critics fail to recognize is that even though one is paddling on the left side of the boat, and the other is paddling on the right side of the boat, &lt;em&gt;both are paddling like hell&lt;/em&gt; and have done far more to advance public awareness of science and critical thinking than their critics. They are close allies and work together frequently. Take note that they do not derail their own cause by turning their attentions inward and infighting with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying we shouldn’t be open to internal criticism of the way we do what we do. We have to be, and we are. But unless you’re trying to communicate to the world that skepticism is falling apart, you don’t trumpet your criticism to the world in your blog, you pick up the phone and make your suggestions appropriately. I had a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; problem with something that happened at The Amazing Meeting 7. I didn’t podcast or blog to the world that TAM is all fucked up; I communicated my concerns in private to the appropriate person. Guess what, my concerns were welcomed, and I also discovered that I didn’t know the whole story. How about that for a shocker? And the world still knows what I want them to know: That I think TAM is an incredibly positive event. We’re still paddling in step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite every skeptical blogger, podcaster, or communicator to stop and consider what it is they’re trying to accomplish. Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have no better targets to go after than your best allies? If you feel that I or anyone else have done something counterproductive to science education, you’ll probably find that we welcome your comments if you present them appropriately. If you’re just out there trying to shout “Look how smart I am”, well, we don’t have time for you; but we’ll make time if you want to pick up a paddle and climb on board.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Dunning</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254385420474"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-1462966369042300920">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/26c572f6ffda81d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Metablog" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Meatspace" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Religion" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Action" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Don't Say I Never Learn</title><published>2009-10-01T05:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T05:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/10/dont-say-i-never-learn.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">During the Blog Against Theocracy event on 2007, I wrote the post "&lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2007/04/theocracy-writ-small.html"&gt;Theocracy Writ Small&lt;/a&gt;," wherein I related an experience with small, local, well-intentioned religious discrimination on September 11, 2001. In the post, I said&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When it's being quietly and benevolently violated in a moment of emotional turmoil, when you know you'll be the lone voice of dissent with two dozen eyes shooting daggers at you as you violate the sancitity of their understandable rage and anguish, when you risk the greatest offense by placing the sanctity of the individual over the sanctity of collective mourning, that is when you must stand up and say something. That moment, right then...Perhaps more importantly, however, it is moments like that that define a person, that test his or her convictions, that show how much one truly values what one says he values.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last time I failed. Next time I'll be ready to do what's necessary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I had a chance to make good on that promise yesterday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my "Indians of North America" class, we had a guest lecture from two members of the Cherokee Nation. It was generally pleasant and informative, but the elder of the two, toward the end of the hour, asked to say a few words (he had been silent through the rest of the period). He began by speaking about how prayer, such as it is, worked and works in the Cherokee Nation, and said that he was going to recite for us the Lord's Prayer in Cherokee. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an academic exercise, I thought it would be quite interesting. He, however, made it something more: he asked the class to bow their heads and have a moment of silence for our troops overseas while he prayed the Lord's Prayer in Cherokee. My initial reaction, as per usual, was non-confrontational; if I just bowed my head like he asked, there would be no risk of any problems at all. I began to lower my head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I thought "Wait a minute. I wrote an entire post where I defended one's right to offend the collective in the name of freedom from religion. Like hell I'm going to bow my head." At that point, remembering what I had said, and realizing that I had &lt;i&gt;meant&lt;/i&gt; what I said, it wasn't even a question anymore. I stared straight at him the whole time. Not because I want American troops to die, and not because I wanted to be spiteful, but because I'll be damned if I'll kowtow to someone else's beliefs simply to make them comfortable. In the battle between "Them making me uncomfortable" and "Me making them uncomfortable," I have chosen a side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only reason, really, that the decision was so simple, was because of this lame-ass blog right here. I tend to be self-deprecating about my online habits and the internet in general; as useful as it is, it's mostly a godawful vanity machine for self-obsessed douches. But if I hadn't collected some of my stray thoughts about 9/11 into written form, yesterday would have gone differently. And if I didn't write a lame-ass blog and display my own self-obsessed douchiness, I wouldn't have put those thoughts into words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's kind of a weird form of personally trans formative public introspection. If only all of my posts could prove that useful in the long run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, incidentally, I'm hesitant to push "publish," because this post feels so much like a "Pat me on the back cause I'm so awesome" post, when that's not the intent. Oh, well. Vanity, away!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-1462966369042300920?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254382793662"><id gr:original-id="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/?p=587">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8230efc9b66b7b8f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Jesus"/><category term="God."/><category term="Penn Jillette"/><category term="fuck"/><category term="Christ"/><category term="blasphemy"/><title type="html">Jesus Fucking Christ, it’s Blasphemy Day!</title><published>2009-10-01T07:30:42Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T07:30:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/jesus-fucking-christ-its-blasphemy-day/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today is Blasphemy Day! (Alright…it’s blasphemy day &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; day in my household. )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Blasphemy-Day-International/143655943748"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="blasphemy" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/blasphemy.jpg?w=315&amp;amp;h=220" alt="blasphemy" width="315" height="220"&gt;International Blasphemy Day&lt;/a&gt; is a loose day of observance, and an informal campaign to promote free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delightful &lt;strong&gt;Penn Jillette&lt;/strong&gt; covers the history of Blasphemy Day in the &lt;em&gt;Penn Says&lt;/em&gt; episode &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrDq9tHPTFE"&gt;Happy Blasphemy Day&lt;/a&gt; and offers an example of blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The date, September 30, was chosen to commemorate the incident whereby a set of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy"&gt;Danish cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; stirred a violent outcry throughout Islamic communities on an international level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so that was more of a semiotic gesture, like burning a flag or a cross, or Andres Serrano’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piss_Christ"&gt;Piss Christ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A linguistic example of blasphemy is a profane utterance that invokes a sacred religion theme &lt;em&gt;and is construed as offensive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blasphemous language comes in many forms. Examples are often interjections that invoke deity names or religious figures such as &lt;em&gt;God!&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Jesus!&lt;/em&gt; These can be euphemistic, such as &lt;em&gt;crumbs!&lt;/em&gt; (for &lt;em&gt;Christ!&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;golly!&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;geez!&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;jeez! &lt;/em&gt;for &lt;em&gt;Jesus!&lt;/em&gt;). As exclamations, they function like &lt;em&gt;shit!&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ouch!&lt;/em&gt; and can express a range of emotions from frustration to surprise to sympathy. Some blasphemous phrases contain expletives, such as &lt;em&gt;Jesus Fucking Christ&lt;/em&gt;, or may become expletives themselves, such as adjectival &lt;em&gt;bloody&lt;/em&gt; (a reference to the crucifixion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are examples of blasphemy that ‘sound’ contemporary, such as those cited above, and there are examples that sound comically archaic, such as the oaths&lt;em&gt; zounds!&lt;/em&gt; (a contraction of &lt;em&gt;God’s wounds&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;Marry&lt;/em&gt; (a corruption of Jesus’ very virginal mother &lt;em&gt;Mary&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;By Jesu&lt;/em&gt; (a clipping of &lt;em&gt;Jesus&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when did religion-based terms become taboo? Well, the Bible sanctions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, and when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.&lt;/em&gt; (Leviticus 24:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early modern Europe this ‘law’ was enforced. Sadly, up until the end of the seventeenth century, blasphemy was punishable by burning in some parts of Britain. In other parts of the country at this time, blasphemy was merely outlawed, especially in theatre, and like the modern equivalent of the ‘donating a coin to the swear jar’ offending actors would be fined for any transgressions. Queen Elizabeth I reputedly loved to mutter the oath &lt;em&gt;God’s Wounds&lt;/em&gt;, but it was around this time that euphemisms began emerging for blasphemous terms, &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;they were offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But does God give a fuck if you take His name into vain anymore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all taboos, prohibitions are about people and perspectives. What is offensive to some societies, is an offense in others. What will land you in jail in one era, won’t be noticed in another. In Australia and England in the recent past, &lt;em&gt;bloody&lt;/em&gt; has raised a bloody &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s46379.htm"&gt;outcry&lt;/a&gt; as to whether the word is acceptable in formal domains, such as parliament. In these situations, it’s probably more a matter of the speaker’s aggression as determined by the use of the word, rather than &lt;em&gt;bloody&lt;/em&gt; offending religious sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise,&lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0429/1224245599892.html"&gt; Ireland&lt;/a&gt; is currently subject to an anti-blasphemy law, but it appears to be more based in defamation than deities, and their definition is wavering and open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious censorship significantly weakened during the twentieth century. In its place, racial/ethnic-based epithets have tabooed in English since desegregation in the States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, language referring to sex and bodily effluivia have stood their ground as taboo themes. &lt;em&gt;Cunt&lt;/em&gt; is more offensive than &lt;em&gt;Christ&lt;/em&gt; to many speakers of English, just ask my Mum (if you like the taste of soap)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I accompanied my father to a church fete. In the 150-year old church the doorways were low, and my 6’4″ father knocked his head painfully on the doorway. I’ll never forget the horrified look on the faces of the priest and the church ladies when my father bellowed “Jesus fucking Christ! Oh fuck!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Jesus Fucking Christ&lt;/em&gt; that makes the phrase offensive to many speakers of English…&lt;/p&gt;

People fret about whether our children &lt;s&gt;is&lt;/s&gt; are learning what they should about science, math, and critical reasoning.  Netizens speculate on the destination of the handbasket in which we seem to be riding.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the big problems that seem insurmountable, we should welcome the opportunity to do something small that can have an immediate impact.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the month of October, a bunch of us &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/"&gt;ScienceBlogs&lt;/a&gt; bloggers will be participating in the annual &lt;a href="http://donorschoose.org/"&gt;DonorsChoose&lt;/a&gt; "philanthropic throwdown for public schools", which this year they're calling the &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/social-media-challenge-2009"&gt;2009 Social Media Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.newstimes.com/ci_13441505"&gt;“Psychic” arrested for lying&lt;/a&gt; – Self-proclaimed “psychic” &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Janet Lee claimed she was attacked by a herd of wild psychics. No, I’m serious:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the self-proclaimed “foremost psychic in New England” was arrested by Greenwich police over the weekend after detectives said she lied about being attacked in town by rival psychics over the summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the lesson here is that having the ability to see the future would manage to keep you out of danger by always keeping you one step ahead of your enemies. But magical powers in the world can prevent imaginary attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_B-CKCNJUt8w/SJQ3k0nc17I/AAAAAAAAAdE/kdfkNOvLck4/s400/sexy-hot-cheerleader.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_B-CKCNJUt8w/SJQ3k0nc17I/AAAAAAAAAdE/kdfkNOvLck4/s400/sexy-hot-cheerleader.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="271"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2009/sep/29/cheerleaders-religious-signs-draw-fire/"&gt;Cheerleaders banned from promoting religion to audiences&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community members are rallying around Lakeview-Fort Oglethorpe High School cheerleaders after they were banned from displaying signs with Bible verses urging fans and players to “commit to the Lord” and “take courage and do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The cheerleaders are not trying to push a religious cause, to shove religion down someone’s throat,” said local youth minister Brad Scott, who was LFO High’s class president in 2004. “The cheerleaders are just using Scripture to show motivation and inspiration to the players and the fans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I’m sure next week they were planning on using passages in the Koran to show motivation and inspiration to the players and the fans. The week after than, they had a whole section of the Bhagavad Gita lined up. Ugh!&lt;/p&gt;

None other than our old friends at bigoted Illinois &lt;em&gt;Family&lt;/em&gt; Institute. I wrote about them before, particularly the head of their coven, Laurie Higgins as part of my “Laurie Higgins is a crazy bitch” series &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/laurie-higgins-is-a-crazy-bitch/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/08/21/laurie-higgins-is-still-a-crazy-bitch/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/08/22/laurie-higgins-is-a-crazy-bitch-part-3/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I guess I can dub this “Laurie Higgins is a crazy bitch 4.” The details of this particular case can be found in the link above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kqswtiifBws/SUpWHcVl74I/AAAAAAAAARg/VJVwqQvb53w/s400/libertarianism.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kqswtiifBws/SUpWHcVl74I/AAAAAAAAARg/VJVwqQvb53w/s400/libertarianism.JPG" alt="" width="256" height="215"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2009/09/problems-with-libertarianism.html"&gt;Massimo Pigliucci takes on Libertarianism&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/4342/"&gt;Last week, I linked to Massimo’s balanced criticisms of Penn &amp;amp; Teller&lt;/a&gt;. Part of that touched on their Libertarianism. Now Massimo has done a superb job of explaining the problems of Libertarianism. Definitely worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/30/atheist-billboard-in-morgantown/"&gt;Atheist billboard hitting Morgantown, West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; – It’s the traditional “Don’t Believe In God? You Are Not Alone” slogan. Still among my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, he’s high up on my list of people who, despite my being a non-violent person, I will punch in the face if ever in my presence. The man just sells fear. And though for a while I wasn’t entirely sure whether he was certifiably insane or just a charlatan performing a schtick, I more recently have come down more on the latter, which is infinitely worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well after already accusing Barack Obama of being a racist, now Beck has sunk to a new low, arbitrarily blaming atheism for a gang killing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others like myself have written the show with our complaints and contacted the show’s sponsors threatening to boycott their products. Which companies are sponsoring Beck’s show, you ask?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this installment, it is quite clearly and cleverly why it's impossible to "prove" the existence of God or any god and thus why such gods are always a matter of faith and belief without evidence:&lt;/p&gt;

This month I also started importing the best links I posted on Twitter over the day, in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/tweetlinks/" title=""&gt;Tweetlinks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September I interviewed &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_11.php" title=""&gt;Victor Henning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_12.php" title=""&gt;John Wilbanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_13.php" title=""&gt;Kevin Emamy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work, the most exciting news was the release of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/article-level_metrics_at_plos_1.php" title=""&gt;Article-Level Metrics at PLoS - Download Data&lt;/a&gt;. I announced the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/plos_one_blog_pick_of_the_mont_1.php" title=""&gt;Blog Pick Of The Month&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/w00t_plos_one_wins_the_09_alps.php" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE won the '09 ALPSP Award for Publishing Innovation!&lt;/a&gt;. Then I did an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/interview_with_drderya_unutmaz.php" title=""&gt;Interview with Dr.Derya Unutmaz, Section Editor for Immunology at PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; and told you about our &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/a_new_longneck_discovered.php" title=""&gt;cool new dinosaur paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of dinosarus, it was also the time to announce the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/now_this_is_open_science_1.php" title=""&gt;Open Dinosaur Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a brand new &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/homepage_yeah.php" title=""&gt;Homepage&lt;/a&gt; and did some fiddling around with my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/housekeeping_time.php" title=""&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt; page here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/good_news_2.php" title=""&gt;editorial board&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/journal_of_science_communicati.php" title=""&gt;Journal of Science Communication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the first big &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/scienceonline2010_update.php" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline2010 update&lt;/a&gt;, went on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/on_the_radio_later_today.php" title=""&gt;the radio to talk about it&lt;/a&gt; and announced a new sponsor and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/conference_travel_fellowship_f.php" title=""&gt;travel grants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best post of the month was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/talkin_trash.php" title=""&gt;Talkin' Trash&lt;/a&gt; about the reporting from the Northern Pacific Gyre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futurity.org, a new &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/new_science_news_service.php" title=""&gt;science news service&lt;/a&gt; was anounced, with mixed reactions from the twitterverse, which prompted me to ask &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/what_is_investigative_science.php" title=""&gt;what investigative science reporting is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month was also an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/an_important_date_in_history.php" title=""&gt;important date in my life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/techie_tuesday.php" title=""&gt;Techie Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/foodbloggingstoryblogging_in_t.php" title=""&gt;The Long Table&lt;/a&gt; and next is a concert by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/cohen_in_durham.php" title=""&gt;Leonard Cohen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/the_best_of_september_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/9d4ryRyDwLY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254369270550"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3c5b542c02210b6b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">One Pound of Mofeen</title><published>2011-10-07T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2011-10-07T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/medical/drugs/mofeen.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Pharmacist questions prescription for 'one pound of mofeen.'</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254368791329"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/journalwatch/~3/dLZRh1ii15Y/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3aa7a36b3ca56ecc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Young Blood</title><published>2009-09-30T22:16:22Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T22:16:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/WRYK4EqsGaM/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/journalwatch/~3/dLZRh1ii15Y/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Hunting may increase rates of infanticide among cougars...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear darling chickens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the most wonderful time of the year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, in October the ScienceBloggers participate in the DonorsChoose Social Media Challenge.  DonorsChoose is an organization that allows teachers to write proposals to fund classroom projects and donors to choose which projects to fund.  Last year around this time I was still blogging over at &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/"&gt;blogspot&lt;/a&gt; and could only &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/2008/10/open-letter.html"&gt;participate in the challenge&lt;/a&gt; from afar.  It was absolutely a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote this about the challenge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;You see, as a child, wee Isis loved to take things apart. She took apart her father's clock radio, the new VCR, the toaster, and finally (in an event that earned her the wrath of The Parents Isis) the microwave. Dr. Isis still loves to take things apart, to learn how they work, and to solve problems. She's certainly not in academia for the hot chicks and big paychecks. She has no tolerance for the most brilliant of students who seek only to add an experience with her as another notch in their lab coats ,but she will go to the ends of the Earth for a student who is passionate about what they are doing. How could I turn down an opportunity to help provide a child with a research experience that may inspire them to pursue a career path that Dr. Isis has loved and found fulfilling?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put things in perspective, and to possibly help highlight why I feel so passionate about this, &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=292814&amp;amp;challengeid=24239"&gt;one of the schools&lt;/a&gt; on my giving page is asking for $219.12 to fund projects for elementary school students in a high poverty school.  This will buy them a microscope and supplies to complete 4 experiments.  $219.12 could change the way these children look at science and inspire them to pursue a career that could someday gain us several new colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have included a link and widget on my sidebar for the challenge.  Take a look at the projects I have chosen, but also take advantage of the opportunity to search through projects you might feel passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year I challenged my readers to click my blog and I donated a dollar amount based on the number of clicks I received.  I also challenged PhysioProf to join me and he responded:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;You're a motherfucking sweetheart! In recognition of that fact, Comrade 
PhysioProf will match your donation!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Together we donated more than $400, if my memory serves me correctly. This year my blog is bigger and better than ever, so the shenanigans will also have to be even bigger than last years.  Also, many of you know I have a competitive streak...I think you will all be pleased.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will be chickens...there will be schwag... there could be nudity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, let me encourage you to click my widget and donate what you can.  I know that many of my readers are students and trainees, but as little as $5 would make a difference.  Take advantage of the &amp;quot;email and more&amp;quot; button at the bottom of this post to encourage your friends to give.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you afford $5 to encourage a future little muffin to pursue a career in science? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XOXOXOXO,&lt;br&gt;Isis the Scientist&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/an_open_letter_19.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/ez7tEXp_mfY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254366632736"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=1152">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1c43155cfab5481e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">A fun site to peruse</title><published>2009-10-01T02:21:48Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T02:21:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/a-fun-site-to-peruse/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="width:336px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/"&gt;&lt;img title="Texas" src="http://media.peopleofwalmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/248.jpg" alt="Click the pic" width="326" height="203"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the pic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Perhaps the artist didn&amp;#39;t want to offend the linguistic sensitivities of potential foreign customers, but I must say that I much prefer to translate the title of the piece directly as &amp;quot;Fart,&amp;quot; or, with a bit of license, as &amp;quot;Bull Fart&amp;quot; because the atomic cloud depicted by the artist is coming out of the anus of an enormous bovine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bull.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[This view comes from a story at Business Insider (Joe Weisenthal,  "&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/finally-madoff-gets-what-he-deserves-2009-9"&gt;Finally! Madoff Gets What He Deserves&lt;/a&gt;", 9/29/2009); other perspectives are available at &lt;a href="http://mlartsource.com/en/blog/29/Melanie-Lum-ml-art-source-emergency-escape-chen-wenling-golden-bull-madoff"&gt;ML Art Source&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/09/flatulence_and_finance.php"&gt;TPM&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see in this impressive sculpture is a horned Bernie Madoff pinned against the wall by the rocket-propelled bull. Just from looking at the whole ensemble, it's pretty obvious what Chen is trying to tell us, but by entitling the piece "FANG4PI4," he invokes additional levels of scorn that are inherent in that term when applied to the words of others. Several of the blogs that have shown this piece claim that as slang FANG4PI4 implies "bluff" or "lie." Actually, it is more accurate to say that it means "talk nonsense," the idea being that one is comparing the words coming out of the mouth of one's opponent to a stream of farts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if one wishes to increase one's contempt for what one's opponent is saying, one may style his / her words as GOU3PI4 狗屁 ("dog fart"), as in this ringing denunciation: NI3 FANG4 GOU3PI4! (lit. "You are emitting dog farts!" = "What you say is nonsense / bullshit!"), although GOU3PI4 ("dog fart[s]!") shouted loudly by itself gets the message across clearly enough. This is an old expression that may be found as early as 1750 in the Qing Dynasty novel Rulin waishi (The Scholars). If you want to emphasize that what your opponent is saying is not only bullshit but is also completely incoherent, you may declare that it is GOU3PI4 BU4TONG1 ("dog fart not pass through").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your adversary still does not give in to your withering denunciations, you may embellish them as follows (I shall only give a few of the possible varieties):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FANG4 GOU3CHOU4PI4 ("emit stinking dog fart[s]")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FANG4 NI3 MA1 DE 4PI4 ("emit 'your mother's' fart[s]")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FANG4 NI3 MA1 DE GOU3CHOU4PI4 ("emit your mother's stinking dog fart[s]")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one must be careful when one gets into the territory of "your mother's" whatever, since such characterizations are considered to be extremely vulgar and, as often as not, fighting words. We all remember the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1225"&gt;"Grass Mud Horse" phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year, and a lot more could be said about this most offensive of imprecations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for "bull," that is NIU2 牛, although I did mention in an &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=982"&gt;early January post &lt;/a&gt; that "Happy NIU2 Year" was the most popular STM New Year's greeting in China this year, I have not yet found the time to explore the full range of nuances of NIU2 in current usage ("balls, guts, spunk, awesome, formidable," and so forth). Particularly when combined with "B," viz., 牛B (often written as NB), then we begin to combine all of the androgenic qualities of NIU2 with the estrogenous implications of what "mother's" refers to, resulting in an explosive combination. To do full justice to this aspect of NIU2 would require a modest (or perhaps I should say "immodest") treatise, one that I have not yet found the opportunity to compose. Someday.&lt;/p&gt;

Ok, that's not totally true or this post wouldn't exist.  I almost never watch it.  I did catch  a re-run while I was eating lunch on the weekend, an episode called "Overload" (some guy was electrocuted and fell off a building -- I can't exactly remember why).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one scene, the lead character says, in what I assume is his typical "know it all" tone, "Terminal velocity is 9.81 metres per second per second".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, it ain't -- the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;acceleration due to gravity&lt;/span&gt; (on Earth) is 9.81 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The second time unit gives it away -- this isn't a velocity, it is a rate of change of a velocity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, any kid in high school physics could have picked out that error.  But here we have a screenwriter (probably a team of them), a director, producers, all the actors, sound techs, cameramen, editors, and post-production people involved in the scene, and evidently not one of them knows even the most basic physics concepts.  More seriously, the producers of the show must assume that it doesn't matter whether basic facts are checked because the audience is likely similarly uninformed.  This really isn't artistic license, and it adds nothing to the drama.  It's just a goofy mistake that could have been prevented --  as Carl Sagan recommended in The Demon-Haunted World -- by hiring a grad student to check the script.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nitpicking?  Maybe.  But I think it's a sad situation when no one involved in a science-themed show is even qualified to nitpick.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-7159007425617599153?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/7vAcZ6fczpM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254361613748"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-588974558614393208">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/abccb1cdb6e88067</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Terminology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Omnigenomics.</title><published>2009-09-30T23:44:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-01T15:27:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/iMGkcURB2ko/omnigenomics.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=588974558614393208" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/09/omnigenomics.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2009/10/worst-new-omics-word-award-omnigenomics.html"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SsTJcl-3MgI/AAAAAAAAAw8/h9OSQbbIYzI/s400/omic.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sometimes it is helpful to have a catchy word to describe one's type of research.  I think that's why "omics" words are so popular -- they encapsulate a complex combination of approaches (usually something + genomics, or something-more-than-genomics) in a memorable way that immediately conveys the gist of the field.  "Metagenomics" is a good example -- it's the study of a larger assemblage of genomes than just one, usually from an environmental sample of microbes.  "Proteiomics" is another, or "transcriptomics".  Of course, this can get out of hand (see &lt;a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2009/01/worst-new-omics-word-award-museomics.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  However, I think the study of genome size (which predates molecular genetics, let alone genomics) deserves a catchy moniker.  The problem is, I haven't really come up with one in the past, so I just end up saying "I study the total amount of DNA in different species of animals, which includes genes and all the other sequences, most of which are non-coding and..." -- well, you get the idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People like me study &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;entire&lt;/span&gt; genomes -- every component included, be it gene or pseudogene or repeat or transposable element.   We also are interested, not in a few model organisms, but in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;everything &lt;/span&gt;(people usually stare blankly when, to the question "which animals do you work on?", I reply "all of them").  But what to call such a discipline?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Proposed neologism: "Omnigenomics"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Etymology: Latin "omnis" (all or everything) + genomics (study of genomes)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sample usage: "What do you do?" / "Omnigenomics" / "What's that?" / "I study the total amount of DNA in different species of animals, which includes genes and all the other sequences, most of which are non-coding and..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The alternative Greek version, "pangenomics", is already being used and sounds way less cool).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Yes, I note the irony of getting a "worst new omics word award" from a blog called phylogenomics.blogspot.com!)&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-588974558614393208?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/iMGkcURB2ko" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254360897445"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/if_you_enter_a_dialogue_do_you.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4865843793207734</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Communication"/><title type="html">If you enter a dialogue, do you risk being co-opted?</title><published>2009-09-30T21:53:46Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T21:53:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/pFXgC6T2I-I/if_you_enter_a_dialogue_do_you.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/if_you_enter_a_dialogue_do_you.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On my earlier post, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/dialogue_not_debate.php"&gt;"Dialogue, not debate"&lt;/a&gt;, commenter &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/dialogue_not_debate.php#comment-1968435"&gt;dave c-h&lt;/a&gt; posed some interesting questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Is there an ethical point at which engagement is functionally equivalent to assent? In other words, is there a point at which dialogue should be replaced by active resistance? If so, how do you tell where that point is? I think many activists fear that dialogue is a tactic of those who support the status quo to co-opt them into a process that is unlikely to lead to any real change because the power is unevenly divided.

Evolutionary biologist Laurence Hurst wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7264/full/461596a.html"&gt;two-book review&lt;/a&gt;: Richard Dawkins’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416594787?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1416594787"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and my own &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981519474?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0981519474"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tangled Bank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I revived when I saw that my book held up under Hurst’s comparison: “The book is billed as the first textbook on evolution for the general reader, and in that framework, it excels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurst used his review to pose an interesting question. He contrasts my style, which he describes as “authoritative and easy to read” with that of Dawkins, who “emerges like a prize-fighter, knocking out of the ring all objections.” Hurst then asks, “So which is the better strategy for explaining the difference between fact and fantasy, that of the quiet American or that of the British Rottweiler?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my answer: this is a false choice. Dawkins and I did not write the same kind of book. Mine is a textbook, and Dawkins’s is not. Reading Hurst trying to equate the two gave me a vision of a college class on evolution. Spotlights swirl around the lecture hall. The professor jogs in. He’s wearing gold trunks and boxing gloves. As he pumps his arms over his head, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xd44PWZGzg"&gt;Gary Glitter blares from the loudspeakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who here doesn’t think there are any transitional forms in the fossil record?” he roars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One student meekly raises his hand, and immediately receive a devastating left hook. As he fades out of consciousness, he hears the professor bellowing his trademark battle-cry, “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.carlzimmer.com/books/watersedge/art.html"&gt;Ambulocetus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t speak about Dawkins’s latest book, not having read it yet. But I can speak to my own thinking as I wrote &lt;em&gt;The Tangled Bank.&lt;/em&gt; I envisioned my potential readers as curious people who didn’t know much about evolution–what the idea actually is and how scientists study it. I envisioned people who might be interested in learning the nuts and bolts of processes like selection and drift, and who might be intrigued by sexually deceptive wasps, whales with legs, the viruses that dominate our genome, and other features of life that evolution allows us to understand. My readers may not hear Gary Glitter in their mental loudspeakers as they work their way through my book. But, if I succeed, the music should still be sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Lundgren&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://cycleninja.blogspot.com/2009/09/intl-day-of-blasphemy-open-letter-to.html"&gt;wrote an open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the Catholic League’s &lt;strong&gt;Bill Donohue&lt;/strong&gt; in which he explains why he criticizes the Catholic Church:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bluntly speaking, you deserve it. Your church has no claim to morality of any kind anymore at all. The crimes committed under the steeples of your church all over the world are what are truly appalling. But the cover-ups, the papal edicts ordering the cover-ups, and the consistent, system-wide, organized reaction of the church to protect its reputation first, minimize the financial damage second, and make amends — maybe — third is inexcusable and make me want to barf. You have no excuses anymore. You are not a model of piety and morality, you are an ironclad example of how NOT to do morality.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, I hope Paul tells us how he really feels &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end, &lt;strong&gt;Thomas Verenna&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the organizers of the original Blasphemy Challenge,&lt;a href="http://tomverenna.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/why-i-choose-not-to-support-blasphemy-day/"&gt; wants nothing to do with Blasphemy Day&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, I helped organize the Blasphemy Challenge.  At the time, it was useful.  We had a target (Christians who never read the Bible).  We had a purpose (to allow atheists to step out of the “closet” and tell the world they were not afraid).  We brought atheism into the media light–even before Dawkins’ book &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt; (2006) hit book shelves and took off running.  We challenged preconceived notions about atheism by letting atheists speak for themselves.  This was over four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some may say that Blasphemy Day is the same, it isn’t.  There was a message behind the Blasphemy Challenge; it was not meant to ridicule.  It was meant to awaken minds.  Blasphemy Day has no real message other than to say “We’re here, now STFU and watch while I degrade this crucifix!”…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/30/should-we-blaspheme-not-always/"&gt;I said earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, blaspheming without any good reason serves no useful purpose other than to piss off religious people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have no message to send — no way to uplift people — they’re not going to drop their faith just because we mock it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/zEuAVgmWt0U%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“America I have a question for you.  Why do you think we’re are powerful as we are or we have been?  What did we do different from other countries?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, my head was flooded with answers.  I wanted to jump in and say “We realized that governmental legitimacy comes from the consent of the governed!” or perhaps “We decided to prohibit the interaction of governmental power and religion!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beck went in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We recognize God’s authority.  It says so in our Constitution – actually our declaration of independence – all men are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an ironic and completely unaware slip.  The Constitution is our principle governing document.  It certainly doesn’t recognize a god’s authority.  The declaration of independence was more of a letter breaking up with the king of England, and has no actual power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ended his scattershot tirade by saying “Let us celebrate our freedom.  And die for each other’s freedom if we must.  Just not kill each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen.  Thank you, Glenn Beck, for recognizing our right to religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was your favorite part?  Mock away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally tracked down this clip from V for Vendetta.  &lt;span&gt;Roger Allam as Lewis Prothero &lt;/span&gt;IS Glenn Beck.  His rabble rousing, his racism, everything.  Parody is now impossible; life is mimicking satire.  “Why [has America fallen]?  Godlessness.  I’ll say it again.  Godlessness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Aside:&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you’re religious, read this article all the way to the end.  There’s an interesting twist at the bottom – and a very important message for my fellow skeptics/atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="blasphemy day" src="http://img.getactivehub.com/dawn/custom_images/cfi_oncampus/Campaign_for_Free_Expression_cropped_compressed.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="274"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Blasphemy Day isn’t about the non-religious thumbing their noses at the religious so much as it is about defending free inquiry and demanding that the free &amp;amp; unfettered exchange of ideas be respected.  More specifically, &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/events/international_blasphemy_day"&gt;in CFI’s own words…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free speech is the foundation on which all other liberties rest. Without having the right to express our opinions, however unpopular, those willing to use political clout, violence, and threats will stifle dissent, and we must all suffer the consequences of this. As George Bernard Shaw quipped, “Every great truth begins as a blasphemy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blasphemy Day International is a campaign seeking to establish September 30th as a day to promote free speech and to stand up in a show of solidarity for the freedom to challenge, criticize, and satirize religion without fear of murder, litigation, or reprisal. The event was created as a reaction against those who would seek to take away the right to satirize and criticize a particular set of beliefs that have been given a privileged status over other beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And that freedom to analyze &amp;amp; criticize covers &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; beliefs, or non-belief.  Freedom of speech is a two-way street: I have the right to criticize religious organizations and the idea of a god, and the religious have just as much right to criticize my &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/atheism.html"&gt;atheism.&lt;/a&gt; Let the free exchange of ideas flow uninhibited – I am not afraid of what someone has to say about me concerning my skepticism of woo and/or a lack of god belief.  And even if I were afraid of such criticism, too bad – I don’t have the power, nor should I, to determine anyone else’s right to free speech!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, sadly, there are those who would use their religious beliefs as a cover to avoid criticism and/or exposure of fraud.  Worse yet, there are those who would use this religious charade as a way of shutting people up and denying them their right to free speech.  This is because, in the United States at least, there has been a relatively widespread &amp;amp; long-standing social contract to not discuss religion in mixed company.  For the most part, I can understand the wisdom of not acting like a fire-breathing atheist when you’re out with your religious pals (I have many religious friends, and I’d like to keep them).  The problem is that when some people couch their dangerous nonsense under the umbrella of “religion”, there are far too many people who are simply unwilling to provide criticism for fear of “offending someone’s religious beliefs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there are &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/ultrafundamentalism.html"&gt;fundamentalist&lt;/a&gt; Christian &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Creationist_Arguments"&gt;creationists&lt;/a&gt; who attempt to shut down the teaching of evolutionary science in our public schools who scream about how they’re undergoing “religious persecution” when called out on their pseudoscience.  And there’s New Age woo masquerading as “religion” – for the tax breaks (in the U.S.) as well as the social protection of religion – as in the case of &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Sylvia_Browne"&gt;psychic Sylvia Browne’s Novus Spiritus.&lt;/a&gt; Then there are those who &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21347434/"&gt;claim a “religious-exemption” to otherwise mandatory child-vaccination programs&lt;/a&gt;, thus endangering their kids as well as the children of others when small-scale epidemics of easily preventable diseases crop up.  Also, on the issue of protecting children, there is the utterly reprehensible behavior of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases"&gt;Roman Catholic Church in covering up and prolonging the despicable sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt; of thousands upon thousands of innocent boys &amp;amp; girls over half a century.  Not to mention, &lt;a href="http://xenu.net/"&gt;the overly &amp;amp; outrageously litigious nature of the Church of $cientology&lt;/a&gt; as they attempt to use their considerable funding and bullying legal (and sometimes illegal) tactics to shut up critics of the cult.  And let’s not forget what got Blasphemy Day started in the first place: &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060326071135/http://www.cartoonbodycount.com/"&gt;the threats of violence &amp;amp; murder against journalists in Western Europe and the Islamic World&lt;/a&gt; for daring to publish cartoons – &lt;em&gt;cartoons!&lt;/em&gt; – of the Muslim prophet Muhammed.  Speaking of those cartoons, &lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/75/Jyllands-Posten-pg3-article-in-Sept-30-2005-edition-of-KulturWeekend-entitled-Muhammeds-ansigt.png"&gt;here’s a link to them&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see a pattern here?  The message is: &lt;em&gt;“You can’t criticize me, you can’t analyze my beliefs, you can’t ask hard questions about my religion, because that would offend my religious sensibilities – Wah!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a stupid, childish, and dangerous cop out.  Dangerous, that is, if those of us – religious &amp;amp; non-religious alike – who consider ourselves lovers of liberty allow such arguments to go unchallenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, the twist: Let me not get too high &amp;amp; mighty from my atheist perch, folks.  Because &lt;em&gt;every single&lt;/em&gt; criticism I’ve leveled at the religious community in the paragraphs above also goes for the non-theistic community.  As a perfect example of what I’m talking about, let us consider the recent debacle of the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org/"&gt;Atheist Alliance International&lt;/a&gt; bestowing their 2009 Richard Dawkins Award on comedian &amp;amp; talk-show host &lt;a href="http://www.billmaher.com/"&gt;Bill Maher.&lt;/a&gt; As The Amateur Scientist blog states…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/09/value-in-skepticism.html"&gt;The Value in Skepticism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has upset a lot of skeptics, since Bill Maher, in addition to being a loud and open atheist, is also a promoter of pseudoscientific “alternative medicine” treatments, a promulgator of paranoid conspiracy theories about pharmaceutical companies and western medicine, and an antivaccinationist. The Dawkins Award, in the words of AAI, is supposed to be given to those people &lt;em&gt;“whose contributions raise public awareness of the nontheist life stance; who through writings, media, the arts, film, and/or the stage advocates increased scientific knowledge; who through work or by example teaches acceptance of the nontheist philosophy…”&lt;/em&gt; Bill Maher may meet the secularist qualifications, but he fails miserably on the increasing scientific knowledge front. And the nonsense he spews could keep people from seeking life-saving medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More upsetting, even though he isn’t a member of the board which gave the award to Maher, it seems that &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,4388,n,n"&gt;Richard Dawkins himself has decided to turn a blind eye to Bill Maher’s blatant promotion of anti-science-based medicine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks, this is wrong, and the AAI &amp;amp; Richard Dawkins are not acting by the standards of rationality the skeptical movement should expect of them.  They are giving an award, of which a chief criterion is the promotion of science, to a man who – despite all the good he’s done in promoting the non-theistic viewpoint regarding religion – &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/08/bill_maher_antivaccination_wingnut.php"&gt;advocates some &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; dangerous &amp;amp; irresponsible views on medicine, views which will get people killed.&lt;/a&gt; The fact that Bill Maher is a famous, high-profile atheist does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; give him a free pass from science &amp;amp; reason-based scrutiny; and the fact that AAI and Richard Dawkins are very powerful &amp;amp; influential in the atheist &amp;amp; skeptical movements does &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;give them a free pass from our criticism of them speaking out of both sides of their mouths on this issue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were a member of the AAI, I’d rip up my membership card in disgust.  &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is my suggestion to all you AAI folks out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close, the lesson of Blasphemy Day is about so much more than just “bashing religion”, as too many of my atheist brethren think.  It is also about something much deeper &amp;amp; more fundamental than being able to criticize religion openly &amp;amp; freely; it’s about having the moral courage to extend the reach of free inquiry, the asking of tough &amp;amp; critical questions, and the demanding of satisfactory answers into our own beliefs.  If we, as atheists &amp;amp; skeptics, cannot apply our own values and standards of free inquiry upon an analysis of our own house, then we are no better than the deceitful &amp;amp; self-serving religious and wooish charlatans whom we criticize so often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Known within the scientific community for his work with amorphous semiconductors, granular materials, and 1/f noise, he is known to the general public as the author of the book The Physics of Superheroes, which considers comic book superheroes from the standpoint of fundamental physics&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SsPnQJBPFxI/AAAAAAAAAHI/BMA18OODKEk/s1600-h/050919_kakalios.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:115px;height:115px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SsPnQJBPFxI/AAAAAAAAAHI/BMA18OODKEk/s320/050919_kakalios.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By James Kakalios&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It began, as do many tales of travel, adventure, and triumph, with a librarian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SsPnnFrcpGI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/1jc4L6CwszA/s1600-h/827-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SsPnnFrcpGI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/1jc4L6CwszA/s320/827-1.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In June 2007, I was in Denver for the national meeting of the Special Librarians Association, to give a talk on my efforts using superhero comic books to teach physics.  There I met a librarian from the National Academy of Sciences. Upon returning to DC, she passed my name along to Ann Merchant, who was in the early stages of setting up The Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In August Ann called, having received a request for a science consultant from a superhero movie that was about to begin filming, asking if I would be interested. “Have you ever heard of Watchmen?” Ann asked. When I stopped vibrating like a gong, I replied that I was familiar with the graphic novel and would be happy to help out.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Now, I should explain that my excitement resulted from Watchmen, a 12-issue miniseries published in 1985, being considered by many fans as the Citizen Kane of superhero comic books. Director Zack Snyder, Production Designer Alex McDowell, and Art Director Francois Audouy took great care to make their film as faithful as possible to the graphic novel. If faced with a choice of antagonizing a million rabid Watchmen fans – or a physics professor from Minnesota – well, I know which choice I’d make (and I’m the physics professor from Minnesota!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SsPkrQWfuAI/AAAAAAAAAHA/O1sgHmJ1Y7s/s1600-h/photo+%282%29.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:320px;height:240px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SsPkrQWfuAI/AAAAAAAAAHA/O1sgHmJ1Y7s/s320/photo+%282%29.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A conversation about science with Billy Crudup (aka Dr. Manhattan - pictured right), telephone calls, e-mails, and a set visit to Vancouver was the beginning of my consulting gig for Watchmen. But my real work as a physics professor began after filming had wrapped in the spring of 2008. As the filmmakers worked to edit and incorporate special effects in the film, I was asked by Warner Bros. to give a talk on The Science of Watchmen at the 2008 Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, an annual celebration of comics, science fiction, and fantasy that draws 125,000 fans over 4 days in July.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SsPojufvp9I/AAAAAAAAAHY/1Esh9LMHauU/s1600-h/s320x240.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:124px;height:124px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SsPojufvp9I/AAAAAAAAAHY/1Esh9LMHauU/s320/s320x240.jpeg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My talk Why So Blue, Dr. Manhattan turned out to be effective in presenting real physics to the filled-to-capacity room of superhero and science fans. At one point in my discussion of the physics underlying the amazing powers that Dr. Manhattan possesses, I informed the audience that I now needed to teach them Quantum Mechanics. And I had 10 minutes. Which left me with a problem of what do with the other 8 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Quantum Mechanics involves strange, fantastic propositions, and that this was the perfect audience to accept strange, fantastic propositions! They not only believed a man could fly, but that a pair of eyeglasses could serve as a fool-proof disguise as well! (A point I then emphasized by removing my own glasses.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My big opportunity for science outreach came in February 2009, when the University of Minnesota Public Relations office asked if I would be interested in making a short video to be posted on the university’s YouTube.com page, discussing the Science of Watchmen. After securing approval from Warner Bros. (who graciously provided us with HD clips from the film, some of which had not yet been shown online), we shot the video in a morning and posted it a few weeks before the film opened nationwide. It was cross-linked on sites from Aint-it-Cool-News to Pharyngula, from Richard Dawkins to Roger Ebert, and received more than 1.5 million views within a couple of months. I doubt that I could get 1.5 people to view a straight video demonstrating the particle-wave duality that underlies quantum physics, but by tying it to the interest in and marketing of a major motion picture, people who came for the fiction would stay for the science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then, in August we learned that the video had been nominated for an Upper Midwest Regional Emmy award, in the Advanced Media: Arts/Entertainment category (hence the title of this post – upping the ante on Jerry Zucker’s first post on this site). The award ceremony would be September 26 at the Pantages Theater in downtown Minneapolis, and I resolved that I would be up on that stage – either to accept the award or to inform everyone that Beyoncé had the best video of all time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The above was written prior to the Saturday evening ceremony. Having just returned from the gala, I now have a new item to add to my CV. I wonder if I can get the phrase “Emmy-laureate” into common usage? Let me close this post with my acceptance speech I gave that night:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I’m Prof. Jim Kakalios. Don’t worry - I won’t be giving a lecture. I wish to thank Justin Ware and Elizabeth Giorgi at the University of Minnesota, who conceived and created this video, as well as Brian Andersson, who provided the physics demos we used. I would like to thank the Academy – both the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, and Ann Merchant, who put me in touch with the Watchmen crew, and everyone on Watchmen and at Warner Bros. for their first-class treatment of me. And I wish to thank my wife and family, for their love and support.

&lt;p&gt;My friend Eddie the pagan goldsmith has inadvertently discovered an unusual way to acquire a clean mink skeleton. Here's what you do.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set some crayfish traps in a lake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mink will break into one of the traps to get at the crayfish, get stuck and drown.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When retrieving your traps with their catch, fail to find the one the mink has thrashed around in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since you have lost the trap, crayfish and other scavengers will have ample time to clean the mink's bones.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following year, set the traps again along the same lake shore. When you retrieve them, find the trap you lost last year.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mink's skeleton will be clean but still partly articulated by sinews.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/09/how_to_get_a_mink_skeleton_in.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/ePlWS9eUyxQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254352133426"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=1144">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/751b84eb3412b282</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Poe?</title><published>2009-09-30T22:31:34Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T22:31:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/poe/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a &lt;a href="http://atheiststooges.wordpress.com"&gt;Poe&lt;/a&gt;, but I cannot quite be sure. As such, I’m going to explain a few errors in &lt;a href="http://atheiststooges.wordpress.com/2007/04/17/8-defects-in-the-evolutionary-theory/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most serious defect in the evolutionary theory&lt;/strong&gt; is the absence of transitional fossils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transitional_fossils"&gt;Really&lt;/a&gt;? That’s cool, because there seems to be at least two fairly &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html"&gt;long&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/140Sarcopterygii/140.000.html"&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; of them. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If life has always been in a continual stream of transmutation from one form to the other,as evolutionists insist,then we should certainly expect to find as many fossils of the intermediate stages between different forms as of the distinct kinds themselves.Yet no fossils have been found that can be considered transitional between the major groups of Phyla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://vuletic.com/hume/cefec/5-1.html"&gt;Fish-&amp;gt;amphibians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://vuletic.com/hume/cefec/5-2.html"&gt;Amphibians-&amp;gt;reptiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://vuletic.com/hume/cefec/5-3.html"&gt;Reptiles-&amp;gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://vuletic.com/hume/cefec/5-4.html"&gt;Reptiles-&amp;gt;birds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://vuletic.com/hume/cefec/5-6.html"&gt;Terrestrial cetaceans-&amp;gt;whales/dolphins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning these organisms were just as clearly and distinctly set apart from each other as they are today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, they aren’t; go look at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of finding a record of fine gradations preserved in the fossil record,we invariably find large gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaps? If you have a time line, and you find something from a specific point in it, exactly where evolutionary models predict it to be, mind you, it splits it in two. You can extrapolate between these and make predictions as to what kind of fossils you will find at what points in time to fill said “gap” and where you will find them. This was precisely what was done with &lt;em&gt;Tiktaalik&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Acanthostega&lt;/em&gt; as well as numerous hominoid fossils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fact is absolutely fatal to the general theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you sleep during biology class?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider well these immense Gaps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The imagined jump from dead matter to living protozoans is a transition of truly fanciful dimension,one of pure conjecture which overlooks the works  of Redi,Spallanzi, and Pasteur,who disproved spontaneous generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because molecules fossilize SO well… They disproved spontaneous generation, NOT modern abiogenesis. The modern field of abiogenesis research knows that. It’s not excluding that information. Bacteria don’t magically appear. Self-replicating systems can appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.There is a gigantic gap between one-celled microorganisms and the high complexity and variety of the metazoan invertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses make neat transitional forms for this, as do archaea. Cyanobacteria are neat little bacteria which look an aweful lot like chloroplasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.The evolutionary transition between invertebrates and vertebrates is completely missing. This is absolutely incredible since evolutionists propose  100 million years of developmental time between the two,which would have involved billions of transitional forms,Yet,not one has ever been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikaia"&gt;Not&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haikouichthys"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkenia"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; one, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.The evolutionary advance from fishes to Amphibians is totally nonexistent.The timeline allegedly took millions of years….(30 million)…and yet no one has been able to produce even one fishibian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already mentioned two transitional forms, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthostega"&gt;acanthostega &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik"&gt;tiktaalik&lt;/a&gt;, want more?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyostega"&gt;Ichthyostega&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hynerpeton"&gt;Hynerpeton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eryops"&gt;Eryops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.There are no connecting links between and the altogether different reptiles.Seymouria has been offered as such a link,but it allegedly occurs in the geologic column some 20 million years after other reptiles had  already appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has many reptile-like features, it was first thought to BE a reptile, not a “link.” The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthracosaur"&gt;anthracosaurs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadectomorpha"&gt;diadectomorphs&lt;/a&gt; better illustrate a transitional forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.There are no transitional forms between mammals and reptiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I really need to demonstrate this? Will you just take my word that there are lots of them? I do? Just read about what a “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapsid"&gt;synapsid&lt;/a&gt;” is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.There is no connecting evolutionary link between reptiles and birds.Archaeopteryx was once highly acclaimed as such a link but has since  been acknowledged by Paleontologists to have been a true bird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropoda"&gt;theropods&lt;/a&gt;… First, however, you have to go from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_dinosaurs"&gt;reptiles to dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;8.There are no intermediate fossils leading up to man from an apelike ancestor.Fossil hominids and hominoids cited by evolutionists are actually  either fossils of ape or a man or neither.There is no valid Scientific  evidence to suggest that they are fossils of animals intermediate between men and apes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Australopithecus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus"&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Sahelanthropus tchadensis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahelanthropus_tchadensis"&gt;Sahelanthropus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Homo habilis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_habilis"&gt;Homo habilis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Pierolapithecus catalaunicus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierolapithecus_catalaunicus"&gt;Pierolapithecus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Today I'm 203.5#.   I feel into some bad habits this week.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that routine is my friend.  I have a few choices for breakfast at home, a few lunch and dinner choices at the hospital, and a few evening snack choices at home, all of which support my diet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a very stressful week at Casa Pal, mostly due to friends' illnesses, and while I didn't "stress eat" as much as I might have (the donuts don't count, honey), I was thrown off my routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'm back on track and we'll see how things go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/bmi_tmi_weekly_update.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/cZjFfA7GgPE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254348118760"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16566">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2e3ca9775fc62af1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><category term="General"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Richard Dawkins Makes American Media Appearances</title><published>2009-09-30T22:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T22:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/30/richard-dawkins-appears-tonight-on-the-colbert-report/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt; will be the guest on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/home"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tonight &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   He’ll be there to promote his new book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416594787?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1416594787"&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun to watch Colbert interview him &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,210,Stephen-Colbert-Interviews-Richard-Dawkins,The-Colbert-Report-Richard-Dawkins"&gt;three years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and I doubt this will be any less entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that Colbert’s guest the next day is evangelical Christian scientist and head of the NIH, &lt;strong&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/strong&gt;… just a coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on Friday, Dawkins will &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-8947-LA-Atheism-Examiner~y2009m9d29-Atheist-author-Richard-Dawkins-to-appear-on-Bill-Maher-show?cid=exrss-LA-Atheism-Examiner"&gt;be a guest&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Real Time with Bill Maher&lt;/em&gt;.  They’ll be taping the show, then taking off for the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org/schedule/speakers/"&gt;Atheist Alliance International convention&lt;/a&gt;, where Dawkins will present Maher with his namesake award.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher invited &lt;strong&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/strong&gt; on his show in August — it’s was an unusual, but pleasant, experience seeing two famous &lt;strike&gt;atheists&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;rationalists&lt;/strike&gt; God-free people discuss faith last time.  Dawkins is even more entertaining when interviewed &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   Good times will be had.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Can you tell what it is, yet?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mornings, my alarm runs ahead of the Earth turning to bring the sun above the Thames; and the sky is already dark by the time I emerge from the Tube in the evening. There is a smoky, leafy scent to the air; hazelnuts litter the paths and I shoof through the drying leaves of red-haired Autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend is my church’s harvest festival. We’re having a shared lunch after the service: unfortunately I think that my vision of long oaken tables and marrows and carrots and whole roast pigs and raucous singing and lusty young wenches serving foaming mead &lt;em&gt;Ed: does mead foam? Please check&lt;/em&gt; from pewter mugs is likely to remain unfulfilled. It does, however, remind me that back in May and June, when the year in bright blues and greens danced to an altogether less sombre tune, I set to my own little garden and tried to defend it against the &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/06/08/on-chemical-warfare"&gt;Axis of Gastropod&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might remember that I used coffee grounds to keep the slugs and snails at bay, much to Jenny’s &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog/2009/05/25/in-which-i-nuke-the-bastards"&gt;amusement&lt;/a&gt;. And I remember that I never reported back on the long term effects of that experiment. So, the coffee grounds did keep the little bastards away, although I am not tempted to use that method routinely in future, for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the power of coffee waned rather quickly, meaning that I had to replenish the Maginot Line every week or so. Although it was tiresome, this wasn’t a major problem because we managed to persuade Kate’s lab to give us all their coffee grounds. More worryingly however, I think the coffee was actually &lt;em&gt;poisoning&lt;/em&gt; my runner beans. And as they were the plants I wanted to protect, this was rather self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know the coffee was poisoning the beans? I don’t have direct evidence, but my plants were rather pale, spindly things (and one just upped and died), until I stopped giving them coffee (maybe they &lt;a href="http://f1000biology.com/article/id/1165003"&gt;couldn’t sleep?&lt;/a&gt;). Then, from the top down, they started to go a darker green, and indeed flourished (although still behind everyone else I knew who grew runner beans this year). Next year, I’m considering protecting some plants with coffee and others with metaldehyde, to see if it really does make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3969908844/" title="Beans by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2443/3969908844_848c95ebd3.jpg" height="346" alt="Beans" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Beans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see? I’m still thinking about experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came over from Australia, I spent a bit of time with my parents in Lincoln. There I helped my mother (her of  &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog/2009/04/11/in-which-the-mystery-tree-succumbs"&gt;Chilean Potato tree&lt;/a&gt; fame) dig the allotment and plant several rows of seed potatoes, aided by my young assistant, Sophie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3969875092/" title="Request stop by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2525/3969875092_18f6f7fc1d.jpg" height="322" alt="Request stop" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sophie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much to Sophie’s delight we’ve been eating some of those potatoes for a month, now, and there’s no end in sight (which is good, because the few I planted here won’t keep us in wedgies for very long). But more excitingly, the tomato seedlings my mother gave me did rather well. ‘Excitingly’, because for three bloody years in Sydney I had no luck at all with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3969918408/" title="Toms by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2596/3969918408_e95e849bed.jpg" height="484" alt="Toms" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tomatoes doing well&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also scored some cucumbers from up North. And this isn’t scientific at all, but I thought it was pretty:&lt;/p&gt;

I am ever so pleased to bring you yet another edition of &lt;em&gt;Get to Know Your Skepchicks&lt;/em&gt; featuring one of the gals you love waking up to in the morning to get your quickie fix. That’s right, it’s the beautiful and ever so intelligent and talented, Jen!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/9840/jen13small.jpg" alt="Jen Meyers" width="320" height="213"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I had a wonderful time taking glamour shots and getting to know Jen better. She is smart, talented and ever so charming. I have asked her some questions to help you get to know her better. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What first got you interested in skepticism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/4117/jen4small.jpg" alt="Jen Meyers" width="320" height="213"&gt;I swear this is the truth and not just a nice-sounding answer – it was reading the early Skepchick zine and blog. While I flatter myself I always had a rational mind bent, I tended to consider most skeptical topics with a “what’s the harm?” attitude and I didn’t make it a habit of thinking critically about things in my own life. Rebecca’s entertaining writing drew me in. I’ve learned the majority of my still-tender skeptic knowledge on duty here at Skepchick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. How much time do you set aside for a quickie each morning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, I’m fortunate to get so much inspiring material sent in by our wonderful readers that it usually&lt;img src="http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/7726/jen8small.jpg" alt="Jen Meyers" width="213" height="320"&gt; doesn’t take very long. Ten minutes, tops. It’s helpful that Amanda does half of the work, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. On Skepchick island who would you recommend for the tech position? (We will need someone to update our website and film our webcasts etc. and you will be busy drinking margaritas.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There’s actually quite a few accomplished tech people I know in the skeptic community, so this would be difficult. I’d have to schedule some interviews. If necessary, I can update websites and drink margaritas at once. It’s been scientifically proven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Name a skeptic who has influenced you in a positive way and why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My favorite professional skeptic is Neil deGrasse Tyson. I love his genuine enthusiasm for learning and curiosity. He’s a great example of how skeptics and nonbelievers aren’t cold, emotionless and/or gloomy, but humorous, optimistic and passionate about the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The bad news: You have to give up all but one of these things: coffee, hottubbing, drunk dialing or whipped cream. Which is it?&lt;br&gt;
The good news: You can pick any one person to share the remaining item with. (seriously anyone) Who is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Oh, man. My heart says life would be so empty without Elyse and drunk dialing, but, for the good of humanity, I better keep coffee. I’m nicer and more entertaining caffeinated. Elyse can still share it with me, though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. What one skeptical topic do you wish there was evidence for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I really wish more alternative medicine worked. it seems so much more fun.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/1286/jen9small.jpg" alt="Jen Meyers" width="320" height="213"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;7. What have you found is a good technique for encouraging skepticism and or scientific literacy in children?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I think one of the best techniques is to do is nothing. Children are naturally curious. Put them in front of learning opportunities and step back. This is actually harder than it sounds, because often you want to just tell them the answers, or just do an experiment for them, or stop them from making a mess or noise. But watching kids learn how to reason and discover for themselves is one of the most amazing things you can experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. What skeptical podcasts do you listen to?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src="http://img230.imageshack.us/img230/2563/jen12small.jpg" alt="Jen Meyers" width="213" height="320"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;SGU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/"&gt;The Amateur Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/"&gt;NPR’s Science Friday&lt;/a&gt; and a few others. I also like &lt;a href="http://www.pixlee.net/"&gt;Sasha’s Den of Iniquity podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which is about cocktails but has a skeptic twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. The phone rings, it’s Kirk Cameron. He says he is having a potluck birthday party for Ray Comfort and you’re invited! What dish do you prepare and what do you write on Ray’s birthday card?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I don’t really cook, so I’ll probably just pick up a bunch of bananas. I’ll be nice and bring a birthday card, but first I’ll tear out the message on the front and replace it with a special introduction about how birthdays are an idolatrous pastime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. If you could pick one book for required reading in all high schools, what book would you choose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Very hard to say. I am and have always been a rabid reader, but as soon as someone required that I read something, I immediately rebelled. Even if it was a good book – I’d just read it later, on my own. I honestly think that a student truly enjoying reading is more important than the particular book, so I’d leave it open. Except maybe I’d ban Twilight.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s called (and I love this) &lt;a href="http://sciencesowhat.direct.gov.uk/"&gt;&amp;quot;Science: So What? So Everything&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, and their website has lots of info about science, its impact on society, examples of everyday science, news, science events, and interviews with famous scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s rare for a government to have such a nice program promoting science, and it’s even rarer when they seem to have an actual ability to make it fun… for example, &lt;a href="http://www.draysonracing.com/partners.html"&gt;sponsoring a green race car&lt;/a&gt; (there’s &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chkltcow/3960636840/"&gt;a picture&lt;/a&gt; for proof, too)! Of course, it helps when the person who owns the company making the car is Lord Drayson, the UK Minister for Science and Innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, very cool. I’d love to see my own government doing something like this…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254342319396"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=1106">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3456da4852117919</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="aerosol cheese"/><category term="aisha"/><category term="ayn rand"/><category term="b.c."/><category term="beef"/><category term="blasphemy"/><category term="blasphemy day"/><category term="dumbledore"/><category term="eucharist"/><category term="hinduism"/><category term="hot dogs"/><category term="jenna elfman"/><category term="jesus is coming"/><category term="jonny hart"/><category term="medina"/><category term="mohammed"/><category term="poetry"/><category term="sacred cows"/><category term="sangria"/><category term="scientology"/><category term="slashfic"/><category term="snape"/><category term="thetans"/><title type="html">How to Celebrate Blasphemy Day: Some Suggestions</title><published>2009-09-30T17:50:13Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T17:50:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2009/09/30/how-to-celebrate-blasphemy-day-some-suggestions/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Happy Blasphemy Day!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, around these parts &lt;i&gt;every day&lt;/i&gt; is Blasphemy Day, so today we’re actually focused on celebrating the anniversary of when &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology#Body_and_spirit"&gt;a thetan was reborn&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Elfman"&gt;Jenna Elfman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, we like to think that we have some expertise in things blasphemous.  In that spirit [ha!], here are some celebratory tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; participate in the CFI’s &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/campaign_for_free_expression"&gt;contest&lt;/a&gt; to come up with the best 20-word-or-less blasphemy.  I am unable to write succinctly enough to participate; therefore, you are welcome to my idea of rhyming “&lt;a href="http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/places/medina.htm"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt;” and “vagina.”  If you are less strict about your rhymes, “Jesus” and “penis” could work too.  Let me know if you come up with anything good.
&lt;p&gt;There’s also some sort of essay contest for college students, which I am unfortunately too old to enter.  Based on my hazy recollections of college, I’m pretty sure a good strategy would involve writing about Ayn Rand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt; give gift copies of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://yrif.org/book/"&gt;Your Religion Is False&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the Official Book of Blasphemy Day.  (Note:  not actually associated with Blasphemy Day.)
&lt;li&gt; using the internet (or any other computer network), download your favorite slashfic (I myself am partial to Dumbledore/Snape pairings), recast it into a first-person narrative, and “confess” it to a priest.
&lt;li&gt; create some &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.C._%28comic_strip%29#Religious_aspect"&gt;B.C. cartoons&lt;/a&gt; featuring Mohammed.  This is doubly blasphemous!  Also, as they are “B.C.” cartoons, there’s no need to make them funny.  Perhaps Mohammed could be climbing a mountain to ask a question of some wise ascetic, like “oh, great guru, at what age should I deflower my &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisha#Marriage_to_Muhammad"&gt;child bride&lt;/a&gt;?”  The guru could then come back with a pithy retort, which you can write yourself.  I’m not going to do &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; your work for you!
&lt;li&gt; aerosol cheese + &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist#Ritual_and_liturgy"&gt;Most Precious Body of Christ&lt;/a&gt; = yummy!  (Also, fruit + sugar + Blood of Christ makes for a refreshing, linguistically-authentic &lt;i&gt;sangria&lt;/i&gt;.)
&lt;li&gt; rent a hot dog cart and set up shop right outside a &lt;a href="http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/things/cow.htm"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; temple.  Offer special prices on the “100% all-beef &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin"&gt;Brahmin&lt;/a&gt; Dog.”  As there might be Buddhists hanging around, you should also stiff your customers and use the “&lt;a href="http://www.arcamax.com/jokes/s-403242-866297"&gt;change comes from within&lt;/a&gt;” joke.
&lt;li&gt; make “Jesus is coming, so” jokes on Twitter.  Suggested punch lines include “look busy,” “close your eyes and open your mouth,” “grab a towel,” “tell the cameraman to zoom in on her face,” and “don’t be surprised if you feel a burning sensation.  That’s normal.  Totally normal.  We promise.  Mention this to anyone and you’re dead!”
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, make sure to have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254342128567"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/join_in_the_effort_to_ask_cong.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d8c688c2b7094d3b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Get Some Damned Money"/><title type="html">Join in the Effort to Ask Congress to Increase NSF Funding</title><published>2009-09-30T20:37:40Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T20:37:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/yWAvLqeKL4I/join_in_the_effort_to_ask_cong.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/join_in_the_effort_to_ask_cong.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the United States, a substantial portion of biomedical research is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH currently provides more than &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/about/budget.htm"&gt;$30.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; to researchers at universities and medical schools. Today President Obama &lt;a href="http://whitehouse.blogs.foxnews.com/2009/09/30/obama-to-announce-5-billion-in-nih-grants-via-stimulus-funds-says-jobs-will-be-created-as-job-losses-continue-in-september/"&gt;announced an additional allocation&lt;/a&gt; of $5 billion in stimulus money. &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Creating-Jobs-and-Finding-Cures/"&gt;According to President Obama&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;We know that this kind of investment will also lead to new jobs: tens of thousands of jobs conducting research, manufacturing and supplying medical equipment, and building and modernizing laboratories and research facilities. I've long said, the goal of the Recovery Act was not to create make-work jobs, but jobs making a difference for our future. There is no better example than the jobs we will produce or preserve through the grants we are announcing this morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the NIH certainly receives a fair amount of press and I hope that this additional funding will help stimulate the economy, I think it is also not important to lose sight of other funding mechanisms important to researchers. &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/about/"&gt;The National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; received $6.49 billion in funding for the 2009 fiscal year -- a fraction of funding allocated to the NIH. An additional $5 billion would essentially have doubled the NSF budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the President of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB, of which the American Physiological Society is a member) Dr. Mark O. Lively wrote to member scientists to ask them to petition Congress to provide a sustainable increase in NSF funding. Dr. Lively wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Advocate, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The National Science Foundation (NSF) is the only federal research agency dedicated to supporting all fields of fundamental science and engineering, and is the principal source of federal research support in fields such as mathematics, computer science and social science. The agency is also committed to achieving excellence in science, technology, engineering, and math education at all levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your elected officials need to know how important NSF's mission and work are to our nation's economic prosperity, health, and global competitiveness. Please write to your Senators and Representative and ask them to champion substantial and sustainable annual increases in federal funding for NSF. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sincerely, &lt;br&gt;Mark O. Lively, Ph.D. &lt;br&gt;President, Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people who are also interested in science, I thought that you might also be interested in this initiative.  You can access FASEB&amp;#39;s advocacy website &lt;a href="http://capwiz.com/faseb/issues/alert/?alertid=14063676"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, complete with an editable letter that you can send to your Representative or Senator.&lt;/p&gt;

If the legislature passes it's budget as planned, massive cuts to Medicaid will reduce federal matching funds further limiting access to health care for the state's many uninsured.  It's not clear if there is a way out of this, other than a massive overhaul of the nation's health care system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lawmakers are looking for termporizing measures.  One of these is to &lt;a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2009-2010/billintroduced/House/htm/2009-HIB-5386.htm"&gt;levy a tax on doctors&lt;/a&gt;. This is insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medicaid pays pennies on the dollar so many physicians (my practice included) cannot afford to participate.  This means that our already narrow-margin business would be assessed an additional 4% tax on our gross receipts  (in addition to income and small business taxes).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is already a shortage of primary care physicians, and if health care reform passes, more people will have insurance and seek our care.  If we tax doctors to provide care, we are shooting ourselves in the neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not simply a self-preservation issue for me---the abject stupidity of a narrowly-applied tax for a societal benefit is odd, and to apply it to the people trying to provide the service is even crazier.  Providers who already take care of Medicaid patients will still pay the tax, but may see a rise in compensation (although I doubt that it will make it profitable to care for these patients).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this goes through, may practices are going to be in trouble.  In addition to cutting our own pay, we will probably have to implement draconian measures such as dropping health care for our employees and probably laying off at least one worker (out of five).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a monumentally stupid idea.  If you live in Michigan or in any other state where there are such proposals, make some noise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/bad_idea_department_tax_doctor.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/dw8ZC_FstMo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254340855346"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/ai-a-a-a-a-i-a-is-ice/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d416878bb3bc8422</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">“Ái á Á á á í á” is Ice…</title><published>2009-09-30T19:24:56Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T19:24:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/ai-a-a-a-a-i-a-is-ice/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Ái á Á á á í á” is Icelandic for “A farmer named Ái who lives on a farm by the name of Á, owns a female sheep that is in a river”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254340093616"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8838150164778675734">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dbc99803aa3e327d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The College Student’s Back to School Guide to Intelligent Design Creationism</title><published>2009-09-30T18:38:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T19:04:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/09/college-students-back-to-school-guide.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8838150164778675734/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8838150164778675734" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The Evolution News website is run by the Discovery Institute in Seattle, Washington USA.

Metagenomics is basically the process of surveying genomes in the environment.  By going to genome analysis as directly as possible, this reduces the issues of isolation and culture.

My review won’t be posted until Friday (at the earliest), but I’d like to bring up a couple of ideas which were quite interesting which I may elaborate on even further at a future time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) The Sullk’atas relatedness stems from a combination of “birth kinship” and &lt;em&gt;ayllu &lt;/em&gt;membership. The ayllu is the community and is defined by exchange and reciprocity. This exchange comes in the form of food and labor. Children are defined through the one-way exchange of food from parent to child. This gets particularly interesting when children are adopted or “given” to an older relative or in the inability of the “birth parent” to care for the child. In this sense, a child may have two (or possibly more) mothers; the mother who gave birth to the child and the mother(s) who raised the child. The author gives the example of “Javier’s Mothers” in which Javier’s birth mother (Julia) was injured shortly after giving birth. As a result of her inability to care for Javier, Julia’s sister (Silveria) cared for Javier while her sister was injured. Upon Julia’s recovery, she wished to care for Javier once more. The status of Javier as “Julia’s son” is undisputed, but Javier’s status as “Silveria’s son” is also undisputed. Since both of these women participated in the one-way contribution to raising Javier, both women are considered Javier’s mothers. This is similar to the explanation of why it is a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/falsehood_a_baby_is_not_the_bi.php"&gt;falsehood&lt;/a&gt; that adopted parents are not the “biological” parents and explains it in quite a similar way. As a child of both mothers, Javier is expected to reciprocate caring through the giving of gifts to both “mothers” upon adulthood or when returning from school or work in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom:0"&gt;2) Sex, marriage, and children: The Sullk’ata assume the young man and woman to be wed have had sex prior to the formal marriage (Catholic) and as such, children and parents are not stigmatized if the parents have not undergone the formal wedding. Additionally, women are not stigmatized for having sex (and children) prior to &lt;em&gt;warmi suway&lt;/em&gt; (to steal a woman; usually during Carnival) or &lt;em&gt;warmi mañay&lt;/em&gt; (to marry a woman)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The individuals are assumed to be drunk (during Carnival) and because of this are not considered responsible for their own actions, but sex is something which is assumed to take place, just not around the adults of the community. A woman can return to her parents after being “stolen” and is generally accepted back into the family, although usually after a scolding.&lt;/p&gt;

Halvorsen's article is headlined "Dr Richard Halvorsen: I'm not opposed to jabs but there are serious worries."&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
What are these serious worries? Well, Halvorsen apparently believes that "the sudden death of Coventry schoolgirl Natalie Morton after a jab against cervical cancer highlights the reality that vaccination programmes are not without their risks". It seems to me that a sudden death that has not yet been explained - and certainly has not been confirmed to be linked to the vaccination - should not be characterised as a "serious worry" about vaccines. Nor does this case "highlight the reality that vaccination programmes are not without their risks". I do not doubt that there are risks involved in vaccination, but it would surely be better to rely on incidents that &lt;i&gt;have been shown to be linked to vaccination&lt;/i&gt;, rather than speculating about a case in which the facts are not yet in our possession, in order to highlight this point? In fact, a preliminary post mortem has found that the girl in this case had a "serious underlying medical condition" and the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/29/cervical-cancer-hpv-girl-death"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; has reported that: "Although local health authorities stressed that further tests needed to be carried out to establish how Natalie Morton died, they said the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was "most unlikely" to have been the cause of her death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree with the sentiment expressed by Dr Halvorsen when he argues that we need to know whether vaccines "do more harm than good", Halvorsen goes on to contrast the sad death of Natalie Morton with the 911 deaths from cervical cancer in 2005. I find it odd that Halvorsen seemingly believes that the sad death of a young girl (that has not even been linked with the vaccination she received) means that the vaccination against HPV is of serious concern, but not that the deaths of nine hundred and eleven women is of serious concern. The exact words used by Halvorsen are as follows: "In 2005, just 911 women died of the disease. Though every death was obviously a terrible blow to the victim's family and friends, this figure pales beside the 12,000 who died from lung cancer or the 11,000 who succumbed to breast cancer." &lt;i&gt;Just&lt;/i&gt; 911 women? Halvorsen's piece could be read as arguing that as there were '&lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt;' 911 deaths from cervical cancer in 2005, it is not worth vaccinating against HPV. That more people die of other causes is not a good argument against trying to reduce hundreds of preventable deaths each year. While Halvorsen compares the number of deaths from cervical cancer to those of lung and breast cancer, it would surely be more relevant to compare (a) the number of deaths (and complications) of cervical cancer caused by the strains of HPV that Cervarix vaccinates against with (b) the number of deaths (and complications) that have actually been linked to the vaccine. We should not be considering whether lung cancer is deadlier than cervical cancer here - we should be considering whether not vaccinating against HPV is riskier than vaccinating against HPV. We have a vaccine available. The debate should be about the risks and benefits of the vaccine and should be informed by evidence.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Halvorsen then goes on to remind us that pharmaceutical companies are businesses, who have marketing departments and make profits. I mention this only because I was interested to note that Halvorsen writes that pharmaceutical companies "have a vested interest in deliberately whipping up public anxieties". Dr Halvorsen, who (as he reminds us in his latest article) runs "an immunisation clinic which offers a wide range of vaccines as a protection against various diseases", has previously written articles on the dangers of the MMR vaccine - and recommended vaccination with the single measles vaccine in this &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-468890/Are-vaccines-waste-time.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;. It could be argued that Dr Richard Halvorsen and the Daily Mail are themselves guilty of the charge of "whipping up public anxieties", which makes his criticism of pharmaceutical companies (not to mention the Daily Mail's decision to publish this criticism) seem perhaps a little hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Halvorsen's next tactic is to argue that the decline in deaths from diseases such as measles is due to social factors and the discovery of antibiotics rather than vaccination. This is an argument he makes against the effectiveness of vaccination. Halvorsen compares "the late Victorian age, when tens of thousands of children died of tuberculosis, measles and whooping cough" with the situation today, where "such fatalities are almost non-existent." It seems to me that in order to discuss the effectiveness of a particular vaccine it would be better to compare a period of time immediately prior to the introduction of a vaccine with the same period of time immediately following the introduction of a vaccine. I did this &lt;a href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/measles/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in a blog post on measles and vaccination. From this post: "The 10 years prior to the introduction of the single measles vaccine (1958-1967) brought 863 deaths (and 4,120,936 notifications) and in the 10 years following the introduction (1968-1977) there were 292 deaths (a fall of 571 deaths – or 66%) – and 1,600,979 notifications (a fall of 2,519,957, or 61%)." It seems clear that the introduction of the vaccine against measles saved hundreds of lives in the following decade. Reducing the number of deaths by two-thirds and saving over fifty lives a year seems a worthwhile endeavour. If you also consider that the number of notifications fell by over two and a half million in the same period of time and take into account the rate of complications in those infected, it is also clear that a number of people avoided serious complications from measles infection through the introduction of the vaccine. For example: the NHS factsheet "MMR The Facts" gives a rate of 1 in 1,000 people with measles suffering from meningitis/encephalitis, while 1 in 8,000 children under 2 years old are at risk of Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) - a rare, degenerative neurological condition that causes brain damage and death. The factsheet is available as a PDF here: &lt;a href="http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/resources/pdf/factsheets1-3.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halvorsen's article can be found here: &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1217057/Dr-Richard-Halvorsen-Im-opposed-jabs-worries.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*I note that Halvorsen's article does not cite evidence in support of his opinions. Given the lack of references in other Daily Mail articles on health, I assume that it is Daily Mail policy not to reference research rather than an omission on Dr Halvorsen's part. For those who would like to read further on HPV vaccination, I provide this link as a starting point: &lt;a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;amp;pid=S0074-02762009000100001&amp;amp;lng=en&amp;amp;nrm=iso&amp;amp;tlng=en"&gt;HPV vaccination: the beginning of the end of cervical cancer? - A Review&lt;/a&gt;. There is discussion of the efficacy and safety of prophylactic HPV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

You can point a telescope at a star, a planet, or a galaxy, but they all look pretty much infinitely far away (if you’re walking, that’s pretty much a fact). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So some new software called &lt;a href="http://www.thinkastronomy.com/M13/index.html"&gt;Whereis M13?&lt;/a&gt; looks pretty interesting. It’s an interactive 3D galaxy atlas, and it gives lots of info and a graphical display of the location of a particular object in space. For example, here is the eponymous M13:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/whereism13.jpg" alt="whereism13" title="whereism13" width="610" height="376"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it gives info in the window, as well as a view looking down at the galactic disk as well as along the plane of the galaxy, and you can see that M13, a globular cluster, is well above the galactic plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a rather basic app at the moment, but it’s a) free, and 2) promising. I think that with more features this could be a very cool and educational piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;

Jeremy Thomas, the film's producer &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6173399/Charles-Darwin-film-too-controversial-for-religious-America.html"&gt;whined that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The film has no distributor in America. It has got a deal everywhere else in the world but in the US, and it's because of what the film is about. People have been saying this is the best film they've seen all year, yet nobody in the US has picked it up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this party line was immediately bought hook, line and sinker by an army of disgruntled bloggers; none of whom thought to look at the pattern of distribution in other countries like the UK. Because it's only when you try and see the film that you realise that you'd be hard-pressed to find two cinemas showing it within sixty miles of each other. Why? Because it's utter, utter crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any great biopic of Darwin should naturally lavish a great deal of attention on the Voyage of the Beagle.  After all, if Peter Jackson can make a nine-hour trilogy about some vertically-challenged morons walking in New Zealand, getting something visually pleasing out of nature in the Galapagos Islands should be a doddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no. The producers left out the voyage, as indeed they left out the theory itself, and most of the science. In fact they skipped over most of the interesting parts of Darwin's life, like a dumb kid skipping over questions on an exam paper they don't really understand, and turned the story of one of the greatest intellectual achievements of mankind into Yet Another Romantic Period Drama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us on to Paul Bettany. Bettany is a solid enough actor, but it's hard to bring credibility to a romantic role when you're being over-shadowed by a giant latex bald cap. Once I'd locked eyes on it, I found myself unable to focus on any other part of the screen as its mesmeric pink latex form displayed an emotional range that its occupant just couldn't quite match. It frowned, it wrinkled in laughter, it cocked a bit of latexy forehead in puzzlement; at one point I even thought I saw it cry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as what seemed like days passed, it increasingly looked like the make-up department were waging a sick and twisted vendetta against the male stars of the film. This reached a nadir of sorts when Huxley appeared on screen as a sort of angry and disgruntled dwarf, tormenting a clearly unhappy Bettany with his visions of militant atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that Bettany looked unhappy doesn't really do justice to a film that explores misery like a suicidal emo teen explores the insides of their wrists. The message of the film is quite clear: evolution makes you miserable, kills children and makes you have arguments with your wife in a curiously stilted "British" accent. Evolution sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2009/sep/28/creation-charles-darwin-creationists"&gt;David Cox has mentioned at The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, the misery is almost unrelenting: &lt;i&gt;"Reel after reel, Darwin languishes in wearisome despond."&lt;/i&gt; He's miserable, the bald cap is miserable, the wife is concerned, angry-dwarf Huxley is agitated, the daughter is sick and eventually dies; at which point, rather than feeling any sympathy, you begin to realise that she's probably the lucky one in this film. Well before the end I gave up and walked out, wishing Darwin would just give up and be a sodding creationist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short then, this film is about as entertaining as a night in Butlins with my Gran, and probably the best argument for creationism I've ever seen. Here's the trailer. See if you can watch it without shooting yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

Halvorsen's article is headlined "Dr Richard Halvorsen: I'm not opposed to jabs but there are serious worries."&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
What are these serious worries? Well, Halvorsen apparently believes that "the sudden death of Coventry schoolgirl Natalie Morton after a jab against cervical cancer highlights the reality that vaccination programmes are not without their risks". It seems to me that a sudden death that has not yet been explained - and certainly has not been confirmed to be linked to the vaccination - should not be characterised as a "serious worry" about vaccines. Nor does this case "highlight the reality that vaccination programmes are not without their risks". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not doubt that there are risks involved in vaccination, but it would surely be better to rely on incidents that &lt;i&gt;have been shown to be linked to vaccination&lt;/i&gt;, rather than speculating about a case in which the facts are not yet in our possession, in order to highlight this point? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, a preliminary post mortem has found that the girl in this case had a "serious underlying medical condition" and the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/29/cervical-cancer-hpv-girl-death"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; has reported that: "Although local health authorities stressed that further tests needed to be carried out to establish how Natalie Morton died, they said the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was "most unlikely" to have been the cause of her death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree with the sentiment expressed by Dr Halvorsen when he argues that we need to know whether vaccines "do more harm than good", Halvorsen goes on to contrast the sad death of Natalie Morton with the 911 deaths from cervical cancer in 2005. I find it odd that Halvorsen seemingly believes that the sad death of a young girl (that has not even been linked with the vaccination she received) means that the vaccination against HPV is of serious concern, but not that the deaths of nine hundred and eleven women is of serious concern. The exact words used by Halvorsen are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2005, just 911 women died of the disease. Though every death was obviously a terrible blow to the victim's family and friends, this figure pales beside the 12,000 who died from lung cancer or the 11,000 who succumbed to breast cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Just&lt;/i&gt; 911 women? Halvorsen's piece could be read as arguing that as there were '&lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt;' 911 deaths from cervical cancer in 2005, it is not worth vaccinating against HPV. That more people die of other causes is not a good argument against trying to reduce hundreds of preventable deaths each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Halvorsen compares the number of deaths from cervical cancer to those of lung and breast cancer, it would surely be more relevant to compare &lt;b&gt;(a)&lt;/b&gt; the number of deaths (and complications) of cervical cancer caused by the strains of HPV that Cervarix vaccinates against with &lt;b&gt;(b)&lt;/b&gt; the number of deaths (and complications) that have actually been linked to the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not be considering whether lung cancer is deadlier than cervical cancer here - we should be considering whether not vaccinating against HPV is riskier than vaccinating against HPV. We have a vaccine available. The debate should be about the risks and benefits of the vaccine and should be informed by evidence.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Halvorsen then goes on to remind us that pharmaceutical companies are businesses, who have marketing departments and make profits. I mention this only because I was interested to note that Halvorsen writes that pharmaceutical companies "have a vested interest in deliberately whipping up public anxieties". Dr Halvorsen, who (as he reminds us in his latest article) runs &lt;i&gt;"an immunisation clinic which offers a wide range of vaccines as a protection against various diseases"&lt;/i&gt;, has previously written articles on the dangers of the MMR vaccine - and recommended vaccination with the single measles vaccine in this &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-468890/Are-vaccines-waste-time.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;. It could be argued that Dr Richard Halvorsen and the Daily Mail are themselves guilty of the charge of "whipping up public anxieties", which makes his criticism of pharmaceutical companies (not to mention the Daily Mail's decision to publish this criticism) seem perhaps a little hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Halvorsen's next tactic is to argue that the decline in deaths from diseases such as measles is due to social factors and the discovery of antibiotics rather than vaccination. This is an argument he makes against the effectiveness of vaccination. Halvorsen compares:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...the late Victorian age, when tens of thousands of children died of tuberculosis, measles and whooping cough" with the situation today, where "such fatalities are almost non-existent." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that in order to discuss the effectiveness of a particular vaccine it would be better to compare a period of time immediately prior to the introduction of a vaccine with the same period of time immediately following the introduction of a vaccine. I did this &lt;a href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/measles/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in a blog post on measles and vaccination. From this post: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 10 years prior to the introduction of the single measles vaccine (1958-1967) brought 863 deaths (and 4,120,936 notifications) and in the 10 years following the introduction (1968-1977) there were 292 deaths (a fall of 571 deaths – or 66%) – and 1,600,979 notifications (a fall of 2,519,957, or 61%)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that the introduction of the vaccine against measles saved hundreds of lives in the following decade. Reducing the number of deaths by two-thirds and saving over fifty lives a year seems a worthwhile endeavour. If you also consider that the number of notifications fell by over two and a half million in the same period of time and take into account the rate of complications in those infected, it is also clear that a number of people avoided serious complications from measles infection through the introduction of the vaccine. For example: the NHS factsheet "MMR The Facts" gives a rate of 1 in 1,000 people with measles suffering from meningitis/encephalitis, while 1 in 8,000 children under 2 years old are at risk of Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) - a rare, degenerative neurological condition that causes brain damage and death. The factsheet is available as a PDF here: &lt;a href="http://www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk/resources/pdf/factsheets1-3.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halvorsen's article can be found here: &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1217057/Dr-Richard-Halvorsen-Im-opposed-jabs-worries.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*I note that Halvorsen's article does not cite evidence in support of his opinions. Given the lack of references in other Daily Mail articles on health, I assume that it is Daily Mail policy not to reference research rather than an omission on Dr Halvorsen's part. For those who would like to read further on HPV vaccination, I provide this link as a starting point: &lt;a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;amp;pid=S0074-02762009000100001&amp;amp;lng=en&amp;amp;nrm=iso&amp;amp;tlng=en"&gt;HPV vaccination: the beginning of the end of cervical cancer? - A Review&lt;/a&gt;. There is discussion of the efficacy and safety of prophylactic HPV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.heavingdeadcats.com/2009/09/29/add-us-to-the-map/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neece&lt;/strong&gt;, the local CoR Coordinator, explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here in West Virginia, it seems like everyone must be traditionally religious. People wear crosses around their necks and churches seem to be on every corner. But there are godless people scattered about. When I first moved here I felt like I had to hide my lack of faith in the closet. It was oppressive, and still can be at gatherings or over the holidays.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s also quoted in the press release saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“We want the public to see that atheists and agnostics are part of the community, just as the faithful are… We have the same compassionate values and, in most other ways, are just like them. We are hard-working, tax-paying, moral citizens who care deeply about family, community, state and nation.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, other scattered WV atheists will notice the billboard and find a way to meet like-minded people.  And WV theists will discover atheists aren’t as scary as they may have thought.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust/a520_chandra.jpg" width="500" title="And the third different configuration, but with similar features, should convince you that this is common." alt="a520_chandra.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when clusters collide, &lt;b&gt;the normal matter gets &lt;i&gt;separated&lt;/i&gt; from the dark matter!&lt;/b&gt;  Let's tell you how.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some normal matter is packed together in tight, dense little clumps.  Good examples of this are stars and galaxies.  When you run two large clusters (spanning millions of light years) into each other, these little clumps hardly ever hit each other, and move with a lot of momentum.  What does this mean?  They tend to miss one another, and they hardly get slowed down by the friction of moving through the other cluster.  In other words, they behave like the little metal balls in a game of "Crossfire".  They mostly just pass straight through to the other side.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust/crossfire.jpg" width="500" title="But where are the 1980s kids with &amp;#39;Rambo&amp;#39; bandanas?" alt="crossfire.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with the &lt;i&gt;gas&lt;/i&gt;, which is where most of the normal matter is, and the &lt;i&gt;dark matter&lt;/i&gt;.  For all intents and purposes, these are distributed over the entire cluster, so they're very &lt;i&gt;diffuse&lt;/i&gt;, but also omnipresent.  The gas is still made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons, and these tiny particles interact with one another very easily.  When they run into each other, they behave similarly to running two jets of water into each other:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust/motion_water_collide.jpg" width="500" height="281" title="Splat!" alt="motion_water_collide.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of friction between them, which (if you remember) both &lt;b&gt;slows them down&lt;/b&gt; and also &lt;b&gt;heats them up&lt;/b&gt;.  The slowing down is why the X-ray-emitting gas is always in the middle of these clusters (in all three cases), and the heating is why the gas becomes energetic enough to emit X-rays!  In other words, the gas goes "SPLAT!"
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what of the dark matter?  Although it obeys the same &lt;i&gt;gravitational&lt;/i&gt; laws of physics, it's missing the main source of friction -- electric charge!  In fact, we're pretty sure that dark matter has practically no electromagnetic interactions at all.  The friction between dark matter particles (as well as between dark matter and gas) is so small it might as well not even be there at all.  Colliding dark matter with itself is as futile as colliding light beams with one another; they might as well not even be there!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust/3936617624_d62aa69a4b.jpg" width="500" height="375" title="Just passing through, thank you!" alt="3936617624_d62aa69a4b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we've gone even further than that, and have simulated what would happen to both the normal, gaseous matter (in pink) and the dark matter that only has gravitational friction (in blue), when two clusters collide.  The video is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/04/colliding_dark_matter/1e0657_bullett_anim_lg.mpg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I've taken some screen captures of the relevant parts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust/clustercollide1.jpg" width="500" alt="clustercollide1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the collision, you can see that the normal matter and dark matter line up very well with one another, and are both distributed in (roughly) spherical shapes over the entire cluster.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust/clustercollide2.jpg" width="500" alt="clustercollide2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until they start to collide, they both retain those shapes, and both the gas and dark matter remain in spheres.  But all that changes once the collision starts...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust/clustercollide3.jpg" width="500" alt="clustercollide3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see, right away, that the dark matter (blue) just keeps moving straight through, effectively unimpeded by anything.  But the gas (pink) collides with itself, slowing down (losing kinetic energy) and heating up (gaining thermal energy).  This gets more pronounced as we go forward another couple of million years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust/clustercollide4.jpg" width="500" alt="clustercollide4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the separation increases as the dark matter just continues to coast, and the gas continues to simply heat up and slow down.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust/clustercollide5.jpg" width="500" alt="clustercollide5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the collision progresses, the dark matter eventually reverses direction and comes back towards the cluster.  You don't see this in the Bullet cluster, which is in the early stages of the collision, but you can see it slightly in MACS J0025, which is in a slightly later stage, and it's very pronounced in Abell 520, which is in quite a late stage of its merger.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there you have it.  That's why colliding clusters do what they do, and that's why there needs to be some kind of collisionless, uncharged stuff that interacts gravitationally.  We call it dark matter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has gravity like matter, and it's completely invisible, neither absorbing nor emitting light.  So whether you love or hate the name, that's what it does, and this explanation is the only sensible one we've found for this phenomenon.  Dark matter.  Remember it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_35_when_clust.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254331516680"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4428">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e3a4ced649bb34c2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Ohio" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="freshwater" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Freshwater"/><category term="mtvernon" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Mt.

&lt;p&gt;An educational and residential complex for teens and young adults with autism is planned for Naperville, Ill. Turning Pointe Autism Foundation has been cleared to build an 18,700-square-foot school, which would serve 36 students between middle school and age 21. A 9,455-square-foot recreational facility has also been approved. A 3,000-square-foot residential duplex on the 6.44-acre property will remain as a respite house, and six other duplex buildings eventually will be constructed to provide transitional housing for 36 more young adults to develop life skills. In the category of Hard to Believe, the project will effectively wipe out plans for a 17-lot residential duplex community approved four years ago. The autism foundation paid $3 million to acquire the site from owner KB Homes in November 2007.

The group TAP (Transition to Adulthood Program) has helped participants find jobs for such businesses as Walmart, and both parents and participants claim the program has changed themselves, their lives, and, most important, their prospects.

The father, 39, and his 11-year-old son were found dead by police in their north Edmonton home Sunday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

Willingham seems to have been a kind of Texan dumbass, an uneducated, wife-beating piece of work, but he was also the father of three children, who he, by all accounts, loved. Those kids died in a house fire. Forensic 'experts' declared the fire an arson, Willingham was arrested, tried, and convicted of murder, and was executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only problem: he didn't do it. The fire experts were good ol' boys who were operating on folklore and fairy tales about how fires propagated; real experts have looked at the scene and since declared that it was an accidental fire. Nobody killed those little girls, but their father was killed for their deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not the most disturbing part of the story to me. You have to watch these &lt;a href="http://stopexecutions.blogspot.com/2009/09/full-video-of-nightline-report-on-todd.html"&gt;videos of Judge John Jackson&lt;/a&gt; (he was prosecutor in the case, and is now a judge). He openly admits that the evidence for arson was weak, and that he looked at the circumstances to determine Willingham's guilt. Those circumstances? Willingham was a low-class ruffian with tattoos of skulls who like heavy metal music. Therefore, he was probably a satanist. Therefore, he probably killed his children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not joking. That was the basis for this smug cracker's determination of guilt, that led directly to his execution. Why not just criminalize tattoos and Metallica? It would make it easy to round up the riff-raff and exterminate them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state of Texas murdered an innocent man, and we can see the whole chain of incompetence, bigotry, and cowardice that led to the tragedy, from this ass of a prosecutor to Governor Perry, who refused to heed the evidence of malfeasance. Why aren&amp;#39;t all of them being impeached or fired, and facing criminal charges in a court of law? Is it because they don&amp;#39;t have any tattoos and listen to patriotic tripe from Lee Greenwood, Brooks &amp;amp; Dunn, and Tim McGraw?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since commenters seem skeptical, I’ll explain, laying out the case I used in my debate last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody should be taxed to pay for another person’s religious training, nor should the government encourage certain religious practices over others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 5-4 decision in Zelman v. Simmons Harris, the Supreme Court narrowly found the particular voucher program in Ohio to be constitutional.  But it did so specially mentioning the importance of requirements and provisions in the Ohio program – provisions that are absent in the DC program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first difference is a familiar problem.  Unlike the Ohio voucher program, which prohibits participating schools from discriminating, the DC program has a specific exemption for religious schools participating in the vouchers.  They are allowed to discriminate in their hiring on the basis of religion, meaning that teachers’ access to federal money is affected by their religious affiliation.  This should sound familiar – it’s the biggest ongoing controversy with the Faith-Based Initiative program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="border:1px solid black;margin:7px;padding:5px;float:right;font-size:16px;width:300px"&gt;“Current voucher policies… essentially push students into Christian Association and Catholic schools, pricing out independent (non-religious) schools and Hebrew Schools”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key difference is that, unlike the Ohio Voucher program, the DC Voucher Program gives parents incentives to choose religious schools.  In Zelman, the Supreme Court wrote that such programs could not have “financial incentives that skew the program towards religious schools.”   They found that the Ohio program accomplished this by requiring a copay and capping the cost.  In their program, private secular and private religious schools would cost the same for these students, and each would cost more than the public, non-sectarian schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Vouchers are different.  There’s no copay, and the government will give a set maximum of $7,500.   That’s conveniently enough to cover the whole tuition for most private religious schools – but not private secular schools.   A Rutgers study that came out in July 2009 found that the average cost of religious schools was about $7,700 per child.  The cost for secular schools was twice as high.  They concluded that the difference has&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“clear implications for voucher programs, since current voucher policies are funded at amounts that cover costs at only a select subset of private schools. They essentially push students into Christian Association and Catholic schools, pricing out independent (non-religious) schools and Hebrew schools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program is focused on low-income families in bad neighborhoods.  Offering $7,500 towards private school doesn’t mean the parents can choose any school they want – &lt;strong&gt;it means parents can choose any &lt;em&gt;religious &lt;/em&gt;school they want&lt;/strong&gt;.  They can’t afford to pay the additional seven or eight thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fundamental to the separation of church and state that government should never encourage or endorse certain religious practices over others.  And the DC Voucher Program does just that, encouraging parents to send their children to religious schools and receive religious educations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might hope that the money would only be going toward a secular education.  But many religious schools receiving money through the program don’t even make an effort to separate out their sectarian religious teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Ambassador Baptist Church Christian School (quite a name, huh?) website states that its “primary mission and goal is to train the students in the knowledge of God and the Christian way of Life and to provide them with an excellent educational experience…. God’s truth is infused throughout the curriculum and is reinforced in chapel each week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I heard testimony in the Senate Office Building yesterday that the Ambassador  Baptist Church Christian School is no longer getting voucher money. Could it be because they were using my tax money to promote religion and indoctrinate children?   No, the school had financial problems.  I don’t know the details of their financial problems, but apparently the program had no problem with over 50 students receiving federal money to be “trained in the knowledge of God and the Christian way of Life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not an isolated case. New Macedonia Christian Academy boasts about delivering “a high quality Christian education to our students while instilling a strong Christ-centered academic foundation.”  The Dupont Park School encourages “each student to develop a personal relationship with God” and strives to “prepar[e] students for the service of God’s Church, Country, Community and above all for Eternity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="border:1px solid black;margin:7px;padding:5px;float:left;font-size:16px;width:300px"&gt;The program has no problem with over 50 students receiving federal money to be “trained in the knowledge of God and the Christian way of Life.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this if not religious instruction?  As the Supreme Court said in Everson vs. Board of Education,“No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever from they may adopt, to teach or practice religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that outrages me as a taxpayer.  But it’s also children who are being harmed.   Unlike the Wisconsin Voucher program, the DC program has no required “opt-out” option for students who wish not to participate in the religious activities.  Students are priced into religious schools where they have no guarantee that they won’t be proselytized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s happening.  The 2008 US Department of Education Report found that, &lt;strong&gt;when students leaving the program were asked why they left, 8% said that “religious activities at the private school make the child uncomfortable”.&lt;/strong&gt; I find that number to be remarkable, and it doesn’t tell us how many children are put into uncomfortable religious situations but don’t leave the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonreligious Americans are a growing population, and the American Religious Identification Survey report that came out this month found that 18% of DC residents are not affiliated with a religion.  How are they supposed to participate in the DC Voucher program?  The way pricing is arranged, they can only afford to choose religious schools, but what if they don’t want to be surrounded by a religious climate and receive a ‘christ-centered’ education?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to end this program.  It misuses taxpayer dollars on religious education and discrimination, it encourages certain religious practices over others, and it puts parents and students into uncomfortable positions of choosing between their wallet and their freedom of conscience.&lt;/p&gt;

Jeremy Thomas, the film's producer &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6173399/Charles-Darwin-film-too-controversial-for-religious-America.html"&gt;whined that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The film has no distributor in America. It has got a deal everywhere else in the world but in the US, and it's because of what the film is about. People have been saying this is the best film they've seen all year, yet nobody in the US has picked it up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this party line was immediately bought hook, line and sinker by an army of disgruntled bloggers; none of whom thought to look at the pattern of distribution in other countries like the UK. Because it's only when you try and see the film that you realise that you'd be hard-pressed to find two cinemas showing it within sixty miles of each other. Why? Because it's utter, utter crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any great biopic of Darwin should naturally lavish a great deal of attention on the Voyage of the Beagle.  After all, if Peter Jackson can make a nine-hour trilogy about some vertically-challenged morons walking in New Zealand, getting something visually pleasing out of nature in the Galapagos Islands should be a doddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no. The producers left out the voyage, as indeed they left out the theory itself, and most of the science. In fact they skipped over most of the interesting parts of Darwin's life, like a dumb kid skipping over questions on an exam paper they don't really understand, and turned the story of one of the greatest intellectual achievements of mankind into Yet Another Romantic Period Drama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us on to Paul Bettany. Bettany is a solid enough actor, but it's hard to bring credibility to a romantic role when you're being over-shadowed by a giant latex bald cap. Once I'd locked eyes on it, I found myself unable to focus on any other part of the screen as its mesmeric pink latex form displayed an emotional range that its occupant just couldn't quite match. It frowned, it wrinkled in laughter, it cocked a bit of latexy forehead in puzzlement; at one point I even thought I saw it cry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as what seemed like days passed, it increasingly looked like the make-up department were waging a sick and twisted vendetta against the male stars of the film. This reached a nadir of sorts when Huxley appeared on screen as a sort of angry and disgruntled dwarf, tormenting a clearly unhappy Bettany with his visions of militant atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that Bettany looked unhappy doesn't really do justice to a film that explores misery like a suicidal emo teen explores the insides of their wrists. The message of the film is quite clear: evolution makes you miserable, kills children and makes you have arguments with your wife in a curiously stilted "British" accent. Evolution sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2009/sep/28/creation-charles-darwin-creationists"&gt;David Cox has mentioned at The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, the misery is almost unrelenting: &lt;i&gt;"Reel after reel, Darwin languishes in wearisome despond."&lt;/i&gt; He's miserable, the bald cap is miserable, the wife is concerned, angry-dwarf Huxley is agitated, the daughter is sick and eventually dies; at which point, rather than feeling any sympathy, you begin to realise that she's probably the lucky one in this film. Well before the end I gave up and walked out, wishing Darwin would just give up and be a sodding creationist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short then, this film is about as entertaining as a night in Butlins with my Gran, and probably the best argument for creationism I've ever seen. Here's the trailer. See if you can watch it without shooting yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

Fisher’s eminent work The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection helped pave the way for development of the modern evolutionary synthesis. [PAUSE] 

Actually…  If truth-be-told, I’d be inclined to give Fisher’s work a bit more credit for Neo-Darwinism than just “helped pave the way”.  Not to shortchange the labors of Huxley, Haldane and the rest of modern biology’s forefathers, but in my assessment Fisher’s linkage of natural selection with genetics was the perhaps the greatest single contribution to the study of evolution since Charles Darwin.

Resistance is carried in both antibiotic producing bacteria to protect themselves from their own weaponry, and the soil bacteria they attack, in an attempt to defend themselves. The sudden influx of pharmaceutical antibiotics has encouraged the spread of resistance to human pathogenic strains, leading to the so-called &amp;#39;superbugs&amp;#39; seen in the media such as MRSA and vancomycin-resistant C. difficile.However researchers at Harvard found that not only are some bacteria able to neutralise the threat of antibiotic resistance, they actually use antibiotics as a food source. Not only that, but they were capable of using antibiotics as the sole carbon source. The table below (taken from the reference at the end of the post) shows the survival of bacteria on antibiotics using samples from three different types of soil, Farmland (F), Urban (U) and Pristine (P - soil from non urban areas with minimal human contact for 100 years):The antibiotics used include natural, synthetic and semi-synthetic molecules, all all of which could be used by bacterial species as a carbon source. Even more interestingly (or alarmingly) the antibiotics were at concentrations of 1g/litre, 50 times higher than the concentration normally used to test for resistance.The &amp;#39;pristine&amp;#39; soil is the one that the researchers found the most interesting, as the general expectation was that this area would contain fewer antibiotic-eating bacteria, having had minimal interaction with people and pharmaceutical antibiotics. However the data showed no noticeable difference, despite not being in contact with human-designed antibiotics, the bacteria are meeting plenty of bacterial-based antibiotics, and adapting to use them for food.The big question of course is Will it Spread? Around the quarters of the isolated strains belonged to orders containing clinically relevant strains such as Salmonella and E. coli, meaning that hypothetically at least antibiotic consumption should be able to spread. On the other hand, actual consumption of antibiotics is unlikely to provide a greater evolutionary advantage than just resistance, and will confer a larger metabolic load on the bacteria. Although the pathways of antibiotic metabolism have not yet been fully determined, the first few steps seem to be similar to well-known resistance mechanisms (particularly in penicillin consumption). One conclusion, therefore, is that only part of the metabolic pathway would be (or already has been) passed on to pathogenic organisms, enough to provide resistance without placing unnecessary metabolic burdens on the cell.Hat tip to Byte Size Biology for alerting me to the paper.--Dantas, G., Sommer, M., Oluwasegun, R., &amp;amp; Church, G.

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/09/28/thats-not-ratfish-genitalia-thats-ratfish-genitalia/"&gt;post on the genitalia of ratfish&lt;/a&gt; (which are shark relatives), I noted that although no extant sharks had similar structures, some fossil ones did, so here are what two species of these sharks looked like. Both are members of the family &lt;a href="http://www.sju.edu/research/bear_gulch/pages_fish_species/species_list.php#stethacanthidae"&gt;Stethacanthidae&lt;/a&gt;, known for its sexual dimorphism.&lt;img title="Falcatus falcatus, by Smokeybjb, from Wikipedia" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/falcatus.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=360" alt="Falcatus falcatus, by Smokeybjb, from Wikipedia" width="500" height="360"&gt;Fig. 1. Female (above) and male&lt;em&gt; Falcatus falcatus&lt;/em&gt; (Carboniferous of North America). Note the pelvic claspers on the male, and the roughened denticles atop the head, as well as on the head clasper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly the male ratfish uses his head clasper during mating is obscure (at least to me), and the use of the head clasper (the spine of the first dorsal fin) in the shark &lt;em&gt;Falcatus&lt;/em&gt; would also be obscure, except that a pair has been found fossilized &lt;em&gt;in flagrante delicto&lt;/em&gt;, the female grasping the head clasper in her mouth, her body parallel to and above the male’s.  There would have to be more to their mating than this to bring the male’s pelvic claspers in to position, but it does provide at least a partial picture of mating and courtship in this fossil species. A nice photo of the fossil pair is at the fine website on &lt;a href="http://www.sju.edu/research/bear_gulch/pages_fish_species/Falcatus_falcatus.php"&gt;Fossil Fishes of Bear Gulch&lt;/a&gt; maintained by Richard Lund and Eileen&lt;a href="http://www.sju.edu/research/bear_gulch/pages_fish_species/Falcatus_falcatus.php"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Grogan. They also have a &lt;a href="http://www.sju.edu/research/bear_gulch/pages_fish_species/Damocles_serratus.php"&gt;photo of the rather similar &lt;em&gt;Damocles serratus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (presumably so named because its own sword [clasper] was always hanging over its head).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally bizarre is &lt;em&gt;Stethacanthus&lt;/em&gt;, with a brush-like set of denticles atop the first dorsal fin, a large first dorsal fin spine, and roughened denticles atop the head. It’s not clear exactly how, or for what, this structure was used, but the fact that it occurs only in males, and that the related &lt;em&gt;Falcatus&lt;/em&gt; (and almost certainly &lt;em&gt;Damocles&lt;/em&gt; as well) used a similar structure in mating, suggests some sort of sexual behavior function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="Stethacanthus altonensis by Dmitry Bogdanov, from Wikipedia" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/steth_pair1.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=356" alt="Stethacanthus by Dmitry Bogdanov, from Wikipedia" width="500" height="356"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fig. 2. Male (to left) and female &lt;em&gt;Stethacanthus altonensis&lt;/em&gt; (Carboniferous of North America).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lund and Grogan provide further discussion and illustration &lt;a href="http://www.sju.edu/research/bear_gulch/pages_fish_species/Stethacanthus_altonensis.php"&gt;at their website&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/3554/1/N2828.pdf"&gt;one of Lund’s papers&lt;/a&gt; is in the American Museum of Natural History’s &lt;a href="http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/"&gt;digital library of its scientific publications&lt;/a&gt;. Matt Celeskey at the &lt;a href="http://www.hmnh.org/archives/2005/08/26/friday-dead-animal-blogging-4/"&gt;Hairy Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; has reconstructions of both &lt;em&gt;Falcatus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stethacanthus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filling a demand that I didn’t know existed, in the mid 1990’s &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; excellent and well-illustrated popular accounts of the history of fishes were published, both emphasizing the fossil record. WEIT readers should enjoy both; Long has more on these odd sharks and ratfish.&lt;/p&gt;

I actually enjoyed T&lt;em&gt;he Da Vinci Code&lt;/em&gt; immensely as a jolly good read, as long as you're not too much of a stickler for anything resembling historical accuracy. Ditto &lt;em&gt;Angels &amp;amp; Demons&lt;/em&gt;, although even I cringed at one of the most ham-handed bits of author foreshadowing every put into a highly popular novel. (Those of you who&amp;#39;ve read Angels &amp;amp; Demons no doubt know exactly what I&amp;#39;m talking about.) In fact, I&amp;#39;ll probably eventually get a copy of Dan Brown&amp;#39;s latest book &lt;em&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/em&gt;, just released a couple of weeks ago. Maybe when I take my usual few days off around Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My weakness for cheesy mysteries notwithstanding, I know that Dan Brown novels are fiction. They exist for one purpose: To entertain. Well, that, and to make Dan Brown truckloads of money because people with the same weakness as I have buy his books. Apparently, however, not everyone seems to realize that it's all a huge put on, an enormous conceit, outrageous fiction meant to see how much Brown can get the audience to suspend disbelief. I'm not sure that the same can be said of certain equally imaginative woo-meisters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm referring to, of course, a young man known as &lt;a href="http://www.dreamhealer.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Adam Dreamhealer&lt;/a&gt;, a young man whose name popped up on my newsfeed yesterday with a most curious press release &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/adam/dreamhealer/prweb2954264.htm"&gt;Intention Heals: Truth is Stranger than Fiction in Dan Brown's Latest Book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be more something like "Intention Steals: The Truth Is a Lot More Boring Than the Fiction in Dan Brown's Latest Book."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_lost_symbol_is_real--really_so_sayet.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_lost_symbol_is_real--really_so_sayet.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/qzIHul4faSU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254321777515"><id gr:original-id="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/?p=1802">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c697ea8e29f859fb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="1"/><title type="html">More on Goodyear-SSHRC “bullying”</title><published>2009-09-30T14:29:34Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T14:29:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/more-on-goodyear-sshrc-bullying/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/" type="html">The alleged threat to withhold funding increases from SSHRC made by a senior member of Minister of Science Gary Goodyear’s office has been picked up by the international journal Science.

Fail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have my hopes up initially for this first episode, because I know of one reporter’s credentials as a science communication / Science Circus graduate from the prestigious ANU course. I was also a little miffed that a good friend of mine didn’t make the cut to be on the show - so I guess I was hoping that it was going to rock regardless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even though I could see a somewhat ’skeptical’ bent (a fake news report on gullibility that only Media Watch saw through; a scrolling-list of ‘bullshit’ topics that they’ll tackle every week - that showing support with a green avatar on Twitter for the Iran elections would honestly make any difference whatsover: “O we go change foreign policy OMFG LOL”)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… I’m still feeling it really is a oh-so-hipster scattergun approach to snaring a demographic which is portrayed as having a YouTube-attention-span-of-five-minutes. Ha. Boo. Woo. Jeer. Bleah. Erm. Okay. When. Do. I. See. Some. Content. I’m. Starting. To. Have. Every. Presenter. Blur. Together. Like. Muppets. In. A. Spindryer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don’t stereotype us, Denton - if I wanted YouTube? I’d &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt; to YouTube for an evening full of cursor-clicking disparate elements directed by my friends’ Twitter links. This is my evening on the couch and &lt;em&gt;you’re just giving me what I did during my coffee break earlier in the day&lt;/em&gt;. Lots of news items flashing past, a few Panda-kicking jokes that have nothing to do with environmentalism or ethics - yet you expect me to be emotionally engaged with a very drawn-out ‘um, what &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; happened to him?’ talking-head tale with the relatives of an Australian soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact? The brief graphic-heavy news sequence which revealed ‘just how many CCTV cameras there are out there’? Just made me reconsider checking out ABC’s upcoming ‘&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/10_october/27/hunter.shtml"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;‘ instead, which is a TV series and not a patchwork of post-teens getting giggly over genitalia-jokes. They’re better than that kind of portrayal and should be given a chance to show it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thanks for that at least.&lt;/p&gt;

All the churches are doing it!", was one of disgust.  When it is revealed that one's organization is responsible for years of covering up sexual abuse, the appropriate response is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to point out that "only" 1 in 20 priests were involved in sexual abuse, or that clergy from other religions are just as guilty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But maybe it will do some good in the long run.  Clergy of all stripes are in a position of false authority, and worse than that, there is a default assumption that they are exemplars of morality, an assumption not granted to your average authority figure.  So it seems quite plausible that clerical sex abuse could be a serious problem in most religions, if for no other reason than that clergy would typically have an easier time getting away with it.  If the Vatican's desperate finger-pointing inspires investigation into the wrongdoings of other religions' clergy, that can only be a good thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do want to highlight one particularly despicable thing from the Holy See's statement, though:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The statement said that rather than paedophilia, it would "be more correct" to speak of ephebophilia, a homosexual attraction to adolescent males.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Of all priests involved in the abuses, 80 to 90% belong to this sexual orientation minority which is sexually engaged with adolescent boys between the ages of 11 and 17."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I actually think it's fair to distinguish between paedophilia and ephebophilia (though both are obviously terrible crimes), but what really bothers me is the phrase "sexual orientation minority."  It seems like the Vatican is trying to co-opt the language of political correctness to somehow portray the priestly perps as an oppressed minority.  Maybe next they can throw in with NAMBLA...&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-1339613531298377708?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254320366699"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=18855">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/79e4cc21cd2b1b4b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="holidays"/><category term="traffic"/><title type="html">A Gut Yontif for L.A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That day marked my first encounter with banned books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably don’t need to point out that my mother’s efforts were utterly counter-productive, that her prohibition only made true-crime books seem even more alluring. Human nature, for all of its rumored complexity, is a simple thing: Tell us we can’t have something and we suddenly want it more than we’ve ever wanted anything else in our lives. Put something out of our reach and we grope and strain and pant for it with all of our might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groups that keep Banned Books Week front and center want to remind us that freedom of reading, like freedom of speech, is crucial to a democracy. Books are worth fighting for. The release of the annual list of controversial books is a great opportunity to renew our commitment to unfettered access to books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books don’t kill people; people kill people. In other words, I didn’t become the ax murderer that my mother feared I might. And if I had, I don’t think we could’ve blamed the books…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds reasonable.  If I were a child, I’d be eager to find out what was so dangerous about a book that someone (i.e. probably a conservative Christian) wanted to keep it away from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So guess who’s all offended by this article?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/26/is-the-controversy-over/"&gt;Laurie Higgins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  We missed you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higgins and the Illinois &lt;em&gt;Family&lt;/em&gt; Institute &lt;a href="http://www.illinoisfamily.org/news/contentview.asp?c=34565"&gt;issued a rebuttal to Keller’s piece&lt;/a&gt;.  They don’t find anything wrong with censoring certain books from children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here’s what [Keller] fails to address:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideas do, indeed, have consequences. Keller’s personal experience that reading about serial killers, ax murderers, and remorseless poisoners didn’t turn her into a murderer is lousy evidence for her unproven implicit claim that literature has no capacity to change people.
&lt;li&gt;Not every novel, play, essay, or short story is appropriate at every age.
&lt;li&gt;Books that never appear on the shelves of libraries, that is, books that the ALA’s de facto censorship protocols (aka “Collection Development Policies”) never allow to be purchased can’t be banned.
&lt;li&gt;Banning a book, or more accurately, making a book less easily accessible to children, may keep dangerous, destructive, deviant  ideas and images out of the minds and hearts of children or delay the age at which they’re exposed to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course literature can change people.  Keller of all people wouldn’t say otherwise.  But a book alone isn’t going to turn you into a monster.  There are always other factors in play.  And to shield a child from every potentially damaging factor is to remove that child from the world itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is every piece of writing appropriate for every age?  Not necessarily.  But no one should be making that decision for someone else’s children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for sheltering the children from harmful ideas, we’ll get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higgins goes on to talk about “inappropriate” books assigned in school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Keller seems to employ a red herring argument when she cites &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&lt;/em&gt; while, for example, ignoring a play like &lt;em&gt;Angels in America&lt;/em&gt; that includes extraordinarily obscene language and graphic sex and whose author &lt;strong&gt;Tony Kushner&lt;/strong&gt; displays some rather virulent anti-religious sentiment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She makes it sound like some teacher forced that book upon his unsuspecting students.  Not true at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some backstory: An Illinois teacher was under attack from conservative groups when he assigned &lt;em&gt;Angels in America&lt;/em&gt; last year.  The lady leading the charge (*surprise*) &lt;a href="http://www.illinoisfamily.org/news/contentview.asp?c=32992"&gt;once worked with IFI&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher didn’t force the book upon the students and he gave them an option to read an alternative book (Camus’ &lt;em&gt;The Stranger&lt;/em&gt;).  In addition, parents had to “opt-in” to the play and sign a permission slip if they were allowing their children to read &lt;em&gt;Angels in America&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href="http://blogs.pioneerlocal.com/lake/2008/03/north-shore-student-advocacy-a.html"&gt;what the teacher wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a letter to parents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“If I have any agenda, it’s this: kindness and compassion are virtues to celebrate, forgiveness is always preferable to revenge, hope is powerful and lasting, and what we do for the greater good is what will define us and our legacy. If any work of literature can be demanding, complex, and nuanced in helping me express those values, then that is an exciting prospect. I believe that Angels in America is all of these things, and that, above all, is why I teach it.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How &lt;em&gt;dare&lt;/em&gt; he…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And what’s with Higgins attacking Kushner’s religious beliefs?  An atheist wrote a book, therefore it should be banned?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higgins finally gets to the part you know she’s been waiting to get to — The Homosexuals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In addition, [Keller] fails to acknowledge that many of the most frequently challenged books are ones that affirm controversial ideas about homosexuality, and that many of those are picture books intended for very young audiences. The frequently challenged books &lt;em&gt;Heather Has Two Mommies&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;King and King&lt;/em&gt; embody unproven ontological and moral claims that many parents consider radical, subversive, and perverse. The implicit claims are far too abstract and complex for the very young audience for whom these picture books are intended, which leaves just squishy, emotional non-arguments to shape the feelings of young children. I think this could reasonably be called propaganda.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what Heather learns in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555835430?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1555835430"&gt;that book&lt;/a&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lesleakids.com/heather.html"&gt;She learns&lt;/a&gt; that “the most important thing about a family is that all the people in it love each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn radical, subversive, perverse propaganda…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, as &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/19/why-the-illinois-family-institute-is-angry-with-me/"&gt;she’s done before&lt;/a&gt;, Higgins goes down the slippery slope and brings in false analogies (like racial superiority and paraphilias):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The epithet “book banner” is hurled at conservative parents as a tactic to humiliate them into silence. Would parents who object to picture books that explore the sorrow of children who have been deliberately created as motherless or fatherless children be called book banners?  &lt;strong&gt;Would parents who object to picture books that affirm polyamory be considered book banners? Would parents who object to public school teachers enthusiastically and positively teaching a play that affirms and celebrates racial superiority be considered book banners? Would parents who object to public school teachers teaching a novel that graphically depicts and celebrates paraphilias as normal variations of sexual practice be considered book banners? Would parents who object to the teaching of a book whose author attacks or ridicules Orthodox Judaism or Islam be considered book banners?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, no teacher is encouraging racial superiority or celebrating paraphilia.  Just because a book discusses those ideas in a certain way doesn’t mean it’s an endorsement of said ideas.  (And what the hell is wrong with &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/08/polyamory-and-polygamy/"&gt;affirming polyamory&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can argue over the phrase “book banner.”  Maybe “book denier” is better.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I have with Higgins throughout her piece is that she and IFI are not simply concerned with what their own children read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their goal is to control what &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; children read.  If they’re offended by it, then they don’t want &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; kids exposed to it.  That’s why we raise a fuss.  And that’s why we should be embracing Banned Books Week.  Parents have a right to control what their children should read (key word: THEIR).  I would hope they don’t censor anything, but it’s each parent’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And smarter children will find their way around the barriers surrounding them.  Children, with their almost unlimited sense of curiosity, ought to read books they think are interesting.  If someone else is trying to stop you from doing it, it’s all the more reason to find out why that is.  (Want some advice?  Try &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Blume"&gt;Judy Blume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  She’s fantastic.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do agree with Higgins when she implies that parents &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be concerned with what their own children read.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to handle that, though, is not by censoring their kids from tackling controversial subjects.  Let your children read what they want.  But keep an eye on what books they choose.  Read it yourself, if you can.  Discuss the subject matter with them.  Don’t let the book be the last word on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, If IFI were truly concerned about children being exposed to violent imagery, graphic sexuality, and complete fabrications about the world around us, then they would focus on banning the Bible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they get around to that, maybe I’ll take their other concerns more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Clawson&lt;/strong&gt;, a Christian, has &lt;a href="http://julieclawson.com/2009/09/29/banned-books-week-2009/"&gt;a few thoughts about Banned Books Week&lt;/a&gt; and how it relates to her faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There’s good reason why people lose their faith in college -– when confronted with the messiness of religion, or theology, or textual studies their sheltered minds are taken by surprise and they feel lied to and betrayed by the church that did it’s best to keep them from encountering reality.  But some still think it’s better (or at least easier) to pretend than to deal with the messiness that is reality. Instead of wrestling with church history or helping our kids respond with love to all the people they encounter, the very discussion gets banned. So kudos to Banned Books Week for forcing us to face those fears instead of hiding from them. For not letting ideologies be used as silencing weapons of oppression.

We’re talking 30 and 40 Mb each, so be ye fairly warned, says I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those magnificent images are of the galaxies NGC 4402 and NGC 4522, respectively, as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope’s Advanced Camera for Surveys (from before the recent repair mission). They’re both spiral galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, the nearest large collection of galaxies to us, roughly  60 million light years from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they look funny to you, then good! The Virgo Cluster is massive, and has a lot of gravity. The galaxies bound to it are moving like bees surrounding a hive, each in its own orbit going every which way. These galaxies are screaming through the cluster at speeds of 10 &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; kilometers per hour, a truly terrifying velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an ethereal gas distributed between the galaxies called the intercluster medium. It’s incredibly thin, but over the size of a galaxy — especially when said galaxy is barreling through it at such tremendous speed — the gas can exert significant pressure, called ram pressure. The pressure is actually blowing the galaxies’ internal gas clouds out into the cluster itself, making them look a little bit like pickup trucks driving down a highway with dirt copiously pouring out the beds&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially obvious in NGC 4522 (the lower one), where you can see bright blue splotches, which are regions of intense star formation, along with dark lanes of dust actually &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; the galactic plane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NGC 4022, you can see how the ram pressure is roiling up the dust in the galaxy, and also blowing it back, though apparently not as briskly as in the other galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pictures are incredible. Poke around them; you can see amazing detail in the galaxies themselves, as well as hundreds, maybe &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of background galaxies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since we’ve seen deep, glorious pictures of spiral galaxies from Hubble. Now that ACS is working again, and it’s being joined by the equally powerful Wide Field Camera 3, we’ll be seeing &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; more of these. Get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

The editorial makes many excellent points, but also puts into clear relief the double standard that is consciously being fabricated by proponents of non-science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=672"&gt;I wrote previously&lt;/a&gt; about another editorial that took a very different approach. Speaking for The Kings Fund, Professor Dame Carol Black said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The challenge is to develop methods of research that allow us to assess the value of an approach that seeks to integrate the physical intervention, the personal context in which it is given, and non-specific effects that together comprise a particular therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editorial essentially defended the use of CER and other forms of evidence to bolster the evidence base for so-called CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) in order to promote its use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find most interesting is that when medical scientists write in the literature about medical research and practice, absent the context of CAM, their statements and perspective are unapologetically rational and scientific. They typically will advocate for a high standard of science and evidence in making medical policy and decisions. In the context of CAM, however, this standard vanishes and we encounter squirrely apologetics for lowering the scientific standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the PLOS Medicine editorial and apply the principles they endorse to CAM, and I think you will see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s turn to the content of the PLOS Medicine editorial, by the journal’s editors. They emphasize the need for publishing negative studies, and lament the “file drawer effect” that is known to bias the published literature toward positive studies. they write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…the demonstration that an existing practice is ineffective or potentially harmful can (or should) prompt a rapid change in research agendas, policy, and clinical care. Knowing what doesn’t work is particularly useful in efforts to control medical spending, where redirecting limited resources away from ineffective interventions is of obvious benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a cornerstone of science-based medicine – actually responding to quality published evidence by altering practice, including stopping practices that are shown not to work or to have unacceptable risks. While mainstream medicine can be criticized for ignoring this rule in some specific cases (while generally applying it), the culture of CAM seems to be based upon ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then get to the primary point of their article -that comparative effectiveness research (CER), which has recently received a great deal of funding, requires just as much transparency as traditional efficacy trials in order to ward off distortion of the medical literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, CER is designed to give real-world comparisons of the applications of various medical interventions (whether diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, etc.). Such trials are not designed to determine efficacy. I wrote previously about the fact that CER type studies are being abused by some to draw efficacy conclusions – but this is not what such trials are designed to do. For example, they are rarely blinded and do not control for many variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are useful in assessing the effect on the health care system of various interventions. They just need to be used appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PLOS Medicine editors warn that CER has a higher potential for distortion than efficacy trials. They write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CER, which will include studies of many types, practices that distort the scientific evidence base—such as ‘‘cherry picking’’ for publication only those studies describing a desired outcome, or ‘‘fishing’’ from an ocean of possible analyses only those that might support favorable (but statistically invalid) conclusions—have the potential to affect policy, practice, and profits to an even greater degree than they have done in the context of traditional efficacy trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with their assessment that this means the need for transparency in CER is great. But is also highlights one of the reasons why CER should not be used to determine efficacy, especially of controversial or implausible health claims – and especially as a method to rescue modalities which have failed in efficacy trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, however, exactly the new approach Dame Carol Black and others who promote CAM have been suggesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CER is a useful area of medical research that will help us to navigate toward more cost effective medicine. However, because of the nature of such research, as the PLOS Medicine editors point out, the potential for distortion is great and therefore we need both high standards in research and transparency to minimize known sources of distortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example they specifically recommend (and I agree) extending to CER the requirement to register all clinical trials prior to their onset, so that all results will be made public, not just those favorable to those funding or carrying out the study or those profitable to the study publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also take the opportunity to endorse open-access journals, which can be seen as a bit self-serving since PLOS is a major open-access medical journal. But their point is legitimate, as open-access journals remove the profit motive from deciding which studies to publish, which creates a motivation to publish positive studies that will garner readers, media attention, and requests for reprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, although perhaps not expressly intended by the authors, their points also can be used to argue that CER should not be used to make efficacy claims in the absence of quality efficacy research showing that a specific intervention works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the high standards of science and evidence that is overtly being recommended by the PLOS Medicine editors should apply to all of medicine – a single, fair, and thoughtful science-based standard. The call for a double standard or the weakening of the scientific standard of medicine, in order to promote preferred modalities that have not been able to demonstrate efficacy, should be vigorously opposed.&lt;/p&gt;

While this story is sensational and sure to stir up fears of the risks of the vaccine, a more sober look at the data shows that the vaccine has a very high safety record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that we cannot interpret a single case such as this. As present there is no medical conclusion as to why the girl, Natalie, died. She stopped breathing, arrested, and could not be resuscitated. While tragic, this can unfortunately happen from a number of causes. It is plausible that the vaccine was a trigger, but it’s also plausible that it was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as a physician, a science writer, and a father of two young daughters I want to know what the data shows – what is the safety profile of the vaccine. (It’s somewhat misleading to ask “is it safe” although we often resort to this short hand, because it encourages a false dichotomy. Medical interventions are not all safe or all unsafe – they have a risk-benefit ratio. But it is reasonable to characterize the ends of this safety spectrum as either being basically safe or unsafe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Albietz at SBM &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1652"&gt;gives us the recent skinny of Gardasil safety&lt;/a&gt;, based upon recently published data. Here are the vital stats &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm179549.htm"&gt;from the FDA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every year, about 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and almost 4,000 die from this disease in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After distributing 23 million doses of Gardasil, there have been 772 serious adverse events reported, included 32 deaths. These are no greater than the background rate of reported events for a population this size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, safety monitoring of Gardasil has not revealed any pattern of excess deaths or serious outcome associated with the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that all the data we have so far is compatible with the conclusion that Gardasil produces no serious side effects. It is possible that rare reactions are hiding in those numbers, but there has not been enough for a statistical pattern to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of the vaccine is that it is 94-100% effective in trials so far at preventing precancerous lesions from occurring (the very lesions that turn into cervical cancer). It is too early to say how many lives this will saved (it will be years before we see the effects of the vaccine on cervical cancer incidence), but it is likely that hundreds or even thousands of women per year will be spared death from cervical cancer by this vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we assume that all 32 reported deaths were caused by the vaccine (very unlikely as that would mean otherwise there would have been zero deaths in the 23 million girls receiving the vaccine in the time period following the vaccine), that would still mean that the benefit of the vaccine outweighs the risk. And keep in mind the true number of excess deaths from the vaccine is certainly less than 32 and may be very close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a single case to promote fear is easy. Putting that case into statistical context is complex. But it is unfortunately true that people are more compelled by one vivid story than they are by mountains of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8281673.stm"&gt;BBC has now reported&lt;/a&gt; that initial medical evaluation of Natalie indicates that she had a major underlying health condition that was likely the cause of her death and that the vaccine was unlikely to be a contributing factor to her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense, and is what I suspected. There are a number of known conditions, such as heart defects, that can lead to exactly what was described as happening to Natalie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will add any updates as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I remember, or at least think I do, when "low-hanging fruit" was not yet vacant managerese. Is there any epidemiological data to suggest when this transition occurred? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not convinced that "low-hanging fruit" is accurately described as "vacant managerese" even now. But let's leave that point aside while we consider the epidemiological data on the rise of this cliche among all classes of users, which suggests an index case in the late 1980s, with the main contagion starting in the mid 1990s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LowHanging.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LowHanging.png" alt="" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This graph is based on data from the New York Times archive, and is derived from the counts in the following table, which tracks occurrences of "low-hanging fruit" and four other cliches, namely "easy pickings", "shooting fish in a barrel", "easy as pie", and "a piece of cake":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="text-align:center" border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TIME&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LHF&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;EPie&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PCake&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;72&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1986-1990&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;67&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1996-2000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;84&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2001-2005&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;74&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;78&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2006-2009&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;78&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to correct for possible changes in number of words indexed per time-period, I've added up the counts for the four other cliches, and graphed the ratio of "low-hanging fruit" to that sum. Obviously, in this case, a graph of the raw LHF counts would show a similar pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrett added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I also remembered when other geeks recommended Malcolm Gladwell's &lt;cite&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/cite&gt; to me, which now seems to be exclusively marketed to management types who understand it not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "marketing types" here at Penn are Wharton students, whose level of technical understanding is second to few, I think.  (Though I certainly recall from my years in industry that developers viewed "marketing types" as being an especially clueless subspecies of "suits", less actively evil than finance types, but stupider.  I'm sure that the feelings were reciprocated, &lt;em&gt;mutatis mutandis&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in any case, since Gladwell&amp;#39;s book was published in 2000, well into the spread of the LHF epidemic, I don&amp;#39;t think that he deserves either any blame or any credit for the process.  Another clue to his innocence is the fact that the string &amp;quot;low-hanging fruit&amp;quot; (with or without the hyphen) doesn&amp;#39;t occur anywhere in the book. (Nor, for  that matter, does &amp;quot;at the end of the day&amp;quot;…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note — the OED&amp;#39;s earliest citation is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1990&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;N.Y. Times&lt;/em&gt; 16 Aug. D1/3 We've picked all the *low-hanging fruit when it comes to fuel efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's indeed the earliest citation in the NYT's archive. It's not hard to back that up by a bit, e.g. Brenton Schlender, "Some U.S. Makers of Semiconductors Are More Optimistic", WSJ 2/17/1987:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LHF1987.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect that (figurative) examples can be found from several years earlier — the phrase in its literal meaning, of course, goes back hundreds of years. The earliest literal use I&amp;#39;ve found is from &lt;em&gt;Adam Bede&lt;/em&gt;, 1859:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;He could see there was a large basket at the end of the row: Hetty would not be far off, and Adam already felt as if she were looking at him. Yet when he turned the corner she was standing with her back towards him, and stooping to gather the low-hanging fruit. Strange that she had not heard him coming! perhaps it was because she was making the leaves rustle. She started when she became conscious that some one was near—started so violently that she dropped the basin with the currants in it, and then, when she saw it was Adam, she turned from pale to deep red. That blush made his heart beat with a new happiness. Hetty had never blushed at seeing him before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it would be surprising if there weren't earlier examples as well.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — Jesse Sheidlower sent in an earlier use as an explicit simile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;1968 P. J. Kavanaugh in _Guardian_ 12 July 6/3 His work is so appealing to me that I feel almost bashful praising it… He is gentle and stoic and simple, his rare images are picked aptly, easily, like low-hanging fruit, and though he appears to move short distances slowly he really moves far and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse's find suggests looking for even earlier active similes and metaphors, perhaps with slightly different wording, and indeed there are many. Thus Wilfred Scawen Blunt, &lt;em&gt;Griselda&lt;/em&gt; (1914):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;57   For we, in truth, were no wise company,&lt;br&gt;
58   Men strong and joyous, keen of hand and eye,&lt;br&gt;
59   And shrewd for pleasure, but whose subtlest wit&lt;br&gt;
60   Was still to jest at life while using it,&lt;br&gt;
61   And jest at love, as at a fruit low hung&lt;br&gt;
62   To all men's lips, no matter whence it sprung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or George MacDonald, &lt;em&gt;To Any Friend&lt;/em&gt; (1893):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9   At home, no rich fruit, hanging low,&lt;br&gt;
10      Have I for Love to pull;&lt;br&gt;
11   Only unripe things that must grow&lt;br&gt;
12      Till Autumn's maund be full!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Dora Sigerson, &lt;em&gt;My Darling&lt;/em&gt; (1893):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5   Oh, Life came over the meadows,&lt;br&gt;
6      And the song of her coming was sweet;&lt;br&gt;
7   The streams leaped joy-mad down the mountains,&lt;br&gt;
8      Flowers bloomed 'neath her dawning feet.&lt;br&gt;
9   The trees bent their branches fruit-laden,&lt;br&gt;
10      So low as her soft hands' hold;&lt;br&gt;
11   And the harvest rose up like an army&lt;br&gt;
12      Of kings in their harness of gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Edmund Gosse, &lt;em&gt;VIllanelle I&lt;/em&gt; (1879):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1   		Wouldst thou not be content to die&lt;br&gt;
2   		   When low-hung fruit is hardly clinging,&lt;br&gt;
3   		And golden Autumn passes by?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Herman Melville,&lt;em&gt; Clarel&lt;/em&gt; (1876):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3919   Estranged, estranged: can friend prove so?&lt;br&gt;
3920   Aloft, aloof, a frigid sign:&lt;br&gt;
3921   How far removed, thou Tree divine,&lt;br&gt;
3922   Whose tender fruit did reach so low—&lt;br&gt;
3923   Love apples of New-Paradise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OrAaron Hill (died 1750), &lt;em&gt;Sareph and Hamar&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;42      Refresh'd by sleep, he rose serene and gay,&lt;br&gt;
43      And walk'd abroad to see the breaking day,&lt;br&gt;
44   With dawning lustre, thro' the boughs, in trembling sallies play.&lt;br&gt;
45      Where-e'er he pass'd, the golden fruit hung low&lt;br&gt;
46      And dancing, wanton, bow'd to court his hand,&lt;br&gt;
47      Proud of the native charms they had to show;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or  Charles Goodall, &lt;em&gt;To Mr. R. Smith of King 's Colledge in Cambridge&lt;/em&gt; (1689):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33   The barren Tree can in the Desarts spread,&lt;br&gt;
34   And threaten Heaven with its luxurious head:&lt;br&gt;
35   Whilst others low, and laden with their Fruit,&lt;br&gt;
36   With bended Branches touch their very root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Henry Reynolds' 1628 translation of Torquato Tasso's &lt;em&gt;Aminta&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being but a Lad, so young as yet scarse able&lt;br&gt;
To reach the fruit from the low-hanging boughes&lt;br&gt;
Of new growne trees; Inward I grew to bee&lt;br&gt;
With a young mayde, fullest of loue and sweetnesse,&lt;br&gt;
That ere display'd pure gold tresse to the winde;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, you could say that LHF was a poetic cliche long before it came to be a cliche associated with any other group. And I wouldn't be surprised to find the metaphor in Homer, or the Bible.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2 — Allan Jenkins at Desirable Roasted Coffee, who is definitely towards the censorious end of things linguistic, &lt;a href="http://desirableroastedcoffee.com/2009/10/now-i-am-really-sure-i-hate-low-hanging-fruit.html"&gt;tells a cute story about this phrase&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="border-collapse:separate;color:#000000;font-family:&amp;#39;Times New Roman&amp;#39;;font-size:medium;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#111111;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px"&gt;At a conference in New York, an ad guy once asked me, "The Monkey Bar would be a stretch target for me if we have to meet at 8; isn't there some low-hanging fruit closer?" He's probably still wiping himself of spittle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;d been there, the ad guy wouldn&amp;#39;t have been in any danger of spittle-spatter, but he might have been puzzled or even offended as I  muttered something like &amp;quot;Wow; hold on a minute while I write that down.&amp;quot;]&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254312123662"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=4601">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9985e38c9e45a7ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="science and medicine"/><title type="html">The Huffington Post: a clearing house of alt-med nonsense</title><published>2009-09-30T12:00:25Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T12:00:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/09/30/the-huffington-post-a-clearing-house-of-alt-med-nonsense/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I used to write for the Huffington Post, an online news and blog collective. It was started by Arianna Huffington during the Bush Era as a response to all the far-right online media. I didn’t agree with a lot of what was on there — I am more centrist — but at the time I thought it was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they started to promote far-left New Age nonsense, and when it came to vaccinations, HuffPo started posting all kinds of opinions that amounted to nothing more than out-and-out health threats. While they do sometimes post a counter-argument, it’s still almost all alt-med, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the latest: &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-frank-lipman/swine-flu-what-to-do_b_286245.html"&gt;a doctor named Frank Lipman is telling people not to get vaccinated against Swine Flu&lt;/a&gt;. Instead he says you should wash your hands a lot, eat well, and take homeopathic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, seriously. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And he does it while spouting quite a few of the standard antivax memes, like the flu won’t be that bad (maybe he should consult with Dr. Joe Albietz, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Jalbietz/statuses/4367477539"&gt;who I’m sure would disagree&lt;/a&gt;) and my favorite, we don’t know how well the vaccine will work. In fact, the vaccine for Swine Flu is based on many decades of research on how vaccines are produced, and will certainly work better than Dr. Lipman’s homeopathic &amp;quot;medicine&amp;quot; which we know is just plain old water, and totally useless. I’ll note that on his own site he promotes acupuncture and chiropractic, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the peddling of antivax rhetoric like this that drove me from HuffPo, and I’ve let them know why. I was a minor cog there, so I know it made no difference… and the proof is that they still post articles promoting procedures known to be useless. In fact, it’s worse than that, &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/spray-for-tga-over-homeopaths-20090924-g4pt.html"&gt;since someone might try the homeopathic water rather than get actual treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as always, don’t listen to people like Lipman, or even to me when it comes to this stuff. Instead, go to your doctor, a board-certified and science-based doctor, and ask them about the H1N1 swine flu, and see if they recommend getting the shot. And yes, as soon as it’s available here I’ll get vaccinated, as will my wife and daughter. We talked to a real doctor about it, and we understand the threat of H1N1, and we understand what vaccines do. &lt;/p&gt;

It's a basic unit of memory or knowledge defined by pattern of connections between a network of neurons associated by experience.Termed by Fuster in 2006, the construct was created to solve the problematic yet popular view that the human brain is made up of discrete cortical domains dedicated exclusively to visual discrimination, language, spatial attention, face recognition, motor programming, memory retrieval, and working memory.Although the modular modeling of the brain has utterly failed due to a lack of conclusive evidence, many neuroscientists continue to maintain this antiquated view... but why? Put quite simply, there was nothing better. However, thanks to Fuster, a new paradigm is emerging...Introducing the cognit network model. It postulates that memory and knowledge are represented by interactive, distributed, and overlapping networks of neurons in association cortices.The posterior-post-rolandic association cortex contains perceptual cognits and the frontal  association cortex contains executive cognits. The prefrontal and posterior association cortices are linked by complex cognits in a hierarchical order. The parasensory and premotor cortex, found at the bottom of the hierarchy, contain relatively simple and small cognits which represent motor acts or simple percepts. At the top of the hierarchy is the temporo–parietal and prefrontal cortex containing larger cognits representing complex and abstract information of perception and executive control. The  long reciprocal cortico–cortical connections between the posterior and frontal networks support sequential behavior, speech, and reasoning.What I found most fascinating was that a single neuron can be part of many memory networks and therefore many memories and units of knowledge.Fuster JM (2009).

Along with the knee and back it is probably the most studied and researched topics in the sport injury world. However, each professional has a different outlook and “experts” on the topic are constantly being recycled.     One injury in particular leaves many professionals constantly second guessing themselves. A SLAP lesion is a pathology which occurs in the superior aspect of the labrum and often involves a tear traveling from an anterior to posterior manner. (Hense the term SLAP lesion –superior labrum anterior to posterior).     The problem with this injury is its ability to often replicate other shoulder pathologies such as shoulder impingement, bicep tendinopathies, shoulder instability and rotator cuff disease. The combination of this overlap and the delay of access to mri imaging in small towns and Canada leaves quite a dilemma. That’s why it’s important to be constantly updated on new test which are evolving in the literature. This is a review of a new test described and its validity for detecting SLAP lesions.     The study involved 113 subjects all which tried conservative treatment but failed to be successful.  These subjects were put through three orthopaedic tests before undergoing an arthroscopic procedure. Once the procedure confirmed or denied a suspected SLAP lesion correlations were made.  Subjects were tested using the Speed’s Test, Obrien’s Test and the evaluated supine flexion resistance test (See Links)O&amp;#39;Brien&amp;#39;s Test Video   Speed&amp;#39;s Test Video Supine flexion resistance test       The supine flexion resistance test is performed with the patient lying in the supine position. Both of the patient’s arms are elevated above their head with the forearms resting on the table and their palms facing upward.  The examiner stands on the same side as the tested shoulder. The examiner then grasps the forearm just distal to the elbow. The patient is then instructed to attempt forward flexion while the examiner applies resistance. The idea is to emulate a throwing motion.  Positive – Pain deep inside the shoulder joint or along the dorsal aspect of the joint line. (See Link for video)     The problem with the study was the author’s lack of correlating the test with all forms of SLAP lesions and never stated why such exclusion was done? Many statistical evaluations were performed in the study but many of non importance.  Sensitivity and Specificity of the test to all groups of pathologies (all injuries found on subjects) are clinically irrelevant. This tells me the test is positive when patients are in pain but not where the pain is coming from. As you can see multiple test have multiple over lap of findings with a wide arrange of pathologies. Needless to say their rarely ever is a clear cut answer when performing testing. Subjects were found to have everything from 3 different types of SLAP lesions to AC joint arthritis.Results     The presenting of the results wasn’t done very effectively by the authors. They were quick to point out the good results of their study yet completely fail to discuss some of the more important findings. Such as the specificity of the test for SLAP lesions. However the specificity for supraspinatous lesions was mentioned ....go figure?     Sensitivity for isolated SLAP Lesions was 92% compared to 58% for Speeds and 75% for O’Briens     This means 92% of the time if a patient has a SLAP lesion this test will pick it up. It doesn’t mean 92% of the time the test is positive it is a SLAP lesion. This is often the big problem with orthopaedic testing for the shoulder. For example the test also had high sensitivity for pathologies as a whole in the study (80%).This is why it’s important to look at the entire clinical picture with the shoulder and not just rely on one test alone. Sometimes treatment can even help figure out the diagnosis down the road.The idea     Although the article lacks a good explanation of why such a test would provoke symptoms it is fairly easy to understand. The test is merely a different version of the Speed’s test. The bicep has attachments to the superior aspect of the labrum.  SLAP orthopaedic test are designed to contract and tension the bicep muscle taking advantage of this bicep labrum complex. The hope is to provoke pain in which the patient is feeling due to this complex. The idea behind both the supine flexion resistance test and Speed’s is to contract the bicep tendons head and thus pull on the inflamed torn labrum. Obrien’s is usually a test used for better confirmation because it attempts to twist and torsion the head of the bicep which may continue to provoke symptoms. However my favourite test for SLAP lesions is the bicep load test number 1 and 2 (Sen 90.9%, Spec 96.9% &amp;amp; Sen 89.7%, Spec 96.9%). Bicep Load Test 2 Video Bicep Load Test Video Reasoning being this test actually helps rule a SLAP lesion out by attempting to lessen the patient’s symptoms. As we all know if someone is in pain most tests will be positive and thus give us insignificant clinical findings. It is much harder when given an acute injury to find test which lessen the pain then provoke it. When the bicep load tests are negative and ease symptoms it is a significant tool for ruling out a SLAP lesion.

&lt;p&gt;Why do we celebrate it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Blasphemy Day International is a campaign seeking to establish September 30th as a day to promote free speech and stand up in a show of solidarity for the freedom to challenge, criticize, and satirize religion without fear of murder, litigation, and reprisal. Blasphemy Day takes place September 30th to commemorate the publishing of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons. The purpose of Blasphemy Day is not to promote hate or violence; it is to support free speech, support the right to criticize and satirize religion, and to oppose any resolutions or laws, binding or otherwise, that discourage or inhibit free speech of any kind.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center For Inquiry is running a &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/cfi_blasphemy_contest/"&gt;blasphemy contest&lt;/a&gt; through next week to mark the occasion.  All you have to do is “create a phrase, poem, or statement that would be or would have been considered blasphemous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Kurtz&lt;/strong&gt; is the founder and former Chairman of CFI and he thinks &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blog/a_disssenting_view_about_blashphemy_day/"&gt;the contest is in the wrong spirit&lt;/a&gt;.  I have to say I agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is one thing to examine the claims of religion in a responsible way by calling attention to Biblical, Koranic or scientific criticisms, it is quite another to violate the key humanistic principle of tolerance. One may disagree with contending religious beliefs, but to denigrate them by rude caricatures borders on hate speech. What would humanists and skeptics say if religious believers insulted them in the same way?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the contest that’s the problem.  It’s the idea of blasphemy, used in the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re doing something blasphemous today, ask yourself these questions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you doing it to make some larger point?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you doing it to begin a conversation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you doing it just to piss off religious people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you trying to accomplish?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blasphemy isn’t always bad, of course.  When &lt;em&gt;Jyllands-Posten&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy"&gt;“blasphemous” cartoons&lt;/a&gt; about Muhammad — and a few other newspapers and magazines followed — they were doing it to support freedom of the press.  A very important point was made: just because you find something or someone sacred doesn’t mean the rest of us have to follow suit.  More power to those institutions which stood up to the violent protestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you could hold a sign that reads, “FUCK JESUS.”  You could wear a &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jomme/3164114730/"&gt;shirt like this&lt;/a&gt;.  You could paint a picture of religious deities doing all sorts of disgusting things with barnyard animals.  But what would be the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without a good reason&lt;/em&gt;, you’re not showing the general public that we ought to take advantage of our right to free speech.  You’re only showing them you’re a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to act holier-than-thou or anything, either.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several affiliates of the Secular Student Alliance are celebrating their own way and I support what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, At LSU, &lt;strong&gt;Matthew Shepherd&lt;/strong&gt;’s campus atheist group &lt;a href="http://www.lsureveille.com/news/group-plans-for-blasphemy-day-1.1930078"&gt;has a plan of action&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Shepherd said the group will hand out fliers about the Jyllands-Posten cartoons from 10 a.m. until at least 12:30 p.m., and AHA might set up a system for students to exchange Bibles for materials “promoting free thinking.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what the day should be about: opening peoples’ minds, not simply offending them for the sake of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; blaspheme doesn’t mean you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to blaspheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: Current CFI CEO &lt;strong&gt;Ron Lindsay&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blog/two_different_understandings_of_blasphemy_--_two_different_visions_of_cfi/"&gt;has responded to Kurtz’s piece&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Paul Kurtz does offer to the readers of Free Thinking a choice between two starkly different views of CFI. There is the CFI that stands with those who believe we should be free to criticize religion just as we criticize other beliefs; then there is the neo-Kurtzian vision of a CFI that would tiptoe around criticism of religion for fear of giving offense. There is a CFI that believes that art, even when it might be considered crude or offensive to some, may have symbolic value, and, in any event, deserves protection; and then there is the neo-Kurtzian CFI that advocates censorship of art. There is the CFI that honors those who have risked everything to express their views about religion; and then there is the neo-Kurtzian CFI that equates critique of religion with hate speech.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurtz wasn’t arguing against critiquing religion, though.  He was against attacks on religion that had no point other than to offend.  There’s a difference between criticizing what the Bible says and drawing a picture called “Jesus Does His Nails”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.danaellyn.com/press/blasphemy/postcard2F.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.danaellyn.com/press/blasphemy/postcard2F.jpg" title="JesusNails" width="447" height="576"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one’s trying to censor the artist or anyone else for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I think Kurtz is asking what I’m asking: If you’re “blaspheming,” are you doing it for the right reasons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(On a side note, like Ron Lindsay, I would like to know why Kurtz is using the phrase “fundamentalist atheist”…)&lt;br&gt;

Here is what he said and my response to him.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He finds that I am unclear about the test and as such there are not one but five (different?) tests because I'm not clear about it. Joshua is doing three things with me and my test in order to maintain an improbable faith.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) He’s mistaking my attempts at clarifying and further explaining the OTF as different tests, which is wholly inappropriate rhetoric. 2) He’s faulting me for not writing to the professional philosopher, which, if I did so would not be my target audience. 3) He’s chosen to personally offend me with his rhetoric in hopes that I will not respond so he can have the last word. All in all this is indeed an interesting strategy, but it will not work with me. Leaving aside his many mischaracterizations of my position, and leaving aside the things I’ve already addressed, along with his offensiveness, I’ll briefly respond.&lt;blockquote&gt;He said: Whether Loftus thinks skepticism is a presumption or a “control belief”, something we start with or something we conclude with, is now wholly beyond me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Both. I said it is circular but not viciously circular.&lt;blockquote&gt;He said: This should lead us to “presuppose” skepticism, one of Loftus’s many underdefined terms. But skepticism seems to be a negative term, meaning something akin to “Don’t assume the Bible is true,” or something very much like that. It’s unclear whether Loftus has anything positive in mind for skepticism as an actual investigative methodology for the epistemology of religion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;If he doesn’t know what it means to be skeptical of a positive claim or assertion then he’s being willing obtuse. As Vic Stenger repeats, “absence of evidence is evidence of absence when the evidence should be there and is not.” In my book I argue for Hume’s standards, methodological naturalism, and the scientific method itself. There are no better standards or methods. What are the alternatives if not?&lt;blockquote&gt;He said: Loftus repeats his book’s claim that sociological data is akin to a “background” fact to be used in assessing religious “truth claims.” It is important for the non-specialist reader to realize that, usually, sociological or cultural arguments are relevant only to the rationality of religious believers themselves. Say Joshua’s only reason for believing in God is because his trusty uncle told him so. This wouldn’t cast doubt on the proposition “God exists,” but it would cast doubt on the proposition, “Joshua believes in God for good reasons.” This is an important distinction that Loftus frequently ignores.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This analogy is disanalogous and even disingenuous, for we’re not just talking about one case of one uncle telling one person to believe in one kind of God. There are myriads of uncle’s telling a myriad of nephews to believe in a myriad number of gods, and these nephews all believe what they’re initially told. And THAT is what I’m addressing with the OTF. Such a situation does indeed cast doubt on what any given uncle tells his nephew such that these nephews ought to be skeptical of what they were told. Why? Because all nephews believe what they were initially told by their uncles, and because at the very least all but one of these uncles must be wrong. They could even all be wrong.&lt;blockquote&gt;He said: Loftus says certain rather conspicuous things given his own projects, such as “Christian, just ask yourself whether the initial reasons you had for adopting your faith were strong ones.” Yet Loftus doesn’t want us examining his initial reasons for adopting his atheism, and to instead examine the new arguments in his book (and arguments in future books, and on blogs). Remember, not only did Loftus have weak-to-bad reasons for adopting his atheism, but had he been born in Saudi Arabia, he likely would have never become an atheist at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I deny I have weak reasons to be an agnostic. That’s the default position. And I deny I have weak reasons to be an atheist once I leave the default position. I claim that when it comes to the truth about these sorts of questions agnosticism is the default position precisely because of these sociological factors. We should all doubt all of our conclusions, and I do. Join me won’t you?&lt;blockquote&gt;He said: The worst case scenario is that Loftus’s argument yields an infinite regress of Outsider Testing. Shouldn’t we do Outsider Tests with respect to the beliefs that led us to take the Outsider Test? And so on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is a red herring. In one sense all tests would fall prey to such an objection. And yet we’re all just mere mortals. Agnosticism is the default position anyway, as I have repeatedly said.&lt;blockquote&gt;He said: Here he’s trying to argue that we should have skepticism about beliefs arrived at through cultural means. As Alvin Plantinga has shown, this sort of thing reduces to attacking the truth of belief, in those cases where the belief system includes beliefs about how the system came about. For example, Christians will often hold that the spirit of God gets much of the credit for their belief. So if Loftus is correct about cultural determinism, then he actually is objecting to the truth of Christian belief. In any case, I’m not sure I can take Loftus seriously when he says he’s just trying to convince Christians to use &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;skepticism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for their further investigations into their beliefs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here he uses the word “skepticism” as if he knows what I mean by it, so which is it? Does he or doesn’t he know what I mean by it? If he doesn’t know then he just doesn’t know, right? And if so he cannot turn around and act like he does. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, even if we grant Plantinga’s argument, the fact remains that all belief systems that excuse themselves from scientific testing are belief systems which include beliefs about how the system came about. So there is no way to decide between them. And they are almost certainly culturally caught in the culture of one’s origin. So I see no reason not to be skeptical about all these kinds of belief systems, and I see no reason why the Christian believer wouldn’t want to be skeptical about his own system of beliefs because of this.&lt;blockquote&gt;He said: But the Christian can just say, “Hi John Loftus. I’ve given arguments for my Christian belief. Therefore I don’t need to apply the Outsider Test to it.” Loftus claims he doesn’t have to test his test, because his test has good grounds for it, despite the indisputable cultural data he keeps talking about, that shows Loftus would not have developed the Outsider Test if he was born on Mars. But the Christian usually thinks she has good ground for her beliefs, despite the indisputable cultural data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Again, these things all point to agnosticism being the default position. Why can’t he understand that? Because he’s trying his best against the arguments to defend what he was raised to believe and he just cannot bring himself to doubt what he was taught. I’m sure every believer in every different culture would say the same thing as he did here, which I dealt with in my book.&lt;blockquote&gt;He said: Lastly Loftus should realize that we need to figure out the best way to investigate religious claims. To me it seems to be that proper methodology will be to put ourselves in situations where we would be likely to perceive religious objects – say, God. For example, it would be silly to write off Islamic belief on the basis of reading a book about it, when Muslims claim to have palpable experiences of God. If we really want to investigate Islam so that we can justifiably say it is groundless, we at least need to include some experiential investigation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Muslims do indeed claim to have done the experimental investigations. And surprise, they have experienced Allah! Maybe he can tell me why the Mormon Church still exists now that DNA evidence has conclusively shown that Native American Indians did not come from the Middle East too? His test comes straight out of William James whose argument only serves to reinforce what one believes. Any believer who approaches his faith as James sought to do would only become more entrenched in what he originally believed.&lt;blockquote&gt;He said, quoting me: &lt;blockquote&gt;Let me put it to you this way, if you read everything that I have read and experienced everything that I have experienced, then you would think on these issues exactly the same way I do. Deny this if you can.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I have an even better suggestion. If I became John Loftus, my beliefs would be those of John Loftus. Deny this if you can!&lt;/blockquote&gt;My point, since he missed it, is that this is the case for every single one of us when it comes to all of our beliefs. I don’t claim we cannot be rational. We can. I only maintain that the human mind is extremely malleable and capable of believing a great many different mutually exclusive things. It is a fact that all of us hold to beliefs which cannot all be true and which contradict other things we accept!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-4546163960270016265?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

You just CAN'T QUIT.  It'd be one thing if you got hooked, got sober, there were some initial bad reactions, and then you were ok.  But drug addiction isn't like that.  Drug addicts relapse, even when they are completely and totally sure they never want to do the drug again, when they know the drug isn't worth it.  They relapse anyway.  And this is one of the biggest problems with trying to treat drug addicts.  Scientists have been working for years to determine what triggers relapse to drug taking behavior, what connections in the brain are involved, and how permanent they are.  Answers so far: a lot of triggers, lots of connections, and pretty long-lasting.

So when Sci saw this paper in PLoS ONE, she got excited:

It&amp;#39;s an idea that&amp;#39;s been rediscovered recently by psychologists interested in well-being and human flourishing. Now the positive psychologists Malte Klar and Tim Kasser have provided some tentative evidence that activists are happier than non-activists. Moreover, they&amp;#39;ve shown that a brief activist task boosted participants&amp;#39; vitality levels compared to a group of controls.Klar and Kasser recruited hundreds of college students and found that those who identified themselves as activists and who said they were planning some activism were happier and more fulfilled than non-activists. A second study made a similar finding with a sample of activists recruited through the website www.campusactivism.org compared with a control group of non-activists matched for gender and education. An exception to this general pattern was that extreme activism, such as that likely to lead to arrest, was not associated with more happiness. Overall, the first two studies suggest that activists are happier than non-activists, but they don&amp;#39;t say anything about whether happiness leads to activism or vice versa. However, Klar and Kasser&amp;#39;s final study suggested tentatively that activism may actually lead to greater happiness.One hundred and twelve student participants were encouraged to write to the college cafeteria director calling on him to source food more locally and ethically. These students subsequently reported feeling more energised and alive than a control group of participants who wrote to the director calling for tastier food and more choice (more global measures of happiness showed no difference between the groups). It&amp;#39;s not simply that the students in the activism condition were more motivated by the task they&amp;#39;d been given - in fact, the students in the control condition said they felt more strongly about the issues they were writing about than did the students in the activism condition.&amp;quot;Activist groups might use these results to help recruit new members from a broader range of people, &amp;quot; the researchers said. &amp;quot;Further, they might be able to find ways to emphasise the psychological benefits of activism to help encourage current activists in their daily struggle for a better society.&amp;quot;_________________________________Klar, M., &amp;amp; Kasser, T.

Crumb’s Bible to be released soon&lt;/a&gt; – A while back, I blogged about subversive Cartoonist R. Crumb’s plans to release his own take on the Bible. Well now it’s about to be released:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I grew to hate the Bible,” he told a press conference for the international launch of “Robert Crumb’s Book of Genesis”, which he called a “gruelling” four year project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea of millions of people taking this so seriously is totally nuts,” he added. “The Bible doesn’t need to be satirised. It’s already so crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I’m looking at you Ted Haggard!). But now they’re extending their disdain for same-sex ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s, liberal hippies that they are, had not long ago announced their re-release of their Chubby Hubby ice cream flavor under the name, Hubby Hubby in honor of gay marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, apparently Coral Ridge Ministries objects to ice cream on ice cream action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/coral-ridge-ministries-vs-ben-jerrys/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/115LDJ99dMA/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always find it hilarious that these nuts make such a big deal about gay marriage but find divorce so acceptable despite the fact that according to the Bible, their god hates divorce infinitely more than two dudes doin’ it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they quote clearly biased sources like “Americans for Truth about Homosexuality” and make up flat-out lies to justify their hypocrisy such as “the health risks of homosexual behavior.” Like what, John Rabe? AIDS? What decade are you living in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ya gotta love this line though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next time you’re tempted to surcome to the temptations of Chunky Monkey or Cherry Garcia, know that part of your money will go to some patently unholy causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mmm, unholy causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll make an extra special trip to Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s tomorrow to get a taste of those delicious, unholy causes. And please take a moment to tell them how much you support Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s evil gay agenda &lt;a href="http://www.benjerry.com/contact-us/comment.cfm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, on a related note, these guys also hate Pepsi for also supporting the evil gay agenda, so show them some love too. After all, be honest. The product tastes so much better knowing how much it pisses off bigoted assholes like this.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the things that's always puzzled me about the anti-vax movement is why people are motivated to rail against something with so much supportive evidence. Sure, there are legions of misinformed parents who think they're helping society by decrying the vaccination conspiracy, and there are certainly those that have experienced personal loss due to the very very rare negative side effects of vaccination. But Chiropractor Dr. Chad Rohlfsen illustrates in abundance what I think might be the primary motive for anti-vaccine rhetoric, and that is pure, simple, banal greed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of his &lt;a href="http://www.vaccine911.com"&gt;vaccine911.com&lt;/a&gt; web site, Dr. Rohlfsen has the phrase "Because the right choice is the well informed choice." And I realize I'm &lt;a title="Godwinning" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law"&gt;Godwinning&lt;/a&gt; this article, but that phrase found on that site calls to mind the words &lt;a title="Arbeit macht frei" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeit_macht_frei"&gt;Arbeit macht frei&lt;/a&gt;, which ironically graced the Nazi concentration camps.

So, here goes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_Neopaganism"&gt;Ásatrú&lt;/a&gt;: I'm not sure how to feel about Ásatrú. I mean, on one hand, it's got to suck to have other people casually citing your gods as the silly mythological ones that no one believes in anymore, but on the other hand, you've got &lt;i&gt;fucking Thor&lt;/i&gt;. Plus, your canon is huge--once you've finished the Edda, you can start working on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_Into_Mystery"&gt;Journey Into Mystery&lt;/a&gt;. Even Catholicism doesn't have regular monthly updates. Or continuity editors, for that matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baha%27i"&gt;Baha'i&lt;/a&gt;: I've read about Baha'i half a dozen times, but any information about them just kind of slides off my brain. I'm pretty sure their schtick has to do with letting the dogs out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;: I realized today that I'd really like to do a comedy version of the Jesus story. Not "The Life of Brian," but an actual, accurate adaptation of the gospel stories (inasmuch as you can call any mash-up of those four contradictory stories "accurate") done in a wacky slapstick style. It occurred to me while reading &lt;i&gt;Jesus, Interrupted&lt;/i&gt; that Jesus gets run out of town and stoned quite a few times. I can just imagine the scenes of Jesus and his crew running with huge crowds of angry Jews chasing them with stones and stuff, while Ciaphas (or someone) shouts "JEEEESUUUUS!" in a Mr. Slate/Dean Wormer style. The more I think about it, the better I think it would be. I just need to figure out how to funny up the downer ending. Much as I'd like to, I can't steal this idea:&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/4GjNSUatTc4%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism"&gt;Deism&lt;/a&gt;: Deism is kind of like the bathtub drain of religious belief; it's almost totally empty, and so many things seem to end up sucked down it. Every major argument for the existence of gods ends up getting as far as Deism and no farther; people who aren't quite ready to give up religious belief altogether seem to get caught in it like clumps of hair, Antony Flew fell in from the other side of the tub, much though Christians would like to claim that he made it across the Deistic divide; and American government has spent so much time caught in the gutter that it's started using it for ceremonial purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess what I'm trying to say is "Deism sucks."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellinais"&gt;Ellinais&lt;/a&gt;: All the lameness of Ásatrú, but without the awesomeness of Thor. Sure, Hercules and Zeus are cool and all, but there's so many also-rans--the Legion of Substitute Olympians like Iris and Eris and Nike and such. I don't know, I just can't imagine Odin turning into a golden shower to impregnate someone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and as long as I've mentioned Eris, I might as well mention &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordian"&gt;Discordianism&lt;/a&gt;. Either it's a parody religion with its collective head up its own ass, or it's a real religion based around trying way too hard to be funny. I can't tell the difference, and I'm convinced that its followers can't either, and most of them are just playing along so they don't look like they don't get the joke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethinkers"&gt;Freethinkers&lt;/a&gt;: When people accuse atheists of being smug and superior, this is the kind of stupid bullshit they're talking about. "Freethinker" is even worse than "Bright" in this regard; it's effectively calling everyone else a slave-thinker or restricted-thinker. Any organization with cute derogatory terms for everyone in the outgroup has its head way too far up its own ass. Can we please resign this elitist term to the dustbin of history? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism"&gt;Gnosticism&lt;/a&gt;: Hey, look, an entire religious movement based around being super-special elites who know secret things that make them better than you. It's the religion equivalent of high schoolers with an in-joke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_krishna"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt;: A religion known mainly for hanging out in airports, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (which sounds more like an organization that James Bond would fight against) peaked with a mention in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Sweet_Lord"&gt;George Harrison song&lt;/a&gt; and had officially jumped the shark by the time they started &lt;a href="http://krishna.org/man-on-the-moon-a-colossal-hoax-that-cost-billions-of-dollars/"&gt;denying the moon landings&lt;/a&gt; on religious grounds. Yeah, let's teach &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; controversy. Bald assholes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism"&gt;Humanism&lt;/a&gt;: You know, there's not a lot I disagree with when it comes to Secular Humanism, but something about the tradition kind of squicks me out. I think it's the adherence to a specific set of ethics, or something. I guess I'm technically a Humanist, but it's not a term I really use. So, yeah, Humanists...stop being so squicky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;: I thought about just putting a crude cartoon of Mohammed here, but then a new thought occurred to me. See, like my "Laugh-In of the Christ" above, I think the life of Mohammed would make a fun movie. See, the Hadith has this bit about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buraq"&gt;Mohammed flying up to heaven on a magic donkey&lt;/a&gt; that my brain connected to the end of "Grease," where Danny and Sandy fly into the sky in their car, and I thought "it'd be awesome to do the story of Mohammed like 'Grease'!" See, you start it with "Allah (is the Word)," then there's "Sunni Nights," "Look at Me, I'm &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisha"&gt;Aisha B.&lt;/a&gt;," and "Madrasah Dropout." By the end, Mohammed will be all clean-cut and wearing a sweater, and Aisha will be sewn into her leather burqa. I know she's only supposed to be six years old, but given Hollywood's proclivity toward casting older people as younger people, I suspect that we might get an actual teenager in the role. I recommend Miley Cyrus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"&gt;Jainism&lt;/a&gt;: You know, if the Jains were serious about their commitment to not killing any living things, they'd all take medication to inhibit their immune systems. You guys are so careful that you sweep bugs out of the sidewalk in front of you and avoid root vegetables since they kill living plants, but what about all those living bacteria that your body's killing all the time? Bunch of hypocrites. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemetism"&gt;Kemetism&lt;/a&gt;: Why resurrect Egyptian mythology as a religion if you're not going to mummify the dead and build pyramids? Neopagans ruin &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism"&gt;Libertarianism&lt;/a&gt;: Because substituting "the market" for "God" is &lt;i&gt;still a religion&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism"&gt;Mormons&lt;/a&gt;: Mormonism is religion as done by fanfic.com. It's a mishmash of Christianity, 19th Century science fiction, Masonic ritual, American patriotism, wish fulfillment, and really awful pseudohistory. "So, this guy discovered some magic stones, which may or may not have been in a breastplate of some sort, then used them to translate a book of golden plates (though the book wasn't in the room at the time), written in 'reformed Egyptian' by Indians who were actually Jews who sailed across the ocean to America, where Jesus went on walkabout once. Apparently, there's no such place as Hell (but somehow there's still a devil), so everyone gets into Heaven, but some people get better rooms, and if you're really good and wear your magic underpants and never drink coffee, you get to be the god of your own planet when you die! Oh, and God is from another planet, which orbits a star called Kolob, and there are Puritans living on the moon! And black people will turn white if they start behaving, and God and Jesus had bunches of wives, but we don't talk about those things anymore." Joseph Smith was fucking &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_Man"&gt;Harold Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and I wouldn't be surprised if it started as a drunken bet that just got out of hand. In fact, I would be &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; surprised if it &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;/i&gt; start as a drunken bet that got out of hand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/tinewage.html"&gt;Newage&lt;/a&gt;: Ah, newage, less a religion, more a smorgasbord of stupidity. There is no dumb idea that newage hasn't adopted, embraced, and woefully misunderstood. If Deism is a shower drain, then newage is the trap pipe underneath that collects all the gunk and detritus that gets past the screen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29"&gt;Objectivism&lt;/a&gt;: What kind of cult of personality outlives their personality? One with the personality of a petulant junior high student, I guess. It's a shame that Ayn Rand and L. Ron Hubbard are both dead; I'd really like to see a definitive decision on which cult leader was the bigger hack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism"&gt;Pantheism&lt;/a&gt;: Pantheism saw Deism's non-interventionist, impersonal prime mover god, and said "that god's not useless and superfluous enough! I can do better." And by George, they did at that. Way to set the bar high, Pantheists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakerism"&gt;Quakerism&lt;/a&gt;: The graph of Quaker popularity drops off significantly after the end of the 18th century, and has a short, sharp resurgence in 2003 or so, when everybody took the &lt;a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Entertainment/Quizzes/BeliefOMatic.aspx"&gt;Belief-O-Matic Quiz&lt;/a&gt; and found out they were "Liberal Quakers." In between, it's all oatmeal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari_movement"&gt;Rastafarianism&lt;/a&gt;: I think if you actually did the demographics, Rastafarianism comprises equally Jamaicans and pretentious college stoners who want to give up shampoo. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism"&gt;Satanism&lt;/a&gt;: I don't know what's worse: that Christians repeatedly get panicked over an effectively nonexistent religion, or that they get panicked over an effectively nonexistent religion that they think is made up of Dungeons and Dragons players and KISS fans. Never has there been a sweatier, hairier nonexistent religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism"&gt;Taoism&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/187"&gt;'Nuff said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Universalism"&gt;Unitarian Universalism&lt;/a&gt;: All the uselessness of Deism with all the boredom of church! UU is the best argument for good atheist meetup groups. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Vodou"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;: The only group who has contributed more easy plot devices to horror movies than the gypsies. It's almost a shame that no one knows anything accurate about them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca"&gt;Wicca&lt;/a&gt;: A fifty-year-old ancient religion made entirely out of pale skin, fishnet sleeves, awkward body fat, pretentious teenagers, and lesbians. No religious tradition in history has ever needed a harder smack with the cluestick. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-files"&gt;X-Files&lt;/a&gt;: I know it's not a religion, I'm just using it as a handy term for all the conspiracy theorists out there who aren't adequately covered by the rest of the list. The X-Files was basically "Left Behind" for the Coast to Coast AM crowd. Which explains why the show ended up being totally incoherent, ridiculous, empty, and raising far more questions than it was poised to answer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt;: As I understand, this religion gives you the ability to stretch across the screen and breathe fire. And according to the manual, it supposedly allows you to teleport, but that's, like, 12th-level Yoga or something. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism"&gt;Zoroastrianism&lt;/a&gt;: Spanish for "the foxastrianism." Extant since somewhere around 600 BCE, it's like the little religion that could...worship &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda"&gt;a god&lt;/a&gt; who answers phones on the Enterprise and drives a Japanese car. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone else: chances are, you're too lame or tiny to merit notice. I mean, come on, I picked Kemetism over you? Yeah, sucks to be you. With the exception of Scientology (aka Mormonism with a higher page count): it's okay, Scientology, someday you'll catch Nicholas Cage for killing John Travolta's kid. In the meantime, enjoy being 4chan's bitch. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that's the end of it. Happy Blasphemy Day, everyone!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-1010368457028173416?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254286739154"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8dc893410cb9b900</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Norman Thomas on Socialism</title><published>2009-09-30T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/socialism.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Did Norman Thomas once say that America would eventually unknowingly adopt socialism "under the name of 'liberalism'"?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254286042171"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1940">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/77b76d144d440bf8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Cold Flusion?</title><published>2009-09-30T04:30:16Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T04:30:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1940" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a quick entry to allow me to have a little spleen venting.  And I am cross posting this over at &lt;a href="http://boards.medscape.com/forums?128@513.Jf4GamRDelU@.29f681d4!comment=1"&gt;Medscape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background for you youngsters.  In 1989 two electrochemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, announced they had successfully developed cold fusion: nuclear fusion at room temperature.  Pons was chairman of the chemistry department at the University of Utah at the time and lent a fair amount of respectability to the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great deal of brouhaha followed, but in the end “is heard no more: it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.” Cold fusion was and is a bust, although millions were spent in pursuit of that pot of gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to this week.  Here is the data upon which important public health decisions are being made, in its entirety:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/limit+seasonal+vaccines/2043121/story.html"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“new Canadian study — which has not yet been peer reviewed or published —that found those who receive the seasonal flu vaccine become two times more likely to get H1N1.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all I can find as of 8:15 on 9/29/9.  Interesting but we do not have the data, the methodology, confirmatory data from similar or other populations.  Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some biologic plausibility for this effect. The flu vaccine or infection can increase the uptake of unrelated influenza strains into cells that have an Fc receptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe its true. I don’t know.  No one knows. Yet.  It is almost, but not quite, an unsubstantiated rumor, and it is not known if it is clinically relevant. Hardly the information upon which you would want to use to make sweeping public health decisions that could affect the health of millions.  Unless, of course, you are Canadian. Evidently  Canadians have decided to stop vaccination with seasonal flu as a result of that information. That’s it.  And that makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You  already have a population of people who already have had either the vaccine or influenza year after year after year after year.  So everyone should already be at risk from this phenomena, if clinically relevant, from either having had influenza or the vaccine. They should already have the evil antibody, either from disease or vaccine.  Please note.  No one had received THIS years seasonal flu vaccine before the H1N1 hit. Its PRIOR years vaccines that may have lead to this phenomena. Stopping this years vaccination should be too little too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that should happen by discontinuing the vaccination this year is denying protection from the seasonal flu but not preventing slight increased risk for H1N1. Instead people should go on to get seasonal flu, have an increased risk of dying as a result, and in the end have ‘natural’ antibody from disease that should increase the risk for H1N1 anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless I am missing something (and I often am), it would appear stopping seasonal flu vaccination is a decision that should have no upside in preventing H1N1 but should increase morbidity and mortality from seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just does not seem rational to stop the vaccination program on so little information and with the knowledge that if the effect is real, it is from prior years vaccinations.  The horse is out of the barn. All that should happen is increase the risk of seasonal flu and death without decreasing the risk of H1N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the end what I bet will happen is rather than getting two vaccines late, Canadians will get no vaccines at all and flu will cut loose in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is assuming that this study is the real deal and will be reproduced and is clinically relevant.  Or it all may be cold flusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been perseverating on this since I posted it last night.  It occurs to me that the phenomena, if real and due to antibody, should not be one way.  If prior exposure to the seasonal flu or the vaccine increases risk for H1N1, then H1N1 vaccine or disease should increase risk for seasonal flu.  That leads to the following possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) You have had flu or the vaccine in the past. You have the increased risk already.  There is no data that the current vaccine will increase the preexisting risk and all you will do is be at risk for seasonal flu when it hits.  Might as well get the vaccine for seasonal then get H1N1 vaccine when available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) You have never had the vaccine or the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You avoid all vaccines. But you do not avoid the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a)You get seasonal flu, then increase your risk for H1N1, and then you develop H1N1. So you get flu twice in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) You get H1N1, then increase your risk for seasonal flu, and then you develop seasonal flu. So you get flu twice in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By avoiding the vaccine, you increase the risk of getting disease twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you get the seasonal vaccine, you decrease the risk of seasonal influenza, but either way you slightly increase you risk for H1N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) You avoid the vaccines and get lucky and avoid seasonal flu and H1N1. For this season.  One day you will get flu unless you are a full time lighthouse keeper. Then you are there with the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some clever person can run the numbers and calculate the relative risk of seasonal and H1N1 flu with each behavior. As best I can tell, the best bet is to get vaccinated, it is the best way to decrease you risk for getting ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=======&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Infect Dis. 1994 Jan;169(1):200-3. Primary influenza A virus infection induces cross-reactive antibodies that enhance uptake of virus into Fc receptor-bearing cells. Gotoff R, Tamura M, Janus J, Thompson J, Wright P, Ennis FA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sera of young children who had had a primary infection with influenza A virus or were immunized with a live attenuated influenza A virus vaccine were examined for antibody responses that neutralized virus or enhanced uptake of virus into Fc receptor-bearing cells, because antibodies that enhance uptake of influenza virus into Fc receptor-bearing cells have been reported using mouse immune serum and monoclonal antibodies. The neutralizing antibody titers to the homologous infecting virus and to another H1N1 virus isolated several years later were higher after natural infection than after infection with the live attenuated virus. Natural infection and the attenuated vaccine induced antibodies that enhanced uptake of homologous virus and H1N1 virus isolated several years later. These results demonstrate that primary influenza A virus infection results in the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I’ve noticed, even as a child is that being in rebellion to God seemed to make a person stupid or foolish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool, so I’m a foolish rebel for going against Santa Claus and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot"&gt;Russell’s Teapot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even today I witness intelligent people doing things that are so obviously going to turn out badly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s called “being human.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they do them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first began interacting with those who live according to the atheist faith,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is bald a hair color?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;which is by definition in rebellion to Creator God,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, saying the magical teapot doesn’t exist is to rebel against the teapot? I thought it was just coming to the conclusion said teapot didn’t exist because of a lack of evidence for the magical teapot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;they struck me as dull of mind and slow of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool, you think we’re dull and dumb, I like being underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, because atheists, on average, are no more or no less “sinful” than anyone else, I began to wonder if it was simply one’s alienation from God and not sin itself that causes smart people to do and think in a really stunted manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, so those preachers that steal from their churches, the pastors that are meth-addicted closet homosexuals while at the same time telling homosexuals they will burn in hell are “alienated” from God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me give you an example that has been touched on in recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawkins, Harris, Dennett and Hitchens.&lt;br&gt;
Every single one of them is an intelligent person.&lt;br&gt;
Every single one of them is an educated person.&lt;br&gt;
Every single one of them has asked the kindergarten level question,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, what question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Who / What created God?” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a very basic question, where did this entity come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most, if not all atheists have also asked this question. Why? Well, there’s a lot of reasons but one of them is a quirky trait that seems to be shared by all atheists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, honestly, we’re supposed to believe a supernatural entity has always existed outside of space and time, started the ENTIRE universe, and gives two flying fucks about life on this little speck of rock? Where did such an entity come from? Are there more like this entity? Are they the &lt;a href="http://media.www.collegian.com/media/storage/paper864/news/2009/09/28/News/Former.Csu.Professor.Speaks.At.Extraterrestrial.Convention.In.Denver-3785383.shtml"&gt;Reptile Men&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atheists seem to be, to an extreme very literal, black and white, rigid and repetitive, linear thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have evidence for this? I can tell you for certain that while most aspects of biology are very graded, some aspects of physics (particle spin, for example) is very polarized. In any event, where are you going with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Matthew says that an angel talked to Mary at the tomb of Jesus, and John says the angel spoke in the presence of women, atheists cannot see any other possibility than it must be a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…there is no contradiction in that statement; contradictions do exist, but that isn’t one I would point out. The problem is that Matthew (28:2) says they were OUTSIDE the tomb while Mark (16:5), Luke (24:3-4), and John (20:11-12) state it was INSIDE the tomb. That is a contradiction; unless of course a violation of space was going on. You know, being magic and all. Funny how that didn’t destroy all the atoms in the bodies of those poor little humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They really can’t do it. Now, some of them are just too stupid to be able to see more than one possibility yet many are at least intelligent enough to have graduated high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would never make such a claim. You bitch and moan when we use any name-calling in generalities, isn’t there a “golden rule” you like to trumpet about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the ability to comprehend the nature of anything that can’t be seen or touched is simply beyond the average atheist. Take for instance these scientific facts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, here we go again…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Everything that begins to exist has a cause / explanation for its beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, many different types of causes are possible, that doesn’t mean they all exist. Many explanations are possible, that doesn’t mean they are all true. You need evidence to substantiate a claim that your specific cause is the true cause…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The universe had a beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already established as a “not exactly” answer…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Therefore the beginning of the universe had a cause and an explanation for its beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of, there is an explanation, but not for the “beginning” nor a “cause.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until they recognised the metaphysical implications of a universe with a beginning, atheists could allow themselves to agree with Hume, “I’ve never asserted anything so ridiculous as to suggest that something could begin to exist without a cause.” That was the old and somewhat more intelligent atheist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, that’s not what any physicist is saying. They are postulating causes based upon known conditions. The problem with the models is that time ceases to exist during the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_epoch"&gt;Planck Epoch&lt;/a&gt;. It is an unknown. This does not mean your cause is correct. You have no evidence substantiating this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realising the spot in which this puts them, modern atheists, the so called New Atheists are actually willing to say with a straight face that something probably CAN just pop into existence without a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle"&gt;Virtual particles&lt;/a&gt; do exist… Matter CAN just “pop into existence without a cause.” Not only CAN it, but it DOES. It has been OBSERVED. Neat, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the New Atheists even tells his devotees, that Nothing “evolved” into, well, everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straw man of evolution, much? A randomly assembled simple self-replicating molecule is all that is needed to account for life on this planet. What this chemical was is subject to debate, but we have some really&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"&gt; good models&lt;/a&gt; (which make predictions) such as the RNA World, Iron-Sulfur World, etc. Look, seriously, Wikipedia is a good starting point. It is by no means an end, but it makes for good background reading before delving into more weighty books on the subject. Start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one reaches that level of internal confusion, it’s not a great leap to see how an intelligent person can allow h/herself to ask, “Well, if God made the universe, who made God?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this entity come from? You’re evoking a magical terminator to an infinite regress. Rather than understand that there is no regress. “universe happens”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, atheists have no problem with saying that something is infinite, or that it has always existed,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct, but that’s based upon mathematics and evidence indicating that something (in this case, the fabric of space itself) is infinite in terms of the “four” dimensions we are familiar with. Time actually seems to be just something clocks measure, but that’s a whole other issue entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;or that it’s eternal, as long as that something isn’t Creator God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any evidence for this? It’s a jump in logic; “we don’t know, so God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if God exists, then He exists outside of and prior to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the universe? That’s nonsensical; time didn’t exist before mass or energy because all three rely upon each other to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;God is not material. He is Spirit. He does not need a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(read: “He’s magical”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has always been. He is infinite. He is eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(read: “I’m just making this shit up as I go, and since I have no evidence for this, this deity MUST be infinite in all aspects)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking, “What caused an infinite or eternal Being to begin?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better question; how do you know this supposed being even DOES exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;or, “When did an eternal being begin to exist?” is illogical and incoherent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know this entity exists, and if you can prove this, how do you know this entity is eternal? Any evidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illogical statements are something that atheists &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; take great pains to avoid, except when they’re confronted with the reality of Creator God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I seem to be avoiding it? Nope, I’m reading it, thinking about it, and butchering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, it seems, all bets are off. The fact remains, and it remains a fact that is based on what science tells us is true,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;that everything that begins to exist, including the universe, had its cause from something outside of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already explained why this is a nonsensical argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no known exceptions to this observed and consistently verified rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, virtual particles…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the origins of our universe, we must choose between Matter as infinite and Creator God who is Spirit,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little red “False Dichotomy” flag should be blowing in the hot air right about now…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;as infinite and eternal (existing outside of time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because without the straw man of “infinite matter,” your “created universe” argument just seems silly. How about this: matter existed as long as time has, but since time and matter and energy and thus the way we think causality seems to flow no longer existed in the Planck Epoch, it’s a completely silly question. Read up about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality#As_physics"&gt;physical retrocausality&lt;/a&gt;, that shit will blow your linear-thinking mind. Oh, wait, my mind was the linear one, I forgot, seems I went off on a tangent rather than follow your circle, you’ll find I tend to do that a lot with circular logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason states that it must be One and not the other for matter cannot pre-exist itself either physically or chronologically,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, retrocausality, virtual particles, radioactive decay, gravity, need I go on with these “chronological” events that are so often violated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;nor can matter bring itself into existence or create itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool, you know more about retrocausality that Feynman, Hawking, Wheeler, etc. Good to know next time I have a question about Minkowski Space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it is impossible for Matter to be infinite or to exist from eternity past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, atheists used to agree that there cannot be an infinite regress of cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, there is no infinite regress of causation because causation ceases to be a factor…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confronted with the reality of the nature of matter, modern atheists, supposedly intelligent atheist insist that Creator God, who is Spirit, must also adhere to the law of first cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, personally, I think this is a ridiculous argument. If you’re going to make the argument that the universe needs a cause (which I see no reason for it to have a cause since causality could not have existed without matter and energy) then you propose the infinite regress terminator. Without your notion of a deity, no infinite regress exists because of the lack of causality without matter or energy or time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it is so elementary it’s difficult to understand how these individuals cannot grasp that physical laws do not apply to Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirits exist too, it would seem; evidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since God is by definition outside the universe,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds familiar…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is not part of any series,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, within the Planck Epoch, he/she/it could NOT have caused anything because causality would not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;be it regressing or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t regress without you invoking causality without causality being possible… You are implying causality is similarly outside of space-time and thus we can say “where did God come from.” That’s the problem with your terminator; it OPENS the can of worms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that the rules of the series, including the rules of causation will not and cannot apply to Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they would; if causality applies to the origin of the universe (when causality would not exist) then causality must be outside of space-time. Causality would then apply to your deity of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Matter is eternal – or&lt;br&gt;
Creator God is eternal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; If Matter isn’t eternal then Matter is able to bring itself into existence – or&lt;br&gt;
Creator God brings matter into existence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False Dichotomy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q:”either matter is eternal or it isn’t” A: “it isn’t”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q:”how can some entity cause a something to exist without the causality being applicable to said entity?” (for this, I have no answer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; Matter, against impossible odds, accidentally or purposely produces life – or&lt;br&gt;
Creator God purposely produces life from Matter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither; matter, under certain conditions, can (inefficiently) self-replicate, this inefficient self replication results in diversification and differential “survival” given limited resources resulting in a selective pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; Matter arranges and designs itself exquisitely and intricately – or&lt;br&gt;
Creator God arranges and designs Matter exquisitely and intricately&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalytic_set"&gt;Autocatalysis&lt;/a&gt;. Also, see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_poor_design"&gt;Unintelligent Design.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) Matter produces a life of meaning and context and purpose – NOT! – or&lt;br&gt;
Creator God produces a life of meaning and context and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purpose? Meaning? You mean you are given meaning and purpose, what is it? Is it universal? I consider my purpose in life is to explore the world around me and use what I learn to help as many people as possible to live healthier, happier, more intellectually satisfied lives. What’s your purpose again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern atheists will tell you that since the first supposition is impossible and the second is unpalatable, “Nothing caused the universe to come into being. It just happened an we need not consider it further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is precisely NOT what atheists are saying. We are saying to explore the universe, probe the puzzling questions. How does matter behave on the Planck timescale? What is the minimum requirement for “living organisms” and where else might they be found? What is the nature of time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What question does your model raise? Oh, right “God did it, so we need not consider it further”–I have a question, are you looking in a mirror and thinking of yourself as this mysterious atheist whom you base your strawman upon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So vast, without any question, is the divine handiwork of the Almighty Creator.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, Copernicus, yes, because he truly understood how big the universe was… Also, it’s possible he was sucking up to those in power, let us not forget what happened to Galileo Galilei when he supported Copernicus’ ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may recall, the Irish government &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/10/irish-blasphemy-law-passes/"&gt;recently passed a law&lt;/a&gt; making it a crime to blaspheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is AI doing in response?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Atheist Ireland is seeking your help today to launch and shape a new long-term campaign with two important aims: to repeal the new Irish blasphemy law and to attain a secular Irish Constitution. Specifically, we are asking you to do three things: send us a message of support, get actively involved in shaping this project, and lobby to persuade Irish politicians to pursue these policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will soon be holding public meetings around Ireland to launch this campaign. We want it to include religious and nonreligious people working together, within Ireland and with international support. The campaign has one common aim that transcends any other differences we may have: that all Irish citizens, of all beliefs and none, can live together in equality, with the State being neutral on matters of religion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in learning about how you can help, &lt;a href="http://blasphemy.ie/2009/09/30/campaign-for-a-secular-irish-constitution/"&gt;check out their website&lt;/a&gt;.  If you live in Ireland, I’ll glare at you unless you volunteer to help overturn this travesty of a law.  (Yep.  You’re trembling in your boots.  I know it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where you live, &lt;a href="http://blasphemy.ie/2009/09/30/campaign-for-a-secular-irish-constitution/"&gt;send Atheist Ireland your vote of support&lt;/a&gt;.  Let them know you appreciate the work they’ve done and the work they’re about to embark upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only had an introduction and conclusions, so I used my conclusion period as a rebuttal.  It’s usually my favorite part of debates, and I wasn’t going to miss it.  Mine went (from memory):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m glad that Councilmember Thomas at least tried to address my arguments, but I was disappointed by the weak response.  Notice what he did: he said that he knows there is no religious pressure on children because he’s been to Saint Andrews and there wasn’t a problem.  He’s singling out one school, but how can he say that there’s no problem in the other schools?  If there were no pressure at all, why are 8% of students leaving the program citing uncomfortable religious pressure as their reason?  That even ignores the students who experience pressure but don’t leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Councilmember Thomas rightly said that education is an essential part of our democracy.  So is the Constitution.  Councilmember Thomas said that we shouldn’t throw the baby out with the bathwater.  I say we shouldn’t throw out the Constitution.  I’ll close with a quote from Justice Souter’s dissent in Zelman [who also quotes Agostini v Felton]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there were an excuse for giving short shrift to the Establishment Clause, it would probably apply here. But there is no excuse. Constitutional limitations are placed on government to preserve constitutional values in hard cases, like these. ‘[C]onstitutional lines have to be drawn, and on one side of every one of them is an otherwise sympathetic case that provokes impatience with the Constitution and with the line. But constitutional lines are the price of constitutional government.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll really miss Justice Souter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a blast, and tomorrow I’ll try to post the full argument I made.&lt;/p&gt;

(Update 3)</title><published>2009-09-29T20:51:58Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T20:51:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/648" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Statistically speaking, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8279855.stm"&gt;the story that broke last night&lt;/a&gt; was tediously inevitable. 1.4 million doses of the Cervarix vaccine have been administered to teenage girls since the program began, and eventually - whether by chance or adverse reaction - one person was bound to die. Yesterday, for whatever reason, that teenage girl was Natalie Morton, and my sympathies go out to her kith and kin. Her death, and the manner of its reporting, will affect public health in ways she'll never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two possibilities here, reaction or coincidence. As a species we're fairly poor at dealing with probability, and events like this seems far less likely to us than they actually are. The raw facts of the matter are that: &lt;b&gt;a)&lt;/b&gt; most teenage girls around Natalie's age will be vaccinated in 2009, and &lt;b&gt;b)&lt;/b&gt; a number of teenage girls die every year of initially unexplained causes. The chances of a one of those girls dying on the same day she got her vaccine could be as high as one in a few dozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand it could be an a adverse reaction to the vaccine. The chances of this are also fairly small, but there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about these risks, largely coming from a misunderstanding of vaccine reaction incidence reports. For example, The Daily Mail make the mistake of suggesting that the Cervarix vaccine &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1216714/Schoolgirl-14-dies-given-cervical-cancer-jab.html"&gt;has been linked to thirty deaths&lt;/a&gt;. Of course it hasn't; the mistake they've made is to use the database of &lt;a href="http://vaers.hhs.gov/"&gt;Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System &lt;/a&gt; with the mistaken belief that the data shows confirmed vaccine reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact the VAERS simply records people's self-reported ill health occuring around the time of vaccination on the off-chance it might be related. More accurate estimates of risk by the MRHA estimate the risk of severe reactions at around one in a million. To put that into context, about 2% of the population &lt;a href="http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/p/penicillin_allergy/stats-country.htm"&gt;have reactions to penicillin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mail &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1216714/Schoolgirl-14-dies-given-cervical-cancer-jab.html"&gt;also report that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the tragedy highlights the risks of mass vaccination because no testing regime can detect the rarest and potentially most lethal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These critics appear to be JABS, who were quoted prominently in earlier editions of the Mail's online article, and in their print edition today. I'll move on to that coverage in a moment, but first it's worth pointing out that since he vaccine is likely to save around 700 lives a year, any theoretical, extremely rare side-effects would be comprehensively outweighed by the benefits. It's a self-defeating argument to make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response of mainstream media organs has ranged from reasonable (&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8279855.stm"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;) to dire (the Daily Mail print edfition); and &lt;a href="http://www.malcolmcoles.co.uk/blog/cervical-cancer-jab-irresponsible-coverage/"&gt;Malcolm Cole has done an excellent review of the coverage on his own blog&lt;/a&gt;, with scores for the various papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian have done an excellent job allaying fears, bringing in a doctor to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;explain a number of facts&lt;/a&gt; about the vaccine and the risks involved, but compromised that work with this &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/sep/29/cervical-cancer-vaccine-hpv"&gt;bizarre little piece that looks like it was knocked up in a tea break&lt;/a&gt;. But as usual the Mail and Express lead the way in irresponsible scare-mongering. Take for example the following headline, kindly sent to me by the &lt;a href="http://www.dailyquail.org/"&gt;Daily Quail&lt;/a&gt; (click to enlarge to read the whole article). Some journalists consult doctors, the Mail speak to JABS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/files/mailjab.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/mailjabs.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll be interesting to see if they dare print anything &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/507"&gt;similar in their Irish Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mail article is horrendously biased towards sensationalism, and the The Daily Quail &lt;a href="http://www.dailyquail.org/2009/09/hpv-mails-new-mmr.html"&gt;have covered it well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A statement from the Director of public health for NHS Coventry, saying 'No link can be made between the death and the vaccine until all the facts are known' was relegated to the last line of the report, while no mention was made of how many cases of cervical cancer might be prevented by the vaccination or how many womens' lives saved each year, or any research indicating that the vaccination is in fact safe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, it was noted that 'more than 2,000 have suffered side-effects ranging from rashes to paralysis', and that 'some critics argue [the vaccine] will encourage promiscuity'." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side effects are of course triflingly minor; while the suggestion that the vaccine promotes promiscuity is completely baseless in fact, a moral authoritarian fantasy idea for which no supporting evidence has been advanced. Taken together with the shocking exclusions of any sort of balancing information about the benefits of the vaccine, and the way in which the article leads the reader towards conclusions about tainted vaccines, and what we have is an incredibly irresponsible and potentially dangerous piece of reporting that will affect uptake of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; vacccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science Minister Lord Drayson recently took on Ben Goldacre in a debate at the Royal Institute. I was there, and he claimed repeatedly that newspapers and media outlets had learned the lessons of MMR; that in 2009 similar failures in science reporting wouldn't happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, they haven't. And if this sort of sensationalist, unbalanced and misguided reporting of distorted facts and cherry-picked evidence continues, vaccination rates will fall again, and diseases which have no business still existing in the 21st century will continue to plague us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 1:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
News has just come in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/29/cervical-cancer-hpv-girl-death"&gt;via The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting the vaccine did not cause Morton's death. I may blog more on this later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A 14-year-old girl who died shortly after receiving a vaccine against cervical cancer had a &lt;b&gt;'serious underlying medical condition'&lt;/b&gt;, a preliminary postmortem examination has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although local health authorities stressed that further tests needed to be carried out to establish how Natalie Morton died, they said &lt;b&gt;the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was 'most unlikely' to have been the cause of her" death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 2:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Daily Mail have now &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1216942/Cervical-cancer-vaccine-programme-chaos-death-schoolgirl-14-hours-jab.html"&gt;begrudgingly admitted the above&lt;/a&gt;, but only as a single line in the &lt;i&gt;fourth&lt;/i&gt; paragraph. There is no reference to it in the headline or leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NHS Coventry revealed tonight that had she had a 'serious underlying medical condition' and said the vaccination was 'most unlikely' to have caused her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But the city's primary care trust has nevertheless halted vaccinations for two days while an investigation into Natalie's death is carried out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And below that, they still say that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not yet known whether Natalie had an extreme - and very rare - reaction to a standard vaccine, or whether the particular dose she was given was from a rogue contaminated batch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 3:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you thought that the Mail's coverage was bad, The Express have taken things to an &lt;a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/130908"&gt;unbelievable level&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARENTS’ REVOLT AFTER GIRL DIES IN CANCER JAB HORROR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer stupidity of the journalists involved with that criminally misleading headline is matched only by the reactions in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE GOVERNMENT MAKES OUR GIRLS INTO PROSTITUTES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of government policy is that all girls in every school should be readily available for sex at any time with anyone - in other words they want to make our daughters into prostitutes. Prostitutes have to have various medical treatments to keep them ready for the men - so our government administers this jab to every girl in the country except for those at independent schools, of course. This jab is against a sexually transmitted disease and shows the total failure of the government's sex policy: anything is all right as long as you use a condom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Times &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/business/media/30adco.html"&gt;has coverage&lt;/a&gt; and the full report (&lt;i&gt;Americans Reject Tailored Advertising and Three Activities that Enable It&lt;/i&gt; is available &lt;a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1478214"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Here's a summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This nationally representative telephone (wireline and cell phone) survey explores Americans' opinions about behavioral targeting by marketers, a controversial issue currently before government policymakers. Behavioral targeting involves two types of activities: following users' actions and then tailoring advertisements for the users based on those actions. While privacy advocates have lambasted behavioral targeting for tracking and labeling people in ways they do not know or understand, marketers have defended the practice by insisting it gives Americans what they want: advertisements and other forms of content that are as relevant to their lives as possible.

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what many marketers claim, most adult Americans (66%) do not want marketers to tailor advertisements to their interests. Moreover, when Americans are informed of three common ways that marketers gather data about people in order to tailor ads, even higher percentages-- between 73% and 86%--say they would not want such advertising.  Even among young adults, whom advertisers often portray as caring little about information privacy, more than half (55%) of 18-24 year-olds do not want tailored advertising. And contrary to consistent assertions of marketers, young adults have as strong an aversion to being followed across websites and offline (for example, in stores) as do older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This survey finds that Americans want openness with marketers. If marketers want to continue to use various forms of behavioral targeting in their interactions with Americans, they must work with policymakers to open up the process so that individuals can learn exactly how their information is being collected and used, and then exercise control over their data.  We offer specific proposals in this direction.  An overarching one is for marketers to implement a regime of information respect toward the public rather than to treat them as objects from which they can take information in order to optimally persuade them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/09/americans_on_tailored_advertis.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/02sRfrIOQXY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254275174460"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=1128">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a26752c71213f548</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Me, nice, really?</title><published>2009-09-30T01:18:42Z</published><updated>2009-09-30T01:18:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/me-nice-really/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to introduce my readers to something I rarely have the opportunity to do: introduce a theist with whom I mostly agree with on non-theological issues (science and politics come to mind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go read, it’s mostly political, but he does have some &lt;a href="http://lawfulgoodwonk.blogspot.com/search/label/religion"&gt;religion/science&lt;/a&gt; oriented stuff and seems honestly inquisitive about science. People such as him make remind me why I stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could say Christians can’t argue because of your [Makarios] apparent inability to understand basic logic. I would never do such a thing since Christians CAN be very intelligent and think critically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But there are a lot more good quotes about time than chapters in the book.  Here are some of the quotes I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; end up using.  Further examples are hereby solicited — who knows when they might turn out to be useful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything happens to everybody sooner or later if there is time enough.” — George Bernard Shaw, &lt;em&gt;Back to Methuselah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time is the longest distance between two places.”  — Tennessee Williams, &lt;em&gt;The Glass Menagerie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The future’s not ours to see.” — Doris Day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time rushes toward us with its hospital tray of infinitely varied narcotics, even while it is preparing us for its inevitably fatal operation.” — Tennessee Williams, &lt;em&gt;The Rose Tattoo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time, you old gypsy man,&lt;br&gt;
Will you not stay,&lt;br&gt;
Put up your caravan&lt;br&gt;
Just for one day?”&lt;br&gt;
– Ralph Hodgeson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time present and time past&lt;br&gt;
Are both perhaps present in time future,&lt;br&gt;
And time future contained in time past.&lt;br&gt;
If all time is eternally present&lt;br&gt;
All time is unredeemable.”&lt;br&gt;
– T.S. Eliot, “Burnt Norton” (&lt;em&gt;Four Quartets&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time is the substance from which I am made.  Time is a river that carries me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger that devours me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire.” — Jorge Luis Borges, &lt;em&gt;Labyrinths&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The amount of planetary tilt and the time of year the tilt occurs change over time. When the Northern Hemisphere is less tilted towards the sun on June 21st, and at the same time the Earth is as far from the sun in its elliptical orbit as it ever gets, ice age conditions prevail. This makes ice ages on Earth pretty regular, cyclic, events....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Would you be more upset if he or she had sex with someone else, or if they had fallen in love with someone else? Several studies have found that the answer to that question depends on the your gender. Women say they would be more upset if their partner was in love with someone else, but men say they would be more upset if their partner was having sex with someone else.

Why the difference? There are a couple explanations. One relies on natural selection: It's important to men to know their genes are being passed on, so sexual infidelity is a bigger problem than romantic infidelity. Women, this explanation argues, are certain their children possess their genes, so they are more concerned that a man will use his resources to support the child of another woman. So sleeping with other women is not as bad as falling in love with them.

A second explanation suggests that there's no practical difference between romantic and sexual infidelity. Women assume that if a man loves another woman, he's also slept with her. Men assume that if a woman has slept with another man, she loves him. This was backed up by a 1996 study by Christine Harris and Nicholas Christenfeld. So what's different for men and women is what's implied by "sexual intercourse" and "love," not their level of offense at their partner's behavior. (Few of these explanations, by the way, account for same-sex relationships)

More recently, Monica Whitty and Laura-Lee Quigly wanted to see if similar principles held up cyberspace. Does cybersex and cyber-romance show the same gender difference? Whitty and Quigly surveyed 112 undergraduates with the same questions about sexual and emotional infidelity, but also asked cyber-versions of the same question. So respondents were given four choices to the question of what bothered them the most: A partner in love with someone else, having sex with someone else, in a cyber-romance with someone else, or having cybersex with someone else.

Then, for each possible relationship, they also asked whether love implied sex or vice-versa:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007288" title=""&gt;Common Avian Infection Plagued the Tyrant Dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex and other tyrannosaurid fossils often display multiple, smooth-edged full-thickness erosive lesions on the mandible, either unilaterally or bilaterally. The cause of these lesions in the Tyrannosaurus rex specimen FMNH PR2081 (known informally by the name 'Sue') has previously been attributed to actinomycosis, a bacterial bone infection, or bite wounds from other tyrannosaurids. We conducted an extensive survey of tyrannosaurid specimens and identified ten individuals with full-thickness erosive lesions. These lesions were described, measured and photographed for comparison with one another. We also conducted an extensive survey of related archosaurs for similar lesions. We show here that these lesions are consistent with those caused by an avian parasitic infection called trichomonosis, which causes similar abnormalities on the mandible of modern birds, in particular raptors. This finding represents the first evidence for the ancient evolutionary origin of an avian transmissible disease in non-avian theropod dinosaurs. It also provides a valuable insight into the palaeobiology of these now extinct animals. Based on the frequency with which these lesions occur, we hypothesize that tyrannosaurids were commonly infected by a Trichomonas gallinae-like protozoan. For tyrannosaurid populations, the only non-avian dinosaur group that show trichomonosis-type lesions, it is likely that the disease became endemic and spread as a result of antagonistic intraspecific behavior, consumption of prey infected by a Trichomonas gallinae-like protozoan and possibly even cannibalism. The severity of trichomonosis-related lesions in specimens such as Tyrannosaurus rex FMNH PR2081 and Tyrannosaurus rex MOR 980, strongly suggests that these animals died as a direct result of this disease, mostly likely through starvation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007241" title=""&gt;Dragon's Paradise Lost: Palaeobiogeography, Evolution and Extinction of the Largest-Ever Terrestrial Lizards (Varanidae)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The largest living lizard species, Varanus komodoensis Ouwens 1912, is vulnerable to extinction, being restricted to a few isolated islands in eastern Indonesia, between Java and Australia, where it is the dominant terrestrial carnivore. Understanding how large-bodied varanids responded to past environmental change underpins long-term management of V. komodoensis populations. We reconstruct the palaeobiogeography of Neogene giant varanids and identify a new (unnamed) species from the island of Timor. Our data reject the long-held perception that V. komodoensis became a giant because of insular evolution or as a specialist hunter of pygmy Stegodon. Phyletic giantism, coupled with a westward dispersal from mainland Australia, provides the most parsimonious explanation for the palaeodistribution of V. komodoensis and the newly identified species of giant varanid from Timor. Pliocene giant varanid fossils from Australia are morphologically referable to V. komodoensis suggesting an ultimate origin for V. komodoensis on mainland Australia (&amp;gt;3.8 million years ago). Varanus komodoensis body size has remained stable over the last 900,000 years (ka) on Flores, a time marked by major faunal turnovers, extinction of the island&amp;#39;s megafauna, the arrival of early hominids by 880 ka, co-existence with Homo floresiensis, and the arrival of modern humans by 10 ka. Within the last 2000 years their populations have contracted severely. Giant varanids were once a ubiquitous part of Subcontinental Eurasian and Australasian faunas during the Neogene. Extinction played a pivotal role in the reduction of their ranges and diversity throughout the late Quaternary, leaving only V. komodoensis as an isolated long-term survivor. The events over the last two millennia now threaten its future survival.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007262" title=""&gt;The Origin and Initial Rise of Pelagic Cephalopods in the Ordovician&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the Ordovician the global diversity increased dramatically at family, genus and species levels. Partially the diversification is explained by an increased nutrient, and phytoplankton availability in the open water. Cephalopods are among the top predators of todays open oceans. Their Ordovician occurrences, diversity evolution and abundance pattern potentially provides information on the evolution of the pelagic food chain. We reconstructed the cephalopod departure from originally exclusively neritic habitats into the pelagic zone by the compilation of occurrence data in offshore paleoenvironments from the Paleobiology Database, and from own data, by evidence of the functional morphology, and the taphonomy of selected cephalopod faunas. The occurrence data show, that cephalopod associations in offshore depositional settings and black shales are characterized by a specific composition, often dominated by orthocerids and lituitids. The siphuncle and conch form of these cephalopods indicate a dominant lifestyle as pelagic, vertical migrants. The frequency distribution of conch sizes and the pattern of epibionts indicate an autochthonous origin of the majority of orthocerid and lituitid shells. The consistent concentration of these cephalopods in deep subtidal sediments, starting from the middle Tremadocian indicates the occupation of the pelagic zone early in the Early Ordovician and a subsequent diversification which peaked during the Darriwilian. The exploitation of the pelagic realm started synchronously in several independent invertebrate clades during the latest Cambrian to Middle Ordovician. The initial rise and diversification of pelagic cephalopods during the Early and Middle Ordovician indicates the establishment of a pelagic food chain sustainable enough for the development of a diverse fauna of large predators. The earliest pelagic cephalopods were slowly swimming vertical migrants. The appearance and early diversification of pelagic cephalopods is interpreted as a consequence of the increased food availability in the open water since the latest Cambrian.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007252" title=""&gt;The Cultural Dynamics of Copycat Suicide&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The observation that suicides sometimes cluster in space and/or time has led to suggestions that these clusters are caused by the social learning of suicide-related behaviours, or "copycat suicides". Point clusters are clusters of suicides localised in both time and space, and have been attributed to direct social learning from nearby individuals. Mass clusters are clusters of suicides localised in time but not space, and have been attributed to the dissemination of information concerning celebrity suicides via the mass media. Here, agent-based simulations, in combination with scan statistic methods for detecting clusters of rare events, were used to clarify the social learning processes underlying point and mass clusters. It was found that social learning between neighbouring agents did generate point clusters as predicted, although this effect was partially mimicked by homophily (individuals preferentially assorting with similar others). The one-to-many transmission dynamics characterised by the mass media were shown to generate mass clusters, but only where social learning was weak, perhaps due to prestige bias (only copying prestigious celebrities) and similarity bias (only copying similar models) acting to reduce the subset of available models. These findings can help to clarify and formalise existing hypotheses and to guide future empirical work relating to real-life copycat suicides.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007230" title=""&gt;Identification of Copy Number Variants Defining Genomic Differences among Major Human Groups&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Understanding the genetic contribution to phenotype variation of human groups is necessary to elucidate differences in disease predisposition and response to pharmaceutical treatments in different human populations. We have investigated the genome-wide profile of structural variation on pooled samples from the three populations studied in the HapMap project by comparative genome hybridization (CGH) in different array platforms. We have identified and experimentally validated 33 genomic loci that show significant copy number differences from one population to the other. Interestingly, we found an enrichment of genes related to environment adaptation (immune response, lipid metabolism and extracellular space) within these regions and the study of expression data revealed that more than half of the copy number variants (CNVs) translate into gene-expression differences among populations, suggesting that they could have functional consequences. In addition, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are in linkage disequilibrium with the copy number alleles allowed us to detect evidences of population differentiation and recent selection at the nucleotide variation level. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive view of relevant copy number changes that might play a role in phenotypic differences among major human populations, and generate a list of interesting candidates for future studies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of these ideas may be more appropriate for the high school setting, but I hope elementary and middle school teachers will also find some useful suggestions. I will use examples from Monsters vs. Aliens, which comes out on DVD today, September 29, to illustrate each suggestion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monsters vs. Aliens tells the story of Susan Murphy’s transformation from normal woman into Ginormica, a 15-meter tall, white-haired version of herself. Susan’s transformation was caused by being struck by a meteorite on her wedding day. (I really appreciate that the writers got that right: the object that hit Susan is a “meteorite,” since it reached the ground. While still in space, rocky objects like this are “meteoroids” and while in the atmosphere are “meteors.”) She is captured by the military and taken to a secret facility where she meets several other monsters based on 1950s science-fiction films. There is Bob, a blue gelatinous mass, à la The Blob (1958); The Missing Link, who bears a striking resemblance to The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954); Insectasaurus, who is a giant mutated larva not so different from Mothra (1961); and, finally, Dr. Cockroach Ph.D., who is the result of a teleportation experiment gone wrong, as in The Fly (1958).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, and probably my favorite way to use movies in class, is to have students collect some data from a short segment and use that data in a quick calculation. Actual data collection in this film is hard to come by, but it is possible to estimate the kinetic energy of the meteorite that hits Susan at the start. Students can estimate the size of the meteorite if you pause the film just before the collision, and you could even get a rough speed number by advancing frame by frame. Combine the estimated volume with a density of about 3 grams per cubic centimeter, and you have the approximate mass of the meteorite.  Then the kinetic energy is ½ mv^2, and can be compared to the energy of a soccer ball or moving car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a check on students’ ability to apply a science concept in a new context, you might show a short scene from a film and ask students to “spot the errors.” For this application, the film you use depends on the topic you want to review, and Monsters vs. Aliens is especially good to check on students understanding of scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A classic way to make a movie monster is to put an actor wearing a rubber suit in a model city. He stomps around knocking down buildings and power lines until confronted by another actor in a different suit who stops him. The problem is that simply scaling up an animal does not work for a variety of physical and physiological reasons. First, consider the volume (and if the density is maintained, also the mass) when an object is doubled in size. If you take a cube 1 cm on a side and double all the dimensions, you get a cube 2 cm on each side, with a volume of 2×2×2=8 cubic centimeters. That means doubling the size of the cube made it 8 times more massive (23=8). Susan/Ginormica went from being a normal height (say 1.7 meters) to approximately 15 meters tall. That’s a factor of about 9, so her mass would increase by a factor of 93 or about 730. Her mass would go from a very reasonable 60 kilograms to over 43,000 kilograms. This might not seem so bad, since she has larger bones and muscles as well. The problem is that the strength of a bone is determined by its cross section, not its volume. When she grew by a factor of 9 in all directions, the cross section of her bones grew by a factor of 81 (9×9). While Ginormica’s mass has gotten more than 700 times larger, her bones have only gotten 80 times stronger, and her skeleton would collapse.

Monsters vs. Aliens perpetuates a stereotype of the “Mad Scientist” common in science fiction and the media generally. (Try an image search on the Internet for “scientist” and see how many of them show a man in a lab coat with wild eyes and crazy hair.) As a follow up to the discussion you might invite a real scientist to your classroom for a visit, or arrange for an online video chat so that your students can see that scientists are real people, not caricatures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope these ideas will inspire some of you to try incorporating at least a bit of Hollywood science into your classroom as a way to bridge the gap between school science and students’ everyday lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another version of this column was originally published by NSTA.

There may be a demand for the store in a sparsely populated region but it may be wiser to locate the store in a densely populated region for more profit. Is there a definite correlation between population density and commercial facility density?

Similarly, if the government or citizen group wants to locate a public facility - temples, toilets, grocery store, fire station - where should that be? It is not for profit, but should be easily accessible by many. Is there a suggestive correlation in this situation? 

The answer to the above two questions is yes. There exists a definite correlation between population density and the density of facilities - commercial or public. Both the correlation are of the form D ~ ρα where D is the facility density and ρ is the population density. For commercial facilities the exponent α ~ 1.13 while for public facilities α ~ 0.69. The following empirical data for the USA and South Korea emphatically asserts such a correlation.

A recent paper [1] in PNAS by Jaegon Um et al. titled Scaling laws between population and facility densities also predicts such a correlation with identical exponent values through a proposed model based on economic mechanisms that mimic the competitive balance between the profit of the facilities and the social opportunity cost for populations. 

The arguments for such unique exponents are simple and catchy. 

For commercial facilities it is safe to assume profit as the goal. If so, more people come to your store (facility of one type), more the profit. So, one could expect, all other conditions remaining equal (like availability of supplies) a store located in a densely populated region to incure more profits than the one in a sparsely populated region. Obviously this is a highly unstable equilibrium for maximizing profits for all. Consequently, to gain more profit, it is logical to expect a store manager to move her store from a sparsely populated region to a densely populated region. But as the number of stores increase in a densely populated region, the profit for each store drops. Extrapolating this local shifts all over a region or country, one can expect in time all the stores, irrespective of their location, to receive almost similar profits. In other words, each store would have strategically located itself in such a place where the number of customers are almost the same for each of them. So, the correlation between the facility density and the population density should have an exponent close to unity. As the data above shows. 

For public facilities the motive is different. It is not profit that determines their location but, safe to say, accessibility. The cheaper it is for people to travel and access such facilities, more they will be sought. So, their location is determined by how accessible they are to more number of people. Given a bunch of such public facilities, each unit moves from a location where the average travel distance is short (so, cost of travel is cheap) to a location where the average traveling distance for a larger population is large (so, cost of travel is high). Such a relocation shifts the travel cost or social opportunity cost, as the authors call it, for a population towards a mean value - reducing in the place where it moved close to and increasing slightly in the place from where the facility moved away from. After several such relocation, at steady state, one observes the exponent α ~ 0.69 as seen from the figure above. 

Both these correlations have been predicted well by the proposed models in the PNAS paper [1]. The authors have shown such a correlation exists for facility density versus population density in the data for USA and South Korea. The exponent in their model are α ~ 1 and α ~ 2∕3 for commercial and public facilities respectively. 

As one could expect not all commercial and public facility obey exactly those exponent values. For example, in the US, banks have an exponent close to 0.88 while in South Korea they have a value of 1.18. Whereas hospitals in the US have                                                                                                                                              α ~ 1.13 while in South Korea 0.96. By defining a generalized objective function to account for these variations, the authors have proposed a generalized correlation in the form

where D(r) is the facility density and ρ(r) is the population density (r is a certain position). When β = 0 the correlation applies for commercial facility and when β = 1 it suits the public facility. The rest of the continuous values should correlate variations of the facilities.

Obviously, it is beyond the scope of the model to attempt a positive correlation for seemingly public facilities - like a place of worship - that are run for profit.

As a species we're fairly poor at dealing with probability, and events like this seems far less likely to us than they actually are. The raw facts of the matter are that: &lt;b&gt;a)&lt;/b&gt; most teenage girls around Natalie's age will be vaccinated in 2009, and &lt;b&gt;b)&lt;/b&gt; a number of teenage girls die every year of initially unexplained causes. The chances of a one of those girls dying on the same day she got her vaccine could be as high as one in a few dozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand it could be an a adverse reaction to the vaccine. The chances of this are also fairly small, but there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about these risks, largely coming from a misunderstanding of vaccine reaction incidence reports. For example, The Daily Mail make the mistake of suggesting that the Cervarix vaccine &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1216714/Schoolgirl-14-dies-given-cervical-cancer-jab.html"&gt;has been linked to thirty deaths&lt;/a&gt;. Of course it hasn't; the mistake they've made is to use the database of &lt;a href="http://vaers.hhs.gov/"&gt;Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System &lt;/a&gt; with the mistaken belief that the data shows confirmed vaccine reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact the VAERS simply records people's self-reported ill health occuring around the time of vaccination on the off-chance it might be related. More accurate estimates of risk by the MRHA estimate the risk of severe reactions at around one in a million. To put that into context, about 2% of the population &lt;a href="http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/p/penicillin_allergy/stats-country.htm"&gt;have reactions to penicillin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mail &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1216714/Schoolgirl-14-dies-given-cervical-cancer-jab.html"&gt;also report that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the tragedy highlights the risks of mass vaccination because no testing regime can detect the rarest and potentially most lethal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These critics appear to be JABS, who were quoted prominently in earlier editions of the Mail's online article, and in their print edition today. I'll move on to that coverage in a moment, but first it's worth pointing out that since he vaccine is likely to save around 700 lives a year, any theoretical, extremely rare side-effects would be comprehensively outweighed by the benefits. It's a self-defeating argument to make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response of mainstream media organs has ranged from reasonable (&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8279855.stm"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;) to dire (the Daily Mail print edfition); and &lt;a href="http://www.malcolmcoles.co.uk/blog/cervical-cancer-jab-irresponsible-coverage/"&gt;Malcolm Cole has done an excellent review of the coverage on his own blog&lt;/a&gt;, with scores for the various papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian have done an excellent job allaying fears, bringing in a doctor to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/sep/29/cervarix-hpv-vaccine-facts&amp;quot;&amp;gt;explain a number of facts about the vaccine and the risks involved. But as usual the Mail and Express lead the way in irresponsible scare-mongering. Take for example the following headline, kindly sent to me by the &lt;a href="http://www.dailyquail.org/"&gt;Daily Quail&lt;/a&gt; (click to enlarge to read the whole article). Some journalists consult doctors, the Mail speak to JABS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/files/mailjab.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/mailjabs.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll be interesting to see if they dare print anything &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/507"&gt;similar in their Irish Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mail article is horrendously biased towards sensationalism, and the The Daily Quail &lt;a href="http://www.dailyquail.org/2009/09/hpv-mails-new-mmr.html"&gt;have covered it well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A statement from the Director of public health for NHS Coventry, saying 'No link can be made between the death and the vaccine until all the facts are known' was relegated to the last line of the report, while no mention was made of how many cases of cervical cancer might be prevented by the vaccination or how many womens' lives saved each year, or any research indicating that the vaccination is in fact safe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, it was noted that 'more than 2,000 have suffered side-effects ranging from rashes to paralysis', and that 'some critics argue [the vaccine] will encourage promiscuity'." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side effects are of course triflingly minor; while the suggestion that the vaccine promotes promiscuity is completely baseless in fact, a moral authoritarian fantasy idea for which no supporting evidence has been advanced. Taken together with the shocking exclusions of any sort of balancing information about the benefits of the vaccine, and the way in which the article leads the reader towards conclusions about tainted vaccines, and what we have is an incredibly irresponsible and potentially dangerous piece of reporting that will affect uptake of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; vacccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science Minister Lord Drayson recently took on Ben Goldacre in a debate at the Royal Institute. I was there, and he claimed repeatedly that newspapers and media outlets had learned the lessons of MMR; that in 2009 similar failures in science reporting wouldn't happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, they haven't. And if this sort of sensationalist, unbalanced and misguided reporting of distorted facts and cherry-picked evidence continues, vaccination rates will fall again, and diseases which have no business still existing in the 21st century will continue to plague us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 1:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
News has just come in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/29/cervical-cancer-hpv-girl-death"&gt;via The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting the vaccine did not cause Morton's death. I may blog more on this later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A 14-year-old girl who died shortly after receiving a vaccine against cervical cancer had a &lt;b&gt;'serious underlying medical condition'&lt;/b&gt;, a preliminary postmortem examination has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although local health authorities stressed that further tests needed to be carried out to establish how Natalie Morton died, they said &lt;b&gt;the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was 'most unlikely' to have been the cause of her" death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 2:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Daily Mail have now &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1216942/Cervical-cancer-vaccine-programme-chaos-death-schoolgirl-14-hours-jab.html"&gt;begrudgingly admitted the above&lt;/a&gt;, but only as a single line in the &lt;i&gt;fourth&lt;/i&gt; paragraph. There is no reference to it in the headline or leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NHS Coventry revealed tonight that had she had a 'serious underlying medical condition' and said the vaccination was 'most unlikely' to have caused her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But the city's primary care trust has nevertheless halted vaccinations for two days while an investigation into Natalie's death is carried out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And below that, they still say that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not yet known whether Natalie had an extreme - and very rare - reaction to a standard vaccine, or whether the particular dose she was given was from a rogue contaminated batch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 3:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you thought that the Mail's coverage was bad, The Express have taken things to an &lt;a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/130908"&gt;unbelievable level&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARENTS’ REVOLT AFTER GIRL DIES IN CANCER JAB HORROR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer stupidity of the journalists involved with that criminally misleading headline is matched only by the reactions in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE GOVERNMENT MAKES OUR GIRLS INTO PROSTITUTES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of government policy is that all girls in every school should be readily available for sex at any time with anyone - in other words they want to make our daughters into prostitutes. Prostitutes have to have various medical treatments to keep them ready for the men - so our government administers this jab to every girl in the country except for those at independent schools, of course. This jab is against a sexually transmitted disease and shows the total failure of the government's sex policy: anything is all right as long as you use a condom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But between now and then I’m off to jolly old to attend TAM London! So this is a short post designed to buy me a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Remember &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/05/homeopathy-kills/"&gt;the homeopath and his wife&lt;/a&gt; who killed their nine-month-old daughter, because she had severe eczema and all they did was give her nothing but water (because that’s what homeopathic &amp;quot;medicine&amp;quot; is)?  Yeah, &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,26135817-421,00.html"&gt;they got six years in jail&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Antivax groups aren’t getting smarter about medicine, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/how_anti-vaccine_groups_rebrand_them.php"&gt;but they are getting smarter about branding&lt;/a&gt;. They call themselves Talking About Curing Autism and Operation Rescue, but don’t be fooled: they are antivaccination, pure and simple. And whether they believe what they say or not, they are not supporting children. They are putting them at grave risk of illness and death from preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, if you read that link you’ll see that TACA is sponsoring a concert to raise funds for their antivax efforts, and got the radio station JACK 93.1 to partner with them. Lots of big names will be at the concert, and all the money will go toward a group that may in fact want to help autistic kids, but is also spreading gross misinformation about vaccines while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) And finally, a ray of hope: the New York Times &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/28/health/policy/28vaccine.html"&gt;posted an article&lt;/a&gt; debunking antivax swine flu nonsense.

Thanks to a reader, I have a case for you, which I'll present in parts. I will try to make the information accessible to both professionals and lay-people.  I'll start with the barest of information and rather than guess what's going on right away, I'd like to see people organize their thoughts into broad categories based on the initial symptoms.  One way to think about this is to think about what, anatomically, is in the area of question---in other words, what can go wrong there.  Then, think of types of disease---vascular, anatomic, infectious, allergic, etc.  I will, of course, help you with this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 32 year old woman presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of abdominal pain.  She reports that the pain is in her lower abdomen.  It began as a vague, dull ache about one week prior to presentation  but now it is sharp, severe, and does not radiate.  Nothing seems to make it better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So think about what structures could be affected and by what mechanism.  If you guys can't come up with it, I'll give you an example.  After a while, I'll addend this post with a summary of the comments and the next set of findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Addendum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really shouldn't do this without providing an example, so I'll start off a bit for you so you see how to approach this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower abdominal pain can be due to (but not necessarily limited to) some of the following structures:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mesentery/Omentum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large intestine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small intestine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appendix&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iliac artery or other large arteries branching off the aorta&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Female reproductive tract, including ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;round ligament&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bladder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ureters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;referred pain from somewhere else, and anything else I might have forgotten&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One or more of these structures may be affected by one of these general processes(incomplete list):&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infectious&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto-immune&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vascular&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;

At that time it was clear that the act would open the door to teaching creationism in the public schools of that state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the creationists are going further, rigging the procedure by which classroom materials are evaluated for appropriateness.  Barbara Forrest, stalwart in the defense of teaching honest science and the separation of church and state, has &lt;a href="http://lasciencecoalition.org/2009/09/30/creationists-dictate-bese-policy/" rel="external "&gt;a long press release&lt;/a&gt; outlining what has happened.  &lt;strong&gt;[Note: URL now fixed.]&lt;/strong&gt;  From that release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 16, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education [BESE] ignored the recommendations of science education professionals in the Louisiana Department of Education (DOE) and allowed the Louisiana Family Forum (LFF), a Religious Right lobbying group, to dictate the procedure concerning complaints about creationist supplementary materials used in public school science classes under the 2008 Louisiana Science Education Act (LSEA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the creationists are now the umpires in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;

Read them, and help as you can in Forrest’s efforts.

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great billboard.  It emphasizes that it’s not just disbelief in a god that binds rationalists.  We also deny the existence of heaven, hell, Satan, and miracles.  We don’t believe in Creationism, reincarnation, or the idea that prayers are heard by anybody.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all part of the same myth-y package and we see no reason to accept any of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, while saying all that, it’s not pointing some mean-spirited finger at theists who do buy into all those things.  It’s just calling out to the atheists who might agree with the sign.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more of us out there than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.Real.Girl is on tour with the band… or something like that and needs someone to cover for her AI today. Plus, I was a slacker last week and had Karen cover for me. So I’m covering for A for today’s Afternoon Inquisition. A will cover for Karen next week and sometime next month, Sam’s head will explode and he’ll send out 3 AI’s in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone got that? Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning,  I was listening to the &lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/09/amateur-scientist-podcast-episode-77.html"&gt;latest Amateur Scientist Podcast&lt;/a&gt; where he mentions how people have told him to get bat boxes. He said he refused because the last thing he needs is more bats in his life.  As someone who has had the exact same conversation with her bat-loving husband, I found myself yelling and cheering along to this sentiment and started a bit of a bat argument on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/masalaskeptic/status/4469176300"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, people, I know they’re useful and eat mosquitoes etc. But really, they creep me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most useful creature that creeps you right the hell out? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I would have tried to take a picture, but I didn't want to crash my car.  heh...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that was groan-worthy, but on the way back to work I was pondering exactly &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it bothers me.  I mean, we should all coexist, right?  They aren't directing anything at me, they are just very publicly congratulating a friend on getting baptized, which is just some thing that they do.  Why should that effect me?  How would I like it if people took offense to my hobbies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then I figured it out:  It's because the implication is that baptism is necessary for salvation.  So while it sounds innocent enough -- "Congratulations!" -- the subtext is "All of you unbaptized heathens are going to burn!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suppose it's possible they don't actually think that, but then that raises the question, why baptize in the first place?  If you show me someone who really just thinks baptism is a fun thing to do in their spare time, and doesn't believe I will suffer any ill effects from avoiding it, then I guess that's just fine.  But until then, I'm gonna keep being offended by signs about "BBQ and baptism".&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-6087097965381571125?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254248052801"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=5718">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/78d549e95e6b9cce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alt-Med"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Girl dies shortly after vaccine shot</title><published>2009-09-29T17:59:13Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T17:59:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/29/girl-dies-shortly-after-vaccine-shot/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;That headline above is factually accurate. Of course, most people reading it will assume that the vaccination &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; the death. But we have no evidence of that yet, so try not to jump to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1216714/Schoolgirl-14-dies-given-cervical-cancer-jab.html"&gt;The Daily Mail is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that a young woman, aged 14, died shortly after receiving a vaccine shot (they call them &amp;quot;jabs&amp;quot; in the UK) for HPV, to prevent cervical cancer. They are reporting that about an hour after the shot  she became pale, stopped breathing, and fainted. Rescuers were not able to save her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story, first and foremost, is horrible and tragic. My heart goes out to the parents of the young woman and to all her friends and schoolmates. This is an awful thing, what every parent dreads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be careful and not rush to judgment, though. First and foremost, we don’t know that the vaccination is why she died. The Daily Mail is not exactly the most trusted news source, to start off with. I am taking events reported therein with a large grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we don’t know why she died at all. Reports of that have not yet been aired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, complications of any kind from vaccinations are incredibly rare. Gardasil, an HPV vaccination (though different than the one the girl in England received), has been given to over 7 million girls, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/18/more-antivax-distortion-the-swine-flu-version/"&gt;yet there have been only 20 deaths after getting the shot&lt;/a&gt;… and for almost all of them there is no obvious relation between the shot and the fatality except for timing. In other words, they were tragic coincidences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one person pointed out on Twitter, you could write an article that says &amp;quot;Man dies after reading the Daily Mail&amp;quot;, since I’m sure that will happen many times every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As skeptics tirelessly point out: correlation does not mean causation. Because an event happens after a previous event, it doesn’t mean the first &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; the second. Is it possible the vaccination resulted in that girl’s death? Yes, it’s possible. However, &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; it responsible? &lt;strong&gt;That&lt;/strong&gt; we don’t know, and have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if it was responsible, we need to find out why. Did she have a rare condition? Was it a bad batch? Was she terribly scared of shots, and her heightened fear exacerbated a heart condition? The point is, &lt;em&gt;we don’t know&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do know is that the antivax crowd will go ballistic over this, despite not having enough facts to make a rational conclusion here. But facts are tenuous or malleable things to them, only useful for ignoring or distortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the comments below I expect we’ll hear a lot of the usual misinformation about toxins and autism and mercury and fetal tissue, long-debunked worries over vaccines. Let’s please remember two things here: one is that we don’t know what happened, and the other is that a young girl has died, and we should all be respectful of that. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254247954259"><id gr:original-id="http://ecographica.blogspot.com/2009/09/papilios-unconstrained-phenotypic.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/68be85b66e9ba354</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Papilio’s Unconstrained Phenotypic Flexibility</title><published>2009-09-29T13:06:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T13:06:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/lqCeggvW0wc/papilios-unconstrained-phenotypic.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://ecographica.blogspot.com/2009/09/papilios-unconstrained-phenotypic.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">As with most plant feeding insects, butterfly to host-plant adaptations are highly specialized towards specific plant species or plant groups. The reason for this is that plants characteristically produce chemicals that either deter or attract insects based on the defensive and mutualistic needs of the plant itself.  Through natural selection, plants adapt specifically to work with (as with pollinators, like bees), or work against, the other organisms cohabitating in their ecosystem. So, if an insect is to take advantage of a plant as a food source it must first adapt tolerances or immunity to the toxic compounds that the plant produces as a defensive measure....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He now advocates the theory that modern man is not the result of a natural process of evolution, but that evolution was artificially aided by reptilian extraterrestrials. The reptilians bred mankind as servants and continue to rule the planet today, Horn said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Reptilians have manipulated perceptions of world history and hold power over humankind through their influence over an elite and powerful group of humans, known as the Illuminati, Arthur said. Throughout human history, the reptilian beings have been recorded as dragons or gods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think that was an example of media quote mangling, either. He was speaking at a meeting called a "Galactic Gathering," organized by The Institute for the Study of Galactic Civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plus on his side: there's also a nice human interest story there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift in Arthur's focus came shortly after meeting Lynette, who was then a metaphysical healer, he said. After many conversations over the telephone, Arthur and Lynette finally met face-to-face in July of 1988 when they spent a week in Northern California's Trinity Mountains searching for Sasquatch, commonly known as Bigfoot.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The couple never spotted the mythic creature, but fell in love, Lynette said. Only a few months later, they were married in the chapel on the CSU campus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awww. Woo Love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody pass his name on to &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/215563?from=rss"&gt;Sharon Begley, who is manufacturing pseudo-controversies this week&lt;/a&gt;. She's defending Lamarckism now, based on some work that suggests a plausible basis for multi-generation responses to the environment, a justification for some of the observations made by Kammerer on toads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes for living on land seem to get &amp;quot;environmentally silenced in early embryos exposed to water,&amp;quot; says Vargas, who combed through Kammerer&amp;#39;s lab notes and whose analysis appears in the Journal of Experimental Zoology. &amp;quot;It has taken a painfully long time to properly acknowledge that environment can influence inheritance,&amp;quot; he told me. &amp;quot;I think academia has discouraged experiments testing environmental modification of inheritance,&amp;quot; because the inheritance of acquired characteristics—Lamarckism—drives the self-appointed evolution police crazy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They might want to spend more time reading studies and less energy manning the barricades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaaargh! Epigenetics is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; Lamarckism! Also, Begley doesn't seem to understand that the institution of science is extremely conservative, and rightly so: we 'man the barricades' because science isn't like the Huffington Post, letting any wacky idea sail through unchallenged. There is a demand for rigor: show us the data, do the experiments, repeat until you've got a case that can't be shot down by a lone skeptical first year grad student. Postulating reptoids guiding human evolution isn't going to be credible until someone shoots one and writes a paper about the dissection, and Lamarckism is going to be sneered at until someone does the experiment that shows it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think academia has been neglecting this field because of dogma, either. Epigenetics is hot right now (and again, it's &lt;i&gt;NOT Lamarckism&lt;/i&gt;!), and there&amp;#39;s some interesting work going on in the field of eco-devo. I also think that a replication of Kammerer&amp;#39;s work that demonstrated an actual effect would be easily publishable — I&amp;#39;d be interested in reading it, for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

But once again, he's going to get misquoted by every creationist on the planet, thanks to Newsweek. They have an article about him and his book, and in a nice bold pull quote, here's what they claim:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/09/richard_dawkins_says_were_desc/frogs_quote.jpeg" width="400" height="266" alt="frogs_quote.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hey, frogs are highly derived amphibians; we certainly aren't descended from them. Monkeys are closer to us than frogs, but they're still cousins, not grandparents. Not only does that quote look silly to a creationist, it looks ridiculous to a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did Dawkins actually say? Why, that the whole simplistic imaginary chains of descent that creationists invent are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silliest of all these &amp;quot;missing link&amp;quot; challenges are the following…&amp;quot;If people came from monkeys via frogs and fish, then why does the fossil record not contain a &amp;#39;fronkey&amp;#39;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever wonder why scientists distrust the media, this is a nice clear example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/richard_dawkins_says_were_desc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/NznRAav0BTU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254246967231"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ea47d815d2928290</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Huffington Post promotes alt med nonsense</title><published>2009-09-29T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/723-huffington-post-promotes-alt-med-nonsense.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I used to write for the Huffington Post, an online news and blog collective.

Really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes touted as one of the more secular of countries, we often lapse into &lt;a href="http://cavalcadeofwhimsy.wordpress.com/2009/05/11/gregson-on-myers-on-rosenhouse-on-fish-on-eagleton-on-god-on-recursion/"&gt;woolly-minded relativistic thinking of the Terry Eagleton variety&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s fine, up to a point. I mean, if you’re not hurting anyone, who are we to cause a fuss?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But say you hurt someone because of it. What if your over-arching, bend-over-backwards-accommodation led to damage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would it be the preserve of a secular society, an indisputable right?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Especially if it concerns children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not in &lt;a href="http://cavalcadeofwhimsy.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/thank-you-cardinal-donohue-for-reducing-my-faith-in-humanity/"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://cavalcadeofwhimsy.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/shame-on-the-church-shame-on-the-state/"&gt;way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A foundation of an enlightened, peaceful society is education. And as educators (as I’m sure some of you are) we are in a privileged, but often daunting position of responsibility. Too often we are seen as a repository of facts – as if we all carry around a swot-list of inerrant information, and conveyance of these facts is of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, if children don’t learn the facts, has education failed them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then cultural relativists come along, and accuse educators (and scientists, and many others) of ignoring the multitude of subtle, nuanced discussions going on in the world – there is no objective truth etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that would be fine (sort of), if it weren’t a massive straw man. Education can best be seen using the scientific method as the basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have facts. Facts are observed and collated, from which we can construct theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theories are then tested – if they fail, they are revised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this may be ok for science – but what about, say, literature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as discussed with friends last night, take ‘King Lear’. [&lt;i&gt;spoiler alert&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would his blinding by his daughters be seen best as a Freudian castration? Or would a more poetic interpretation - relevant to Shakespeare’s time and canon - such as a catalyst to open his eyes to his situation, be the more appropriate reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literary criticism can discuss these ideas – even though there is no ‘objective’ reading, there are &lt;i&gt;more sensible&lt;/i&gt; readings. Essentially, Occam’s Razor can shave off the more anachronistic interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what education should achieve. I’ve been fortunate – I’ve had a good education, with passionate instructors who served as positive role models. I’m now in a position to help carry that on, and I take the responsibility seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to teach people to think critically – an encyclopaedic knowledge of the world is fine for University Challenge, but of no use if you can’t filter out the relevant portions and make logical inferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take science – some science (heck, most science) is counter-intuitive when seen as a totality. Evolution seems pretty bizarre – but makes perfect rational sense when seen as a series of small, non-random steps (i.e. micro-evolution &amp;amp; speciation are just small steps in the long walk of macro-evolution, if you will).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the understanding of the method, the ability to filter out all the junk pseudo-science, and the humility to understand the difference between rational confidence and arrogance, that are the true differences between a &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is not about a difference in intelligence – not by a long shot. It’s all down to application – which true education should allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, enough pre-amble. The reason I’m writing is because of a rather scary curriculum that my colleague Jonny Scaramanga has brought to the attention of the UK press, with the most thorough article thus far being the &lt;a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6019140"&gt;original Times TES article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, both &lt;a href="http://www.richarddawkins.net/article,4116,Fundamentalist-exams-on-a-par-with-A-levels,Michael-Shaw--TES-Times-Educational-Supplement"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/nessie_disproves_evolutionin_t.php"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt; have supported by writing about it, and Twitter is ABLAZE with re-tweeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonny’s written a letter to &lt;a href="http://www.naric.org.uk/"&gt;NARIC&lt;/a&gt; which has formed the basis of the Times Educational Supplement article, and which he’s graciously given me permission to reprint here [bold emphasis added]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
NARIC recently found that International Certificate of Christian Education (ICCE) qualifications are broadly comparable to those offered by Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). As a university lecturer and former student of ICCE’s curriculum, I have a number of concerns about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            ICCE uses the Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) curriculum. This has major academic flaws of which you may not be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning and assessment methodologies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of ACE criticise its emphasis on rote learning at the expense of higher-order cognitive skills.1 Tests predominantly consist of multiple choice, matching, or fill-in-the-blanks. These means only test factual recall, not understanding. Furthermore, options on the multiple choice tests are often meaningless, e.g., “Jesus died on the___ (cross, toss, chrome).”2This cannot be compared to CIE, which makes use of essay writing and long-answer exam questions as assessment for skills such as understanding, analysis, and critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summative assessment of a CIE course tests a student’s learning over a long period of study, typically a year. By contrast, ACE students are tested after each PACE (Packet of Accelerated Christian Education), which typically takes two weeks. Combined with the emphasis on factual recall, this method of assessment promotes student “cramming” and the use of short-term memory, at the expense of retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACE curriculum includes no practical science and accordingly no investigation. CIE syllabus assessment objectives for chemistry, biology, and physics all specify that a student should learn to construct hypotheses.3 ACE is a workbook-based system, so it cannot fulfil these objectives. This would be troublesome for any ACE student embarking on a science higher education course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PACEs are based on the reading comprehension mode of learning… There is no room within this method of learning for the negotiation of topics, for whole class problem solving, for the generation of ideas, for the formulating and testing of hypotheses, discussion of results and social application.”4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACE science teaches Creationism. Leaving aside whether Creationism is true, ACE’s approach is unscientific because it does not test theories against rival theories in accepted ways.5 Rather than weighing evidence objectively, the ACE system rejects any science that contradicts the Bible, as this Year 9 Science PACE shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“True science will never contradict the Bible because God created both the universe and Scripture…If a scientific theory contradicts the Bible, then the theory is wrong and must be discarded.”6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The system also takes an intellectually dishonest approach to discrediting evolution. PACE 1107 (1996), for example, claims evolutionists use the “hopeful monster” theory to save the “sinking ship” of evolution. In fact, this theory was put forward by one scientist, Richard Goldschmidt, whose ideas were dismissed by his colleagues. Another PACE claims that the Loch Ness Monster exists and is proof of a young earth.7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, PACEs ridicule the theory of evolution: “No branch of true science would make these kind of impossible claims without proof. Because evolutionists do not want to believe the only alternative – that the universe was created by God – they declare evolution is a fact and believe its impossible claims without any scientific proof!”8 They also claim that Creationism has “unquestionable proofs” and “unarguable evidences,”9 both deeply unscientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racial insensitivity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACE curriculum “shows a degree of insensitivity towards blacks, Jews, and natives.”10 Users of the system have observed that some cartoons contained within the PACEs appear to depict racially segregated classrooms.11 The syllabus has also included controversial racial statements. Prideaux and Speck (1993) state that, after consulting with Aboriginal Studies Officers and the Education Department of South Australia, they found ACE materials about Aborigines were unacceptable to the Aboriginal people. ACE’s stance on apartheid is also of concern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If apartheid were done away with, the twenty million Blacks, who are not taxpayers, would be given the privilege of voting. Within a short period of time they would control the government and the means of taxation. ‘The power to tax is the power to destroy.’ …Some people want to abolish apartheid immediately. That action would certainly alter the situation in South Africa, but would not improve it.”12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although apartheid appears to allow the unfair treatment of blacks, the system has worked well in South Africa…Although white businessmen and developers are guilty of some unfair treatment of blacks, they turned South Africa into a modern industrialized nation, which the poor, uneducated blacks couldn’t have accomplished in several more decades. If more blacks were suddenly given control of the nation, its economy and business, as Mandela wished, they could have destroyed what they have waited and worked so hard for.”13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political bias&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACE materials do not allow the consideration of any opposing point of view. This goes against the skills required by degree-level study of forming an argument, considering different opinions, and analysing the validity of claims. Rather than engaging with differing points of view, ACE derides them. The ACE approach to politics borders on propaganda, with opinions presented as fact.14 An ACE booklet (1987) claims that God’s values are those of right-wing politics. The further left a person moves on the political spectrum, the further they move from God’s absolutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The substance of truth, ideals, and absolutes is on the right. Evil does not have substance: it is a departure from, and absence of the substance of, good. The left is the farthest extreme from that basic substance…Men on the left cannot walk in wisdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a further departure from the CIE syllabus, ACE promotes coverage over depth. World History, from Creation to the present, is covered in a series of 12 PACEs, each of about 40 pages. Inevitably, there is little analysis. The CIE syllabus for history at both ‘A’ and ‘O’ Level, by contrast, studies specific areas of history in depth.15 An ACE student arriving at university will have learned (and forgotten) many facts, but will not have engaged with the material. Because all the answers are contained within the PACE, the student will also not have learned how to conduct research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICCE’s defenders will point out that there are now modules available aimed at addressing some of these issues. These modules are not compulsory, nor are they offered at all ICCE schools. In any case, ACE would make up the majority of an ICCE student’s educational experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            For these reasons, and numerous others, it is my belief that ICCE is an inadequate preparation for higher education or employment in British society. It should be noted that ICCE is operated by many independent schools and homeschoolers in the UK. In spite of this, it is not recognised by the National Database of Accepted Qualifications, nor is it awarded UCAS points. I hope that UK NARIC’s endorsement of ICCE will be reconsidered in light of this evidence. I look forward to hearing your response, and would be happy to discuss this further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 I have attached an appendix that deals with this comprehensively, since it is prohibitively long to include in the body of this letter. I am aware that some of my sources date back to the mid-80s. It should be noted, however, that the ACE syllabus has changed very little in this time. In her 2005 Marshall University Masters’ thesis, Lisa Kelley noted that the 3rdedition PACEs, introduced in 1980, were still being used.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is hoped for, is a raising of the level of discourse – we need to let people, parents, students and teachers know that this sort of uncritical, non-educative brainwashing is happening. Especially this form of racist, homophobic, anti-science, anti-questioning husk of ‘education’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s currently a one-way conversation (cheers, Mr. ”Education, Education, Education”), and we need to change that right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is one thing, but this is a gross misuse of the freedoms of private religious belief, and into the indoctrination of young, enquiring minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, it’s not so much about the conclusions reached – but about the method used to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They quote Christian after Christian.  In fact the whole second half of the piece is about how Christians &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; protesting this group’s presence.  Is that just a space filler or the meat of the story, I wonder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Leaders of other campus religious groups are supporting the SSA’s membership, saying its presence will provide a good debate about secularity, Christianity and spirituality in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mollie Ramstrom, an elementary education major, described herself as a “very strong Christian” at last week’s first SSA meeting. She regularly attends Intervarsity Christian Fellowship meetings, but she wanted to support Elliott, who has been to a couple meetings at IVCF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just wanted to see what the group was about,” said Ramstrom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christy Klippel, a staff worker who facilitates leadership at IVCF, said the SSA is welcome at PUC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no bitterness about them having an organization,” said Klippel. “It would be welcome if its purpose is to have an open discussion about issues. I think it’s good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raydon Haskins, of Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship, said he has no objection to SSA.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s nice, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that &lt;strong&gt;Nikko Elliott&lt;/strong&gt;’s group needed their approval at all, but cordial relations are always  good thing to have.  Joint events tend to make for a wider audience, exposed to more skeptical ideas.  A win-win situation for atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Nikko got 19 people to come out to that first meeting (including the Christian).  That’s an impressive number and with some good leadership, it should only go up!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes touted as one of the more secular of countries, we often lapse into &lt;a href="http://cavalcadeofwhimsy.wordpress.com/2009/05/11/gregson-on-myers-on-rosenhouse-on-fish-on-eagleton-on-god-on-recursion/"&gt;woolly-minded relativistic thinking of the Terry Eagleton variety&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s fine, up to a point. I mean, if you’re not hurting anyone, who are we to cause a fuss?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But say you hurt someone because of it. What if your over-arching, bend-over-backwards-accommodation led to damage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would it be the preserve of a secular society, an indisputable right?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Especially if it concerns children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not in &lt;a href="http://cavalcadeofwhimsy.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/thank-you-cardinal-donohue-for-reducing-my-faith-in-humanity/"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://cavalcadeofwhimsy.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/shame-on-the-church-shame-on-the-state/"&gt;way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A foundation of an enlightened, peaceful society is education. And as educators (as I’m sure some of you are) we are in a privileged, but often daunting position of responsibility. Too often we are seen as a repository of facts – as if we all carry around a swot-list of inerrant information, and conveyance of these facts is of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, if children don’t learn the facts, has education failed them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then cultural relativists come along, and accuse educators (and scientists, and many others) of ignoring the multitude of subtle, nuanced discussions going on in the world – there is no objective truth etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that would be fine (sort of), if it weren’t a massive straw man. Education can best be seen using the scientific method as the basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have facts. Facts are observed and collated, from which we can construct theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theories are then tested – if they fail, they are revised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this may be ok for science – but what about, say, literature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as discussed with friends last night, take ‘King Lear’. [&lt;i&gt;spoiler alert&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would Gloucester's blinding be seen best as a Freudian castration? Or would a more poetic interpretation - less anachronistic, more relevant to Shakespeare’s time and canon - such as a catalyst to open his eyes to his situation, be the more appropriate reading?&lt;br&gt;
[&lt;i&gt;above paragraph was edited 1/10/09 for factual accuracy - John&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literary criticism can discuss these ideas – even though there is no ‘objective’ reading, there are &lt;i&gt;more sensible&lt;/i&gt; readings. Essentially, Occam’s Razor can shave off the more anachronistic interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what education should achieve. I’ve been fortunate – I’ve had a good education, with passionate instructors who served as positive role models. I’m now in a position to help carry that on, and I take the responsibility seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to teach people to think critically – an encyclopaedic knowledge of the world is fine for University Challenge, but of no use if you can’t filter out the relevant portions and make logical inferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take science – some science (heck, most science) is counter-intuitive when seen as a totality. Evolution seems pretty bizarre – but makes perfect rational sense when seen as a series of small, non-random steps (i.e. micro-evolution &amp;amp; speciation are just small steps in the long walk of macro-evolution, if you will).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the understanding of the method, the ability to filter out all the junk pseudo-science, and the humility to understand the difference between rational confidence and arrogance, that are the true differences between a &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is not about a difference in intelligence – not by a long shot. It’s all down to application – which true education should allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, enough pre-amble. The reason I’m writing is because of a rather scary curriculum that my colleague Jonny Scaramanga has brought to the attention of the UK press, with the most thorough article thus far being the &lt;a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6019140"&gt;original Times TES article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, both &lt;a href="http://www.richarddawkins.net/article,4116,Fundamentalist-exams-on-a-par-with-A-levels,Michael-Shaw--TES-Times-Educational-Supplement"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/nessie_disproves_evolutionin_t.php"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt; have supported by writing about it, and Twitter is ABLAZE with re-tweeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonny’s written a letter to &lt;a href="http://www.naric.org.uk/"&gt;NARIC&lt;/a&gt; which has formed the basis of the Times Educational Supplement article, and which he’s graciously given me permission to reprint here [bold emphasis added]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
NARIC recently found that International Certificate of Christian Education (ICCE) qualifications are broadly comparable to those offered by Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). As a university lecturer and former student of ICCE’s curriculum, I have a number of concerns about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            ICCE uses the Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) curriculum. This has major academic flaws of which you may not be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning and assessment methodologies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of ACE criticise its emphasis on rote learning at the expense of higher-order cognitive skills.1 Tests predominantly consist of multiple choice, matching, or fill-in-the-blanks. These means only test factual recall, not understanding. Furthermore, options on the multiple choice tests are often meaningless, e.g., “Jesus died on the___ (cross, toss, chrome).”2This cannot be compared to CIE, which makes use of essay writing and long-answer exam questions as assessment for skills such as understanding, analysis, and critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summative assessment of a CIE course tests a student’s learning over a long period of study, typically a year. By contrast, ACE students are tested after each PACE (Packet of Accelerated Christian Education), which typically takes two weeks. Combined with the emphasis on factual recall, this method of assessment promotes student “cramming” and the use of short-term memory, at the expense of retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACE curriculum includes no practical science and accordingly no investigation. CIE syllabus assessment objectives for chemistry, biology, and physics all specify that a student should learn to construct hypotheses.3 ACE is a workbook-based system, so it cannot fulfil these objectives. This would be troublesome for any ACE student embarking on a science higher education course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PACEs are based on the reading comprehension mode of learning… There is no room within this method of learning for the negotiation of topics, for whole class problem solving, for the generation of ideas, for the formulating and testing of hypotheses, discussion of results and social application.”4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACE science teaches Creationism. Leaving aside whether Creationism is true, ACE’s approach is unscientific because it does not test theories against rival theories in accepted ways.5 Rather than weighing evidence objectively, the ACE system rejects any science that contradicts the Bible, as this Year 9 Science PACE shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“True science will never contradict the Bible because God created both the universe and Scripture…If a scientific theory contradicts the Bible, then the theory is wrong and must be discarded.”&lt;/b&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The system also takes an intellectually dishonest approach to discrediting evolution. PACE 1107 (1996), for example, claims evolutionists use the “hopeful monster” theory to save the “sinking ship” of evolution. In fact, this theory was put forward by one scientist, Richard Goldschmidt, whose ideas were dismissed by his colleagues. Another PACE claims that the Loch Ness Monster exists and is proof of a young earth.7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, PACEs ridicule the theory of evolution: “No branch of true science would make these kind of impossible claims without proof. Because evolutionists do not want to believe the only alternative – that the universe was created by God – they declare evolution is a fact and believe its impossible claims without any scientific proof!”8 They also claim that Creationism has “unquestionable proofs” and “unarguable evidences,”9 both deeply unscientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racial insensitivity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACE curriculum “shows a degree of insensitivity towards blacks, Jews, and natives.”10 Users of the system have observed that some cartoons contained within the PACEs appear to depict racially segregated classrooms.11 The syllabus has also included controversial racial statements. Prideaux and Speck (1993) state that, after consulting with Aboriginal Studies Officers and the Education Department of South Australia, they found ACE materials about Aborigines were unacceptable to the Aboriginal people. ACE’s stance on apartheid is also of concern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If apartheid were done away with, the twenty million Blacks, who are not taxpayers, would be given the privilege of voting. Within a short period of time they would control the government and the means of taxation. ‘The power to tax is the power to destroy.’ …Some people want to abolish apartheid immediately. That action would certainly alter the situation in South Africa, but would not improve it.”12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although apartheid appears to allow the unfair treatment of blacks, the system has worked well in South Africa…Although white businessmen and developers are guilty of some unfair treatment of blacks, they turned South Africa into a modern industrialized nation, which the poor, uneducated blacks couldn’t have accomplished in several more decades. If more blacks were suddenly given control of the nation, its economy and business, as Mandela wished, they could have destroyed what they have waited and worked so hard for.”13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political bias&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACE materials do not allow the consideration of any opposing point of view. This goes against the skills required by degree-level study of forming an argument, considering different opinions, and analysing the validity of claims. Rather than engaging with differing points of view, ACE derides them. The ACE approach to politics borders on propaganda, with opinions presented as fact.14 An ACE booklet (1987) claims that God’s values are those of right-wing politics. The further left a person moves on the political spectrum, the further they move from God’s absolutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The substance of truth, ideals, and absolutes is on the right. Evil does not have substance: it is a departure from, and absence of the substance of, good. The left is the farthest extreme from that basic substance…Men on the left cannot walk in wisdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a further departure from the CIE syllabus, ACE promotes coverage over depth. World History, from Creation to the present, is covered in a series of 12 PACEs, each of about 40 pages. Inevitably, there is little analysis. The CIE syllabus for history at both ‘A’ and ‘O’ Level, by contrast, studies specific areas of history in depth.15 An ACE student arriving at university will have learned (and forgotten) many facts, but will not have engaged with the material. Because all the answers are contained within the PACE, the student will also not have learned how to conduct research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICCE’s defenders will point out that there are now modules available aimed at addressing some of these issues. These modules are not compulsory, nor are they offered at all ICCE schools. In any case, ACE would make up the majority of an ICCE student’s educational experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            For these reasons, and numerous others, it is my belief that ICCE is an inadequate preparation for higher education or employment in British society. It should be noted that ICCE is operated by many independent schools and homeschoolers in the UK. In spite of this, it is not recognised by the National Database of Accepted Qualifications, nor is it awarded UCAS points. I hope that UK NARIC’s endorsement of ICCE will be reconsidered in light of this evidence. I look forward to hearing your response, and would be happy to discuss this further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 I have attached an appendix that deals with this comprehensively, since it is prohibitively long to include in the body of this letter. I am aware that some of my sources date back to the mid-80s. It should be noted, however, that the ACE syllabus has changed very little in this time. In her 2005 Marshall University Masters’ thesis, Lisa Kelley noted that the 3rdedition PACEs, introduced in 1980, were still being used.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is hoped for, is a raising of the level of discourse – we need to let people, parents, students and teachers know that this sort of uncritical, non-educative brainwashing is happening. Especially this form of racist, homophobic, anti-science, anti-questioning husk of ‘education’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s currently a one-way conversation (cheers, Mr. ”Education, Education, Education”), and we need to change that right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is one thing, but this is a gross misuse of the freedoms of private religious belief, and into the indoctrination of young, enquiring minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, it’s not so much about the conclusions reached – but about the method used to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;

I deemed it a relevant post, despite the articles appearing in July, given Martin's &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/638"&gt;personal article on the same topic&lt;/a&gt;. As for all the cultural relativism talk, it's highly appropriate given the Archbishop Williams &lt;a href="http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2009/9/22/ACNS4654"&gt;attacking Reason, and promoting Faith Schools in a recent lecture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The first part was to create &lt;a href="http://www.gigagalaxyzoom.org/images.html"&gt;a magnificent all-sky view of the heavens&lt;/a&gt;; the second was a zoom in on the Milky Way showing &lt;a href="http://www.gigagalaxyzoom.org/G.html"&gt;a region choked with stars and dust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third is of &lt;a href="http://www.gigagalaxyzoom.org/W.html"&gt;the Lagoon Nebula&lt;/a&gt;, a star forming region &lt;em&gt;a quadrillion miles across&lt;/em&gt; and 400 light years in toward the center of the galaxy. And the image? Well, if you want the full-res version, you’d better have some room on your drive: it has &lt;strong&gt;370 million pixels&lt;/strong&gt; and will eat up a whopping &lt;strong&gt;700 Mb&lt;/strong&gt; of disk space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what does it look like? Heh heh heh. Like &lt;a href="http://www.gigagalaxyzoom.org/G10_caption.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/d/190506-4/phot-36a-09-hires.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/gigagalaxy_lagoon.jpg" alt="gigagalaxy_lagoon" title="gigagalaxy_lagoon" width="610" height="408"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[You know the drill, click to embiggen. Do it! Now!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. Wow. And that’s low-res! &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/archives/images/phot-36a-09-fullres.tif"&gt;Here’s the monster one if you want it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depth and detail are simply and truly jaw-dropping. You can zoom in and see young stars, massive stars, dark clouds, ribbons and sheets of gas sculpted by vast winds of subatomic particles blown off of supergiant stars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lagoon was always a favorite target of mine in the summer months when the center of the Milky Way in Scorpius and Sagittarius would just clear my neighbor’s trees. A nearby streetlight always made observing in that direction a pain, but even from a distance of 40 quadrillion kilometers away the nebulous glow of gas and newly-born stars still shone through. I wouldn’t have been able to imagine back then that I’d be able to zoom in on the Lagoon using a 2.2 meter telescope equipped with a &lt;em&gt;67 megapixel&lt;/em&gt; camera!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is science in this picture, to be sure. We can study it to look at the shape of the nebula, how it interacts with the stars and other nearby nebulae, and much more. But you know what? At this exact moment, &lt;em&gt;I don’t care&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because my oh my, the Universe is a beautiful place. And sometimes, for just a little while, that’s enough.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254239406116"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=6681">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/116b49bd904674ee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Adolescence"/><category term="Asperger's Syndrome"/><category term="Autism Lit"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Friendship"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="Teaching Strategies"/><category term="e-newsletters"/><category term="tips"/><category term="UCLA"/><title type="html">Friendships and Homework Tips</title><published>2009-09-29T14:50:15Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T14:50:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/friendships-and-homework-tips/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;UCLA has a class that offers an instruction to ASD teens that’s often lacking from a menu of therapies: How to make friends. The teen years are tough enough, but for those with ASD this time could only be a nightmare in terms of interacting with peers. The UCLA program teaches its 33 students (28 of them male) to watch for all the social clues they might commonly miss — body &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;language, hand gestures, facial expressions, speech inflections — and try to turn those improved interpretations into connections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;The class, called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PEERS (Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills), involves students meeting once a week for 12 weeks for 90-minute sessions, with instruction given in groups of seven to 10 teens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parents were also required to attend separate, concurrent sessions where they were provided direct instruction and guidance to support their child’s development (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“parental involvement was mandatory and important,” said Dr. Liz Laugeson, associate director of the UCLA Parenting and Children’s Friendship Program and director of the Help Group–UCLA Autism Research Alliance). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The class focused on teaching rules of social etiquette to the teens, while parents were given information about how to supervise the implementation of these newly learned skills. These included: how to comfortably join and exit a group of peers; how to pick the right peer group; good sportsmanship; good host behavior during get-togethers; changing bad reputations; and handling teasing, bullying and arguments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results of testing show that teens who have been through the PEERS program were having more peer interactions with their friends outside of school, and parents reported significant improvement in overall social skills, as measured by a standardized test of social functioning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N.H.-based educational consultant &lt;a href="http://susanfitzell.com/"&gt;Susan Fitzell&lt;/a&gt; has run my list of utterly subjective homework tips to educators from one special needs parent in her most recent e-letter. Among the advice: try to get a complete picture of the child’s “homework scene”; encourage parents to discuss the details of working with their child at home; and encourage parents to establish one space, preferably quiet, in the home for doing homework. I’ve used the list in lectures and such, and would be happy to send it to anyone who’s interested. Contact Susan to get on her e-list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jerry’s &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?s=trilobites&amp;amp;searchsubmit=Find+%C2%BB"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; about Steve Marley’s fantastic photo of a trilobite eye reminded me of one of the odder paleontological findings. Many trilobites have chunks taken out of them, presumably by predators. &lt;a href="http://www.phleschbubble.com/album/movies/phlesch_cambrian_01.mov"&gt;This fantastic CGI video&lt;/a&gt; – an extract of a display at the Chicago Field Museum – gives you some idea of what might have happened: at the end, a hapless Cambrian trilobite is snarfed by the top predator of the time, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/27/11/987.abstract"&gt;Anomalocaris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. (This idea &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090807/full/news.2009.811.html"&gt;has recently been disputed&lt;/a&gt; by Whitey Hagadorn of Amherst College, who has made computer models which suggests &lt;em&gt;Anomalocaris&lt;/em&gt; simply couldn’t have crunched the hard exoskeleton of a trilobite. Other people aren’t convinced and point out we’ll have to find some &lt;em&gt;Anomalocaris&lt;/em&gt; poop to settle the issue…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s odd about the munched trilobites is that, when you look at the distribution of injuries, you find a 2:1 ratio of injuries on the right hand side of the animals to injuries on the left-hand side of the animal. Like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="trilo" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/trilo1.jpg?w=350&amp;amp;h=522" alt="trilo" width="350" height="522"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure is taken from &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v337/n6209/pdf/337695c0.pdf"&gt;an article in Nature&lt;/a&gt; in 1989 by Loren Babcock and Richard Robison of the University of Kansas. The table showing the data (rather poorly reproduced below) is pretty convincing, but WHY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="table" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/table1.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=332" alt="table" width="500" height="332"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors suggested that “those scars we attribute to sublethal predation… are significantly more frequently found on the right side of the trilobites, suggesting that predators preferred to attack that side”, and they pointed the finger at &lt;em&gt;Anomalocaris&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a precedent for this kind of predator preference. In 1993, Michio Hori of Wakayama Medial College, Japan, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/260/5105/216.pdf"&gt;reported in Science &lt;/a&gt;that scale-eating chichlid fish in Lake Tanganyika showed handedness and that “attacking from behind, right-handed individuals snatches scales from the prey’s left flank and left-handed ones from the right flank”. Maybe Anomalocaris (or some other Cambrian predator) showed similar preferences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks after Babcock and Robison published their piece, Nature published &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v339/n6220/pdf/339105d0.pdf"&gt;two replies&lt;/a&gt;, one from David Maitland, the other from Stephen Stigler, contesting their interpretation.  Maitland suggested the apparent preference might be a consequence of the trilobites curling up to defend themselves (I don’t really follow his argument, to be honest), while Stigler, more interestingly, suggests this might be a problem of sample biais. Maybe the underlying assymetry is not in the predators, suggested Stigler, but in the internal organs of the trilobites: “it may be that trilobites were attacked equally often on both sides, but more of those attacked on the right side survived to join Babcock and Robison’s sample.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems to have been the last word on the question, for the moment. But I am reminded of a study I heard about a while back, which was based on thousands of beachcombing records from the English Channel, where it was found (I think in Holland), that significantly more left shoes were washed up than right (or it may have been the other way round). I’ve been unable to track down this article, or any sensible explanation. All suggestions gratefully received!&lt;/p&gt;

It's a problem for flora and fauna, which rely on the "day/night" cycle that they've adapted to over billions of years, and it's a problem for astronomers, as the light pollution disrupts observations of the night sky.  All over the world, light pollution is visible to anyone looking at the Earth, even from space.

&lt;p&gt;But I've been watching a little bit of Isabella Rossellini's &lt;a href="http://www.sundancechannel.com/greenporno/"&gt;Green Porno&lt;/a&gt;, which is a series of entertaining, educational shorts about threatened species and the environmental consequences of eating them.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while watching the episode about &lt;a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid18011345001?bclid=38107619001&amp;amp;bctid=38116035001"&gt;squid fisheries&lt;/a&gt;, I was shocked to see how severe light pollution was over the ocean where squid fisheries are located.

Hi Richard, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m on the state board of a high school student organization. As a vice-chair I was in charge of an icebreaker and we did a series of questions. As an avid reader and always on the look out for good books, one of the questions was “what is your favorite book?”. We had a great discussion until one of our members stated that the bible is the greatest book ever written. My knee jerk reaction to that was to think “have you actually READ the bible?????!!!” Really??? I didn’t know what to say to that. The person in question is starting seminary in the fall and I think this was a way to work that into the conversation however I immediately lost all respect for this woman. I knew she was Christian but didn’t realize she was THAT Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a really uncomfortable situation for me as the discussion leader. Do you have any sage words of advice on how to handle this in the future? I totally looked like an idiot, I couldn’t even comment and just moved on to the next person. I’m a non-believer and not out to anyone but my husband and son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speechless
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Speechless,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad that you remained silent. &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; you looked like an idiot, but if you had blurted out your knee jerk reaction, you likely would have looked like a bigot. I don’t think that you’re either one, but your reflex disapproval of the woman’s position put you into that awkward predicament of looking like one or the other. I think that you’ll be much more comfortable when meeting people like her if you eliminate that automatic reaction and tension inside, so that you have more control and choice over your responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please excuse me for talking at length about myself, but I think I may have something that could be helpful to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live by the maxim, “You are what you do,” and I regard others according to that criteria.  The reality of a person’s character, of their very life is in their &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt;, not in their thoughts, beliefs, self-image or self-description.  For instance, if someone thinks of themselves as a kind and honest person, but they consistently act in unkind and dishonest ways, then they are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a kind and honest person.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try very hard to treat everyone courteously, simply because they are human beings.  As I get to know them and I see persistent patterns in their conduct, their actions, their behaviors, those patterns will cause me to respect them more or less than the initial level of respectfulness that I show to everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first find out that someone is a Christian, my respect for them does not automatically go up or down.  I will only be interested in how that fact affects what they do with other people.  &lt;em&gt;In their actual conduct&lt;/em&gt; are they tolerant or intolerant of people who see things differently? &lt;em&gt;In concrete things they do&lt;/em&gt; are they compassionate or aloof to those who are suffering or struggling?  &lt;em&gt;In their observable behaviors&lt;/em&gt; are they open-hearted and fair-minded, or are they conceited and arrogant? Are they mindful and gentle with the environment, or are they wasteful and destructive &lt;em&gt;in how they really live?&lt;/em&gt; Do they in fact &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; honesty, fairness, kindness, responsibility and the encouragement of freedom? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t look for perfect performance, just persistent patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same holds true when I meet an atheist or a Muslim or a Hindu or a Buddhist, or a person in any other such category. I look at how they treat people, how they live their ethics, &lt;em&gt;what they do.&lt;/em&gt;  If they practice those virtues I mentioned, I will hold them in greater esteem and even grow to like them, regardless of their religious opinions.  There are some Christians whom I respect, admire and like.  There are some atheists whom I disrespect, disapprove of and dislike, and all the other possible combinations.  It all depends on what they do, not what they believe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Speechless, for you too, what you DID is what counts.  You did not blurt out all that disapproving stuff, you held it in check.  Good for you.  You were courteous in your conduct, or at least you were not discourteous. A challenge to her opinion of the Bible might have been completely appropriate in the proper setting such as a debate, but that icebreaker wasn’t it, and so you correctly held your tongue.  Maybe it was awkward, so what?  You commendably restrained your impulse to be antagonistic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have such impulses, but with practice we can be relieved of them to the point that they hardly ever come up.  Then we can be more relaxed and at ease with people who have different views, and not have to work so hard to mind our manners.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want this equanimity for yourself, you don’t have to change your opinion of the Bible, you only have to change your criteria for respecting people: Actions. Behaviors. Doings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into yourself and find the Golden Rule.  All normal, healthy people have it in them.  You would not want someone else to “immediately lose all respect” for you just because you like something about a book, or just because you are in a category such as “atheist.”  You’d want them to give you a fair chance to express yourself and to demonstrate your character in your actions.  Simply do that for them. If you persistently &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the Golden Rule outwardly, it will steadily become what you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; inside. You are what you do.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So imagine a future interaction just like the one you described:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: “And what is your favorite book?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her&lt;/strong&gt;:  “I think the Bible is the greatest book ever written.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;:  “Oh, that’s interesting. Can you tell me about how the Bible affects your &lt;strong&gt;actions&lt;/strong&gt; and your &lt;strong&gt;conduct&lt;/strong&gt; with other people?  How does the Bible influence the ways you &lt;strong&gt;live&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;interact&lt;/strong&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speechless, thoughts, beliefs and opinions are as insubstantial as morning mist.  They are not what you are.  If you consider this carefully enough, you’ll see that it is your actions and behaviors that make up the solid reality of your life.  By seeing yourself as a set of actions and behaviors rather than a set of thoughts, beliefs and opinions, you’ll start to see other people that way too. As you talk with people, you’ll ask questions that guide them toward a discussion about their &lt;em&gt;doings&lt;/em&gt;, and you’ll be more likely to find something interesting, and quite possibly something respectable, and maybe even something likable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll end up with friends in unexpected places.&lt;/p&gt;

of 1661, I find &lt;a href="http://oldsite.library.upenn.edu/etext/collections/science/boyle/chymist/000l.html"&gt;this great passage&lt;/a&gt; that has much bearing on how we discuss contentious issues like science and religion today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…I am not sorry to have this Opportunity of giving an example how to manage even Disputes with Civility; whence perhaps some Readers will be assisted to discern a Difference betwixt Bluntness of Speech and Strength of reason, and find that a man may be a Champion for Truth, without being an Enemy to Civility; and may confute an Opinion without railing at Them that hold it; To whom he that desires to convince and not to provoke them, must make some amends by his Civility to their Persons, for his severity to their mistakes; and must say as little else as he can, to displease them, when he says they are in an error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer is the man after whom &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyle%27s_law"&gt;Boyle’s Law&lt;/a&gt; is named; he was also a devout Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is something pretty profound in what Boyle is saying. If we follow his perspective, it may be the case that you can’t really have reasoned discussion, at least among those of different views, without a precondition of civility, acceptance, and a lack of condescension. Otherwise, the arguments, however well-based they may be, won’t get through, but will only offend; defenses will go up and nobody will give ground–none of which is what we want in reasoned discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, no matter what kind of reason-based arguments it contains, discourse might not truly be “reasonable”–in the sense of being meant to promote the spread of reason–unless it is also civil. The two may be inseparable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, I know full well that there are many other reasons for, in Boyle’s words, confuting an opinion &lt;em&gt;while also &lt;/em&gt;“railing at Them that hold it”–it can be very entertaining, or very motivating to those of us who agree. But does it spread the power of reason to those who do not? That I find hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254233688547"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-3531039447157517323">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/77c751e8e2ccf3a1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="alternative medicine" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="skepticism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The obligatory Maher post</title><published>2009-09-29T12:26:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T12:26:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/09/obligatory-maher-post.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">Welp, the atheist/skeptic blog-o-sphere is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/ask_bill_maher_and_richard_dawkins_some.php"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1868"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/the_maher_conundrum.php"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; again about Bill Maher as the recipient of the Richard Dawkins Award, so I suppose I might as well cast my two cents into the conflagration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In brief:  I'm ambivalent towards Maher getting the award; I applaud those who hope to put the screws to Maher at the AAI Conference, though I doubt they'll really get much of an opportunity; and while I would have respected it if Dawkins had remained silent on the matter (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_problem_with_writing_by_co.php#comment-1789758"&gt;he hasn't&lt;/a&gt;), I now think he is obliged to make some kind of clarifying statement distancing himself from Maher's quackademic views.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, regarding Maher getting the award...  I know the reaction to the movie &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt; in atheist circles was mixed, but I loved it.  In fact, it was the closing monologue that inspired me to become more vocal about my (lack of) belief and what I feel about the effects of religion on the modern world.  For those who haven't seen it, the closing monologue is a denouncement of religion's crimes, together with a call to arms to speak out in the name of rationality, super-imposed over a montage of video of some of religion's more disturbing consequences.  My friend Nicole transcribed the monologue when she first rented the movie, and I have included it at the bottom of this post.  My favorite line was "Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking."  I had never heard that sentiment put so succinctly or clearly before.  I know others who were similarly inspired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I have no trouble seeing why AAI would want to honor Maher for his contribution.  He made an anti-religion movie that is both powerful and mainstream.  In a sense, this was as important a contribution as &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;god is Not Great&lt;/i&gt;.  I know many of our more pedantic atheist friends hated the movie because, admittedly, it was not particularly deep in its style of argumentation, and was often unfair to the theists interviewed.  But really, it was a movie, and an op-ed one at that.  And as such, I thought it was highly effective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also think that if I were on the AAI committee tasked with choosing the recipient of the award, I would probably have argued against Maher.  His alt-med views are not only an embarrassment, but &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/"&gt;potentially quite dangerous&lt;/a&gt;.  While I am sympathetic to those who point out that AAI is an atheist group rather than a skeptic group, I think that if the word "atheist" is to meaning anything we must have some shared values.  One of those values is a disdain for magical thinking.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the evidence seems to indicate that &lt;a href="http://brucemhood.wordpress.com/about-supersense/"&gt;all of us engage in a certain amount of magical thinking&lt;/a&gt;, so it is not a problem if some atheist activists privately hold crazy viewpoints.  It would not bother me if the RDA recipient was privately anti-vaccine, but did not agitate for it.  However, when someone becomes a &lt;i&gt;mouthpiece&lt;/i&gt; for magical thinking, that crosses a line.  This doesn't mean everything Maher has done is worthless, of course, nor does it necessarily mean that we can't honor those positive contributions he has made...  but if the atheist community is to stand for anything of value, it is imperative that we make known our collective disdain for his alt-med propaganda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which leads directly to the next two points:  That the atheist community should attempt to put the screws to Maher in a very public way, and that Richard Dawkins should make his disapproval of Maher's health-related views explicit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As PZ pointed out, Maher&amp;#39;s appearance at the AAI Conference is restricted to the award ceremony itself, and I&amp;#39;ve never heard of a Q&amp;amp;A at an awards ceremony.  The grand plan hatched by Orac is not likely to play out effectively -- although I still think we can hope that some will be able to catch Maher privately and challenge him to explain/justify his anti-vaccine and other quack opinions (PZ has indicated a potential willingness to do so, for example) and publicize the results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="atheistsdisagree"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Of course, in some way, the blog-o-sphere fury over the award has already made the message fairly clear, and though some will see this as a tempest in a teapot, I am actually somewhat glad to see the amount of healthy debate surrounding this.  At this point, I don't think anyone can fairly say (as at least &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/ask_bill_maher_and_richard_dawkins_some.php#comment-1967777"&gt;one person did at Orac's blog&lt;/a&gt;) that the atheist community is about nothing other than self-congratulatory smugness in our shared disbelief.  The sizable fraction of the online atheist community which has spoken out against Maher is itself a testament to the extent to which we value rationality and question authority.  To quote &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/ask_bill_maher_and_richard_dawkins_some.php#comment-1967938"&gt;another commenter&lt;/a&gt; at Orac's blog, "Nothing is sacred," and I think this debate has proven that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last point I want to make is that I think now Richard Dawkins needs to say something, even if it's something as simple as, "I think my documentary &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enemies_of_Reason"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enemies of Reason&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enemies_of_Reason#Episode_2:_The_Irrational_Health_Service"&gt;made clear&lt;/a&gt; my position on anti-vaccine paranoia, alternative medicine, and general health-related quackery.  Though we may not approve of all of Bill Maher's expressed opinions, nevertheless I join AAI in recognizing his grand achievement in bringing atheism to the mainstream via his movie &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt;."  He doesn't need to slam Maher or say he is a bad or irrational person, he just needs to explicitly say "Maher is wrong on vaccines."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm going to quote one more &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/ask_bill_maher_and_richard_dawkins_some.php#comment-1968345"&gt;comment from Orac's blog&lt;/a&gt;, and that will be it, I promise.   stinger says: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[M]aybe he doesn't see the point of making a public fuss about an unworthy nominee. Courtesy would indicate that any public opinion he expresses be quietly supportive of the choice, and Dr. Dawkins is an extremely courteous person.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;This initially gave me some pause, and I do see some merit in this position.  However, I must respectfully disagree, and I'm sorry it comes down to something so minor, but the reason is because of one brief &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_problem_with_writing_by_co.php#comment-1789758"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; that Dawkins made on PZ's blog.  I quote it in full here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Richard Dawkins Award (RDA) has no connection with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS). The RDA was instituted by the Atheist Alliance International (AAI) several years before RDFRS was founded, or even thought of. This year, the committee of AAI took the decision to give the RDA to Bill Maher. &lt;b&gt;They asked me, as an individual, if I approved, and I was delighted to do so&lt;/b&gt; because I find him, and especially Religulous, very funny. &lt;b&gt;I know nothing of any stance he may have taken on medical questions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year, RDFRS agreed to jointly sponsor the annual conference of AAI. The decision to do so had nothing to do with the AAI's decision to give the RDA to Bill Maher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, Dawkins has not only stated his approval of Maher as the recipient, but has proclaimed ignorance of Maher's quack views on medicine.  This is unfortunate, because I think at this point it is not fair for Dawkins to plead ignorance.  It unfortunately comes across as a bit of a "Lalalalalala, I can't hear you!" ploy.  It is highly disappointing for Dawkins to endorse the decision to give Maher the award while completely ignoring the substantive component of the controversy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am afraid that this whole thing may give succor to those who falsely insist that "New Atheism" is more about fundamentalism and dogma than it is about rationality.  And that's why I feel Dawkins needs to say something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now, as promised, the closing monologue of &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Standing atop Megiddo, Israel]: It seems peaceful but this is the very spot where a lot of Christians believe life on earth will end. The irony of religion is that because of its power to divert man to destructive courses, the world actually &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; come to an end. The plain fact is, religion must die for mankind to live. The hour is getting very late to be able to indulge in having key decisions made by religious people, by irrationalists, by those who would steer the ship of state not by a compass, but by the equivalent of reading the entrails of a chicken. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;George Bush prayed a lot about Iraq but he didn’t learn a lot about it. Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking. It’s nothing to brag about, and those who preach faith and enable and elevate it are intellectual slave-holders, keeping mankind in a bondage to fantasy and nonsense that has spawned and justified so much lunacy and destruction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Religion is dangerous because it allows human beings who don’t have all the answers to think that they do. Most people would think it’s wonderful when someone says, “I’m willing, Lord. I’ll do whatever you want me to do.” Except that since there are no gods actually talking to us, that void is filled in by people with their own corruptions and limitations and agendas, and anyone who tells you they know, they just know what happens when you die, I promise you, you don’t. How can I be so sure? Because I don’t know, and you do not possess mental powers that I do not. The only appropriate attitude for man to have about the big questions is not the arrogant certitude that is the hallmark of religion, but doubt. Doubt is humble and that’s what man needs to be considering, that human history is just a litany of getting shit &lt;i&gt;dead wrong&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is why rational people, anti-religionists, must end their timidity and come out of the closet and assert themselves. And those who consider themselves only moderately religious really need to look in the mirror and realize that the solace and comfort that religion brings you actually comes at a terrible price. If you belonged to a political party or a social club that was tied to as much bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, violence, and sheer ignorance as religion is, you’d resign in protest. To do otherwise is to be an enabler, a mafia wife for the true devils of extremism that draw their legitimacy from the billions of their fellow travelers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the world does come to an end here, or wherever, or if it limps into the future, decimated by the effects of a religion-inspired nuclear terrorism, let’s remember what the real problem was: that we learned how to precipitate mass death before we got past the neurological disorder of wishing for it. That’s it. Grow up, or die. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks, Nicole!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-3531039447157517323?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254233461311"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9563">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5d4d09e80bcc5fdc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 9.29</title><published>2009-09-29T13:30:48Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T13:30:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/skepchick-quickies-9-29/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are quite a few &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?s=tim+minchin"&gt;Tim Minchin blog-posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?s=tim+minchin"&gt; with lots of information on this site&lt;/a&gt;, since I was one of the first skeptic podcasters to interview him (for the &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/www.youtube.com/watch?v=fABcXf_j4vw"&gt;TANK Vodcast, back in 2008&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we had a &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUOT_h_JSoA"&gt;four-part lengthy video interview&lt;/a&gt;, which you can see thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv"&gt;Skeptic Zone podcast&lt;/a&gt; and Stefan Sojka - which was done during the most recent tour:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUOT_h_JSoA"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUOT_h_JSoA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget, the “&lt;a href="http://www.timminchin.com"&gt;Are You Ready For This&lt;/a&gt;” Tour returns to Australia later this year, after doing Amazing Meeting London (where Tim Minchin will be presenting with the likes of &lt;a href="http://www.geologicpodcast.com"&gt;podcaster George Hrab - another skeptical musician/comedian&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/sep/28/tim-minchin-roald-dahl-matilda"&gt;Guardian article reveals some of the news about his musical project - Matilda!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I write music for theatre and I’m an actor, and comedy is what I’m doing at the moment,” he says. “But I want to have a long and varied career.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The likelihood of that increased recently, with a summons from the Royal Shakespeare Company to write a musical version of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/roalddahl"&gt;Roald Dahl&lt;/a&gt;’s novel Matilda, about a rebellious little girl with psychokinetic powers. At first, Minchin thought this was a joke: a decade previously, he had failed to secure the rights for a children’s theatre production of the novel in Perth. “It’s the only time I’ve ever got off my arse and thought, ‘That should be a musical.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the attraction – and why the RSC thought Minchin was the man for the job… Minchin has been developing the production with Matthew Warchus, director of West End shows Art and The Lord of the Rings. “The whole system is brilliant,” says Minchin. “This is the level I want to work at – with people who go: ‘No, it’s not good enough, Tim.’ It’s so invigorating. This is the most important thing I’ve ever done.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11-y-o Junior bought his first own album last Saturday: Mika's &lt;i&gt;The Boy Who Knew Too Much&lt;/i&gt;. (My own first was Depeche Mode's &lt;i&gt;Some Great Reward&lt;/i&gt;, bought at age 12 in '84 or '85). It's an excellent record once you've gotten used to Mika's queeny (and Queenish) style of singing: catchy studio pop. And Junior has this awesome "'Scuse me while I &lt;a href="http://www.kissthisguy.com/"&gt;kiss this guy&lt;/a&gt;" mishearing of one of the songs. When he told me about it and played me "By the Time" I couldn't hear it any other way either.&lt;blockquote&gt;"By the time I'm dreaming&lt;br&gt;
and you've crept out on me sleeping&lt;br&gt;

There have been many attempts and different approaches to treating the Achilles.  However the key to residing the pain may actually be in a treatment that provokes it.       From Sweden Hakan Alfredson has done considerable research on a strict exercise regiment to help people relieve their Achilles problems.  The best part about it is its non invasive, completely conservative and can be done from the comfort of your own home.Alfredson’s study found that doing “eccentric heel drops” will results in subjects with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy returning to preinjury activity levels within 12 weeks. The success rate of these subjects was  89%.The exercise has to be done in both a knee straight position and the knee bent. The idea of these two different positions is to try and train the Gastrocnemius muscle (Knee straight) and the Soleus muscle (Knee bent). Both of these muscles join to help form the Achilles tendon. The protocol is outlined as 3 sets-15 reps, twice a day, every day for 12 weeks. This includes both the knee straight and knee bent exercises (180 reps a day). The patient has to return to the starting position by using their hands or good foot. Concentric contractions have to be completely avoided.       Besides the protocol being extensive the downfall also lies in the fact these exercises have to be performed with some level of pain. If the patient is performing the exercises with no pain they have to have the exercises progressed by putting on a backpack or using weights. This increases the amount of load and force now travels through the Achilles tendon.       Furthermore, Alfredson wanted to figure out why his results were not as good for those subjects with insertional  Achilles problems (enthesopathy). A couple years later he performed the same protocol on those with Achilles entheopathies but changed the exercise to only bringing the foot to 90°. By this simple change the results went from 32% success rate in the past to 67%.   The idea behind the change was those with enthesopathies also have retrocalcaneal bursitis accompanying the problem. By bringing the foot past 90° the calcaneous shifts backwards to impinge the bursa. Doing this repeatively did not help the problem and by simply bringing the foot to 90° you eliminate this factor.        Make sure to rule out other diagnosis such as inflammatory anthropathies, posterior impingement syndrome, Haglunds disease and Sever’s disease.1.Alfredson, H., &amp;amp; Cook, J.

Indeed, Dr. R. W. Donnell once quite aptly referred to this phenomenon, where wildly implausible claims with no science behind them somehow find truck in some of the oldest and most prestigious academic medical centers, as "&lt;a href="http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html"&gt;quackademic medicine&lt;/a&gt;." Therapeutic touch, reiki, acupuncture, it doesn't matter. Somehow, much of medical academia seems to have forgotten the scientific principles that should underpin modern medicine, at least when it comes to ancient claims from prescientific times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it's not just medical academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary care physicians are on the front lines of medical care in this country. They take care of patients, big and small, healthy and chronically ill, old and young. They are the ones patients visit when they have back pain, headache, fever, coughs, chills, and the entire panoply of symptoms that plague humankind. These symptoms can mean anything from nothing, being entirely self-limited, to impending death from cancer, and it's up to primary care doctors figure out which is which, or at least to know when he can't and to which specialist he needs to refer a patient. Through it all, primary care doctors manage a wide variety of diseases and conditions, from diabetes to hypertension to heart disease to any number of other problems that plague so many of us. Taking care of so many different conditions requires a wide knowledge, keen diagnostic skills, and a good bedside manner. It does not require primary care doctors to embrace woo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the A&lt;a href="http://www.aafp.org"&gt;merican Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt; (AAFP) doesn't see it that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_american_academy_of_family_practice_endorses_quackery.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_american_academy_of_family_practice_endorses_quackery.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/vZXTpb3IiF4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254230862203"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=5648">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/910c8d7a677a89b7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Change of address for LCROSS</title><published>2009-09-29T13:23:55Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T13:23:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/29/change-of-address-for-lcross/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/lcross.jpg" alt="LCROSS" title="LCROSS" width="246" height="240"&gt;I know I said that NASA’s LCROSS impactor was going to smack into the crater Cabeus-A on October 9th, but NASA  changed their minds: &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/main/index.html"&gt;the new target is the crater Cabeus proper&lt;/a&gt;. New analysis of data from other probes indicates that Cabeus has more hydrogen locked up in the regolith than Cabeus-A, and in fact has the highest hydrogen concentration in the south polar region. As an added bonus, the topography of the crater is such that a valley will let sunlight hit the plume of ejected dust sooner than it would have had they stayed with Cabeus-A as a target. That gives scientists more time to look at the ejecta, and earlier is better because the plume will be denser too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this is the right choice for NASA, but I have to say I’m impressed they can change their plans this late in the game.

Your answer depends on how you answer these five questions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the earth getting warmer? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the cause of global warming human activity? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much warmer is it going to get? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the consequences of a warmer climate? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much should we invest in altering the climate? Here are my answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global warming is real and primarily human caused. With questions 3 and 4, however, estimates include error bars that grow wider the further out we run the models because complex systems like climate are notoriously difficult to predict. I provisionally accept the estimate of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that the mean global temperature by 2100 will increase by 4.7 degrees Fahrenheit, and that sea levels will rise by about one foot (about the same as they have risen since 1860). Moderate warming with moderate changes. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 4 deserves even more skepticism. In his carefully-reasoned and politically-bipartisan book &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cool It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Alfred Knopf, 2008), the “skeptical environmentalist” Bjorn Lomborg notes that if global warming continues unchecked through the end of the century there will be 400,000 more heat-related deaths annually; there will be also be 1.8 million fewer cold-related deaths, for a net gain of 1.4 million lives. This is not to say that global warming is good, only that its consequences must be weighed in the balance. For example, Lomborg sites data from the World Wildlife Fund that at most we will lose 15 polar bears a year due to global warming, but what doesn’t get reported is that 49 bears are shot each year. What would be more cost-effective to save polar bear lives — spend hundreds of billions of dollars to lower CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and (maybe) the mean global temperature, or limit hunting permits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to question 5 — the economics of global climate change — which I think needs a sound dose of skepticism, particularly since the collapse of our economy. Even if all countries had ratified the Kyoto Protocol and lived up to its standards (which most did not), according to the IPCC, at best it would have postponed the 4.70F average increase just five years from 2100 to 2105, at a cost of $180 billion a year! By comparison, although global warming may cause an increase of two million deaths due to hunger annually by 2100, the U.N. estimates that for $10 billion a year we could save 229 million people from hunger annually today. It’s time for economic triage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economics is about the efficient allocation of limited resources that have alternative uses. And after the U.S. government allocated a trillion dollars of our limited resources to shore up our flagging financial foundations, those alternative uses have never seemed so pressing. Should we (can we?) really allocate the equivalent of a Manhattan Project to lower CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions 50 percent by 2050 and 80 percent by 2100, as the IPCC recommends in order to divert disaster? My answer is no. Why? Because the potential benefits for the costs incurred are simply not warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had, say, $50 billion a year to make the world a better place for more people, how would you spend it? In 2004, Lomborg asked this question to a group of scientists and world leaders, including four Nobel laureates. This “Copenhagen Consensus,” as it is called, ranked reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions 16th out of 17 challenges. The top four were: controlling HIV/AIDS, micronutrients for fighting malnutrition, free trade to attenuate poverty, and battling malaria. A 2006 Copenhagen Consensus of U.N. ambassadors constructed a similar list, with communicable diseases, clean drinking water, and malnutrition at the top, and climate change at the bottom. A late 2008 meeting that included five Nobel Laureates recommended that President-elect Barack Obama allocate his promised $150 billion in subsidies for new technologies and $50 billion in foreign aid be allocated for research on malnutrition, immunization, and agricultural technologies. For a cool Kyoto $180 billion you can buy a lot of condoms, vitamin tablets, and mosquito nets and rescue hundreds of millions of people from disease, starvation, and impoverishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are skeptical of Lomborg and his branch of environmental skepticism, read the Yale University economist William Nordhaus’ technical book &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Question of Balance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Yale University Press, 2008). Nordhaus computes the costs-benefits of various recommendations for changing the climate by either 2105 or 2205, primarily focused on the cost of curbing carbon emissions. Economists like to compute future profits and losses based on investments made today, adjusting for the value of a future dollar at an average interest rate of four percent. If we spent a trillion dollars today (the equivalent of the recent bailout or the Iraq war), how much climate change would it buy us in a century at four percent interest? Nordhaus’s calculations are compared to doing nothing, where a plus value is better and a minus value worse than doing nothing. Kyoto with the U.S. is plus one and without the U.S. zero, for example, and a gradually increasing global carbon tax is a plus three. That is, a $1 trillion cost today buys us $3 trillion of benefits in a century. Al Gore’s proposals, by contrast, score a minus 21, where $1 trillion invested today in Gore’s plans would net us a loss of $21 trillion in 2105. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to these calculations the numerous other crises we face, such as the housing calamity, the financial meltdown, the coming collapse of social security and medicare, two wars, a failing public education system, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion we need to chill out on all extremist plans that entail expenses best described as Brobdingnagian, require our intervention into developing countries best portrayed as imperialistic, or involve state controls best portrayed as fascistic. Give green technologies and free markets a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a bit late to the latest round of this party, but &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=470"&gt;as I have previously pointed out,&lt;/a&gt; The Huffington Post has been since its inception a bastion of pseudoscience, especially in the medical field. Like distressingly many news outlets, it has decided to abandon all pretense of being “fair and balanced” in its actual content when it comes to its ideological stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arianna Huffington clearly is enamored of anti-scientific pseudomedical nonsense. Earlier in her career she wrote for and frequently appeared on Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher – another &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1868"&gt;quack-friendly&lt;/a&gt; media personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is no surprise that the HuffPo has been a haven for unscientific dangerous medical misinformation. Specifically, writers for the HuffPo, including David Kirby, have consistently taken an anti-vaccine stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science blogging community just can’t keep up with the steady stream of medical stupid coming from the HuffPo, but occasionally an article or group of articles reaches a critical mass of stupid and triggers a response. Such is the case recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1906"&gt;Peter Lipson at Science-Based Medicine &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/even_more_quackery_at--where_else--the_h.php"&gt;Orac at Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt; point out that Dana Ullman, a notorious apologist for homeopathy, an absurd and discredited medical cult, has started blogging for the HuffPo. If Arianna wanted to further drag down the overall scientific quality of her news site (a difficult task), Ullman was a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first post, as Peter says, is an “ignorant load of goat droppings.” Essentially, Ullman argues that symptoms are the body’s way of fighting disease, and that by treating symptoms real doctors are impairing the body’s attempts to heal itself naturally. This is pure ideological nonsense, or crap-based medicine, as we call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real life is far more complex than Ullman’s childish straw men. Sometimes symptoms have nothing to do with the body’s reaction to a disease or infection, it is a symptom of a primary malfunction of the body. The hands shake in Parkinson’s disease because cells in the brain that regulate movement have died, and now the system is malfunctioning. We cannot fix or replace these lost brain cells – but we are working on it. We are approaching the problem from every conceivable angle – slowing down the rate of degeneration, or even replacing the cells with new ones. So far any gains in this area have been minimal at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we can partly compensate for the lost cells pharmacologically, by replacing their lost function. This reduces symptoms, and dramatically increases function and quality of life. Scientists have even obsessed for years over the question of if particular treatments might accelerate the degeneration of neurons, because we wanted to be sure that the treatments were not having any unintended consequences. The evidence so far is reassuring that treatments do not worsen long term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every symptom of every disease requires a similarly complex and individual assessment – not blanket and self-serving ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ullman basically gets everything wrong – so he should feel right at home at the HuffPo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/28/huffpo-still-pushing-antivax-nonsense/"&gt;Phil Plait, the Bad Astronomer&lt;/a&gt;, takes on Frank Lipman who brought out the anti-vax crazy for the HuffPo. Yes, that’s right, Frank Lipman, even though he has an MD after his name, was just pwned by an astronomer about a medical issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipman essentially advises not to get the flu vaccine because there is insufficient evidence for its safety and effectiveness. I respect this approach to a medical question – assessing the evidence. But then Lipman goes on to recommend that instead people rely upon a host of quackery with even less evidence – including homeopathy. This is not just stupid, it’s hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipman basically misrepresents the evidence to make his point. On his website he cites Cochrane database reviews, arguing that they show the flu vaccine doesn’t work. But the very reviews he cites, for healthy adults, for example, conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenza vaccines are effective in reducing cases of influenza, especially when the content predicts accurately circulating types and circulation is high. However, they are less effective in reducing cases of influenza-like illness and have a modest impact on working days lost. There is insufficient evidence to assess their impact on complications. Whole-virion monovalent vaccines may perform best in a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact the review shows that the vaccine is 90% effective when the strain in the vaccine matches the strain that is going around that season, but this effectiveness drops to 50% when the strains do not match. This means that the flu vaccine works, but there is room for improvement. Yet amazingly Lipman reads this and concludes that the vaccine does not work and recommends that people do not get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of the other subgroups he cites – the evidence shows the flu vaccine works, but Lipman still manages to get the bottom line wrong. He also ignores the fact that focusing on subgroups misses a major advantage of the vaccine – herd immunity. The best way to prevent the flu is to keep it from spreading, and that’s what herd immunity does, but that requires high rates of vaccine compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these shenanigans at the HuffPo have motivated the most popular science blogger, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/die_huffpo_die.php"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;, to advise his readers to boycott the HuffPo, and to yearn for its demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us in the science blogging community have wondered aloud if our criticism of the anti-science at the HuffPo is even being noticed. A few months ago it seemed that the editors of the HuffPo blinked at all this criticism – maybe resulting in a brief flirtation with some actual science writing over there, but clearly after reflection they have abandoned scientific legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Huffington Post now seems hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In January, a study conducted by the Parents Television Council (PTC) found 94 advertisers for the CBS show Two and a Half Men. According to the PTC, the show features countless jokes involving adult themes, and many include dialogue with a child actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glen Erickson with the PTC says sponsors were contacted about the show’s content. “So often we find the advertisers are not aware of the content issues the show has,” he points out. “We are continuing to bang our drum, and we have seen some terrific success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 31 advertisers have dropped the show.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, PTC?  “Two and a Half Men” is too &lt;em&gt;edgy&lt;/em&gt; for you?  You would think they’d go after the show immediately after it, “The Big Bang Theory”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, what does the Parents Television Council deem worthy and unworthy for children to watch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/familyguide/weekly.asp"&gt;color-coded chart on their own website&lt;/a&gt; that tells parents what they should allow their children to watch or not watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green = Ok&lt;br&gt;
Red = Not Ok&lt;br&gt;
Yellow = Somewhere in the middle (perhaps similar to a PG-13 movie)&lt;br&gt;
Gray = Not yet rated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Monday.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Monday.png" alt="Monday" title="Monday" width="434" height="214"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Tuesday.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Tuesday.png" alt="Tuesday" title="Tuesday" width="432" height="212"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s see… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTC green-lighted two game shows that encourage risk-taking with money (and, frankly, the idea that you can win money without having any real knowledge or education).  In fact, they &lt;a href="http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/shows/greenratings.asp"&gt;green-light&lt;/a&gt; most game shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They think “Survivor” and just about every drama on television are unsuitable for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, they still haven’t gotten around to rating “Cougar Town.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess one upside is that “The Simpsons” is no longer considered absolutely unsuitable.  When that show premiered twenty years ago, groups like PTC were denouncing it left and right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just seems so useless to rate shows this way.  It’s up to every parent to decide what they want their children to see, and it’s fine that PTC has their recommendations.  But there is a lot to be gained from watching shows that discuss controversial topics.  Based on &lt;a href="http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/shows/yellowratings.asp"&gt;their lists&lt;/a&gt;, the PTC seems to want to discourage children from seeing them.  I find that unhealthy.  Parents ought to watch those programs with their children and discuss them afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many parents who try to follow the PTC’s recommendations have kids who find ways to watch these “red-light” shows, anyway.  I suspect many of them do…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone reading this who was not allowed to watch certain shows as a child?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did you subvert the system?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They list 15 podcasts that will make you smarter, and the SGU is on the list. Thanks, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make a good point that time is precious and having the ability to consume media on your own schedule is very valuable. I think podcasts have taken off in just a few years because they are an extremely convenient medium. You can download them in the background, occasionally sync up your iPod or other device, and have hours of interesting content at your fingertips. You can listen to podcasts while you drive, work (depending on your job), exercise, walk the dog, or otherwise perform a tedious but necessary task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not only are podcasts awesome, the SGU is awesome among podcasts. So spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

Earlier today I joined this blog as a guest blogger, hoping to sharpen my writing and find a new audience to inflict it upon - thanks Martin, for the opportunity. I look forward to writing here, and being part of a collective - something I never quite experienced in my &lt;a href="http://evolvefresno.blogspot.com/"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blog.reconciliationecology.org/"&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why the sad note?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes from &lt;a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/thomas-sam-and-wife-manju-jailed-for-babys-eczema-death/story-e6frf7l6-1225780501304"&gt;this news item&lt;/a&gt; in the Australian Herald Sun which I came across earlier today and which seems appropriate to address in the Lay Scientist: an educated (tertiary - so says the paper) couple, Thomas Sam and Manju, were convicted in Sydney of manslaughter for allowing their 9-month-old baby to die of severe eczema by relying solely on &lt;i&gt;homeopathic remedies&lt;/i&gt; because the father is a homeopath himself! How deluded must someone be to allow their own child to suffer a painful death (I can't imagine &lt;i&gt;eczema&lt;/i&gt; killing even a child all that quickly) without trying every available treatment! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parent of still small children, I can understand and sympathize with people who turn in desperation to "alternative" medicines when conventional treatments fail. But this really boggles the mind: sacrificing one's own child to one's faith in quackery?! The judge was correct in describing Thomas as "arrogant", and their failure to seek proper assistance as "cruelty". Then again, this isn't exactly uncommon among the faithful of various stripes, be they Christian "scientists" or Gandhian "natureopaths" or homeopaths - some parents seem all too willing to put their belief above their children's lives! I will never understand that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other element of this story, the reason it caught my eye, is that this couple apparently came from my home country of India (although the newspaper story never brings up their background, their names and photos hint at south Asian origins). Unfortunately, India happens to be a country where homeopathy thrives along with a wide array of "alternative" medical practices. Combating such quackery and woo is harder in India because there are several indigenous schools of medicine, most prominent being &lt;i&gt;Ayurveda&lt;/i&gt;, with deep cultural and religious roots, and varying levels of empiricism and success. It is therefore easy for most people to be suspicious of "western" medicine regardless of the scientific evidence supporting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed science itself may be deemed as a "western" or "colonial"/"imperial" project, as if that historical connection justifies rejecting rationality itself! The multinational drug companies don't make things any easier either, with poorly regulated drug trials on human subjects often carried out in India to evade stricter scrutiny from govt. / institutional review boards in the developed world. &lt;i&gt;(I know someone in my current neighborhood in California who gave up potentially lucrative drug trials in India because of the ethical problems with how poorly it is conducted.)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, you have a malnourished, impoverished, and largely illiterate (certainly about science) populace that is prey to all kinds of purveyors of woo! And its typical of Indian culture that not only do we have ancient traditions prevailing, but also every new kind of woo taking hold among a large gullible segment of the population, from homeopathy to The Secret via Oprah!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Where does one begin to unravel that irrational Gordian knot? How do we, schooled in "western" science, combat this level of irrationality in that climate back home? Let me leave you, on this my first day here, with that weighty question to ponder! And I promise to find cheerier subjects to blog about while I'm here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why the sad note?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes from &lt;a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/thomas-sam-and-wife-manju-jailed-for-babys-eczema-death/story-e6frf7l6-1225780501304"&gt;this news item&lt;/a&gt; in the Australian Herald Sun which I came across earlier today and which seems appropriate to address in the Lay Scientist: an educated (tertiary - so says the paper) couple, Thomas Sam and Manju, were convicted in Sydney of manslaughter for allowing their 9-month-old baby to die of severe eczema by relying solely on &lt;i&gt;homeopathic remedies&lt;/i&gt; because the father is a homeopath himself! How deluded must someone be to allow their own child to suffer a painful death (I can't imagine &lt;i&gt;eczema&lt;/i&gt; killing even a child all that quickly) without trying every available treatment! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parent of still small children, I can understand and sympathize with people who turn in desperation to "alternative" medicines when conventional treatments fail. But this really boggles the mind: sacrificing one's own child to one's faith in quackery?! The judge was correct in describing Thomas as "arrogant", and their failure to seek proper assistance as "cruelty". Then again, this isn't exactly uncommon among the faithful of various stripes, be they Christian "scientists" or Gandhian "natureopaths" or homeopaths - some parents seem all too willing to put their belief above their children's lives! I will never understand that.

While the AAFP claims to strongly support evidence-based medicine, I have observed a gradual infiltration of CAM into their journal, their website, and their CME offerings. They seem to be more concerned with the popularity of CAM and with not offending its believers than with maintaining scientific rigor. The problem is only getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href="http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/publications/news/news-now/health-of-the-public/20090916cam-rpt.html"&gt;a “News Now” article &lt;/a&gt;was published on the AAFP website: “New Report Details Billions Americans Spend on Complementary, Alternative Medicine: Physicians Can Benefit from Adding CAM to Their Practices, Says FP” It is very disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts by talking about how many people use CAM and how much money is spent on it, and by recommending that family physicians try to get some of that moola for themselves. It says CAM “can help many diverse patients and earn FPs added compensation.” There is no doubt that it can earn FPs compensation, but the claim that it “can help many diverse patients” is questionable. An “integrative” family physician, Dr. Blackwelder, is quoted as saying &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family doctors should recognize many patients use such approaches, and explore for them in an open and nonjudgmental way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can absolutely agree with that. He advocates good bedside manner and empathy. I can absolutely agree with that too. But then he goes on to say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the physician-patient encounter creates a suggestible moment similar to what is done in a hypnosis session. Use that power!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would hope that we are not hypnotizing our patients and gaining undue influence to promote things that don’t work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems to be exactly what he is advocating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family physicians can build in discussions of CAM during face-to-face office visits for specific complaints, he said, by suggesting, for example, nasal irrigation for allergies and respiratory problems; yoga relaxation breathing for insomnia and anxiety; yin yoga for back, hip and flexibility problems; journaling for grief, depression, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma; and meditation and prayer for hypertension, stress and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, they could suggest those things. They could also suggest bloodletting to balance the humours, witch doctors, Perkins’ tractors, homeopathic remedies that are nothing but water, a Breatharian diet, and their own personal brand of snake oil. They could, but they shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer for hypertension? &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19662465?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Doesn’t work.&lt;/a&gt; In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19019516?ordinalpos=11&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;one study &lt;/a&gt;showed that prayer actually increased the likelihood of hypertension. Journalling for rheumatoid arthritis? Says who?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;family physicians can take advantage of patients’ interest in osteopathic manipulation by making it part of their family medicine practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t seem to care whether it is an effective treatment – patients are “interested” in it and that’s enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recommends FPs go to a weekend course to learn acupuncture techniques, because “they’re helpful when working with patients who have addictions, such as smoking.” Oh, really? &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16437420?ordinalpos=5&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A recent Cochrane review &lt;/a&gt;was not confident that they were helpful. It concluded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no consistent evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electrostimulation are effective for smoking cessation, but methodological problems mean that no firm conclusions can be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Anyway, why go to a real acupuncture course? Why not just learn to do sham acupuncture? Sham acupuncture has been shown by good research to work just as well as “real” acupuncture and is a lot easier: you don’t have to bother learning the mythology of qi and the location of meridians and acupuncture points. You can just stick the needles anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;physicians are becoming more comfortable with botanicals and supplements now because such products can be standardized and specific dosages recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, they can be standardized, but unfortunately under the DSHEA most of the products on the market are neither standardized nor checked for purity. Unless you can recommend a specific product that you can be sure is safe and reliable, recommending supplements is a risky business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he claims that a number of CAM remedies have solid study data demonstrating their efficacy and safety, and he lists several of these. Most of his examples are questionable. For some of them, there is solid study data showing they don’t work. For instance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Saw palmetto for benign prostatic hypertrophy. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19370565?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;The most recent Cochrane review &lt;/a&gt;(2009) found that it was “not more effective than placebo for treatment of urinary symptoms consistent with BPH.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Gingko for claudication. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19370657?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A Cochrane systematic review from 2009 &lt;/a&gt;found “no evidence that Ginkgo biloba has a clinically significant benefit for patients with peripheral arterial disease.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Turmeric to prevent Alzheimer’s. The only “evidence” I could find for this was the observation that people in India have a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s and they eat a lot of food with turmeric in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he thinks these treatments are supported by solid study data, his idea of solid data is very different from mine. And yes, of course it is. Because he supports CAM and is willing to accept the results of any study that supports his beliefs, regardless of whether it is a well-designed study or junk science, or whether it is contradicted by more rigorous studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/policy/policies/c/complementarypractice.html"&gt;An AAFP policy statement on CAM &lt;/a&gt;says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AAFP advocates the evaluation of these alternative treatments and complementary practice through various means including evidenced-based [sic] outcomes research as to their efficacy and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One wonders what other “various means” they would recommend. &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/11Ind/weil.html"&gt;Stoned thinking a la Andrew Weil?&lt;/a&gt; Intuition? Dreams? The notoriously unreliable “in my experience” opinions of clinicians? Anecdotes? A popularity contest? Dowsing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already embarrassed by my association with an Air Force that is now &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28930238/"&gt;teaching battlefield acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;. Now I’m embarrassed to be a member of the AAFP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year Charlotte Pop Fest will celebrate the life of Charles Darwin and all proceeds from the event will benefit the &lt;em&gt;Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason &amp;amp; Science&lt;/em&gt;. The year 2009 is the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his book &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the organizer, the reason was to raise awareness for science education, which he said was, “really important.” But of course there are some who don’t think science education is important, such as one of the event’s sponsors, who pulled out. The result was that some of the bands had to be canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_bIvz4y_eCLo/SO4eRUdJB9I/AAAAAAAAAOI/npZCKZB8GR4/s320/WilliamDonohue02.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_bIvz4y_eCLo/SO4eRUdJB9I/AAAAAAAAAOI/npZCKZB8GR4/s320/WilliamDonohue02.jpg" alt="" width="163" height="192"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/bill_donohue_is_getting_antici.php"&gt;Crusty old Bill Donohue thinks everything’s about him&lt;/a&gt; – Donohue, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKLlxAgMO-w"&gt;everyone’s favorite defender of child rapists&lt;/a&gt;, has learned of the Center For Inquiry’s coming Blasphemy Day (Sept. 30), a yearly event started in 2005 on the anniversary of the publication of the infamous Danish cartoons. And if you’re Bill Donohue, this information can only point to one possibly conclusion: this is all about discriminating against Christians. No, clearly nothing about this celebration has anything to do with any other religions, least of all Islam. Nope. Just Christians. That’s why we named it Anti-Christian Day. Oh, wait. No we didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://diminishingreturns.net/images/blog/06winter/madonna_middle_finger_100h.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://diminishingreturns.net/images/blog/06winter/madonna_middle_finger_100h.gif" alt="" width="81" height="101"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/09/28/god-hates-madonna-concerts/"&gt;God vs. Madonna. . .no, the other Madonna&lt;/a&gt; – A Bulgarian pastor has blamed a boating tragedy that killed 15 people on a Madonna concert because “God” was apparently pissed off at people for attending the concert. Pfft, everyone knows God always preferred Cindy Lauper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikolay stressed that the day of the Madonna concert, August 29, had coincided with a holy day commemorating the beheading of John the Baptist, and therefore was not a day for enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s all the evidence I need. Can’t argue with that bulletproof logic. Though I’d be incredibly immused if Madonna fired back by saying that those 15 people would have been spared if they’d only worn their Kabbalah bracelets and didn’t follow that false prophet, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently though, none of the posters of this bulletin or the originator of it bothered to actually read the article. . .or you know, the very next sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as &lt;a title="More articles about swine influenza." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/influenza/swine_influenza/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;swine flu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Immunizations - general overview." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/immunizations-general-overview/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; start next month, some people getting them will drop dead of heart attacks or strokes, some children will have &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Seizures." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/seizures/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;seizures&lt;/a&gt; and some pregnant women will miscarry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those events will not necessarily have anything to do with the vaccine.

&lt;p&gt;First, a hearty congratulations to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/"&gt;Brian Switek&lt;/a&gt;, whose book, now titled &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencefactory.co.uk/content/authors.php?aid=128"&gt;Written In Stone&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; is set to be published &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/09/coming_soon_written_in_stone.php"&gt;next fall&lt;/a&gt;!  If the sample chapters I saw a few months back are any indication, Brian's book will be a superb addition to the science lover's bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;a href="http://inversesquare.wordpress.com/"&gt;Tom Levenson&lt;/a&gt; will be speaking at MIT next Tuesday, 6 October, about his recent and &lt;a href="http://skullsinthestars.com/2009/07/26/thomas-levensons-newton-and-the-counterfeiter/"&gt;much appreciated&lt;/a&gt; book &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/2-9780151012787-1"&gt;Newton and the Counterfeiter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Third, on top of everything else I'm trying to do (like get a career started), I've started writing one myself.  For an appropriately loose definition, it'll be &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Until-Earthset-Blake-Stacey/dp/1442128771/"&gt;my second&lt;/a&gt;; either way, it means I'll be around these parts even less than I have been of late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/09/book_news_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScienceAfterSunclipse/~4/3FrzfW5kftE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/index.xml</id><title type="html">Science After Sunclipse</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254200868106"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MentalIndigestion/~3/10o4ZWD_mv4/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/24d9acb3fb06a837</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">A shortcut to mushrooms…</title><published>2009-09-28T20:01:54Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T20:01:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/wz7ghPeU4mQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MentalIndigestion/~3/10o4ZWD_mv4/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I REFER in this case not to one of the opening chapters of the Fellowship of the Rings, but in fact to the  September edition of Trends in Microbiology, in which a Dutch research team lead by Luis Lugones describe some interesting work with mushrooms.

I was disturbed by the notion. My initial reaction was that this places minority students who cannot pay for internships at a disadvantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DrugMonkey has a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/09/student_interns_should_get_cre.php"&gt;post up now&lt;/a&gt; addressing a similar issue. In it, the esteemed Dr. Monkey takes the hard line stance that undergraduate student research assistants should always be either receiving credit or being paid for their time. In principle, I could not agree more with his post. I remember being an undergraduate, trying to work two jobs to put myself through school as the first person in my family to complete college, and &amp;quot;volunteering&amp;quot; in a lab, grasping any opportunity I could get my hands on. While I certainly gained several valuable skills, it also blew very hard and I try to not take advantage of the undergraduates at MRU the same way. I also try not to catch a case of &amp;quot;If it was good enough for me...&amp;quot;  One thing I think about frequently is that there is a limit in terms of the number of hours per week we can ask a student to spend in the lab and still expect them to be successful in their studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, let me present Dr. Monkey and my readers with the following ethical dilemmas I find myself faced with...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Say Dr. Isis has a hypothetical student who comes to her for an employment opportunity. Dr. Isis tells said student that there is money available to pay her for 10 hours per week of her time. This student then asks if she can spend hours above and beyond the 10 in order to gain "additional experience." Is it ethical to allow the student to spend additional time in the lab?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Dr. Isis mentors a few undergraduate interns each semester who spend time in the laboratory for credit. There is a limit to the number of students that can take internships for credit in an individual lab, but Dr. Isis is frequently approached by additional students who still want to spend time in the lab, even knowing that they will receive no pay or credit because Dr. Isis is basically amazing. There is certainly a limit to how many students one can get to know in a semester, how many letters one can write, and how many projects one can devote to undergraduates, but assuming these are not limiting reagents, is it ethical to allow them in the lab?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Assume Dr. Isis has a student who worked in the lab for credit over the summer and who made tremendous independent progress. Said student participated in a project to the verge of publication, but the project was not completed before the summer term ended and the student wants to see the project to completion. Dr. Isis cannot allow the student in the lab again for credit and does not have money to pay the student. Is it ethical to allow the student to spend an additional semester in the lab finishing the project?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/cash_or_credit_for_student_lab.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/bfCGAT9Qnaw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254200119608"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/?p=1891">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7e94965454f4679a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><category term="Writing Elsewhere"/><title type="html">The Continuing Adventures of the Blind Locksmith: You Can’t Get There From Here</title><published>2009-09-29T04:12:49Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T04:12:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/09/29/the-continuing-adventures-of-the-blind-locksmith-you-cant-get-there-from-here/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/prevsite/lockandkey200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133"&gt;Three years ago, I wrote a series of blog posts about how scientists at the University of Oregon reconstructed the 450-million-year history of a protein. You can read the posts &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2006/04/06/the-blind-locksmith/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2006/04/07/the-blind-locksmith-continued-the-mushy-definition-of-complexity/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2006/04/10/the-final-adventures-of-the-blind-locksmith/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. What was particularly elegant about the study was how the scientists recreated the ancestral protein as it existed over 400 million years ago, to see how it functioned. Then they  pinpointed the mutations that transformed the protein, shifting it from an old function to a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the scientists tried to run their experiment backwards. They tried to turn the new protein back into the old one. And they failed. In that failure, they’ve discovered something important. They argue that when it comes to evolution, you can’t go home again.&lt;/p&gt;

(Wait, I really do try to be that! Guise not needed!) I was prepared to have my worldview changed completely based on what I was told and what happened. I simply would keep my opinion to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who has a serious heart condition. It is as yet undiagnosed, and it causes considerable discomfort. Many of the shops in Sedona sell crystals which are supposed to solve health problems such as these, so I presented my case to the shop owners and asked for help. It went like this:&lt;/p&gt;

One paper of particular interest is a cool merger of evolution, computational biology, structural biology and protein engineering.An interesting question in evolution is to what degree are changes reversible.  In the simplest case, of purely neutral characteristics, the answer would seem to be largely that they are.  However, even a purely neutral change will have a certain probability of reverting.  For example, since transversions (mutation of a pyrimidine to a purine or vice versa) are less common than transitions (purine-&amp;gt;purine or pyrimidine-&amp;gt;pyrimidine), a C-&amp;gt;G mutation (transversion) is less likely to return to C than a C-&amp;gt;T (transition).  Similarly, if a C is methylated but that methylation serves no purpose, the methylation will favor conversion to a T, but the T has no such biochemical slanting to mutate to a C.  But even these will be small changes.But throw in some function, and the question gets more complicated.  The question that this paper addresses is a specific receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor. A previous paper by the group showed that the inferred ancestral form was promiscuous,  primarily bound some related steroids, but did have some affinity for glucocorticoids.  This ancestral form existed in the last common ancestor of cartilaginous and bony fishes but by the time of the last common ancestor for bony fishes and tetrapods (such as us) it had fixed a specificity for corticosteroids.  These inferred ancestral receptors are referred to respectively as AncGR1 and AncGR2.While there are 37 amino acid replacements between AncGR1 and AncGR2, it takes only two of these (group X) to switch the preference of AncGR1 to corticoidsteroids.  The change is accomplished by substantially swinging a helix to a new position in the ligand binding pocket (helix 7)  Only three more substitutions (group Y) enforce specificity for corticosteroids; make all 5 of these changes and you convert a promiscuous receptor with weak activity towards corticosteroids to one activated only by them.  But the interesting kicker is you can&amp;#39;t make this second set of specificity-locking mutations until 2 other mutations (group Z) are made.  The issue is that the first two X mutations cause a significant structural shift which is not entirely stable; without the stability of the group Z pair of mutations the group Y specificity trio can&amp;#39;t be tolerated.But, there&amp;#39;s a kicker.  If you engineer the AncGR2 protein back to having the ancestral states for groups X, Y and Z, the resulting protein is non-functional for any ligand.  Something is going on somewhere in those other 30 changes.  Some further phylogenetic filtering suggested 6 strong candidates and the solution of the X-ray structure of the AncGR2 ligand binding domain (though it turns out the prior homology model of this structure was apparently almost dead on).  Five of the candidates (group W) turn out to either be in or to contact that swung helix 7.  The structure of AncGR1 had been previously solved and a comparison of the AncGR1 and AncGR2 structures showed that the ancestral (AncGR1) forms at these 5 positions stabilize the ancestral position of helix 7 and the derived (AncGR2) amino acids at these positions actually clash with the AncGR1 positioning of helix 7.  Aynthesis of AncGR2 with the ancestral amino acids at groups X, Y, Z and W yielded a receptor whose specificity is very like AncGR1.  One group W substitution had a strong enough effect it could imbue the ancestral phenotype even without the other group W changes but some of the other group W changes could be made only in pairs to show an effect.  Finally, receptors with the ancestral state for combinations of x, y and z mutations (e.g. combining with Xyz -- AncGR2 for X but AncGR1-like at y and z) and found that any combination with xW is non-functional.  AncGR2 with ancestral amino acids at x,y,z &amp;amp; w is not as good a receptor as AncGR1 -- suggesting that at least some of the remaining 25 positions contribute.So, this is a well-detailed case where evolutionary change eventually blocked the route back to the start.  A receptor which made the group X changes could still bind the original ligands but that would be lost once the group Y changes were layered on.  Group Y changes were probably preceded by group Z changes which would have made reversion to the original binding specificity unlikely -- and the group W mutations really nail shut the door.This particular system was a single polypeptide chain.  But it is not difficult to see how the concept could extend to other biological systems.  Co-evolution of interacting proteins, such as a protein and its receptor, or modification of a developmental system could similarly proceed in a stepwise fashion that ultimately prevents retreat.  We are a bit lucky in this case that the evolutionary traces are all preserved where we can find them; it is not difficult to imagine a scenario where part of the ancestral form is lost from all extant lineages and therefore invisible to our current vision.Bridgham JT, Ortlund EA, &amp;amp; Thornton JW (2009).

This also included figuring out for a good number of proteins what the function of that protein is, and then reconstructing the metabolic pathways.Of the 478 proteins, 120 had been identified experimentally. Of the missing 358 proteins, about half could be modeled with pretty good confidence (i.e. better than 30% homology). Only 3 of the proteins required some major tinkering to get at least a rough idea of what the fold looks like, and the analysis of the fold is what the group is focusing on.First, I think the fact that two thirds of the structures were either from experiment or from reliable homology modeling is pretty encouraging, but it depends if you are a glass half full or half empty guy.Second, once they had the enzymatic pathways modeled this way the group then identified a minimal set of proteins essential for the bacterium to survive. They found three groups of proteins: &amp;quot;core essential&amp;quot;, where if you take out one, game over for Thermotoga, &amp;quot;synthetic lethal&amp;quot; where there is a built-in redundancy in the pathways such that one protein alone is not essential, but taking out more than one is lethal, and &amp;quot;non-essential&amp;quot; which are, well, non-essential.The level of detail that the modeling allowed is pretty impressive (I think). I wonder how long it is going to take to go from this to a human or mammalian cell. An analysis like this could have a really big impact in drug discovery, where the preferred thinking of affecting one target to cure a disease is running into a bit of trouble lately, imho. Analyzing networks of proteins this way could really have a major impact on figuring out the best way to affect disease states using polypharmacology.Of course, going from 478 to 20,000-25,000 proteins is not going to happen tomorrow (or ever?). Knowing how many proteins there are would be a good first step, I guess.Did we finally figure out how many protein-coding sequences there are in the human genome? I have to check.Ref.:Zhang Y, Thiele I, Weekes D, Li Z, Jaroszewski L, Ginalski K, Deacon AM, Wooley J, Lesley SA, Wilson IA, Palsson B, Osterman A, &amp;amp; Godzik A (2009).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/StorefrontGibberisha.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/StorefrontGibberisha.jpg" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blogger, an anonymous "foreign university teacher in China's western frontier", captions the photograph thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The diverse number of scripts found on Xinjiang signs — Arabic, Chinese, Mongolian, and Russian — often present a bewildering challenge to Westerners who are used to the Latin alphabet. Here, no one writes English in public places. But Xinjiang&amp;#39;s multilingualism can even mislead the locals. For example, this restaurant, located in downtown Urumqi, advertises &amp;quot;Pancakes, Hamburgers, Porridge&amp;quot; in Chinese characters. Unfortunately, the Uyghur &amp;quot;translation&amp;quot; written above that is: &lt;strong&gt;ngngoongngkngngnglng&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who's pulling whose leg?  It is evident that, in this case, the "Uyghur" language written in Arabic script is there for purely decorative purposes, reminiscent of the mirror-reversed Chinese characters in a New Yorker ad sponsored by the Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism that I wrote about &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1480"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=881"&gt;Hong Kong strip-club flyer&lt;/a&gt; used to decorate the cover of a China-themed issue of &lt;em&gt;MaxPlanckForschung&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that even someone who doesn't know Arabic script or Uyghur language would be suspicious of the numerous repetitions of just a few letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such signage is supposed to be supervised by the official Working Comittee for the Languages and Scripts of Minority Nationalities (少数民 族语言文字工作委员会 Az sanliq milletler til-yeziq xizmet komiteti).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is another way to "read" the Uyghur letters: ng_ng_o_o_ng_ ng_k_ng_ng_ ng_lng.  Try it without choking!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254198181188"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9336f6621cf34a03</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Erma Bombeck's Regrets</title><published>2009-09-29T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/glurge/bombeck.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Did a dying Erma Bombeck pen a list of misprioritizations she'd come to regret?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254195757172"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16549">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6092b661495ffc51</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Mr. Deity and Da Man</title><published>2009-09-29T03:33:20Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T03:33:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/28/mr-deity-and-da-man/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Deity&lt;/strong&gt; has returned… and this time, he is helping Adam find a wife!&lt;/p&gt;

(So is &lt;a href="http://urban-science.blogspot.com/"&gt;DN Lee&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/view/224"&gt;Urban Science Adventures&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grrl has been doing &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/view/152"&gt;pretty well getting votes in this contest&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that her competition includes a radio personality from Portugal and a member of the Osmond family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the top vote-getters, it is clear to me that Grrl would do the best job with the specified task (blogging from, and about, Antarctica).  She has a personal and professional interest in nature, science, the environment, and conservation.  She has a history of writing pieces that are accessible communications of both scientific content and aesthetic appreciation, in an astounding balance of clarity and lyricism.  She takes lovely nature photographs, which she regularly shares with readers of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/"&gt;her blog&lt;/a&gt;.  And to say she's an experienced blogger is an understatement on par with noting that Antarctica can get a little chilly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voting in the contest ends 30 September, 2009 at 12 noon (Eastern time). That's less than 48 hours from now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't yet voted, &lt;a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/view/152"&gt;consider giving Grrl your support&lt;/a&gt;.  Voting does require registering your email address with Quark, but they are doing this to avoid poll-crashing, and I haven't received any spam from them.  And, if you've already cast a vote for someone else, you are allowed by the rules to reassign your vote.  Some other worthy science bloggers in the competition have been throwing their support to Grrl as the voting winds down, so don't miss this chance to give her your vote, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/send_grrlscientist_to_antarcti.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/gr6CNW_4RpE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254184227852"><id gr:original-id="http://healthskills.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/fibromyalgia-an-overview/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d15c90db6526f741</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Fibromyalgia: an overview</title><published>2009-09-28T16:26:02Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T16:26:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/BVUCpcWKL3w/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://healthskills.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/fibromyalgia-an-overview/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I didn’t intend to get into a theme this week, but this paper arrived in my inbox this morning, and given both the prevalence of fibromyalgia, and the often ‘fuzzy’ management that can be provided, I thought it might be worthwhile taking a look at it.  The paper itself is a pre-print, but has been [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I reject the Darwinian assumption that larvae and their adults evolved from a single common ancestor. Rather I posit that, in animals that metamorphose, the basic types of larvae originated as adults of different lineages, i.e., larvae were transferred when, through hybridization, their genomes were acquired by distantly related animals.

Got that? The author thinks that animals with distinctly different larval forms (caterpillars and butterflies, tadpoles and frogs, veligers and marine snails...) don't descend from a single ancestor that had a simple life history and later developed a two-stage strategy. Rather, Donald Williamson thinks that metamorphosing organisms are chimeras - hybrids between two distinct lineages in which the two parental genomes have reached a compromise such that one parent gets to run what we call the larval form and the other oversees the adult.

This is certainly not a mainstream idea,  but the paper I'm talking about was published in the Proceedings on the National Academy of Science (PNAS), one of the most prestigious scientific journals that there is, Williamson must have some good data to support his idea right? Well, no. Williamson's entire case appears is that he finds it really really hard to imagine metamorphosis evolving in gradual steps  and, besides,  some larval forms look quite a lot some other organisms. Williamson does distinguish himself from other pedlars of what Richard Dawkins has named the "argument from personal incredulity" by at least providing a specific hypothesis to test: modern insects with 'caterpillar' larvae (butterflies, beetles, ants, wasps, bees, files...) descend from an 'accidental' mating between a flying insect and an onychophran (no illustration of this process is provided).

Onychophorans (which we usually call 'peripatus' in New Zealand) are part of that admittedly large list of creatures that can be called "David's favourite animals" so before we hang Williamson's preposterous hypothesis out to dry I'm going to have to subject you to a little bit of cheer-leading. This is not the first time that onychophorans have been the subject of woolly evolutionary thinking. Since they are likely related to some of the most spectacular cambrian fossils people have called them "living fossils" and you'll even sometimes hear it proposed they represent a *shudder* "missing link" between arthropods (insects, crustaceans, spiders...) and annelids (earthworms and their kin). Which is all a great shame because it diverts attention from the fact the onychophorans are nocturnal hunters which crawl through the leaf litter on hydro-statically inflated legs in pursuit of small invertebrates which they immobilise with a sticky glue they spray from their mouths in order to let them inject digestive enzymes into their stricken prey and suck the resulting soup from its lifeless body. That's the sort of thing people ought to know about it.

What about Williamson's "larval transfer" idea? Is this a case, like Wegner and continental drift or Bretz on ice ages, in which science needs some outré thinking to get itself out of a rut that is holding it back? Hardly.

 Insect metamorphisms isn't that hard a problem

Just how complete metamorphosis of the sort you see in butterflies evolved is a genuinely difficult and, as such, interesting question. But it's one that Williamson clearly hasn't bothered to read about. If he had he would've found a lovely review from Deniz Ereyilmaz2 who  traces the history of the problem and makes a case that larvae are effectively free living embryos (an idea that was articulated by Harvey (of the circulatory system) and later used by Darwin in the 6th edition of The Origin to reply to contemporary criticism that his theory couldn't explain metamorphosis). Specifically, the idea is that the holometabolous insects (the ones that undergo complete metamorphosis) evolved from direct developing insects like cicadas and grasshoppers. In these insects the final stage of embryonic development is called a pronymph, in most species the pronymph molts into a mini-adult (called a nymph) before it hatches but a few species actually hatch as pronymphs. Ereyilmaz and the few entomologists that have tackled this question in recent years think holometabolous insects descend from species in which the pronymph hatched and then became able to feed. From there the development of the pronymph stage was extended while nymphal development (which usually proceeds as small changes accrued in each of several molts) was progressively squeezed into one step, which we now call pupation (like a caterpillar's cocoon). 

There is some nice genetic evidence that something like that process has happened. One of the genes required to start the metamorphosis process is called broad, mutants that can't produce functional broad protein fail to pupate. Insects like cicadas and grasshopers that don't undergo complete metamorphosis also have copies of broad but in these insects broad is expressed at each nymphal molt - consistent with the idea pupation in holometabolic insects corresponds to nymphal molt in direct developing insects.

The evolution of complete metamorphosis remains an interesting question (if you are want to learn more Christopher Taylor has deeper look at it than I've given here) but the sort of path laid out above - the gradual addition of multiple, relatively small changes to the existing insect life cycle is surely orders of magnitude more likely than two genomes being thrown together and, somehow, deciding to regulate two complete separate developmental programmes as well as the entirely new process of breaking down the first genomes animal before development of the second one can begin?

 Complete metamorphosis doesn't use two sets of genes

Williamson also asks 'genomocists' to search for distinct genomes within the DNA sequence of holometabolous insects. We don't need a complete genome to know that the same genes are being used in the development of adults and larvae. People have been studying the genetic basis of development in Drosophila (which my taxonomic pedantry won't allow me to call fruit-flies) for at least 20 years - all Williamson needed to do to check his hypothesis against the evidence was open an undergraduate textbook. Had he done that he would have seen, in one tirivial example, that the that patterning of the adult wing in Drosphila requires  the genes   hedgehog and wingless (geneticists usually name genes after what loss of function mutants look like ) both of which are also vital to defining the polarity of the segments formed in embryonic development. We've also know since at 1997 [3] than oncychophorans and insects inherited their hox genes, (the genes that lay out the basic body plan in animals) from a common ancestor that lived before the two groups split up - and the holometabolic insects we've looked at only have one set of hox genes.

So why is this in PNAS?

OK, so Williamson has his answer to the problem of metamorphosis and no evidence is about to sway him from it. But he's not asking for his nonsense to be taught in public schools or anything - he's just a harmless crank. The question is why was his idea afforded space in one of the most prominent scientific journals instead of being expressed in the standard media for cranks - self published pamphlets or a huge single page website made with Mircrosoft FrontPage and featuring five different colours of text interspersed with clip-art and presented on a yellow background. Well, until very recently there where two ways to be published in PNAS, you could submit an article to the editorial office in the normal way or you could have a member of the...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Project, an early intervention program that uses play therapy for autistic children, has been awarded a grant of $1.85 million from the National Institute of Mental Health to fund research on play-based intervention. Medical director Richard Solomon is conducting a study slated to run for three years on the program’s model, which addresses the shortage of qualified personnel for home visits by training parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;P.L.A.Y. Project is a direct outgrowth of Stanley Greenspan’s DIR/Floortime philosophy that emphasizes a framework that is Developmental, Individualized and Relationship-based.  By training parents to participate in their children’s therapy, yearly costs are less than $4,000 a year, compared with other interventions that can cost $40,000 to $60,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I’d like to see the cost of this program more heavily subsidized than it seems to be. Although P.L.A.Y. says on their website that they will help families in need and use sliding-scale fees, I have no doubt that the majority of their families are shelling out a few thousand or so a year for training, consultations and home visits — not an insignificant expense in the landscape of a typical family already burdened by costs of early 21st-century life.&lt;/p&gt;

Educators came to meet parents and hear ideas about what they could be doing when they teach. Parents came to share stories about their children and ask that they be treated with respect.&lt;/p&gt;

As Broca’s area is found to be functionally salient in grammatical processing, it is logical to assume that this is place to [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

As many of you already know, the big AAI conference is taking place in LA at the end of this week — I&amp;#39;ll be there! — and they are giving Bill Maher an award. This is a problem. Maher made a provocative movie about religion this year, &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt;, and that&amp;#39;s the kind of thing we want to acknowledge and encourage, but at the same time…Maher is as loopy as they come on medical matters. He&amp;#39;s a conspiracy theorist who blames Big Pharma for controlling health care, thinks modern medicine is a failure, and promotes &amp;#39;alternative&amp;#39; therapies that don&amp;#39;t work. It is a serious embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is an excellent idea to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/ask_bill_maher_and_richard_dawkins_some.php"&gt;ask difficult questions and put Maher on the spot&lt;/a&gt;, as Orac has proposed, and the last thing any skeptic or rationalist should do is ask critics to be silent. However, we have a couple of small problems here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is that some people (not Orac) have been threatening to disrupt the proceedings at the meeting. Nope, not good: there is a difference between asking hard questions and interfering with the event so no one gets to ask questions. Let's nip this one in the bud: do not show up at the meeting with the intent of turning it into something equivalent to those townhall teabagger shouting matches. I think you're entirely right to be pissed off at Maher, but that doesn't justify disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that Maher is going to be well insulated. He&amp;#39;s showing up for the award ceremony, which will NOT have time scheduled for a Q&amp;amp;A, and I think he&amp;#39;ll be vanishing right afterwards. We&amp;#39;re not likely to have an opportunity for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet another problem: people are barking at Richard Dawkins. Dawkins does not support quackery. This isn't an issue on which he'll disagree with any of you, but he's also there to talk about his exciting new book, not about fake cancer cures. I suspect he's not looking forward to a lot of time-wasting headaches over this issue, and if it sounds like it's going to eat up all of his time with the public, he'll probably do the rational thing and cut back on spending time with the public. This is not to be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be printing out &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/ask_bill_maher_and_richard_dawkins_some.php"&gt;Orac's excellent complaint&lt;/a&gt;, and if you're going, you should, too. I'll keep an eye on the comments in the next few days for more good questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we get an opportunity in an open forum to pin Maher down on these questions, let's do it. Let's do it politely and according to the rules of the session. That's fair game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself with a chance to ask Richard Dawkins questions, though, please stick to issues that interest him. If you ask him about acupuncture, he's going to be as dismissive as all of us other skeptics, so there really isn't much point to going on about it. Don't waste an opportunity to converse with Dawkins on a bunch of annoying noise. OK?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;ve probably got a greater likelihood of getting a shot at a private conversation with Richard Dawkins than most readers here; maybe, and this is a very thin maybe, I&amp;#39;ll even get an opportunity to collar Maher. I may also get a chance to talk with some of the other organizers of the conference. If that happens, I&amp;#39;ll pass along the complaints, and I&amp;#39;ll try to drill down and get some good answers for you…which, of course, I&amp;#39;ll post here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that's your best strategy for actually getting answers to the questions Orac is asking, rather than simply triggering a shouting match. While shouting matches are fun, we should want something a little more thoughtful out of these fellows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/the_maher_conundrum.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/oQSahVJMrqs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254169891451"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=1125">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0274266a45169cc6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Time for a fisking</title><published>2009-09-28T20:14:02Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T20:14:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/09/28/time-for-a-fisking/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makarios, do yourself a favor, educate yourself, please? I’m going to give this a once-over for you. It’s long, and I know most of my readers will be bored with it, so it’s below the fold&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said in reply to some comment that I have irrefutable proof of God’s existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I probably overstated my case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I mean is, it’s irrefutable to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, “irrefutable” implies “unable to be refuted” and not “well, I don’t accept the refutation.” You can argue with the refutation if you have reason, but you must be able to support your case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can’t be irrefutable to atheists because they have limited themselves to examinig only a portion of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure, what evidence is being ignored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do believe that I have proof that goes significantly beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t court, it’s a claim. In any event, I’d settle for that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it compelling proof?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d get to the point, we’d see, now wouldn’t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well to someone with an open mind, I believe that yes, it is compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman"&gt;no true Scotsman&lt;/a&gt;” line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To someone who begins h/her quest with a mind already excluding a whole field of evidence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What field?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aww, you think I’m incredulous, Pot, I’d like you to meet Kettle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To atheists there isn’t proof or evidence of Creator God because they begin their search by ruling out the supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you see, if we can observe it, and thus merits the claim “evidence,” then it isn’t exactly supernatural, now is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not very scientific but effective for protecting their belief system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because your iron-clad arguments can’t get through when we exclude your “evidence” on the grounds that it is meaningless jargon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I suppose I could say that except for epistemic, experiential, logical, coherent and reasonable evidence for the existence of God, I could be an atheist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wo, experimental? Logical? Coherent? Please, let me hear them, this sounds fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, my belief in God begins with the following observations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of clear scientific (observable, repeatable, verifiable) evidence, we know that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, on some level there is likely a cause, but is it an intentional cause? Is evolution always goal directed? Lenski’s research indicates evolution has a random component. Then, there’s radioactive decay particles, they are caused by energy being given off by an unstable atom, but why at a specific point in time does that specific atom give off that specific particle? There are varying levels of causality, and the level to which you speak of (the first cause) is a tired argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That we consistently observe this to be true is critically important because scientific naturalists demand that nothing can be believed without consistent observation and verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even random uncaused events have causes, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every single attempt to promote alternatives to this premise have only reinforced its truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except evolutionary biology, radioactive decay, half-life related chemical decomposition, and other random events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, atheists have the highest motivation to accept this premise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all things have causes? No, not really, not all things have causes. They all have explanations, but not causes. You misunderstand the difference.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of clear scientific (observable, repeatable, verifiable) evidence, we know that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one? Damn, science teaches us a lot of things, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The universe began to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, technically, we know our universe exists and at one point, it was a singularity. We don’t know that it “began” to exist because mathematically, time breaks down below when you approach the “Big Bang” within a single Planck epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because those premises are true and coherent we can know that the following conclusion is also true: &lt;strong&gt;The universe has a cause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe has a cause because you say it does? How do you know? I’ve given examples of things that don’t have causes. There are also multiple types of causality; ultimate macro, ultimate micro, proximate macro, proximate micro, and penultimate. You are trying to equate all of these into one type of “cause.” Unfortunately, you miss that these are very distinct types of causality. Additionally, when dealing with proximate macro causality, there are intentional proximate causations and unintentional proximate causations. So trying to claim that this distinct penultimate cause exists because the other types of causations do is quite silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of clear scientific evidence, we know that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, let me interrupt; because of clear scientific evidence, we know that humans will instinctively try to assign causality to random events. Anyway, your point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Matter and energy cannot precede themselves or preexist themselves either physically or chronologically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason that matter and energy cannot precede themselves is because “Coming Into Being” is an essential and objective feature of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time did not exist prior to the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And? So you’re trying to say that if we’re right, the universe didn’t exist? I don’t think there is a single physicist out there whose models are saying that. But hey, I’m sure you know their models better than they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of clear scientific evidence, we know that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Matter and energy do not have the ability to create themselves or bring themselves into existence from nothing or ex nihilo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you mean like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particles"&gt;virtual particles&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of clear scientific evidence, we know that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you think so…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Matter and energy cannot exist from infinity past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? I’m pretty good at understanding scientific evidence, but this makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, whatever brought matter, energy, space, time and the laws of physics into existence had to have existed outside of these entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for, perhaps, virtual particle asymmetry resulting in a cascade of particle condensation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of clear scientific evidence, we know that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn, do you ever get tired of this line? Pretending something is scientific when it’s really a gross misunderstanding of the science?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Anything that exists has an explanation of it’s existence, either in the necessity of its own nature (It can’t NOT exist), or in an external cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So god,” right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is external to as well as transcendent to the universe. That is because:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, I predicted it, how did I predict that, I haven’t read it yet, oh, right, it’s an argument I’ve heard before. The explanation is not the cause. I can explain how my iPod works by invoking magic, that doesn’t me that is the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing outside of time, the Cause is infinite or Eternal,&lt;br&gt;
Existing outside of matter (which is finite), the Cause is immaterial or Spiritual,&lt;br&gt;
Existing as the Cause of time and energy, space, matter and the laws of physics, the Cause is immeasurably more powerful than the mathematically precise universe and its exquisitely Finely Tuned constants and quantities.&lt;br&gt;
The Cause cannot be “scientific” because neither matter nor the laws of physics (i.e., the laws that science has observed and identified), existed prior to the Singularity.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore the Cause of the beginning of the universe is not scientific but Personal.&lt;br&gt;
The transcendent Cause of the universe is therefore on the order of a Mind.&lt;br&gt;
That Cause is omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent. That Cause, is what is normally described as God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument"&gt;wiki explanation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s simple, you’ll like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of clear scientific evidence, we know that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m sure…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The universe exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Therefore, the universe has an explanation of its existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, but that doesn’t mean it has a cause…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the above premises are true and coherent, the following conclusion must also be true: The explanation of the existence of the universe is God&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the premises are not all true, the logic is not flawless, and you haven’t proven a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. According to atheism the universe doesn’t have an explanation of its existence. They say that “It just happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is called a point of ignorance. Just because we don’t know doesn’t make your claim to know any more valid. You must support YOUR claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a dozen theories and over a dozen more variations on those theories have come and gone in a vain attempt to rule out God as the Cause of a beginning universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, we’re not trying to rule out a deity, we’re trying to understand what is happening. If we can observe this deity, great, we’ve found a supernatural entity. That does not mean that it is your notion of a deity, nor that it cares about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the current scientific knowledge described above, atheists persist in stating that either matter has always existed (impossible) or that matter created itself (also impossible).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, because time, energy, and mass are all related to one another, yes, it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do they do this? Because &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because each property is an extension of interactions of the other two. It’s trying to have a  triangle with two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. If there is an explanation of the universe’s existence, then atheism is not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All because you say so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that is because the only explanation that fits the evidence of how and why the universe came into being is Creator God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What evidence do you have (for the existence of this deity, not your own ignorance of science)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why Richard Dawkins himself has lately admitted that a good case could be made for the existence of a Deistic God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not deistic, pantheistic; the metaphorical god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, I believe that some day there won’t be any atheists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So long as religion exists, so too will atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be people for God and people against God but there won’t be anyone who believes that God doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting prediction. Let’s see how that plays out, right, we won’t, we’ll both be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, irony of ironies it will be science that will prove the existence of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one atheist single mother of two said recently, “A big fuck-you to anyone who believes in original sin. The christian god, should it exist, should be fought and resisted by every MORAL person who has ever lived.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, because the actions of parents are the responsibility of the child, how compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mmm, I’m wandering off topic . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You seem to do that frequently&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Because of overwhelming scientific evidence, most atheists do grudgingly admit that the universe does indeed have a beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly, it’s kind of like the question “when did life begin?”–well, how do you define “life” or “the universe” or “time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for atheists, it can be said with absolute confidence that no cosmogonic model has been:&lt;br&gt;
As repeatedly verified in its predictions,&lt;br&gt;
As corroborated by attempts at its falsification,&lt;br&gt;
As concordant with empirical discoveries, and&lt;br&gt;
As philosophically coherent as the Standard Big Bang Creation Event Model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…this is really getting old, I’ll do a few more, I didn’t realize how full of hot air you actually were. I’m waiting on any predictions this model is going to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Hence, most atheists are implicitly committed to God being the explanation of why the universe exists. This is why I call atheists irrational agnostics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame that you are mentally abusing seven innocent children.&lt;/p&gt;

During a conversation with a reporter, Chris found out about a remarkable story: in 1969, a radio technician was able to use home-built equipment &lt;a href="http://www.jefferson.kctcs.edu/observatory/apollo11/"&gt;to listen in on the Apollo 11 transmissions to Earth&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a remarkable effort. He had to build the equipment and guide it by hand to track the Moon (if the Moon drifted out of the equipment’s field of view he lost the transmission… need I say it? More proof we went to the Moon). The story got some coverage, but apparently faded away over the years. I certainly never heard of it. Chris is wondering if anyone else was able to do this, too.

It’s a very good review from a non-science media outlet, and opens like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-scientists, and that includes most of us who work for newspapers or other media, owe it to themselves to read at least one book this year about the scientific issues facing the world. My pick is Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum’s “Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reader can make it through the main corpus of this taut volume, about 132 pages, in a weekend. The rest of the book contains notes, and in a few cases some lengthy elaborations on points in the main text. But do not let the brevity of this book fool you — there is plenty to ponder and chew on in these pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should be entertaining: he's already sending out press releases to complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BLASPHEMY DAY TARGETS CHRISTIANITY&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Center for Inquiry will launch the first International Blasphemy Day on September 30, the anniversary of the 2005 publication of the Danish cartoons that so inflamed Muslims worldwide. Billed as a free speech event designed to oppose such things as a Muslim-sponsored U.N. resolution banning criticism of religion, the day has drawn the support of people like PZ Myers. Myers, a professor at the University of Minnesota known for intentionally desecrating a consecrated Host, says the day was established to "mock and insult religion without fear of murder, violence, and reprisal"; he wants every day to be Blasphemy Day.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Catholic League president Bill Donohue spoke to this event today:
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Center for Inquiry is factually incorrect to say that "Free speech is the foundation on which other liberties rest." Freedom of conscience is the first liberty, and it is inextricably linked to freedom of religion. Moreover, the whole concept of inalienable rights presupposes a belief in the Creator. In other words, atheists have the right to mock religion because our Christian Founding Fathers afforded them human rights.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They are all such phonies. The stated purpose of Blasphemy Day has nothing to do with any religion but Islam, yet there is not one scheduled event insulting Muslims. We can only guess why. So who have they chosen to mock? You guessed it--Christians.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Artist Dana Ellyn will wander to Washington, D.C. to show her masterpiece, "Jesus Does His Nails," a portrait of Jesus polishing a nail jammed into his hand. In Los Angeles, there will be a film about a gay molesting priest and another about a boy who is so angry about being sent to bed that he asks God to kill his parents. Oh, yes, American Atheists will conduct "De-Baptisms" in New Jersey.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nice to know that even the atheists know that Christians can be counted on to react to their antics like good Christians. Which is why there will be no violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ol' Bill really doesn't get it. The purpose of the day is to jeer at &lt;i&gt;religion&lt;/i&gt;, not to do his dirty work of attacking just one sectarian slice of the whole pie of absurdity. In the US, we'll tend to poke fun at Christianity more than Islam because it's Christianity that's in our faces every day of the year. Islam also lacks a histrionic spokesman like Donohue to make entertaining facial spasms for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping there will be no violence, but I can't say the same for those "good Christians." I get a lot of threats from those people, inflamed by affronted polemicists like Donohue, and I can also count on the Catholic League to pine for opportunities to turn Muslims loose on atheists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/bill_donohue_is_getting_antici.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Fv9agv0EqNE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254168760943"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16511">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0e530382c97f46fd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Babies"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Eye Exam Fail</title><published>2009-09-28T20:00:59Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T20:00:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/28/eye-exam-fail/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand it, but &lt;a href="http://failblog.org/2009/09/24/sign-fail-18/"&gt;I know where I’m going&lt;/a&gt; the next time I need an eye exam:&lt;/p&gt;

I think so, since he feels an appeal to ignorance qualifies as evidence as illustrated on &lt;a href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/09/28/on-being-nice/#comment-1030"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, let’s have some fisking fun:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a story going round that atheists are intelligent, well educated and “brighter” than anyone else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there is a correlation between &lt;a href="http://sda.berkeley.edu:8080/quicktables/quicksetoptions.do?reportKey=gss04%3A1"&gt;educational level and religiosity&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn’t mean being an atheist makes you smarter or better educated, it could just be that the smarter and better educated you are, the more likely you are to see religion for what it is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="religion-and-education" src="http://morsdei.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/religion-and-education.jpg?w=655&amp;amp;h=493" alt="religion-and-education" width="655" height="493"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s gotten to the point that even atheists are starting to believe that stereotype. However, there is ample proof to show that that’s an unfair and inaccurate stereotype. Example One below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z’s First Comment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“the universe exploded from a point that must have been infinitesimally small and dense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely an oversimplification; but you’re also illustrating a broad generalization with a single case, based upon this type of evidence, I could say Christians can’t argue because of your apparent inability to understand basic logic. I would never do such a thing since Christians CAN be very intelligent and think critically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z’s Second Comment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Prior to the singularity, nothing existed, not space, time, matter, or energy – nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, of course “prior” is irrelevant since there was no “prior”–which is why asking “what caused the big bang” is such a nonsensical question. How many wings do fairies have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m still waiting Z for you to tell me why those comments aren’t contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, you can just say, “I was wrong. Everything came from nothing and:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slippery slope, here you come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Since nothing, literally nothing natural or material existed, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re doing well so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Since I rule out anything supernatural, or outside of nature, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohh, damn, see, you missed it right there; we have no reason to suppose these things existed then or now. We do, however, have reason to suppose the universe did expand from an infinitesimal singularity with infinite mass, but I doubt you have read about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Since everything that begins to exist does so because of a cause&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, and you missed it again right there. Have you heard of radioactive decay? What causes a specific alpha or beta particle to leave a specific atom at a specific point in time? It is unstable, but why then? And why that specific arrangement of energy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason you want causality is because we humans love to have it. It seems like then we have the answer, unfortunately, not everything needs a direct cause, hence you have issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. That means that &lt;strong&gt;I believe that nothing caused everything to begin to exist.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly, the universe came into existence due to unknown cosmological causes. We know precisely how the universe expanded from this singularity, but because time and space didn’t exactly exist until the universe began to expand, it did not “cause” it to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or you can even go by the ultimate proof that intelligent, knowledgeable atheists is a false and misleading stereotype and quote Richard Dawkins himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’re stepping into my domain, aren’t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nothing EVOLVED into everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, what you fail to realize is that evolution is about replication, if you have a single self-replicating chemical compound, (it can be ANY replicating chemical compound) it will be subject to evolution. This means, simply put, that a very simple self-replicating chemical can result in immense diversity. You arguments are both arguments from ignorance. Good luck with learning to argue more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

Sites such as whale.to and NatrualNews are repositories of paranoid, unscientific thinking and promotion of dangerous health practices.  Thankfully, they are rather fringe (but not fringe enough).  More mainstream outlets print some pretty bad stuff, but it’s usually just lazy reporting and not a concerted, organized effort to promote implausible medical claims.  As many of us have written, both hear and at our other blogs, the Huffington Post is the exception.  It actively and in an organized way promotes dangerous, implausible pseudo-medicine.  This starts at the top with Arianna, and is actively encouraged by medical and health editors like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/who_is_patricia_fitzgerald_and.php"&gt;Patricia Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/03/harkins_war_on_science.php"&gt;Dean Ornish&lt;/a&gt;.  In the spring, our complaints were picked up briefly by the larger blogosphere and for a while, HuffPo appeared to have toned it down.  Some of that may have been due to our critique of their flu coverage, much of which was mere infomercials for patent medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the old joke goes, “Break’s over—back on your knees.”  HuffPo has jumped back into the quakery pond with full abandon.  Venues like HuffPo are one of the reasons a site like this one are necessary.  So let’s take a look at the latest abominations from “the other side”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, Dana Ullman—they really did it this time.  They’ve taken the guy I think of as “Hahnemann’s cognitively impaired bulldog” and given him a regular spot over there.  Ullman is a major booster of homeopathy, as readers of this blog may remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His inaugural piece, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/the-wisdom-of-symptoms-re_b_299070.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wisdom of Symptoms: Respecting the Body’s Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; betrays a stunning level of ignorance of basic human biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have good and bad news about the human body: it is neither wise nor foolish, good nor evil, nor is it simple in any way.  It is a complex system where few simplistic explanations suffice.  It would be nice to believe in “feed a cold, starve a fever” and other simplistic pablum, but things are rarely so simple.  This is why there is a science to medicine—our instincts and hunches often betray us, and only by studying the body systematically can we form valid conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, if you’re lazy or deceitful, you can just make it up as you go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to Dana Ullman who has come up with the shattering observation that, “just because a drug is effective in getting rid of a symptom does not necessarily mean that this treatment is truly curative (or even helpful).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really?  I never would have guessed that—which is why I read the literature, which is pretty damned clear that sweeping generalizations such as this are meaningless.  Take the symptom of chest pain—if you don’t know the likely causes of a case of chest pain, you won’t know how to work it up or treat it properly.  Giving someone nitroglycerin may make a patient feel better, but may indicate a cardiac etiology or an esophageal etiology.  If you simply treat the pain with nitroglycerin without treating the underlying cause you may cause someone to die.  That would be a bad thing.  His “revelation” simply reveals how ignorant he is about current concepts of human medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His ignorance, rather than giving him pause, leads to more senseless expostulations.  He goes on to write about the “wisdom” of the body, whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our human body has survived these thousands of years because of its incredible adaptive capabilities, and one of the ways that it adapts is through the creation of symptoms. Whether it be through fever and inflammation, cough and expectoration, nausea and vomiting, fainting and comatose states, and even the variety of emotional and mental states, each symptom represents the best efforts of the bodymind to fight infection and/or adapt to physical and psychological stresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an ignorant load of  goat droppings.  First of all, “the human body” has not “survived these thousands of years”.  As a distinct species we are a couple of million years old, more or less.  We have survived because we have survived.  If we hadn’t survived, we wouldn’t be having this discussion.  Human beings have been generally able to reproduce at a faster rate than we die.  Our bodies work very much like other mammals (and other vertebrates for that matter).  While vomiting may be “beneficial” when it is caused by a toxic ingestion, it is not so beneficial when it is caused by increased intracranial pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although symptoms may be the best effort of the organism to defend itself at that time, it is not usually effective to simply let the body try to heal itself. Most often, some treatment must be provided to help nurture, nourish, and augment the body’s own wisdom. The challenge to physicians, healers, and patients is to determine when to help aid this inner wisdom of the body and when to intervene to make certain that the body does not harm itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can view the human body in one of two fundamental ways: as a typical biological organism that is subject to the usual laws of physics, chemistry, and biology, and therefore understandable through systematic investigation; or as some sort of mystical thing infused with an &lt;em&gt;elan vital&lt;/em&gt;, subject to the whims of the supernatural and fundamentally mysterious. It’s pretty easy to verify which is a better model of reality, and which is a fundamentally arbitrary fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Ullman is leading to is a &lt;strong&gt;fetishization of symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;.  He elevates the subjective experience of illness to a magical force for good.  I have bad news for you, Dana:  symptoms are a biological phenomenon which are neither inherently good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesse and Williams show how our symptoms and seemingly normal body functions work as important defenses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever is an important, even vital, defense against infection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tears help wash and cleanse the eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The respiratory system is bathed in antibody and enzyme-rich secretions that are propelled up and down the throat and bronchial tree so that invaders are killed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ears secrete an antibacterial wax which helps to fight infection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The frequent washing of the mouth with saliva kills some pathogens and dislodges others so that the stomach’s acid and enzymes can destroy them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without having to tell the bodymind what to do, our innate survival instinct has developed sophisticated responses to both old and new infections and stresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, no!  I’m wondering if this guy is even educable.  Fever is not some magical defense against infection.  Fever is (usually) caused by the release of certain cytokines as a reaction to many different stimuli, especially infection.  There is no evidence that suppression of fever prevents healing.  The “discovery” that tears help cleanse the eyes his hardly groundbreaking.  None of these support his assertions about our “innate survival instinct”.  Now, if Ullman had actually bothered to learn some immunology, he’d be blown away by the beautiful truth.  Our bodies have evolved very sophisticated defenses against malignancy and infectious disease.  The truth is much more complicated and interesting than Ullman’s oversimplification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of teleologic thinking is child-like.  Confounding a reaction with a purposeful, beneficial response is idiotic.  For example, hypertension can cause compensatory thickening of the heart muscle, analogous to a biceps that grows with weight-lifting.  Unlike a biceps muscle, this thickening is not beneficial. While it temporarily keeps the cardiac output up, it leads to accelerated heart damage, and eventually heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having established his fundamental misunderstanding of biology, Ullman tops it off with praise for his pet medical cult, homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of recognizing that symptoms are efforts of the body to defend itself are significant. Because some conventional drugs work by suppressing symptoms, these drugs tend to provide helpful temporarily relief but tend to lead other new and more serious problems by inhibiting the body’s defense and immune processes. Such drugs should be avoided except in dire situations or in extreme pain or discomfort when safer treatments are not working fast or adequately enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, based on his own fantasy about how the body works, doctors have it all wrong, but thankfully, he has all the real answers without having to perform all that pesky science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because symptoms are adaptations of the body in its efforts to defend and heal itself, it makes sense to use treatments that mimic this wisdom of the body. Ultimately, homeopathic medicine is a well-known therapeutic modality that honors this wisdom of the body. Homeopathy is a type of “medical biomimicry” that uses various plant, mineral, and animal substances based upon their ability to cause in overdose the similar symptoms that the sick person is experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This only “makes sense” if you buy into the false assumptions about human biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to state this forcefully enough: Dana Ullman is an ignorant twit who leads a fringe medical cult which promulgates dangerous falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But HuffPo doesn’t stop with Ullman.  &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-frank-lipman/swine-flu-what-to-do_b_286245.html"&gt;Dr. Frank Lipman&lt;/a&gt; is pouring out volumes of ignorance.  Lipman is a &lt;em&gt;self-proclaimed&lt;/em&gt; expert in preventative health care. I emphasize “self-proclaimed” because he doesn’t seem to understand much about the subject. Doctors must be able to think independently. They must be able to look at the data, look at the recommendations of others, and apply these to individual patients. While one patient might “by the book” require a particular type of medication, you may know that this &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; patient won’t do as well for one reason or another.  But one cannot ignore evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipman starts out with the predictable but clearly false claim that he is not “anti-vaccine” (instead being pro-vaccine safety and freedom of choice, setting up the false dichotomy implying that the rest of us are against safety, freedom, and presumably the American way). He then goes on to forcefully, in bold typeface, declare that most of his patients should not get the swine flu vaccine (I can hear &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/author/rebecca/"&gt;Rebecca Watson’s voice&lt;/a&gt; in my head doing the voiceover of the capslock—good lulz). A generous person might take this information and think, “Gee, perhaps he has a geriatric practice so that most of his patients don’t fall within the current evidence-based recommendations.” That would be stretching generosity to the breaking point.  He goes on to discuss why he anti-vaccine (in this case).  But let’s talk a bit about flu and about prevention from, you know, an expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1229"&gt;what swine flu is and is not&lt;/a&gt;.  Every year, influenza sweeps across the world, affecting the US most strongly in the winter months.  It causes at least 35-40 thousand excess deaths every year, and even more hospitalizations and lost days of work and school—and all that is in a “typical” year.  In typical years, flu is most brutal on the very old, very young, and chronically ill.  Swine flu follows a different pattern.  It isn’t any less virulent or deadly than seasonal flu, but attacks a much greater number of people, especially those who don’t usually suffer much during a typical flu season.  It also has refused to confine itself to the normal flu season, having simmered all through the summer. Vaccination helps prevent illness, hospitalization, and death due to influenza, so each year we formulate a vaccine based on the current circulating strains.  To what extent vaccination is beneficial is an open area of investigation, but that it helps is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is an important tool in prevention of morbidity and mortality.  Prevention is generally discussed as being &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt;. Primary prevention is the prevention of disease as you might typically think of it.  If you can prevent someone from developing diabetes, polio, or heart disease, that is primary prevention. Once someone has a particular disease, preventing further episodes is secondary prevention.  If my patient has coronary artery disease (say, having had a heart attack in the past), I can I practice secondary prevention  by treating them with certain medications and with good health habits that reduce the risk of further heart attacks.  There is another category—tertiary prevention—which usually refers to preventing a disease which complicates another.  Diabetics are prone to heart disease, and there are ways to prevent heart disease in diabetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s see what our “expert” in prevention says about flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) At this stage, for the most part the swine flu seems benign.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a million people in the US have already come down with swine flu, many of them without even knowing that they had it. The vast majority of people who get the swine flu recover after a week or so of high fever, aches, and respiratory distress. It’s not pleasant, but except in rare circumstances, it is not fatal. Most people who’ve been infected by swine flu think so little of it, they believe they just had a really bad cold or a regular flu. So unless the swine flu evolves to a much more virulent form, there’s no need for mass vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what we know about the flu, this is foolish.  Yes, swine flu is about equally as virulent as the usual flu—that is, it causes a great deal of excess significant illness and death.  What threshold does Dr. Lipman, as a prevention expert, recommend for preventing a preventable disease?  Is there a certain prevalence threshold?  A certain virulence threshold?  Apparently, his recommendation is based on his “feeling” that it is “rarely fatal” and “relatively mild”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) We don’t know if the vaccine will be effective.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are only useful against the specific viral strain that was available at the time of their manufacture. But influenza viruses mutate quickly, and as the WHO has already said, the real concern with H1N1 swine flu is that it will combine with seasonal flu in the Fall, creating a new strain that will of course be immune to all available vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That reasoning is, in a word, stupid.  The reason we need a new vaccine every year is that the flu changes.  The reason we know &lt;em&gt;which &lt;/em&gt;strains to vaccinate against is through careful public health surveillance.  We do this fairly successfully most years.  This year there is a seasonal flu vaccine based on the current strains, and a separate swine flu vaccine based on the fact that swine flu is still circulating widely.  It has been tested as safe and effective, and is developed and produced just as all previous flu vaccines.  To take the nihilistic view that because the flu mutates we should ignore decades of evidence and experience and just give up is the height of arrogant ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) We don’t know if the vaccine is safe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA has authorized an expedited approval process for the swine flu vaccine but we don’t know yet if it is safe. Even &lt;a href="http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2009/2009_pressrelease_10077.htm"&gt;GlaxoSmithKline&lt;/a&gt;, one of the vaccine manufacturers has said, “&lt;em&gt;The total population studied in clinical trials will be limited, due to the need to provide the vaccine to governments as quickly as possible. Additional studies will therefore be required and conducted after the vaccine is made available.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the only thing that is safe, is to say that no one knows. Since it’s never been used before and they have not had time to conduct any sufficient human testing, by getting vaccinated you are being a human guinea pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is simply untrue.  This vaccine has been developed and produced just as previous vaccines have, and there is no reason to think that it is any more or less safe.  To take this particular paranoid view is to ignore the science and the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His next point is either completely ignorant or sinister: vaccine manufacturers are insulated from liability, therefore they have no incentive not to hurt you.  The reason vaccine manufacturers receive immunity is so they will still be able to provide this not-very-profitable service.  Anti-vaccine cultists would sue the vaccine makers into oblivion, or clog the courts trying.  Instead we have a rational surveillance program.  Since significant vaccine-related side effects are vanishingly rare, it is only on mass release that rarer ones may become apparent, therefore we have a system for monitoring vaccine safety.  Thankfully, serious side effects of flu vaccine are not distinguishable from the baseline incidence of these problems, and are rarer than serious flu-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence shows that the most effective primary prevention of influenza is vaccination.  Still, it’s rather more invasive than, say, dietary changes.  Is there any evidence for other primary prevention strategies?  The answer is essentially, “no”.  Lipman gives a heap of worthless advice about “phytonutrients”, vitamin D, and exercise, some of which is plausible but not supported by evidence, and some of which is implausible enough to be laughable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read the comments to a post like this, you can see that some will never be persuaded by evidence or science—they hold fixed-false beliefs which people like Lipman feed.  His self-declared status as an expert in prevention is irresponsible.  He makes no evidence-based recommendations, and many that are downright dangerous.  He illustrates one of the fundamental contradictions in the alternative medicine movement: the claim to be pro-prevention but actions that completely belie the claim.  It would be sad if it weren’t dangerous and irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Huffington Post is full of dangerous and irresponsible medical writing.  There’s nothing random about it—it is an organized and concerted effort to impose a cult-like vision of health on their readers.  This would be nearly tolerable if it were a fringe website, but it’s not—it’s a wildly popular news outlet, and Huffington uses this to propagate her cult views.  It’s not illegal, but it is immoral.&lt;/p&gt;

I am unbelievably excited and nervous about this venture. Though, as more people contact me, excited about the idea, the nervousness is decreasing and the excitement is approaching “mind blowing”… I might actually have to appoint an excitement czar to help me keep my giddiness in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The awesome thing about &lt;a href="http://skepticamp.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Skepticamp&lt;/a&gt; is that it’s organized by the participants… everyone brings in their superpowers, and put them in a room and BAM! Skepicamp! (I’m probably forgetting a couple steps, but whatever.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So today, I ask you, Skepchickal Super-heroines and heroes, what are your skeptical super powers? What would you bring to the table at a Skepticamp (or do you want to bring to Skepchicamp)? If you have no super powers, what ordinary skeptical skills do you possess (or wish you possessed) that, if you were to inhale radioactive gas from an insect’s breath, might become superhuman?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community. Look for it to appear daily at 3pm ET.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source

&lt;p&gt;The topic is the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (Vouchers).  I’ll be one of the three panelists speaking in favor of the resolution, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BE IT RESOLVED, the District of Columbia should stop accepting new students into the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (sometimes referred to as the DC voucher program) and should end the program once the children who are already in the program have finished their schooling.  [&lt;a href="http://dcyoungdemocrats.web.officelive.com/Documents/Resolution%20Debate%20flyer%20VS.pdf"&gt;Flyer (pdf&lt;/a&gt;)]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secular Coalition objects to the DC voucher program because, as it’s written, the program violates the separation of church and state. We have no position on vouchers for secular schools, but when it comes to taxpayer money being used for religious instruction in religious institutions that discriminate on the basis of faith… we’re against that.  You can read more in our &lt;a href="http://www.secular.org/issues/vouchers/?view=summary"&gt;position paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining me in supporting the resolution are &lt;strong&gt;Tanya Clay House&lt;/strong&gt; (Dir. Public Policy, People For the American Way) and &lt;strong&gt;Iris Toyer&lt;/strong&gt; (Pres., Parents United for the DC Public Schools).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposing the resolution will be &lt;strong&gt;Harry Thomas, Jr.&lt;/strong&gt; (DC Councilmember – Ward 5), &lt;strong&gt;Virginia Walden Ford&lt;/strong&gt; (Exec. Dir., DC Parents for School Choice), &lt;strong&gt;Gregory Cork&lt;/strong&gt;, and (Pres. &amp;amp; CEO, Washington Scholarship Fund).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the debate, the members of DC Young Democrats vote on who won, and that determines the group’s official position on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our perspective is often overlooked in the discussion, so come by and support the separation of church and state!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal for a new kind of slang following the pattern "metal fork" for "metaphor"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to replace boring abstract words with very specific concrete things that sound pretty close to the original word. I'd like to build on the single example of "metal fork" for "metaphor."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is based on a recent mishearing. Did I hear "metaphor" and think I heard "metal fork" or was it the other way around?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the re-shaping began with a mishearing, which Althouse then reproduced deliberately. When such a re-shaping happens without conscious design, we have some sort of &lt;em&gt;malapropism&lt;/em&gt;, and when the re-shaping yields something that seems (to some people) to be especially appropriate semantically, we have an &lt;em&gt;eggcorn&lt;/em&gt; (hundreds of examples on the &lt;a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/"&gt;Eggcorn Database&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written about deliberately invented examples under the name &lt;em&gt;mock&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;malaprops&lt;/em&gt;. See my &lt;a href="http://arnoldzwicky.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/mock-eggcorns-and-their-kin/"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on "mock eggcorns and their kin", with examples of several sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

The arguments of the nonreligious are “not nice” or “are smug” or “are rude.” PZ posted a link to one such argument, and I don’t think I really need to point out how silly it is to simply call someone rude, smug, or cruel as a refutation of an argument or as the first line in an argument. It really needs a good fisking, but since it seems the server is down while I write this, I’ll just post the cached version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*note: it’s dull and boring, the bulk of my actual argument is after the silly part&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am trying really hard to cut down on generalising and bagging out “atheists” rather than specific people and streams of atheism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really now? Odd, because this seems to be precisely what you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re not all the same – and they aren’t all out to eat your babies. But atheists (general) keep giving me reason to think bad thoughts about them. Like the two who hijack this thread on Communicate Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like babies, they’re delicious and nutritious, very tender, too. They hijacked a thread?  I sure thought they were just commenting… Looks like &lt;a href="http://communicatejesus.com/2009/09/disappointing-start-to-jesus-all-about-life/"&gt;it to me&lt;/a&gt;. Go look at the page for yourself. There doesn’t seem to be anything false in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are five tips for my atheist friends to help them seem nicer and more reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasonable? He wants atheists to be reasonable? He can’t be serious. He believes a book written over 1000 years ago with no sources for verification, no corroborating evidence from contemporary historians, not a shred of physical evidence supporting the supernatural claims in that book, and he wants US to be reasonable. What drugs are you on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Stop being so smug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m smug because, let’s see, my arguments aren’t easily refuted? You can’t produce any evidence and therefor must resort to “well, you’re just too proud of yourself.” Really, I’m not, I’ll be proud of myself when I’m part of a project that improves lives for much of humanity. Until then, I’m going to be very vocal about the clear misrepresentations of honest inquiry and attempts to suppress this inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Don’t assume every piece of Christian evangelism is directed at you – we want the undecideds, not the decided-uns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So do I. I want them to have honest representations of what I am saying. I’m also after YOU. I want YOU to think critically about the things you believe. I also want other atheists to think critically about what they believe. I want honest and &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;informed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; criticisms. By making dishonest or uninformed criticisms misrepresenting my position or the scientific method or scientific discoveries, I take great offense to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Admit that the debate about God’s existence is complex – and that it can, depending on your presuppositions, be quite possible for intelligent and rational people to intelligently believe in an intervening deity who communicates through a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except the debate is not complex: “Do/does (a) god(s) exist?” See, simple question. Now, here’s where the rational part comes in. Do you have any &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;physical evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; supporting your claim that a supernatural entity exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Admit that the scientific method – which by its nature relies on induction rather than deduction (starting with a hypothesis and testing it rather than observing facts and forming a hypothesis) – is as open to abuse as any religious belief, and is neither objective nor infallible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s this for a refutation: go fuck yourself with a chalice. A hypothesis is not the starting point, it’s not even the end point, nor is it in the middle. Hypotheses are proposed based upon existing evidence and these hypotheses have testable aspects. So, yes, facts are observed, and hypotheses are formed. The experiments confirm or refute the hypotheses and new hypotheses are created based upon these observations. A hypothesis is an assumption, the observations are data, the interpretation of this data confirming or refuting the hypothesis is termed the result. These results are incorporated into new hypotheses and the cycle starts again. Results will always yield more questions than answers. Answering these questions is the goal of writing a hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this quite different method than the one you claim, science has a few other tricks, peer review and self-correction. In the event you have never been to a conference where two opposing models are being presented, you have yet to see an argument. Both sides are often VERY well informed, and usually very interesting questions are raised by these discussions as well as courses of investigation for both parties to further support or refute their own claims or the claims of the other party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Try to deal with the actual notions of God seriously believed in by millions of people rather than inventing strawmen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, supernatural entity which answers prayers, helps people in need, and so forth? That one? You see, it has been addressed-repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(or spaghetti monsters) to dismiss the concepts of God&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better idea, how about figure out that the spaghetti monster illustrates exactly how much evidence you have for the notion of “God.” Similarly, the Celestial Teapot, Invisible Pink Unicorn, and Cthulhu all illustrate precisely the same level of evidence put forth by these believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;and deal with the Bible paying attention to context and the broader Christological narrative rather than quoting obscure Old Testament laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine, I’ll resort exclusively to the New Testament:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5:18: For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops, seems like the “Old Testament” is still valid, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By all means quote the laws when they are applied incorrectly by “Christians” – but understand how they’re meant to work before dealing with the Christians described in point 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll just let SAB point out the &lt;a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/abs/nt_list.html"&gt;absurdities&lt;/a&gt; to you. I’ll also let them explain the &lt;a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/science/nt_list.html"&gt;blatantly wrong parts&lt;/a&gt;. Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly fun comment on the “communicate jesus” website is this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Gerry, let’s take God out of the picture at the moment. Assuming (falsely, in my view!) that there is no god…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- why are there weapons of war in our world?&lt;br&gt;
- why is there disease in our world?&lt;br&gt;
- we are we not compassionate toward one another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does an atheist respond to these difficult questions of suffering, pain, disease, sickness and the overall problems with the human condition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God easily becomes the scapegoat for humanity’s woes, yet I am yet to hear an atheist thank God for what is good about humanity and the world we live in. If there is no god, how do you respond to the questions above?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answers for these questions are quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Weapons of war were created by humans to fight against one another for resources of various types or political power&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Disease exists because of bacterial infections, viral infections, genetic disorders, autoimmune syndromes, and the like. All organisms struggle for life, mutation exists as a function of life… Disease exists because of these things, there is no cognitive desire for these to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) We generally are compassionate towards others within our “in-group.” This is because of our empathy instinct. When people are not empathetic, it is generally because the target is outside of the “in-group” either by birth or because they are excluded due to his or her behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) These questions are not difficult, and they have been answered MANY times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Even if these questions could not be or have not been answered numerous times, it’s still not useful to say “if you can’t answer this, god exists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Now for my real post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to argue a point, in this case, for “atheists to seem nicer,” be prepared to support these claims when they come under criticism. In the illustrated case, the points brought up already been addressed quite extensively. Saying “the Earth is flat” millions of times is not a persuasive argument. Similarly, saying “atheists should be nice” thousands of times does not explain WHY we “should be nice.” Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean to “be nice.” Does this mean we should not criticize your political views which often overlap with your religious views? Does this mean we are allowed to be critical if we don’t resort to name-calling? Additionally, I hope to come off to many Christians as shockingly rude, I have several motivations for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will respond to your opinions precisely in the same way I reply to any other claims or views; I refuse to accept the notion that religion is somehow exempt from criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presenting shocking arguments are usually the best way to get the attention of the religious. When you present an argument that offends, it is a reflex for the person to read the argument in depth. This is precisely when I will use profanity; for shock-value. Using this too frequently results in attenuation, and hopefully, the attenuation to the shocking views of others will allow the religious to better cope with living in a diverse society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you consider my criticisms to be offensive, rude, or “smug,” I encourage you to criticize them with rational, logical arguments which are novel and have not yet been addressed. I want to learn, saying the same thing over and over again is just intellectually dull.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I find your arguments flawed, and you reword them stating the exact same thing without addressing the critique, I feel obligated to call you out o on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promised last week in a post in which I described Bill Maher's latest pro-quackery remarks (this time, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/is_bill_maher_really_that_ignorant_part_2.php"&gt;supporting cancer quackery&lt;/a&gt;), today is the day that I'm going to ask you, my readers, for some help. As I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_gets_the_richard_dawkins_awar.php"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; a while back, Bill Maher, who is anything but a rationalist or a booster of science (at least when it comes to medicine) is being awarded the Richard Dawkins Award by the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org"&gt;Atheist Alliance International&lt;/a&gt; at its &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org"&gt;convention this weekend in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, given that (1) the award lists "advocates increased scientific knowledge" as one of its criteria; (2) that Maher is an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/08/bill_maher_antivaccination_wingnut.php"&gt;anti-vaccine crank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/bill_maher_on_christine_maggiores_book.php"&gt;sympathetic to HIV/AIDS denialism&lt;/a&gt;, a booster of PETA, and&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/is_bill_maher_really_that_ignorant_part_2.php"&gt; believer in cancer quackery&lt;/a&gt;; and (3) that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_problem_with_writing_by_co.php#comment-1789758"&gt;Richard Dawkin's response to the criticism of Maher's pseudoscientific medical beliefs&lt;/a&gt; was tepid at best, today I'm requesting from my readers suggestions for questions to ask both Bill Maher and Richard Dawkins at the AAI about Bill Maher's beliefs in quackery and woo. Then, on Thursday (the day before the AAI conference begins), I will post a list of these questions in a handy-dandy one-stop-shop blog post for any readers who might be attendees, assuming I end up with a sufficient number of good questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/is_bill_maher_really_that_ignorant_part_2.php"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; before, yeah, I'm trying to make trouble, and I don't apologize for it. I might fail, fall flat on my face, and end up looking like an idiot given that no one else seems to be agitated enough by this to make much of a sustained complaint about it, but I'm going for it anyway. If I end up looking like an idiot, so be it. It wouldn't be the first time and it won't be the last. Look at it this way: I'm just doing what P. Z. Myers &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/put_maher_in_the_hot_seat.php"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;, and helping to give those of you who are as disgusted with Maher as I am ammunition to help put him in the hot seat. I also don't want you to forget Dawkins. Remember &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_problem_with_writing_by_co.php#comment-1789758"&gt;Dawkins' reaction to learning&lt;/a&gt; about the controversy over the selection of Maher for the award bearing his name:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/ask_bill_maher_and_richard_dawkins_some.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/ask_bill_maher_and_richard_dawkins_some.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/lKS2if2gk7g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254156336827"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=18771">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2914776a74f99bab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="food"/><category term="price theory"/><category term="restaurants"/><title type="html">Is the Senior Slam Smart?</title><published>2009-09-28T15:40:22Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T15:40:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/28/is-the-senior-slam-smart/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Denny's breakfast menu in Provo, Utah, offers something that combines demand-based and cost-based price discrimination, but it's neither.

&lt;br&gt;long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
&lt;br&gt;Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;-Edgar Allen Poe, &lt;u&gt;The Raven&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Gazing out into the dark abyss of the night sky, stars, galaxies, and clusters shine like tiny islands of light against the blackness of deep space.  Trillions upon trillions of protons and neutrons fuse together in stars across the Universe, producing all of this light, and decorating the sky above.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/phot-31a-09-fullres.jpg" width="500" title="Just one of the billions of galaxies and a few hundred of the billions of stars available for your viewing pleasure every night." alt="phot-31a-09-fullres.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as we learned in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_i_how_much_ma.php"&gt;part one of this series&lt;/a&gt;, the starlight that we see only accounts for 2% of all the matter that gravity tells us is there.  What's more than that, is that we can figure out how much normal matter (i.e., stuff made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons, etc.) is around.  We explored this &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_ii_how_much_n.php"&gt;in part 2&lt;/a&gt;, and found that this brings us up to maybe 15-20% of the total, but no more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where do we go from here?  Do we invent a new type of matter, and give it some bland, generic name like &lt;b&gt;dark matter&lt;/b&gt;, or do we conclude that gravity is lying to us, because we've been using the wrong theory?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/relativity_light_bending.jpg" width="500" title="Messing with GR, are you?" alt="relativity_light_bending.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In principle, either one of these two explanations would suffice (although I'm hard-pressed to think of a third).  If you're willing to add some new type of matter that doesn't behave the same way that normal matter does, you could explain all of the observations we discussed in the first two parts.  But can you do this by modifying gravity?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am telling you now, the answer appears to be &lt;b&gt;no&lt;/b&gt;, as long as you demand that your new theory of gravity be sensible.  Here's the three killer reasons why.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/double_pulsar.jpg" width="500" title="The Binary Pulsar system is incredibly powerful for testing relativity!" alt="double_pulsar.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.)  General relativity works.&lt;/b&gt;  In all the instances where Newton's theories failed observationally -- for the orbit of Mercury, for the bending of light by stars and galaxies, for pulsar timing variations and orbital decay, for the Lense-Thirring effect, and more -- Einstein's general theory of relativity saves us.  If you're going to modify gravity, you'd better make sure your &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; theory can reproduce all of the successes of general relativity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This immediately means that MOND (MOdified Newtonian Dynamics) is out as a replacement theory, as it fails to solve &lt;i&gt;each and every one&lt;/i&gt; of the problems above.  But maybe there's a way to do it.  Maybe there's a way to modify Einstein's gravity (&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403694"&gt;Bekenstein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Moffat_(physicist)"&gt;Moffat&lt;/a&gt; have tried) to still keep all of the good stuff of general relativity and &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; to get rid of dark matter.  But then this observation came along.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/1e0657_opt.jpg" width="500" title="The Bullet Cluster, as imaged by Hubble, in all its glory." alt="1e0657_opt.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two clusters of galaxies here, interacting with each other.  These galaxy clusters have just collided, clashing into one another.  How do we know?  The X-ray data shows us the evidence of a big &lt;i&gt;SPLAT!&lt;/i&gt; that happened just a few million years ago:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/chandra110408.jpg" width="500" title="This is where your normal matter is." alt="chandra110408.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This splat tells us where the majority of the normal matter is: right in the center of the image.  You can even see the cone-like shockwave on the right side.  But what if we look for the evidence of &lt;i&gt;gravity&lt;/i&gt;?  We can look at the lensing data to tell us where the mass is.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/1e0657_opt_lens_d.jpg" width="500" title="And this is where gravity tells us the overall matter is." alt="1e0657_opt_lens_d.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the key find.  When you lay these images on top of one another, you find out, very clearly, that the majority of the mass is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; where the majority of the gravity is.  Which brings us to point number 2.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/bullet_cluster_c60w.jpg" width="500" title="The image that killed MOND?" alt="bullet_cluster_c60w.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.)  Gravity does not always line up with where the normal matter lives.&lt;/b&gt;  This tells us that either, again, we need dark matter, or we need to accept that not only is General Relativity wrong, but that gravity works in a very bizarre way.  We'd have to modify gravity an additional way to make it &lt;b&gt;non-local&lt;/b&gt;, or to make things gravitate towards places where there isn't any mass!  This is very unsettling, but it's the only way to reconcile these observations without using dark matter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it can be done!  In fact, Moffat (described above) made a version of this that works.  Although it's extremely messy mathematically, he can get this "dumbbell" shape for gravity out of this configuration of mass &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; dark matter.  Sure, it's non-local, but maybe that's not an impossibility.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, however, two interesting things that -- for me -- are convincing enough to kill this idea.  Think about this, if you will: what did the bullet cluster look like &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; these two clusters collided?  Wherever the normal matter (pink) was must have lined up precisely with where the gravity (blue) was.  But after the collision, they don't anymore.  Take a look at the animation below (use the control bar and double-click on the image to start/stop the animation):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;  
 &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same theory of modified, non-local gravity &lt;i&gt;does not work&lt;/i&gt; before the collision!  This brings us to the third -- and in my opinion, the most lethal -- objection to modified gravity instead of dark matter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.) You &lt;i&gt;either&lt;/i&gt; need a separate theory of gravity for each new geometry of cluster collisions, including for each cluster before and after the collision, &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; you need to add dark matter to your modified gravity &lt;i&gt;anyway&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;  So all you need to kill modified gravity?  A &lt;i&gt;second&lt;/i&gt; example of colliding galaxy clusters.  If you'd need a second, incompatible theory of modified gravity to explain it, that tells you that modified gravity isn't the answer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, say hello to the colliding cluster MACS J0025, in the optical:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/macs_optical.jpg" width="500" title="MACS J0025 in the optical..." alt="macs_optical.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the X-ray:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/macs_xray.jpg" width="500" title="MACS J0025 in the X-ray..." alt="macs_xray.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to the gravitational lensing data:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/macs_lens.jpg" width="500" title="MACS J0025 in... uhh... &amp;#39;gravity vision&amp;#39;?" alt="macs_lens.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and to all of them combined.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt/macs_420.jpg" width="500" title="And here&amp;#39;s all three... convinced yet?" alt="macs_420.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The configurations are incompatible.&lt;/b&gt;  So either you need a different theory of non-local modified gravity for every colliding galaxy cluster in the Universe, or you need dark matter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not, mind you, that we know what dark matter &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, just that we need it.  When I write part IV, I'll go over some of the leading candidates, what I favor, and why.  In the meantime, have you convinced yourselves that we need dark matter?  If so, what was it that convinced you, and if not, where have you wriggled out of my reasoning?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/dark_matter_part_iii_dark_matt.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254154649369"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/xopher-yep-the-schedule-is-s/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5fda6c52dd84b8e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">@xopher yep, the schedule is s…</title><published>2009-09-28T15:31:43Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T15:31:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/xopher-yep-the-schedule-is-s/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;@xopher yep, the schedule is still taking shape&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254154472344"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16519">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b9718b8083012de9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Art"/><category term="General"/><category term="Pop Culture"/><title type="html">More Musicians Embrace Godlessness</title><published>2009-09-28T16:00:08Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T16:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/28/more-musicians-embrace-godlessness/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I mentioned that Jazz bassist &lt;strong&gt;Ben Allison&lt;/strong&gt; recently &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/27/jazz-bassist-ben-allison-outs-himself-as-an-atheist/"&gt;outed himself as an atheist&lt;/a&gt;.

How could you recognize&lt;br&gt;
and cherish hysteric fairy tales.&lt;br&gt;
They’ve come to life.&lt;br&gt;
Now sit by and listen…&lt;br&gt;
the whole world wails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it divine&lt;br&gt;
when it’s flawed design?&lt;br&gt;
Fill the cracks with faith I can’t find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh please believe I’m doing just fine.&lt;br&gt;
For what’s deceased I shall never grieve.&lt;br&gt;
Just let your faith die.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I say “allude to”?  I meant they come right out and say it: religious beliefs are absurd and we’d all be better off without the superstition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;David Bazan&lt;/strong&gt; was the frontman for (as the submitter put it) “one of the few historical non-sucky Christian bands” &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_the_Lion"&gt;Pedro the Lion&lt;/a&gt;.  But his faith is slipping, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His new solo album, “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HHBC06?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002HHBC06"&gt;Curse Your Branches&lt;/a&gt;,” came out earlier this month.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt; review, &lt;a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/08/album-review-david-bazans-curse-your-branches.html"&gt;he’s come a long way&lt;/a&gt; since his Christian days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bazan built an intensely devoted following inside the Christian community during his decade-long run with Pedro, asking tough questions of religion from the perspective of a thoughtful believer. &lt;strong&gt;Here, though, the doubt that Bazan has always scratched at takes a firmer, more certain form: “I clung to miracles I have not seen,” he admits in “Bearing Witness,” “From ancient autographs I cannot read.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past tense there is crucial: “Curse Your Branches” documents Bazan’s coming to terms with his newfound agnosticism , a change of heart he credits in “When We Fell” to his inability to accept “the threat of hell hanging over my head like a halo.” (”In what medieval kingdom does justice work this way?” he wonders later in that song.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we just need one of these artists to make it big enough so they can sing these lyrics on TV or at an awards show.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, can we have a Grammy category for Best Contemporary Atheist Album?  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/09/11/jesus-remarks-censored-dick-in-a-box-considered-for-primetime/"&gt;Kathy Griffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; could present it… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Jay&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;David&lt;/strong&gt; for the links!)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/retractable_forehead_genitalia.php"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, PZ has linked to a story at &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/2009/09/another-species-with-forehead-genitals/"&gt;Deep Sea News&lt;/a&gt; about the description of a new species of ratfish with “forehead genitals”. While it’s a great concept, the tentaculum, or cephalic claspers, of ratfish are not genitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Male chimaerid" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/dscn4382.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="Male chimaerid" width="500" height="375"&gt;Fig. 1. That’s not ratfish genitalia. A male ratfish (family Chimaeridae) showing the tentaculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genitalia of male ratfish are the pelvic claspers, modifications of the medial side of the pelvic fins used as intromittent organs for the introduction of sperm into the female’s reproductive tract. The ratfish’s pelvic claspers are bifid and especially spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Claspers of male chimaerid." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/dscn4386.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="Claspers of male chimaerid." width="500" height="375"&gt;Fig. 2. &lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; ratfish genitalia. A male ratfish’s (family Chimaeridae) pelvic claspers; note the bifid structure, giving the appearance distally of four claspers. The anterior of the fish is to the bottom of this photo. The medial lump anterior to the pelvic fins is the rectum, prolapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, here’s a female ratfish with unmodified pelvic fins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Female chimaerid" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/dscn4387.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="Female chimaerid" width="500" height="375"&gt;Fig. 3. A female ratfish (family Chimaeridae), showing unmodified pelvic fins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratfish comprise the &lt;a href="http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/shark_profiles/chimaera.htm"&gt;Holocephala&lt;/a&gt;, one of the two major subdivisions of the cartilaginous fishes, the Chondrichthyes, the other major subdivision being the sharks and rays (&lt;a href="http://www.elasmo-research.org/index.html"&gt;elasmobranchs&lt;/a&gt;). Pelvic claspers are found throughout the modern cartilaginous fishes, which therefore have internal fertilization (most bony fish have external fertilization). Although living species of sharks do not have tentacula, some fossil ones (e.g.&lt;a href="http://www.sju.edu/research/bear_gulch/pages_fish_species/Falcatus_falcatus.php"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Falcatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) did, and &lt;a href="http://www.hmnh.org/archives/2005/08/26/friday-dead-animal-blogging-4/"&gt;others had other sorts of spine encrusted bits&lt;/a&gt; on their front ends which may have been involved in courtship and mating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not tentacula are genitals is a matter of the definition of genitals, of course, but the term is, to my knowledge, reserved for structures involved in the transfer and reception of gametes. If parts of the body used in courtship are considered genitals, then the throat fans of anoles and the long fingernails of turtles would have to be considered genitals, too; indeed,  so would the entire human body.  Many commenters at Pharyngula  have remarked about ratfish having penises on their heads (or something to that effect), which, of course, they don’t: their genitals are in the normal place (for cartilaginous fish), alongside their pelvic fins.&lt;img title="Female (left) and male chimaerids." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/dscn4385.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="Female (left) and male chimaerids." width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fig. 4. A ratfish couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I  tried to post a short comment to this effect at Pharyngula last night, but found I wasn’t registered to do so, and then I thought, “Why talk about it, when you can show pictures”, so I waited to take some photos this morning and posted here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — Citing the extremely low level of entropy present before a normal set of football downs, scientists from the NFL’s quantum mechanics and cosmology laboratories spoke Monday of a theoretical proto-down before the first. “Ultimately, we believe there are an infinite number of proto-downs played before the first visible snap,” lead NFL scientist Dr. Oliver Claussen said during a press conference, adding that the very last yocto-down is a by-product of leftover fourth downs from this universe, as well as those from a theoretical universe running along an arrow of time concurrent to our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably some enthusiastic football coach is going to try to cash in by writing a book about the idea, while others fulminate on the sidelines about how such irresponsible speculation is destroying the game.

I'm opening the site up to guest bloggers, who can follow in &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/642"&gt;the steps of DeeTee&lt;/a&gt; and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places are limited for now, so I'll judge the people who get in touch by some criteria - existing writing, how they come across, what they want to write about, that sort of thing. People can cross-post stuff from their own blogs if they like, to help use this site to promote their own writing. They can post as regularly or irregularly as they like, on whatever science or junk science subjects they like, as long as it's interesting, decent quality, and isn't going to get me in lots of trouble!&lt;/p&gt;

Here&amp;#39;s their abstract.From recordings of single-cell activity in the macaque monkey&amp;#39;s primary visual cortex (V1), we found that black-dominant neurons substantially outnumbered white-dominant neurons in the corticocortical output layers 2/3, but the numbers of black- and white-dominant neurons were nearly equal in the thalamocortical input layer 4c. These results strongly suggest that the black-over-white preference is generated or greatly amplified in V1. The predominance of OFF neurons in layers 2/3 of V1, which provide visual input to higher cortical areas, may explain why human subjects detect black more easily than white. Furthermore, our results agree with human EEG and fMRI findings that V1 responses to decrements are stronger than to increments, though the OFF/ON imbalance we found in layers 2/3 of macaque V1 is much larger than in the whole V1 population in the human V1 experiments (Zemon et al., 1988, 1995; Olman et al., 2008).No wonder boldface text literally catches the eye.Yeh CI, Xing D, &amp;amp; Shapley RM (2009). &amp;quot;Black&amp;quot; responses dominate macaque primary visual cortex v1.

Dawkins proposes a change from calling it the &amp;quot;theory of evolution&amp;quot; to the &amp;quot;theorum of evolution.&amp;quot; This is not to be confused with a mathematical THEOREM spelled with an e but is chosen to give a more specific slant and weight to a particular meaning of the word &amp;quot;theory&amp;quot; in the context of evolution.  This particular meaning being a systematic set of ideas that account for a body of facts. Dawkins is trying to provide the lexicon with a word that differentiates the meaning provided in the last sentence from the secondary definition of the word &amp;quot;theory&amp;quot; which is a &amp;quot;speculative conjecture, or idea&amp;quot; giving the impression that, used in this sense, an idea is merely a concept or &amp;quot;only a theory.&amp;quot;  This second definition is often used by intelligent design proponents to basically give the false impression that the concept of evolution has not been proven.

Well it has, and the most stark evidence of descent with modification driven by natural selection that chemical biology can currently provide lays in the genetic code.  Comparing sequences of DNA we are able to see that certain sequences match and others partially match in mammoths and mice, frogs and dogs, and in some genes even humans and plants.  We can see in the code what is known as molecular phylogeny. We see in matching strings of As Ts Gs and Cs that every organism is living at the tip of a theoretical branch in an ancient tree of life with a central trunk from which we all descended through countless generations of successfully prolific ancestors. To give an example, the genes that dictate the human body plan (Hox genes) are also present in all major branches in the &amp;quot;animal&amp;quot; part of the tree. It has been shown by comparative molecular phylogenetic analysis that these genes arose before the Cambrian explosion about 530 million years before any kind of hominid creature roamed the earth.

Great, but why should we care? Why should anyone not making their living in a biologically inclined academic setting need to understand the &amp;quot;theorum&amp;quot; of evolution?  

Humans are uniquely positioned in the animal kingdom to predict and outmaneuver the inherent screening process that normally facilitates natural selection among all other organisms.  On a single person scale, I myself would not be alive today were it not for the maneuvering of medical technology. When I was born I inhaled part of the afterbirth and had to have my lungs pumped right away. On a global scale, the natural selection screen of limited fossil fuels is rapidly approaching and regardless of your thoughts on the evidence for global climate change, survival in the face of resource depletion requires that we understand how evolution by natural selection works if we hope to overcome and outsmart the brutality of resource wars.  

In the above movie when I talk of a &amp;quot;peaceful survival strategy&amp;quot; being the most successful. I should qualify that further by saying a cooperative and empathetic strategy will out-compete a selfish and aggressive strategy. This is demonstrated by the algorithms of Robert Axelrod explained in great detail in the later chapters the Selfish Gene while the parameters of those strategies are further explored in this paper.

Serendipitously, in a review (which I had not read until after composing this post) of the new book The Age of Empathy by Frans De Waal some of the concepts that I just mentioned are fleshed out even more. The review was aptly titled Survival of the Kindest and apperaerd in SEED magazine last week.  Check it out for yourself.

On the other side, we resent being told to curb what is perhaps our strongest natural instinct – to make more versions of our genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature of this debate that encourages or at least allows emotion to reign over data is that the core questions involve predicting the future. We are very bad at predicting the future. Predicting the future is really just an exercise in projecting our biases onto the future. The best we can do is extrapolate current trends forward, but there are often multiple overlapping trends that we can choose from, some trends are really cyclical, and the appropriate curve (linear, geometric, exponential) may not be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to identify in a controversy where there are value judgments that cannot be resolved objectively with facts. The abortion debate continues to rage because at its core is a personal choice of value – the mother’s biological freedom vs the life of a fetus. In the population debate there are value judgments regarding humanity’s rights and responsibilities toward the earth and all other life on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A recent issue of New Scientist explores various points of view regarding &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/special/population"&gt;the population debate&lt;/a&gt;. For anyone interested in this topic this makes for good fodder. The basic facts are this – human population is now reaching 7 billion people. It is estimated that by 2050 we will exceed 9 billion. However it is also true that as our technology progresses we are able to sustain more people with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It often seems, therefore, that where one stands with regard to the population issue depends upon whether one is a pessimist or optimist. Although, even for the maximal optimist it must be acknowledged that there must be some upper limit to what population the earth can comfortably support, and that at some point (despite technological advances) increasing population becomes an increasing drag on the environment and other species – for reasons of physical space if nothing else (setting aside expanding the human population off planet and focusing just on the population of the earth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the pessimistic point of view is Paul and Anne Ehrlich, who write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, cultural attitudes toward large families everywhere need to be changed. It should be considered immoral to have excessive numbers of children – an attitude that already exists in most industrialised nations with low birth rates. Nothing is more clearly a governmental responsibility than keeping a nation’s population size sustainable by benevolent measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as curbing population growth, we shouldn’t forget the pressing issue of excessive consumption by the rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their argument amounts to a peak resources position – it will get more and more difficult to sustain an increasing population with fewer and fewer resources. Again, this is likely to be true at some point, but saying that we are essentially there now seems to ignore the role of technological advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staking out the other end of the spectrum is Jesse Ausubel who points out that while the population has been increasing at a rate of about 1% per year, crop yields have been increasing at a rate of 2% per year, allowing us to grow more food on less land. In &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327271.600-population-technology-will-save-us.html?page=1"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology has liberated humans from the environment. Today we live about equally well in polar and tropical, arid and wet environments. The new question is whether humanity can use technology to liberate the environment itself. E-books, landless agriculture – farming that uses very little land because of high yields – and subterranean maglevs show the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, however, that even a techno-optimist like Ausubel points out that we need to prioritize those technologies that do “free nature” by allowing us to do more with less. He is not saying that we should ignore the issues of population and resources – but that we can rely upon technological advances to give us solutions, if we choose to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit I am more toward the Ausubel end of the spectrum than the Ehrlich end. Doom and gloom predictions over the last century about population increase and dwindling resources have not come true. Reading the Ehrlich’s warning about rising death rates sound a lot like the predictions of massive die offs that have been made and failed to manifest on a regular basis over the previous decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I think we can conclude that it is not terribly useful to make predictions based upon current sustainability, because technology is constantly changing the equation. And technological advance has continued to surprise us. It seems likely that in 100 years the problems humanity will be facing are likely to be different than most of those causing current worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean, however, that we should just shrug and not worry. Thoughtfully contemplating the implications of our industry and population, and how to prioritize technological development and research is likely to have a huge impact on our future. I am optimistic that technology will give us potential solutions to the problems caused by a rising population within finite resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we still need to develop and implement those solutions. Some of them will happen as a matter of course – people will use light bulbs that use less electricity and last longer simply because they will save money. But others may require more deliberate application, and we may need to bridge to “better” technologies through a cost-ineffective transition. For example, we may need to subsidize solar energy against the very cost effective fossil fuels before fossil fuel prices surge because of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say “may” because I personally don’t know – this is a specific technical question best left to appropriate experts. An approach I generally recommend over ideology.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254151595721"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/morning_report---what_is_diffe.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eadc638db8b29fe0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Morning Report---what is differential diagnosis?</title><published>2009-09-28T14:03:29Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T14:03:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/4FF3hKwKP6w/morning_report---what_is_diffe.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/morning_report---what_is_diffe.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jerome Groopman, whose writing I generally enjoy, put out a book a couple of years ago called &lt;i&gt;How Doctors Think&lt;/i&gt;.  It examined, well, how doctors think, how they &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; they think, and what the future holds for diagnosing disease.  It's a good book, but with some faulty assumptions.  I'm not the guy to write about how decisions are made---I don't know enough about the field, a field which needs much more research.  But most doctors do not, as is sometimes posited, make diagnoses via algorithm.  Nor are we slavishly bound to statistical likelihood, as the use of likelihood ratios and, er, the like has some problems.  What we do teach formally is the process of &lt;strong&gt;differential diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differential diagnosis (DDx) is the fun part of medical thinking, and hopefully the lessons learned about the process endure.  When a resident or medical student presents  a case to me, they often have an immediate feeling for what is wrong with the patient.  This feeling may or may not coincide with reality.  Getting a &lt;i&gt;gestalt&lt;/i&gt; feeling for a case is important, but it is only a starting point.  One of the &lt;i&gt;gestalts&lt;/i&gt; I like my residents to get a feel for is whether a patient is really &lt;i&gt;sick&lt;/i&gt;---I don't mean whether or not they have a cold or whatever, but do they appear seriously ill.  There are parameters which can help determine this, but when someone comes in with a vague picture and you don't have access to sophisticated diagnostic equipment, it's good to be able to make that judgment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the luxuries of being a teaching physician is being able to take the time to break down a case in a more formal manner and to develop a traditional differential diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/morning_report---what_is_diffe.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/morning_report---what_is_diffe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/4FF3hKwKP6w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254151347622"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=2653">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d14182900a785ff1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><title type="html">On Whether to Respond to Critics</title><published>2009-09-28T14:50:08Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T14:50:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/09/28/on-whether-to-respond-to-critics/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I have been busy getting married, on honeymoon, and trying to get settled in Boston, a great many things have been said about &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt; and about myself and Sheril. Many have been false, unfair, or worse. Or as Josh Rosenau &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/08/on_bullshit.php"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;: “Mooney and Kirshenbaum were personally maligned, and their book misrepresented to a degree that raises questions about whether critics actually read the book.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I must agree with this assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, I have been logistically hampered in my ability to reply to such things, but also limited in my desire to do so. After all, there are many reasons to just let stuff go, no matter how unfair or ridiculous. It takes a lot of time to refute errors and misrepresentations, and there’s relatively little chance minds will be changed even when you do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The chief argument for not responding to unfair critics involves peace and tranquility–not getting dragged into a debate in which one side is willing to say very irresponsible and inaccurate things, and having one’s time consumed by such an unedifying spectacle. And there is also the fact that, when under unfair attack, there are always a few honest souls who perceive what is going on and leap to your defense–in this case, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/08/on_bullshit.php"&gt;Rosenau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt; and &lt;a href="http://kazez.blogspot.com/2009/07/chris-mooneys-apostasy.html"&gt;Jean Kazez&lt;/a&gt; in particular have filled that role, as have some others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other side of the ledger, not everyone is a Rosenau or Kazez–and many folks don’t want to enter a brawl even if they do perceive what’s really going on. Meanwhile, misinformation has a way of getting repeated &lt;em&gt;ad nauseum&lt;/em&gt;, and all too many people make up their minds not based on whether they have read a book or thought about it, but merely based on what they’ve heard someone say. Repetition becomes reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fact would seem to argue that one must be constantly involved in responding and setting the record straight–but then again, one quickly reverts back to the counterargument. With so much being said that is wrong, it would be a massive endeavor to set it all right, with highly uncertain rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show as much, let’s consider one tiny example of a ridiculous thing said about our book, and how much effort it takes to refute it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a negative &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/reviews/2009/09/unscientific-america-surprisingly-unscientific.ars"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt; recently published by &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;, the reviewer, Yun Xie, faults us for (among other things) our argument about how science used to enjoy a better place in American life, writing as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;The authors bring up these periods in history throughout the book and advise that we should learn lessons from them because “we need science to reestablish its core relevance to American life, to enjoy the standing and visibility it had in the late 1950s and early 1960s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;But, while there are definitely lessons to be learned, the authors didn’t convince me that science should return to its standing in the post-war era. &lt;em&gt;Much of the appreciation for science back then was based on awe and an almost blind trust in the power of chemicals and machinery. &lt;/em&gt;[Italics added]&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Instead of returning to a previous state of prominence, wouldn’t it be better to achieve a modern level of importance, a place where the public is informed about what research is done in the labs, and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a reasonable criticism–but in fact, it isn’t one at all. Why? Because the argument seemingly being used against us is in fact one that we completely agree with. Indeed, the observations that form its basis [in italics] can be found in our book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, in order to better criticize us, Xie leaves out a key part of our sentence and misconstrues our meaning. We actually wrote the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;…we need science to reestablish its core relevance to American life, to enjoy the standing and visibility it had in the late 1950s and early 1960s (with full accommodation of the lessons learned since then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “lessons learned” here certainly are not that we ought to go back to the 1950s and 1960s uncritically. On the contrary, our parenthetical, which &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; inexplicably drops off, is quite clearly a qualification meant to say precisely the opposite–i.e., that we need a different, more modern way of embracing of science; that we can’t just hope to warp back in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the “lessons learned” from the past involve pretty much exactly what Xie writes–”Much of the appreciation for science back then was based on awe and an almost blind trust in the power of chemicals and machinery.” In fact, we wrote it first. Discussing the reasons science fell from its postwar pedestal in Chapter 3, for instance, we include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Not only did the new mood of “questioning authority” include the questioning of science, but there was often good reason for skepticism. The environmental and consumer movements, spearheaded by the likes of Rachel Carson and Ralph Nader, brought home the realization that science wasn’t always beneficial. Seemingly wonderful technologies–DDT, chlorofluorcarbons–could have nasty, unforseen consequences. A narrative began to emerge about “corporate science”: driven by greed, conducted without adequate safeguards, placing profits over people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the reviewer appropriates our point about “lessons learned” while dropping the parenthetical off our sentence–and then &lt;em&gt;criticizes &lt;/em&gt;us by raising a point that we’ve already thought of and addressed; indeed, a point the reviewer may well have gotten from us in the first place (and that we totally agree with). Thus, the “criticism” isn’t actually a criticism at all–if you’ve read our book. It’s psuedo-criticism from someone who either doesn’t understand what the book is arguing, doesn’t care to do full justice to its arguments, or perhaps is just sloppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after making such a mistake, Xie nevertheless has the gall to accuse us of lacking “substance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is the kind of nonsense criticism I would have to respond to, if I responded regularly to many of our detractors. And indeed, especially among the less rigorous and exacting ones, this is a favorite routine: Criticizing the book based on arguments that are in fact &lt;em&gt;our own arguments&lt;/em&gt;, so that they are actually attacking a strawman–but only someone who has read the book would know it.&lt;/p&gt;

I am nevertheless thinking of doing more–but at the same time, I wonder if I should bother. By God, it’s an imposing task.

On the other side, we resent being told to curb what is perhaps our strongest natural instinct – to make more versions of our genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature of this debate that encourages or at least allows emotion to reign over data is that the core questions involve predicting the future. We are very bad at predicting the future. Predicting the future is really just an exercise in projecting our biases onto the future. The best we can do is extrapolate current trends forward, but there are often multiple overlapping trends that we can choose from, some trends are really cyclical, and the appropriate curve (linear, geometric, exponential) may not be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to identify in a controversy where there are value judgments that cannot be resolved objectively with facts. The abortion debate continues to rage because at its core is a personal choice of value – the mother’s biological freedom vs the life of a fetus. In the population debate there are value judgments regarding humanity’s rights and responsibilities toward the earth and all other life on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent issue of New Scientist explores various points of view regarding &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/special/population"&gt;the population debate&lt;/a&gt;. For anyone interested in this topic this makes for good fodder. The basic facts are this – human population is now reaching 7 billion people. It is estimated that by 2050 we will exceed 9 billion. However it is also true that as our technology progresses we are able to sustain more people with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It often seems, therefore, that where one stands with regard to the population issue depends upon whether one is a pessimist or optimist. Although, even for the maximal optimist it must be acknowledged that there must be some upper limit to what population the earth can comfortably support, and that at some point (despite technological advances) increasing population becomes an increasing drag on the environment and other species – for reasons of physical space if nothing else (setting aside expanding the human population off planet and focusing just on the population of the earth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the pessimistic point of view is Paul and Anne Ehrlich, who write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, cultural attitudes toward large families everywhere need to be changed. It should be considered immoral to have excessive numbers of children – an attitude that already exists in most industrialised nations with low birth rates. Nothing is more clearly a governmental responsibility than keeping a nation’s population size sustainable by benevolent measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as curbing population growth, we shouldn’t forget the pressing issue of excessive consumption by the rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their argument amounts to a peak resources position – it will get more and more difficult to sustain an increasing population with fewer and fewer resources. Again, this is likely to be true at some point, but saying that we are essentially there now seems to ignore the role of technological advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staking out the other end of the spectrum is Jesse Ausubel who points out that while the population has been increasing at a rate of about 1% per year, crop yields have been increasing at a rate of 2% per year, allowing us to grow more food on less land. In &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327271.600-population-technology-will-save-us.html?page=1"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology has liberated humans from the environment. Today we live about equally well in polar and tropical, arid and wet environments. The new question is whether humanity can use technology to liberate the environment itself. E-books, landless agriculture – farming that uses very little land because of high yields – and subterranean maglevs show the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, however, that even a techno-optimist like Ausubel points out that we need to prioritize those technologies that do “free nature” by allowing us to do more with less. He is not saying that we should ignore the issues of population and resources – but that we can rely upon technological advances to give us solutions, if we choose to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit I am more toward the Ausubel end of the spectrum than the Ehrlich end. Doom and gloom predictions over the last century about population increase and dwindling resources have not come true. Reading the Ehrlich’s warning about rising death rates sound a lot like the predictions of massive die offs that have been made and failed to manifest on a regular basis over the previous decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I think we can conclude that it is not terribly useful to make predictions based upon current sustainability, because technology is constantly changing the equation. And technological advance has continued to surprise us. It seems likely that in 100 years the problems humanity will be facing are likely to be different than most of those causing current worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean, however, that we should just shrug and not worry. Thoughtfully contemplating the implications of our industry and population, and how to prioritize technological development and research is likely to have a huge impact on our future. I am optimistic that technology will give us potential solutions to the problems caused by a rising population within finite resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we still need to develop and implement those solutions. Some of them will happen as a matter of course – people will use light bulbs that use less electricity and last longer simply because they will save money. But others may require more deliberate application, and we may need to bridge to “better” technologies through a cost-ineffective transition. For example, we may need to subsidize solar energy against the very cost effective fossil fuels before fossil fuel prices surge because of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say “may” because I personally don’t know – this is a specific technical question best left to appropriate experts. An approach I generally recommend over ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

See &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/blog/57"&gt;more by DeeTee here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewPicture&amp;amp;friendID=202822110&amp;amp;albumId=1738759&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;Myspace picture albums&lt;/a&gt; seem to capture a wonderful moment in time. The scene is idyllic. Sun-kissed palm trees are set against an azure Caribbean sky, and a happy couple delight in their holiday trip to the Florida Keys. Elsewhere, we can see photos of them with &lt;a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&amp;amp;friendID=202822110&amp;amp;albumID=1820098&amp;amp;imageID=29307205"&gt;their children&lt;/a&gt;, a wholesome, all-American family enjoying everything life has to offer and dreaming of good times yet to come. But despite the glowing vitality that is projected in the photos, things are not what they seem. The woman you see is Karri Stokely, a 43 year old who was diagnosed with HIV infection when she was 29 years old. She is keen to &lt;a href="http://www.livingwithouthivdrugs.com/karri.htm"&gt;share her story&lt;/a&gt;, and does so on several other websites and blogs. It should be a story of courage and hope, but I fear it will not turn out that way. For Karri has decided to completely ignore medical advice and forgo her HIV medication.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Despite the severity of her initial diagnosis, Karri’s chances for a fairly long and healthy life might have been excellent. Her HIV was diagnosed in 1996, luckily just when &lt;a href="http://www.avert.org/treatment.htm"&gt;new combinations of HIV drugs were emerging&lt;/a&gt; and having a major impact on the progress of the disease. I know from my own patients that this was a time of near-miraculous recovery for many of them, since for the first time there were drugs that could successfully control HIV replication and allow the body’s immune system to recover its vigour. For patients diagnosed with HIV before that time, the best we could hope to do was to treat its complications when they arose, a strategy that had until then merely delayed the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karri started HIV meds, and over the next 11 years she did well. Her HIV load (58,000/ml) became undetectable, and her immunity improved as her CD4 (helper T lymphocyte count) rose from 29 to a reasonably respectable 200-300 level. Then, just over 2 years ago, Karri’s husband came across a film on the Internet produced by the husband of the AIDS denialists Christine Maggiore. “&lt;a href="http://www.theothersideofaids.com/"&gt;The other Side of AIDS&lt;/a&gt;” is a film that promotes the view that HIV does not cause AIDS. Courtesy of the University of Google, Karri feverishly set about learning all she could about the alternative views of AIDS. Suckered into the idea that her only problem was the “toxic” drugs she was taking, she quit her meds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She became ill, reasoning that this was only because &lt;i&gt;“those toxic drugs are bound to be very hard to the body after 11 straight years”&lt;/i&gt;.  Not unexpectedly, her CD4 count had dropped to 96, and her virus levels rose to 135,000/ml. But Karri seems happy, and without the drugs she claims to feel well, and is determined to continue without them. Not content with getting on with what life she may have left, she has become evangelical in her efforts to promote her newfound beliefs about AIDS and persuade others to think HIV is harmless, appearing on radio shows and publicising her views through &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/rethinkaids"&gt;Myspace&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook. She explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have business-type cards printed up that say HIV does not equal AIDS, an upside down ribbon, and a few of the websites that continue to help me every day. I leave these cards everywhere I go. Every public restroom, every restaurant, on the table, in multiple places in the library, anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How has this affected me? Shock, sadness, despair, fear, suspicious, robbed, angry, outraged, collective, reflective, triumphant! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an overcomer!&lt;br&gt;
I will tell my story.&lt;br&gt;
I will not go quietly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karri is currently planning to give a presentation at &lt;a href="http://ra2009.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=49&amp;amp;Itemid=54"&gt;the “Rethinking AIDS” meeting&lt;/a&gt;, a repository of AIDS denialism masquerading as a scientific conference. Karri’s talk is entitled “How I fell victim to the AIDS machine”. I doubt if Karri’s talk will focus on the revelation that her inspiration, Christine Maggiore, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/hivaids_denialist_christine_maggiore_die.php"&gt;herself died of AIDS in December 2008&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine was, like Karri, diagnosed out of the blue, a wholly unexpected finding in someone who didn’t fit the usual mould of an AIDS patient. Christine was seduced by the idea that HIV didn’t have anything to do with AIDS back in the 1980s, when perhaps she can be forgiven for having some doubts (and a few scientists at that time expressed similar uncertainties). But although &lt;a href="http://www.avert.org/evidence.htm"&gt;science has subsequently demonstrated HIV is unquestionably the cause of AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, and overwhelming evidence has accumulated to confirm this, Christine became ensnared in her own world of AIDS denialism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictures of &lt;a href="http://breakfornews.com/bfn4/ChristineMemorial.jpg"&gt;Christine’s family&lt;/a&gt; look distressingly similar to those of Karri; a vibrant young woman with a loving family around her and everything to live for. But Christine chose not to take HIV drugs in her pregnancy, resulting in her second child, Elisa-Jane, becoming infected with HIV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragically, Elisa-Jane died of AIDS before she reached the age of four, having not only been denied the drugs that would have stopped her being infected in the first place (whilst in utero), but also the drugs needed to save her life once she was infected. Her death merely seemed to intensify Christine’s obsessive AIDS denialism rather than to make her re-evaluate her beliefs about AIDS. Her cognitive dissonance about the subject became so all-consuming that when she started to become seriously unwell with AIDS, she failed to seek appropriate medical attention, eventually dying in December last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many others, I had hoped that Christine’s death would nail the lie about HIV not causing AIDS. But it has not done so. Unfortunately there are too many charlatans who have invested too much in the AIDS denial industry to back down now. They must know the harm they do, as more people like Karri fall under their spell and risk dying as a result, but they promote their lies regardless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tales like Christine’s and Karri’s represent a tiny drop in the ocean of similar tragedies. AIDS denialism does not just kill people in the West, but wherever HIV is a problem. In South Africa, the deliberate denial of life-saving antiretroviral drugs to pregnant women and those with AIDS is estimated to have caused &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18931626"&gt;the premature deaths of 330,000 people&lt;/a&gt;. The promotion of “vitamins” as AIDS treatments by &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/15/matthiasrath.aids"&gt;unscrupulous charlatans like Matthias Rath&lt;/a&gt; has cost untold others their lives. Each of these victims will have their own tragic stories of family destruction and the legacy of lingering infection and death among loved their ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only hope that Karri comes to her sense before it’s too late, and that she doesn’t follow in Christine’s footsteps. This disease has already claimed too many lives, and every unnecessary death is a tragedy.  She is not a &lt;i&gt;“victim of the AIDS machine”&lt;/i&gt;, but a victim of AIDS denialism. &lt;/p&gt;

That&amp;#39;s a ghastly tragedy, and we&amp;#39;d normally feel for the parents who suffered that loss. My sympathies are all for their daughter, however, since her parents watched her die…and treated her with homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

He is alert and fully aware of his condition, and he knows his death is imminent. He also knows that when he is dead, the contemptible ghouls of spiritualism and faith and desperate dogma will descend on his corpse to try and steal some of his dignity and integrity for their superstitions, and he has responded accordingly by &lt;a href="http://nirmukta.com/2009/09/22/premanand-in-abhirami-hospital-coimbatore/"&gt;composing a deathbed testimonial&lt;/a&gt;.


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;I, B. Premanand s/o late Sri Basava Prabhu, 80 years of age resident Chettipalayam Road, Podanur,  sound of mind though suffering from physical complications caused by metastases in many organs caused by carcinoma of the stomach herein solemnly wish to place on record the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align:justify"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have been closely associated with the rationalist movement from 1975 onwards and have been a rationalist of full conviction since then and continue to be so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is common for the purveyors of superstitions and such anti rational forces to start spreading rumors about rationalists turning to god and other supernatural forces at the end of their lives and becoming devotees of gods and god men of various types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also claimed that at times of crises that we staunch rationalists through the major part of our lives, turn to spiritualism and religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish to clarify that as on today the twentieth of September,2009 I remain a staunch rationalist and wish to place on record the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align:justify"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. I continue to be a rationalist of full conviction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. I do not believe in any supernatural power. All the powers that we encounter are in the realm of nature and nothing exists beyond that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c. I do not believe in the existence of the soul or rebirth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;d. I have not turned to any religion, god or any sort of spiritual pursuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e. When I pass away I shall be leaving only my body which is to be donated to a medical college and no spirit or soul to cause problems for the living.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;I want to convey to all that the struggle against the exploitation by god men and so called supernatural forces is a long and hard one but the ultimate victory will be ours.&lt;br&gt;
My very survival has been a challenge to astrologers and their so called “science” of astrology, as they had all predicted that I would die soon after birth and refused to cast a horoscope for me.&lt;br&gt;
I wish to convey to my colleagues of the rationalist movement to continue the work that I have been doing with renewed vigor and that will be the best of tributes for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhirami Hospital&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Podanur                                                                                (B. Premanand)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;Witnessed by:  Dr. Maya Prabhu and Suneera&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1995 a gold hoard was found at Vittene in Norra Björke parish, Västergötland. Its contents had been amassed over two centuries, and it was committed to the earth in the 3rd century AD. A fine book on the find and subsequent settlement excavations has recently been published and is &lt;a href="http://gupea.ub.gu.se/dspace/bitstream/2077/19136/1/gupea_2077_19136_1.pdf"&gt;available in full on-line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a picture of the Vittene hoard. Above is a picture of a replica of the hoard made of marzipan and gold leaf by Sören Elmqvist for the 1995 Christmas market at the county museum.&lt;/p&gt;

There are some bits that work better than others, so I'll probably be tweaking it a bit this week, especially the side bars that I think look a bit harder to read now.

It was started by Arianna Huffington during the Bush Era as a response to all the far-right online media. I didn’t agree with a lot of what was on there — I am more centrist — but at the time I thought it was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they started to promote far-left New Age nonsense, and when it came to vaccinations, HuffPo started posting all kinds of opinions that amounted to nothing more than out-and-out health threats. While they do sometimes post a counter-argument, it’s still almost all alt-med, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the latest: &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-frank-lipman/swine-flu-what-to-do_b_286245.html"&gt;a doctor named Frank Lipman is telling people not to get vaccinated against Swine Flu&lt;/a&gt;. Instead he says you should wash your hands a lot, eat well, and take homeopathic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, seriously. And he does it while spouting quite a few of the standard antivax memes, like the flu won’t be that bad (maybe he should consult with Dr. Joe Albietz, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Jalbietz/statuses/4367477539"&gt;who I’m sure would disagree&lt;/a&gt;) and my favorite, we don’t know how well the vaccine will work. In fact, the vaccine for Swine Flu is based on many decades of research on how vaccines are produced, and will certainly work better than Dr. Lipman’s homeopathic &amp;quot;medicine&amp;quot; which we know is just plain old water, and totally useless. I’ll note that on his own site he promotes acupuncture and chiropractic, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the peddling of antivax rhetoric like this that drove me from HuffPo, and I’ve let them know why. I was a minor cog there, so I know it made no difference… and the proof is that they still post articles promoting procedures known to be useless. In fact, it’s worse than that, &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/spray-for-tga-over-homeopaths-20090924-g4pt.html"&gt;since someone might try the homeopathic water rather than get actual treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as always, don’t listen to people like Lipman, or even to me when it comes to this stuff. Instead, go to your doctor, a board-certified and science-based doctor, and ask them about the H1N1 swine flu, and see if they recommend getting the shot. And yes, as soon as it’s available here I’ll get vaccinated, as will my wife and daughter. We talked to a real doctor about it, and we understand the threat of H1N1, and we understand what vaccines do. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm opening the site up to guest bloggers, who can follow in &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/642"&gt;the steps of DeeTee&lt;/a&gt; and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places are limited for now, so I'll judge the people who get in touch by some criteria - existing writing, how they come across, what they want to write about, that sort of thing. People can cross-post stuff from their own blogs if they like, to help use this site to promote their own writing. They can post as regularly or irregularly as they like, on whatever science or junk science subjects they like, as long as it's interesting, decent quality, and isn't going to get me in lots of trouble!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you're interested, e-mail me: &lt;a href="mailto:layscience@googlemail.com"&gt;layscience@googlemail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A jury deemed them to be sentenced to a minimum of 6 years for the father (Thomas Sam) and 4 years for the mother (Manju Sam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story came to the attention of the public earlier this year, when we heard about the tragic death of Gloria Sam aged 9 months, from complications as a result of an allergic skin condition, eczema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gloria died as a result of a lack of conventional treatment for eczema, a skin disorder that makes the skin dry and itchy and when scratched, weep and bleed. The common treatment is hydrocortisone cream for mild cases but in severe cases, oral steroids in a tablet form are prescribed. As a result of the associated wheeping with severe cases of eczema, dehydration is often a problem, with patients losing large amounts of fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I myself suffer from eczema and have had to take oral steroids on occasion. Eczema has a genetic link and accordingly, my mum suffered attacks so debilitating that she was airlifted from Papua New Guinea in the late 60s to Australia and spent extensive time in hospital, coated in hydrocortisone creme and wrapped in plastic to restore her fluids. She came very close to dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Mum was advised to soak in baths of salt water, and these days pine tar is also touted, but in my experience none of these work. I have been tested for allergies to strawberries, wheat, the usual suspects, but it appears my IgE response is to blame. I even visited a naturopath, who told me to stop eating dairy. Guess what? No change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the hearing for this case there was evidence presented from observers on a Qantas flight on which Gloria was a passenger, describing her cries for lengthy periods, indicative of a serious problem. One passenger described her covered in red blotches and appearing as if she were burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I have not had a flare of eczema of late but I know when I do, I have conventional medicine to relieve my pain, at least temporarily. However, when I am out of Diprosone (the commonly prescribed cortisone cream) I am in much pain. The worst thing is scratching in your sleep and waking up with bloodied bedding not knowing what you did. This is why my Mum often slept with gloves to avoid tearing her already tender skin away. Years of steroid application also increase the likelihood that your skin becomes thinner and more prone to breakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the beast that a hypersensitivity disorder is, I need to manage it with lots of sleep, not too much stress and avoiding late nights. These things are not always easy to correct. But as an adult, I make the decision about when and where I receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Gloria did not have that option.&lt;/p&gt;

It came up as part of the ‘climate services’ discussion and was alluded to in the &lt;a href="http://thingsbreak.wordpress.com/2009/09/11/of-moles-and-whacking-mojib-latif-predicted-two-decades-of-cooling/"&gt;rather confused New Scientist piece&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago. This is a relatively “hot” topic to be working on, exemplified by two initial high profile papers (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/5839/796"&gt;Smith et al, 2007&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7191/abs/nature06921.html"&gt;Keenlyside et al, 2008&lt;/a&gt;). Indeed, the specifications for the new simulations being set up for next IPCC report include a whole section for decadal simulations that many of the modelling groups will be responding to.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/decadal.jpg" width="90%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This figure from a recent BAMS article (&lt;a href="http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;amp;doi=10.1175%2F2009BAMS2607.1"&gt;Hawkins and Sutton, 2009&lt;/a&gt;) shows an estimate of the current sources of prediction error at the global and local scale. For short periods of time (especially at local scales), the dominant source of forecast uncertainty is the ‘internal variability’ (i.e. the exact course of the specific trajectory the weather is on). As time goes by, the different weather paths get averaged out and so this source of uncertainty diminishes. However, uncertainty associated with uncertain or inaccurate models grows with time, as does the uncertainty associated with the scenario you are using – ie. how fast CO2 or other forcings are going to change. &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/ipcc_co2_2010.jpg"&gt;Predictions of CO2&lt;/a&gt; next year for instance, are much easier than predictions in 50 years time because of the potential for economic, technological and sociological changes. The combination of sources of uncertainty map out how much better we can expect predictions to get: can we reduce error associated with internal variability by initializing models with current observations? how much does uncertainty go down as models improve? etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the graph it is easy to see that over the short term (up to a decade or so), reducing initialization errors might be useful (the dotted lines). The basic idea is that a portion of the climate variability on interannual to decadal time scales can be associated with relatively slow ocean changes – for instance in the North Atlantic. If these ocean circulations can be predicted based on the state of the ocean now, that may therefore allow for skillful predictions of temperature or rainfall that are correlated to those ocean changes. But while this sounds plausible, almost every step in this chain is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that this works on short (seasonal) time scales in (at least some parts of the world) because of the somewhat skillful prediction of El Niño/La Niña events and relative stability of teleconnections to these large perturbations (the fact that rainfall in California is usually high in El Niño years for instance). But our ability to predict El Niño loses skill very rapidly past six months or so and so we can’t rely on that for longer term predictions. However, there is also some skill in seasonal predictions in parts of the world where El Niño is not that important – for instance in Europe – that is likely based on the persistence of North Atlantic ocean temperature anomalies. One curious consequence is that the places that have skillful and useful seasonal-to-interannual predictions based on ENSO forecasts are likely to  be the places where skillful decadal forecasts do worst (because those are precisely the areas where the unpredictable ENSO variability will be the dominant signal). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth pointing out that ’skill’ is defined relative to climatology (i.e. do you do a better job at estimating temperature or rainfall anomalies than if you’d just assumed that the season would be just like the average of the last ten years for instance). Some skill doesn’t necessarily mean that the predictions are great – it simply means that they are slightly better than you could do before. We should also distinguish between skillful (in a statistical sense) and useful in a practical sense. An increase of a few percent in variance explained would show up as improved skill, but that is unlikely to be of good enough practical value to shift any policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So given that we know roughly what we are looking for, what is needed for this to work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we need to know whether we have enough data to get a reasonable picture of the ocean state right now. This is actually quite hard since you’d like to have subsurface temperature and salinity data from a large part of the oceans. That gives you the large scale density field which is the dominant control on the ocean dynamics. Right now this is just about possible with the new Argo float array, but before about 2003, subsurface data in particular was much sparser outside a few well travelled corridors. Note that temperature data are not sufficient on their own for calculating changes in the ocean dynamics since they are often inversely correlated with salinity variations (when it is hot, it is often salty for instance) which reduces the impact on the density. Conceivably if any skill in the prediction is simply related to surface temperature anomalies being advected around by the mean circulation, it could be possible be useful to do temperature only initializations, but one would have to be very wary of dynamical changes and that would limit the usefulness of the approach to a couple of years perhaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, given any particular distribution of initialization data, how should this be assimilated into the forecasting model? This is a real theoretical problem given that models all have systematic deviations from the real world. If you simply force a model temperature and salinity to look exactly like the observations, then you risk having any forecast dominated by model drift when you remove the assimilation. Think of a elastic band being pulled to the side by the ‘observations’, but having it snap back to it’s default state when you stop pulling. (A likely example of this is the ‘coupling shock’ phenomena possibly seen in the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/the-global-cooling-bet-part-2/"&gt;Keenlyside et al simulations&lt;/a&gt;). A better way to do this is via anomaly forcing – that is you only impose the differences from the climatology on the model. That is guaranteed to have less model drift, but at the expense of having the forecast potentially affected by systematic errors in, say, the position of the Gulf Stream. In both methods of course, the better the model, the less bad the problems. There is a good discussion of the Hadley Centre methods in &lt;a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1890/925.full"&gt;Haines et al (2008)&lt;/a&gt; (no sub reqd.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that you can come up with a reasonable methodology for the initialization, the next step is to understand the actual predictability of the system. For instance, given the inevitable uncertainties due to sparse coverage or short term variability, how fast do slightly differently initialized simulations diverge? (Note that we aren’t talking about the exact path of the simulation which will diverge as fast as weather forecasts – a couple of weeks, but the larger scale statistics of ocean anomalies).  This appears to be a few years to a decade in “perfect model” tests (where you try and predict how a particular model will behave using the same model but with an initialization that mimics what you’d have to do in the real world). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, given that you can show that the model with its initialization scheme and available data has some predictability, you have to show that it gives a useful increase in the explained variance in any quantities that someone might care about. For instance, perfect predictability of the maximum overturning streamfunction might be scientifically interesting, but since it is not an observable quantity, it is mainly of academic interest. Much more useful is how any surface air temperature or rainfall predictions will be affected. This kind of analysis is only just starting to be done (since you needed all the other steps to work first).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From talking to a number of people working in this field, my sense is that this is pretty much where the state of the science is. There are theoretical reasons to expect this to be useful, but as yet no good sense for actually how practically useful it will be (though I’d welcome any other opinions on this in the comments). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that is of concern are statements that appear to assume that this is already a done deal – that good quality decadal forecasts are somehow guaranteed (if only a new center can be built, or if a faster computer was used). &lt;a href="http://wcrp.ipsl.jussieu.fr/Workshops/ModellingSummit/Background.html"&gt;For instance:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… to meet the expectations of society, it is both necessary and possible to revolutionize climate prediction. … It is possible firstly because of major advances in scientific understanding, secondly because of the development of seamless prediction systems which unify weather and climate prediction, thus bringing the insights and constraints of weather prediction into the climate change arena, and thirdly because of the ever-expanding power of computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just because something is necessary (according to the expectations of society) does not automatically mean that it is possible! Indeed, there is a real danger for society’s expectations to get completely out of line with what eventually will prove possible, and it’s important that policies don’t get put in place that are not robust to the real uncertainty in such predictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that climate predictions can’t get better? Not at all. The component of the forecast uncertainty associated with the models themselves can certainly be reduced (the blue line above) – through more judicious weighting of the various models (perhaps using paleo-climate data from the LGM and mid-Holocene which will also be part of the new IPCC archive), improvements in parameterisations and greater realism in forcings and physical interactions (for instance between clouds and aerosols).  In fact, one might hazard a guess that these efforts will prove more effective in reducing uncertainty in the coming round of model simulations than the still-experimental attempts in decadal forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254142947766"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9559">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe53d53d0edfbe09</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 2.28</title><published>2009-09-28T13:00:20Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T13:00:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/skepchick-quickies-2-28/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

See &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/blog/57"&gt;more by DeeTee here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewPicture&amp;amp;friendID=202822110&amp;amp;albumId=1738759&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;Myspace picture albums&lt;/a&gt; seem to capture a wonderful moment in time. The scene is idyllic. Sun-kissed palm trees are set against an azure Caribbean sky, and a happy couple delight in their holiday trip to the Florida Keys. Elsewhere, we can see photos of them with &lt;a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&amp;amp;friendID=202822110&amp;amp;albumID=1820098&amp;amp;imageID=29307205"&gt;their children&lt;/a&gt;, a wholesome, all-American family enjoying everything life has to offer and dreaming of good times yet to come. But despite the glowing vitality that is projected in the photos, things are not what they seem. The woman you see is Karri Stokely, a 43 year old who was diagnosed with HIV infection when she was 29 years old. She is keen to &lt;a href="http://www.livingwithouthivdrugs.com/karri.htm"&gt;share her story&lt;/a&gt;, and does so on several other websites and blogs. It should be a story of courage and hope, but I fear it will not turn out that way. For Karri has decided to completely ignore medical advice and forgo her HIV medication.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Despite the severity of her initial diagnosis, Karri’s chances for a fairly long and healthy life might have been excellent. Her HIV was diagnosed in 1996, luckily just when &lt;a href="http://www.avert.org/treatment.htm"&gt;new combinations of HIV drugs were emerging&lt;/a&gt; and having a major impact on the progress of the disease. I know from my own patients that this was a time of near-miraculous recovery for many of them, since for the first time there were drugs that could successfully control HIV replication and allow the body’s immune system to recover its vigour. For patients diagnosed with HIV before that time, the best we could hope to do was to treat its complications when they arose, a strategy that had until then merely delayed the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karri started HIV meds, and over the next 11 years she did well. Her HIV load (58,000/ml) became undetectable, and her immunity improved as her CD4 (helper T lymphocyte count) rose from 29 to a reasonably respectable 200-300 level. Then, just over 2 years ago, Karri’s husband came across a film on the Internet produced by the husband of the AIDS denialists Christine Maggiore. “&lt;a href="http://www.theothersideofaids.com/"&gt;The other Side of AIDS&lt;/a&gt;” is a film that promotes the view that HIV does not cause AIDS. Courtesy of the University of Google, Karri feverishly set about learning all she could about the alternative views of AIDS. Suckered into the idea that her only problem was the “toxic” drugs she was taking, she quit her meds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She became ill, reasoning that this was only because &lt;i&gt;“those toxic drugs are bound to be very hard to the body after 11 straight years”&lt;/i&gt;.  Not unexpectedly, her CD4 count had dropped to 96, and her virus levels rose to 135,000/ml. But Karri seems happy, and without the drugs she claims to feel well, and is determined to continue without them. Not content with getting on with what life she may have left, she has become evangelical in her efforts to promote her newfound beliefs about AIDS and persuade others to think HIV is harmless, appearing on radio shows and publicising her views through &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/rethinkaids"&gt;Myspace&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook. She explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have business-type cards printed up that say HIV does not equal AIDS, an upside down ribbon, and a few of the websites that continue to help me every day. I leave these cards everywhere I go. Every public restroom, every restaurant, on the table, in multiple places in the library, anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How has this affected me? Shock, sadness, despair, fear, suspicious, robbed, angry, outraged, collective, reflective, triumphant! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an overcomer!&lt;br&gt;
I will tell my story.&lt;br&gt;
I will not go quietly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karri is currently planning to give a presentation at &lt;a href="http://ra2009.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=49&amp;amp;Itemid=54"&gt;the “Rethinking AIDS” meeting&lt;/a&gt;, a repository of AIDS denialism masquerading as a scientific conference. Karri’s talk is entitled “How I fell victim to the AIDS machine”. I doubt if Karri’s talk will focus on the revelation that her inspiration, Christine Maggiore, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/hivaids_denialist_christine_maggiore_die.php"&gt;herself died of AIDS in December 2008&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine was, like Karri, diagnosed out of the blue, a wholly unexpected finding in someone who didn’t fit the usual mould of an AIDS patient. Christine was seduced by the idea that HIV didn’t have anything to do with AIDS back in the 1980s, when perhaps she can be forgiven for having some doubts (and a few scientists at that time expressed similar uncertainties). But although &lt;a href="http://www.avert.org/evidence.htm"&gt;science has subsequently demonstrated HIV is unquestionably the cause of AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, and overwhelming evidence has accumulated to confirm this, Christine became ensnared in her own world of AIDS denialism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictures of &lt;a href="http://breakfornews.com/bfn4/ChristineMemorial.jpg"&gt;Christine’s family&lt;/a&gt; look distressingly similar to those of Karri; a vibrant young woman with a loving family around her and everything to live for. But Christine chose not to take HIV drugs in her pregnancy, resulting in her second child, Elisa-Jane, becoming infected with HIV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragically, Elisa-Jane died of AIDS before she reached the age of four, having not only been denied the drugs that would have stopped her being infected in the first place (whilst in utero), but also the drugs needed to save her life once she was infected. Her death merely seemed to intensify Christine’s obsessive AIDS denialism rather than to make her re-evaluate her beliefs about AIDS. Her cognitive dissonance about the subject became so all-consuming that when she started to become seriously unwell with AIDS, she failed to seek appropriate medical attention, eventually dying in December last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many others, I had hoped that Christine’s death would nail the lie about HIV not causing AIDS. But it has not done so. Unfortunately there are too many charlatans who have invested too much in the AIDS denial industry to back down now. They must know the harm they do, as more people like Karri fall under their spell and risk dying as a result, but they promote their lies regardless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tales like Christine’s and Karri’s represent a tiny drop in the ocean of similar tragedies. AIDS denialism does not just kill people in the West, but wherever HIV is a problem. In South Africa, the deliberate denial of life-saving antiretroviral drugs to pregnant women and those with AIDS is estimated to have caused &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18931626"&gt;the premature deaths of 330,000 people&lt;/a&gt;. The promotion of “vitamins” as AIDS treatments by &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/15/matthiasrath.aids"&gt;unscrupulous charlatans like Matthias Rath&lt;/a&gt; has cost untold others their lives. Each of these victims will have their own tragic stories of family destruction and the legacy of lingering infection and death among loved their ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only hope that Karri comes to her sense before it’s too late, and that she doesn’t follow in Christine’s footsteps. This disease has already claimed too many lives, and every unnecessary death is a tragedy.  She is not a &lt;i&gt;“victim of the AIDS machine”&lt;/i&gt;, but a victim of AIDS denialism. &lt;/p&gt;

I is happy Australian!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today on Twitter, he raised a concern about a quote which was being &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing"&gt;used on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; to supposedly authenticate remote viewing. Was it perhaps a misquote? So, I decided to zip over an email to see what was going on - and kindly, Dr Wiseman responded!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;Dear Dr Wiseman,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;After perusing the following &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-510762/Could-proof-theory-ALL-psychic.html"&gt;article in the Daily Mail,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-510762/Could-proof-theory-ALL-psychic.html"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-510762/Could-proof-theory-ALL-psychic.html"&gt;“Could there be proof to the theory that we’re ALL psychic?”&lt;/a&gt;, and recalling your discussions about Ganzfeld experiments that I listened to when I was a student of &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/01/i-has-parapsychology-certificate/"&gt;Dr Watt’s Introduction to Parapsychology course&lt;/a&gt; (which I did online via University of Edinburgh), I was wondering if you might have any further comments about the following proposed experiments by Dr Chris Roe? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;In particular, I recall your summation of several Ganzfeld experiments and the need for stringent criteria when conducting such an experiment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…Back at the University of Northampton, Dr Chris Roe hopes he can provide such proof one way or the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next month, he will embark on a series of experiments that will be more rigorous than any so far attempted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They will rule out fluke positive results and any unconscious biases held by anyone involved with the experiments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;&lt;em&gt;And if that wasn’t enough, he then plans to embark on research into an even more outlandish field: whether it is possible to remote view &lt;em&gt;through time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In other words, he will investigate whether it is possible for remote viewers not only to observe distant locations, but also to see what will happen at that place at a predetermined time in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Time does not seem to be a barrier to remote viewing,” says Dr Roe, matter of factly.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003300"&gt;I noticed that you were already interviewed in the article (”&lt;em&gt;Professor Richard Wiseman, a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire, refuses to believe in remote viewing&lt;/em&gt;.”) but I was wondering what was meant by “&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I agree that by the standards of any other area of science that remote viewing is proven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“. Is it a misquote?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It is a slight misquote, because I was using the term in the more general sense of ESP - that is, I was not talking about remote viewing per se, but rather Ganzfeld, etc as well.  I think that they do meet the usual standards for a normal claim, but are not convincing enough for an extraordinary claim.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much to Dr Wiseman and thanks very much to Reed for prompting me to find out more! Oh, don’t forget to check out this interview with Dr Wiseman, thanks to the &lt;a title="Richard Wiseman &amp;#39;Pulse Project&amp;#39; interview." rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU-SCdLRTUM"&gt;‘Pulse Project’,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After we went off the air, meanwhile, something fascinating happened–while the hosts didn’t fully agree with us, they had a really thoughtful (if a bit sad) closing dialogue about the divided nature of the humanist/secular movement around goals and tactics. Really striking to listen to. Again, it’s available &lt;a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/hnn/podcast/#HNNplayer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

No band opted out of the festival; only sponsors did.  The posting now reflects that.  Sorry for any confusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.charlottepopfest.com/"&gt;Charlotte Pop Fest ‘09&lt;/a&gt; took place this weekend — it’s a music festival that featured the likes of The Smithereens, Jill Sobule, and several bands/singers I’ve never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m interested because all the proceeds from the event went to a great cause:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This year Charlotte Pop Fest will celebrate the life of Charles Darwin and all proceeds from the event will benefit the &lt;em&gt;Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason &amp;amp; Science&lt;/em&gt;. The year 2009 is the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his book &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizer, &lt;strong&gt;James Deem&lt;/strong&gt;, said he just wanted to &lt;a href="http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp?S=11205230"&gt;raise awareness for science education&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“It’s just really important,” Deem said.  “There’s not that many people raising money for science.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, of course, some people are offended by the prospect of science education and the idea that their personal sacred cows are challenged at RDFRS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Deem says he’s lost a sponsor because of the event’s support of the Richard Dawkins Foundation and the money he lost forced him to cancel appearances by a couple of the bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thorne stressed that the bands are there to play music, not give out a message about atheism or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop Festival attendee Debbie Aintrazi of Mint Hill hopes they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they start going around saying, ‘no, you shouldn’t believe in this, you shouldn’t believe in that’ — that’s when I [get upset],” she said.  “I don’t believe in not believing.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, no one at the festival is telling people to stop having faith.  And even the &lt;a href="http://richarddawkinsfoundation.org/foundation,ourMission"&gt;Dawkins Foundation wasn’t formed&lt;/a&gt; to convert people.  Even if Dawkins would like to do that, that’s not the purpose of the Foundation.  The Foundation wants &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; atheists to go public about it, and they want people to think for themselves instead of blindly accepting whatever some person in a church tells them to believe.  The Foundation preaches education, not atheism.  But if the former leads to the latter, so be it.  That’s just a pleasant byproduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.charlottepopfest.com/"&gt;This is the press release&lt;/a&gt; issued by Deem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is with great regret that I have to announce that Roger Joseph Manning Jr. and Linus of Hollywood will not be performing at Charlotte Pop Fest this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago a sponsor, that had originally committed to supporting the event financially, abruptly decided they didn’t want to be associated with the Richard Dawkins Foundation…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sponsors refused to give money because part of it was going toward science education and it’s namesake is a man who challenges people to question their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very disappointing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In response to my post "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1771"&gt;'At the end of the day' not management-speak&lt;/a&gt;", Peter Taylor &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1771#comment-44624"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I argue that the first question to ask is whether hearing someone use the phrase &amp;quot;At the end of the day&amp;quot; conveys information on whether they are likely to be a manager…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a definitive determination of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain#KL_divergence_and_Bayesian_updating"&gt;information gain&lt;/a&gt; involved, aside from its limited general interest, would require more resources than I can bring to bear over my morning coffee. But we can make a plausible guess, and the answer turns out to be that the "information gain" is probably pretty small, and is just about as likely to point away from the conclusion that the speaker or writer is a manager as towards it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The information gain associated with an observation y is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/InformationGain.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current case, this cashes out as the probability that someone is a manager given that we&amp;#39;ve added to our background knowledge the fact that they said or wrote &amp;quot;at the end of the day&amp;quot;  — call it p(manager | ATEOTD,I) — multiplied by the base2-log of the ratio between this same term p(manager | ATEOTD,I) and P(manager | I), which is the probability that they&amp;#39;re a manager given only our background knowledge I. We should sum this quantity over the alternatives in the distribution under consideration, here x=manager and x=not-manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the distribution of this phrase in Mark Davies' &lt;a href="http://www.americancorpus.org/"&gt;COCA corpus&lt;/a&gt;, p(manager | ATEOTD,I) seems to be about one in a hundred, 0.01. (In other words, out of a hundred speakers or writers of the phrase "at the end of the day" in its figurative meaning, one is a manager, on average. See below for details.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the probability that someone is a manager given only the background distribution, symbolized p(manager,I)? We  don't want to use Census Bureau statistics, since being the source of speech or text in the COCA sample is already going to be highly skewed relative to the occupational distribution of the general American population, regardless of what phrases are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before even trying to estimate this quantity, we can look at what the information gain would turn out to be, for a variety of values for this background proportion of managers. If one in a hundred sources of speech or text in COCA is a "manager", then the information gain is 0.01*log(0.01/0.01) + 0.99*log(0.99/0.99) = 0 bits. If it's one in a thousand, the information gain is 0.01*log(0.01/0.001) + 0.99*log(0.99/0.999) = 0.02 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;d be very surprised if the proportion of &amp;quot;managers&amp;quot; in the COCA sample was even as low as one in a thousand — and it might very well be more than one in a hundred, not less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we search COCA for the phrase "in the final analysis", for example, the first 100 hits include four clear examples of a managerial source, and two other marginal ones. If the actual value of p(manager) is actually .04, then the information gain associated with saying or writing "at the end of the day" will be 0.01*log2(0.01/0.04) + 0.99*log2(0.99/0.96) = 0.024 bits, but tending towards the conclusion that x=not-manager.  Thus if this estimate of p(manager | I) is accurate, use of "at the end of the day" is a small piece of evidence &lt;strong&gt;against&lt;/strong&gt; the hypothesis that the speaker or writer is a "manager".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don&amp;#39;t see a good  way to get a representative random sample of COCA sources, which we would need in order to estimate p(manager | I) properly. But I invite readers to try to sharpen up these estimates, if they&amp;#39;re interested — I&amp;#39;ve satisfied myself that saying or writing &amp;quot;at the end of the day&amp;quot; provides no useful evidence that someone is a &amp;quot;manager&amp;quot;, and may in fact count as a small piece of evidence in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those social scientists still reading this (if any), let me point out that setting up to do this sort of analysis in a more systematic way would provide an interesting laboratory for investigating the quantitative relationship between stereotypes and reality.  The comments on earlier posts in this series make it clear that many Americans are absolutely convinced that "at the end of the day" is manager-speak.  My guess remains that most &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004244.html"&gt;linguistic peeves associated with despised groups&lt;/a&gt; will turn out to be similarly unsupported by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mark Davies' &lt;a href="http://www.americancorpus.org/"&gt;COCA corpus&lt;/a&gt;, there are 2,438 examples of "at the end of the day' in 400 million words, for an overall frequency of 6.1 per million words. The frequency is greater in "spoken" material (basically news interviews) than in other genres:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking the first (most recent) 200 COCA hits for this phrase, I determined that 51 of them were literal references to the end of daylight, or the end of a working day, or the end of a 24-hour period. That left 149 figurative uses, meaning something like "in the final analysis". Of these, just one was spoken or written by someone I would call a "manager", namely the spokesperson for a manufacturer of sex toys (Jessica Rae Patton, "Make Love, Not Waste: Bringing Environmentalism into the Bedroom", &lt;em&gt;E: the Environmental Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, Sep/Oct 2008):&lt;/p&gt;

Dildos that are glass or wood… will eventually go back to the earth, and if used as they&amp;#39;re meant to be used, will last a very long time. &amp;quot; The store no longer carries products containing phthalates. &amp;quot; We offer a huge selection of rechargeable vibrators, &amp;quot; she says, but acknowledges, &amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;At&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, it is still a manufactured product that will eventually end up in the dump. That's the grim reality. " Day notes that the adult product industry hasn't yet figured out how to address this waste. " It's only a matter of time before that person comes forward who figures out how to recycle sex toys. Trust me, every company in the adult industry will use that service! " she says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other source that was close to being a "manager" was a fashion designer ("Hottest, Newest, Latest", Harpers Bazaar, June 2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;His strong, architectural silhouettes come together to compose a collection of 21 looks, including everything from a modernized interpretation of a tuxedo to a feminine white blouse made of frothy embellished flowers (at right) to exquisite column evening gowns. All in a primary palette of red, white, and black (with some touches of fur detailing), the pieces will be sold at such stores as Bloomingdale's in New York and DNA in Saudi Arabia. " &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;At&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, I didn't know what the reaction would be, but I'm a firm believer that if you do something with pure integrity, you'll find an audience, " Gurung says. Well, this audience is still applauding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So depending on how you count, we get an estimate of 1 or 2 in 149, or about 0.0067 to 0.013 — let&amp;#39;s call it one in a hundred, 0.01.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other sources for ATEOTD in this sample are pretty diverse — a TV journalist, a rescue hero, a basketball player, a rapper, a country singer, a primatologist, and so on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Let me press down on that. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;At&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, are you really talking about over the course of your presidency, some kind of a grand bargain? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Mr-COLLIER: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;At&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it worked for us and we did what we had to do. Mr-ELLIS: Having got those people off were, particularly in this case, nobody else could have gotten them out. Mr-COLLIER: It' s very satisfying. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Yeah, I mean, Shaq, you know, Kobe does really recognize that Shaq helped him to get three titles and Shaq got another title on his own without Kobe, but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, both of them realized that they missed out on opportunities to do something special and - you know, when you' re a little bit younger, you' re a little bit immature and then when you get old and wiser, you reflect on things that would' ve - could have happened. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The rest of Relapse is even more grim. Many of Eminem's new songs depict his drug years in terms that seem to alternate between raw honesty and wild hyperbole. And though rumors have spread that his estranged and reportedly ailing mother, Debbie Nelson, is eager for a reconciliation, a song titled " My Mom " takes aim at her as viciously as ever. (" Don't get me wrong, " he said during last week's Sirius XM interview. " &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;At&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, she is my mother and I do love her. ") &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;When all this role-playing is over, the wife of country legend Tim McGraw and mother of three girls (Gracie, 12, Maggie, 10, and Audrey, 7) has no problem snapping back to reality. She washes her face, pulls her hair into a ponytail, and slips back into those sweats. Has she discovered anything from stepping into such glamorous shoes? " &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;At&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, for me beauty has a lot to do with comfort and being around my family. And, " she says with a laugh, " most likely no makeup! " Then, with a big hug and a cheery " Thank you! " to everyone on set, she's off to meet Tim at the girls' school for a basketball game. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;" It's hard to say what exactly precipitated this behavior, " said Colleen McCann, a primatologist at the Bronx Zoo. " &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;At&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, they are not human and you can't always predict their behavior and how they or any other wild animal will respond when they feel threatened. " &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for "in the final analysis", the four manager-sources in the first 100 hits were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;("Constellation calls off deal with Buffett unit", Business News, Dec. 2008) " &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, we concluded that the EdF investment represents significant enhanced value for our shareholders and serves the best interest as well of our customers, our employees, our regulators and the communities we serve, " Mayo A. Shattuck III, chairman, president and chief executive of Constellation Energy, told analysts on a conference call. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;("Are you paying yourself enough?", Inc magazine, Nov. 2004) And that's something to keep in mind. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, says Driskill, whatever you don&amp;#39;t take from your company today should eventually come back to you. &amp;quot; Really, when I&amp;#39;m ready to retire, the compensation issue becomes moot, &amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot; because theoretically I will sell the company back to my employees. That&amp;#39;s the nice thing — it all becomes your money in the end. &amp;quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;("  In U.S. Plants and Wallets, The Other Iraq Standoff  ", WaPo, Feb. 2003) " The Gulf War triggered a relief trade in equity markets and a brief surge in consumer business confidence, but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, we didn&amp;#39;t have a normal, self-sustaining recovery until&amp;#39; 93, &amp;quot; said David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch &amp;amp;; Co. in New York. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What was meant by this was that females are more-often-than-not the limiting sex in a population and are thus behaviorally better positioned to choose between competing males during the process of sexual selection. Today, I thought that it may be a good idea to give an example of a species that exhibits a mating system typified by reversed sex-roles; one in which males , as opposed to females, are the limiting reproductive resource.

But as the Neuroscience for Kids website tells us,There is no scientific evidence to suggest that we use only 10% of our brains.Neuroscientists, of course, already know that. But are there other false beliefs about the brain? Brain Mythology is a new column in the journal Brain Structure and Function, edited by Laszlo Zaborszky and Karl Zilles. In the first installment, Hilgetag and Barbas (2009) ask the question, Are there ten times more glia than neurons in the brain?Neuroscience students take it for granted that there are many more glia than neurons in the brain. Neuroscience textbooks state with confidence: “Although there are many neurons in the human brain…, glia outnumber neurons by tenfold” (Bear et al. 2006) or, not to be outdone, even by “10–50 times”, as claimed in another text (Kandel et al. 2000). This fact is happily invoked by gliologists to promote the status of their field.Damn those status-conscious gliologists! They&amp;#39;ve been leading us astray!Given this well-accepted figure, we were surprised when our cell counts in the prefrontal cortex of the rhesus monkey turned             up a glia-to-neuron ratio (GNR) of just about 1 (Dombrowski et al. 2001). There was some regional variation, but no prefrontal area had a GNR larger than 1.2. Maybe the proportion of glia is very different in other cortical regions or other parts of the brain, so that the overall ratio for the whole brain is much larger than 1? Classic studies, however, conducted by O’Kusky and Colonnier (1982) in the opposite pole of the brain, the visual cortex, had reported an even lower GNR of 0.5.From Fig. 5A (Dombrowski et al., 2001). The ratio of glia/neurons in prefrontal areas or subdivisions of areas.The origin of the glial dominance myth is not clear at all. Hilgetag and Barbas conclude by mentioning that...Since the number of synapses increases             faster than the number of neurons in larger brains, this affiliation of glia with the multitude of neural connection points may help explain... For example, in large brains such as the human brain... there may be as many as 1.4 astrocytes for each neuron, up from 0.33 in the rodent cortex (Nedergaard et al. 2003). Even that ratio, however, is still a long way from the myth of 10 times more glia than neurons, in any species.          Those species include humans of course, who are like monkeys with a nearly perfect 1:1 neuron:glia ratio [as noted by Jason Snyder].ReferencesBear MF, Connors B, Paradiso M (2006).

This, however, is a brand-new find for me and I seriously hope that other conferences will follow &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.org.nz/SK:SKEPCONFERENCE"&gt;the New Zealand Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; example! They just had their conference, held in Wellington from the 25th to 27th September and whilst poking about to find out how it went, I found the following site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/category/reflections-on-science/"&gt;Science Media Center&lt;/a&gt; - ‘&lt;em&gt;Our aim is to promote accurate, bias-free reporting on science and technology by helping the media work more closely with the scientific community&lt;/em&gt;‘ is what their site says. What their site features now? Audio of the recent NZ skeptic conference!&lt;/p&gt;

There’s Matthew Dentith, whose PhD work on conspiracy theories I’ve had my eye on for a while - his presentation is “&lt;a title="Permanent Link to NZ Skeptics Conference – The Slippery Slope of Conspiracy Theories" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/2009/09/28/nz-skeptics-conference-the-slippery-slope-of-conspiracy-theories/"&gt;The Slippery Slope of Conspiracy Theories”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The fine people at St. Matthew's 56-year-old Church (which I suppose now would be a 58-year-old church) were trying to get people excited about their "Biblical seed harvest plan," an iteration of the so-called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_gospel"&gt;Prosperity Gospel&lt;/a&gt; that claims God rewards people's faith financially, with the cheapest of gimmicks: a paper "handkerchief" that was thinly linked to an almost non-existent event from the New Testament. Seriously, they would have been as relevant if they had given out "Bible Faith Donkey Hair;" after all, Jesus rode into Nazareth on an ass, didn't he?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, through the kindness of commenter and blogroll-member &lt;a href="http://cranialhyperossification.blogspot.com/"&gt;GDad&lt;/a&gt;, I have been alerted to yet another crazy cloth of Christ, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqgx078F6Uw"&gt;Screaming Pastor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kerneythomas.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kerney Thomas's&lt;/a&gt; "Red Blood of Jesus Prayer Handkerchief!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a demonstration of the amazing power of the Red Blood of Jesus Prayer Hanky, peruse, if you will, this YouTube video in which Pastor Thomas utilizes its divine abilities to great effect:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/rx0bHOsBtPc%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's right, ladies and gentlemen: while the Bible Prayer Handkerchief was merely a prayer relic upon which you wrote a name before sending it back to its makers, the Red Blood of Jesus Prayer Handkerchief &lt;i&gt;has the healing power of Peter Popoff&lt;/i&gt;. I mean God. It can even heal people at a distance and over the phone! What amazing power!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just had to get my own, which anyone can do by submitting their information to the &lt;a href="http://kerneythomas.org/pp.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Prayer Hanky page&lt;/a&gt; of Pastor Thomas's website. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last time I submitted my prayer request under the name of famous World of Warcraft chicken-eater Leroy Jenkins. This time, my head is elsewhere and I submitted under the name of brooding Final Fantasy VII anti-hero Vincent Valentine. The "thank you" page reveals that Kerney Thomas, too, is involved in the Prosperity Gospel racket:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Not only is God going to bless you through the Personal Prayer Package, but as you sow into this ministry you are sowing into good ground.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Translation: "We are a high-return, low-risk investment."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;You are supporting a television and radio ministry that is helping thousands daily.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Translation: "You are a good person if you give us free money."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;God said as you use your FAITH and sow into this ministry that he is going to give you your special blessing that you need right now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Translation: "We are bribing you with promises of good fortune."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, I want you to use your FAITH NOW and sow a faith seed offering of either $20, $50, $100 or more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Translation: "Give me the fucking wallet and nobody gets hurt."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever you do make sure it is a sacrifice because the greater the sacrifice the greater the miracle that God will perform for you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Translation: "We want you to be poor so we can be rich." Either that or "God is a prostitute."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;here is a special AGREEMENT PRAYER that God instructed me to pray for you when I receive your faith seed offering.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"We are extorting real money from you and repaying you with empty &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/07/prayer-as-capital.html"&gt;prayer capital&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Remember that this is not a debt you owe but a seed you sow and when you sow it God will grow it!&lt;/blockquote&gt;Translation: "We have no concept of masturbation jokes."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And finally:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We also wanted to make sure you get the number for the Miracle Prayer Line -- (281) 420-2255&lt;/blockquote&gt;Note that the Miracle Prayer Line is not toll-free. No, the long-distance fees you pay a multinational telecom corporation are just another part of the seed that you sow to bribe God into giving you free shit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also received a thank-you e-mail when I submitted my information, the entire text of which is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We have recceived your request for a prayer package, and you will be hearing from us soon!

Many (but by no means all) of these so-called “biomedical” treatments are based on the false view that vaccines somehow caused autism. I and my fellow SBM bloggers have expended huge quantities of verbiage refuting the pseudoscience, misinformation, and outright lies regularly spread by various anti-vaccine groups and two celebrities in particular, namely Jenny McCarthy and her boyfriend Jim Carrey. Most of the time, we discuss these issues in terms of the harm to public health that is done by falling vaccination rates due to the fear engendered by the message of the anti-vaccine movement and the threat of the return of vaccine-preventable diseases that once wreaked havoc among children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another price, however. There is a price that is paid by autistic children themselves and their parents. It is a price paid in money and lost time. It is a price paid in being subjected to treatments that are highly implausible from a scientific standpoint and for which there is no good scientific evidence. It is a price that can result in bankruptcy, suffering, and, yes, even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a price, I think, that is best demonstrated through a few case studies. This is a situation when anecdotes have their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CASE STUDY #1: “MARY” AND HER AUTISTIC SON “SAUL”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What inspired me to write this post and to try to list some of the more horrific examples of treatments and pain to which autistic children are subjected to was a post by a guest blogger at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt; entitled &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3144"&gt;Truth and Consequences: The Anti-vaccination Movement Exacts a Price&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But behind the scientific and legal consensus that vaccines do not cause autism lies a hidden world, the autism “biomedical” Yahoo! and chat group world. There is no decline in the number of posts in this world. It’s a thriving, and growing community, one that has fueled the popularity of the anti-vaxers, and the certainty of those parents who consider their child “vaccine-injured”. It has spurred the spending of millions of dollars on supplements, hyperbaric treatments, off-label prescription medications, and myriad other autism “biomedical treatments”. These “treatments” are almost all of no proven benefit, some are ridiculous, some relatively benign, and many potentially dangerous. This article will explore the journey of one mother, “Mary” in her efforts to cure her son “Saul”. While the case of Mary and Saul, documented in her own words is shocking and appalling, Mary is not alone nor is she an extreme case. She is one of thousands of parents seeking autism “biomedical treatments” on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this guest blogger says is absolutely true. I have seen it for myself, having spent many hours over the last five years lurking on such groups, all too often horrified at what I’ve read. What I have seen on these groups is one reason why I have become so vociferous in my attitude against the anti-vaccine movement and the biomedical quackery movement that it has spawned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a flavor of what I’m talking about, I will reproduce the list of what Mary has treated Saul with from when he was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder at age 3 until age 8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acetyl L Carnitine – acetylated form of L-carnitine (quaternary ammonium compound biosynthesized from the amino acids lysine and methionine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actos (pioglitazone) -prescription drug which carries a black box warning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cal/Mag Butyrate – mineral supplement&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;5 combined IVs DMPS/EDTA/Glutathione&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiropractic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diflucan – prescription anti-fungal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dimethyl glycine – modified amino acid&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Epsom salt baths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential fatty acids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flagyl (Metronidazole) – prescription anti-fungal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Folinic acid – modified folic acid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Folapro – highly absorbable folate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Galantamine – prescription drug used for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease and various memory impairments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GFCF diet – gluten-free-casein-free diet (3 years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GFCF diet with digestive enzymes for infractions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HBOT – hyperbaric oxygen treatment (Mary owns her own; Mary owns a Vitaeris 320)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HLC MindLinx Powder by Pharmax – probiotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IM Bicillin – prescription intramuscularly injected form of penicillin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inositol – a nutrient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IVIG – Intravenous Immunoglobulin – prescription used to treat immune dysfunction, contains the pooled immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoglobulins from the plasma of approximately a  thousand or more blood donors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klaire Labs Detoxification Support and Factor 4 – probiotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquid Bodybio PC – phosphatidylcholine with essential fatty acids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquid grapefruit seed extract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low dose Naltrexone – an anti-opiod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L-theanine – amino acid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnesium supplements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MB12 – Methylcobalamin, vitamin B12 – shots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MB12 – Methylcobalamin, vitamin B12 – spray&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nystatin – antifungal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OLE – olive leaf extract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSR  (N,N’-bis (2-mercaptoethyl)isophthalamide, also know as 1,3-benzenediamidoethanethiol) – an untested synthetic chemical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oxytocin nasal spray&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PCA-Rx – purports to remove toxins from the body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phosphatidylcholine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro Bio – probiotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quercetin – antioxidant flavinoid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced glutathione cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threelac -probiotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transdermal NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valtrex (valacyclovir) – used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zithromax – antibiotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that not an inconsequential number of these are treatments advocated by Jenny McCarthy, including many of the supplements, the gluten-free, casein-free diets, the vitamins, and more. As quoted &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=923"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, Jenny has said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe what helped Evan recover was starting a gluten-free, casein-free diet, vitamin supplementation, detox of metals, and anti-fungals for yeast overgrowth that plagued his intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are scared to chelate, which is the process of pulling metals out of the body, but it has triggered many recoveries. … Everyone has their own recipe to recovery, but your child might need chelation to get there. With a DAN doctor, I mean these guys are so good, they will help, you know, make sure your child is safe, your child has the minerals it needs to do it. … I’m, of course, scared to do it with Evan, but I plan on doing it this summer because Evan still suffers from seizures……&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this biomedical woo comes at a cost. For instance, in one message Mary listed the monthly cost: $2,800 to $3,500 for IVIG, plus $500 for supplements and chelation therapy. But that’s just money. It’s always possible to get more money, even after pouring it down the rathole of quackery. What is not possible to take back the discomfort, fear, and pain that Saul was forced to endure for no potential benefit. Indeed, Mary even appears at certain points to have recognized this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like a mad scientist and my poor kid is my guinea pig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only time I’ve heard a statement like that. Contrast Mary’s statement with Jenny McCarthy’s frequent mantra about her son Evan, “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/jenny_mccarthy_and_oprah_winfrey_two_cra.php"&gt;Evan is my science&lt;/a&gt;.” McCarthy’s is the “biomedical chant” of a person at the beginning of the “biomedical journey” or one whose child appears to be developing since his diagnosis. In contrast, the statement above by Mary is the same idea, much diminished, in the mind of a woman who has been at it for years and is tired but can’t bring herself to admit that all the expense and pain inflicted on her child have garnered no benefit. She doesn’t view the whole biomed thing as an exciting science experiment to cure her child anymore; it’s become Frankenstein. This is the contrast between the new and chipper versus the weary and jaded, between the enthusiastic and the resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the “biomed” discussion groups reinforce it all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of parents are members of these yahoo groups. Once inside the cozy echo chamber of the group, there is general acceptance that vaccines cause autism. Members expressing opposing views are drummed out of the group. It is taken as an article of faith that there are children recovering from autism by the use of these biomedical interventions. The parents get poorer, the quacks get richer, and the innocent children are the victims of often dangerous and painful experimentation at the hands of the people who are supposed to care for them the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, because a not insignificant minority of autistic children develop, sometimes to the point of &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=120"&gt;losing a diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; of being on the autistic spectrum, there are always a few stories that appear to show that “biomed” works, thus providing plenty of false hope to fuel the echo chamber and lure in new recruits. As &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=120"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens to parents whose kids don’t get better? For the most part, they are encouraged – by other parents and by the practitioners themselves – to “keep trying”. They are also encouraged to pay close attention and to “think positively” – but they are never encouraged to doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, parents who give up on “alternative” therapies simply fade away. They have enough going on in their lives that they don’t feel the need to “tell their story”. Especially when it’s not wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the opportunity, check in to one of the many “biomedically oriented” Internet groups and see what happens when somebody questions the idea that “biomed” can “recover” autistic children. At the least, they will be admonished – “Don’t stand in the way of other parents getting their children the help they need!”. More likely, they will be told to “Shut up!” and banned from the group. In some cases, they will be harassed and even threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it’s not too likely that you’ll hear many dissenting “stories”. It seems that everyone’s story is valuable…unless it contradicts the received wisdom of “biomed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warm, cozy, “nurturing” atmosphere, where never is heard a skeptical word. The parents there believe so deeply because they’ve never been exposed to data or criticisms that contradict their world view. Not surprisingly, they construct conspiracy theories to explain all the evidence against them and why they aren’t taken seriously. Indeed, a number of “biomed” cultists have &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3144"&gt;appeared in the comments of the post&lt;/a&gt;. Reading those comments, of which there were 370 as of early this morning I can see just how such parents can make autistic children pay the price of their delusions. Look in particular for comments by Christel King and “Jen,” for examples of just how invested in their world view these parents become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CASE HISTORY #2: KENT HECKENLIVELY, HIS DAUGHTER, AND COSTA RICAN STEM CELLS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Heckenlively &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/legal" rel="nofollow"&gt;blogs for the anti-vaccine blog Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve met him before, albeit a long time ago, when I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9"&gt;poked some not-so-gentle fun at him&lt;/a&gt; for fearmongering about vaccine ingredients, including sucrose. However, there’s one thing that I haven’t addressed about Mr. Heckenlively before, and that’s what he has been subjecting his autistic daughter Jackqueline to in a vain attempt to cure her. Worse, he has been blogging about it, even going so far as to post reports of her “provoked urine tests” to the world. What first made me aware of Mr. Heckenlively’s saga was a post is entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/12/i-officially-join-the-mercury-militia.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;I Officially Join the Mercury Militia&lt;/a&gt;, and it is one of the most horrifying things I’ve seen on AoA. All I could think as I read the post is how sorry I felt for Jacqueline, whom Mr. Heckenlively has subjected to all manner of dubious therapies in the pursuit of his belief that she is “mercury toxic” and that is the cause of her autism. It also shows just how far down the rabbit hole it’s possible for an otherwise intelligent person to go when that person is ignorant of science and fixates on one idea after another about what causes autism. The post begins with some background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem strange that six years after I started in the bio-medical world, beginning with the gluten/casein free diet for my daughter, and encompassing just about every other known treatment, that I’d questioned whether mercury played any role in her problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason was I simply didn’t have any good proof of high mercury levels in her, despite more than three years of chelation, and forty-two UTM tests from Doctors Data.  I did have abundant evidence of aluminum retention.  She usually averaged somewhere between eight and thirteen times the normal amount of aluminum excretion, and in one test, after we’d gone after strep, excreted eighty-one times the normal amount of aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-two urine tests from Doctor’s Data, Inc. (DDI)? For those of you not familiar with this laboratory, it is one of the &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=67"&gt;favored laboratory&lt;/a&gt; of dubious practitioners everywhere because of its lax methodology and tendency to find high levels of mercury and other heavy metals in just about every sample, as well as its tendency to participate in chelation-provoked urine testing for mercury, which is guaranteed to cause the excretion of a lot of mercury in a normal person. Indeed, there is &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/167/"&gt;no scientific basis&lt;/a&gt; for the lab tests that DDI does and reports for “provoked medal excretion.” As for the aluminum, where on earth did he think his daughter may have gotten exposed to so much aluminum, even if Doctors Data’s results were accurate? Certainly the amount in vaccines is far too small to have caused such a seemingly huge aluminum overload. After all, it sounds as though Mr. Heckenlively was subjecting his daughter to chelation-provoked tests, and mercury is not the only metal chelated and excreted in the urine. Several are, and will appear elevated after a course of chelation. It’s the same problem as with mercury. Provoked urine tests for heavy metals give us no information about what’s really going on because they’re an exceedingly artificial test and, well, provoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, DDI is inherently unreliable. Its methodology was once &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=250#comment-1916"&gt;tested by Dr. James Laidler thusly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctor’s Data was tested by Dr. Laidler in a way that any parent could do, almost. Dr. Laidler made up a false urine sample using known mercury free ingredients at a university lab, he divided the false urine (distilled water and creatinine) and sent it off in 2 urine specimen containers provided by Doctors Data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sent it to DD and got back 2 different results and both high in mercury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I wonder, though, is just how much did all those useless and unreliable tests cost? Worse, despite all this search, Dr. Heckenlively was undeterred:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was comfortable with aluminum as the reason for her problems because of the data, but also unsettled.  Despite getting out huge amounts of aluminum she didn’t get noticeably better.  I’d observed that accounts of kids getting better after mercury excretion usually involved somewhere between three to four times the normal amounts of mercury being excreted from their bodies and measured in the urine toxic metals tests.  Even her most extreme test, when everything else was coming out, never even made it to twice the normal amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, despite all the chelation therapy to which he subjected her, Jacqueline did not improve. However, she was subjected to a large number (at least 42, if in fact a urine metals assay was done after each chelation session) of repetitions of a useless treatment followed by an uninformative test. Worse, the treatment is not risk-free. Although I don’t know what specific chelation regimen Mr. Heckenlively subjected his daughter to, but, as we shall see later, chelation therapy can kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Heckenlively then says that this failure “raised a number of questions for me.” Unfortunately, apparently not a single one of the questions raised was whether he was following useless quackery and should stop subjecting his daughter to such treatments before he goes too far off the reservation and really endangers her. Indeed, Mr. Heckenlively’s questions were exactly the wrong questions in a reality-based world. Unfortunately, in the fantasy “biomedical” world into which he had immersed himself and Jacqueline, the questions made sense to him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did girls simply retain aluminum rather than mercury as the boys seemed to do?  Did the aluminum do greater damage than the mercury?  Were there still vast amounts of mercury in my daughter, that for some reason I simply couldn’t get her to excrete?  The answers to these questions are vital because each one requires a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my daughter was an aluminum kid, rather than a mercury kid, then something else had to be at work.  When other children excreted high levels of mercury, they generally got better.  Jacqueline’s levels of aluminum dropped to roughly normal levels by the summer of 2008, but there wasn’t a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Mr. Heckenlively kept pushing the chelation therapy, and there was still no improvement. Years of “treatment” and dozens of chelation treatments with no improvement. Did Mr. Heckenlively start to doubt “biomedical” therapies? Not at all. True, he did start to doubt whether it was aluminum or mercury, but unfortunately he did not move back into science-based medicine. Instead, he went even further down the rabbit hole into even less evidence-based (and far more expensive) “biomed.” If it wasn’t the mercury and the aluminum, Mr. Heckenlively decided that stem cells must be the answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That finding made me consider brain damage. Maybe she was simply damaged. How might you fix that?  Stem cells were my answer. (Cost of $15,500 for treatment courtesy of a grant from her Grandpa Heckenlively.) In August of 2008 we traveled to Costa Rica for four days so my daughter could receive 16 million stem cells, eight million through an infusion in her arm, and eight million infused through a line in her spine so it would have direct access to her brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But two months after stem cells there wasn’t a change.  I was counseled to wait for more time to pass.  My regular autism doctor was also counseling me that at some time the mercury would come out.  But I’d been waiting more than three years to see mercury and my daughter wasn’t getting any younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; part of the story is what I find most appalling and heartbreaking. Mr. Heckenlively subjected his daughter to stem cell &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=73"&gt;quackery&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=614"&gt;quackery&lt;/a&gt;. So not only did Mr. Heckenlively hit his daughter’s grandpa up for over $15,000, but he did it for a completely unproven and &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/stem-cell-therapy-in-costa-rica/"&gt;almost certainly useless treatment&lt;/a&gt;. Worse, given the dubious nature of the offshore clinics that serve up this stem cell quackery, there’s no guarantee that what the doctors at this clinic infused into Jacquelin’s blood and CSF were even real stem cells. In fact, very likely they were not. Not only is Mr. Heckenlively spending his own family’s resources, but he’s spending the retirement fund of his daughter’s grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more appalling, the doctors in Costa Rica injected the stem cells &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;directly into Jacqueline’s cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. That’s right. Let me say that again. They did a lumbar puncture in order to inject these “stem cells” directly into her cerebrospinal fluid! Remember, this being a clinic in Costa Rica, clearly set up there in order to avoid the more stringent regulations of the United States, these cells were of unknown origin and purity. There are no words to describe how appalling I find that. The potential complications are enormous, and for any physician to do this outside the context of a well-designed clinical trial overseen by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board is utterly unethical. That these quacks would not only do this but take advantage of credulous and desperate parents like Mr. Heckenlively to sell their therapy for $15,000 a pop should shock and horrify anyone with any common sense, much less with a modicum of knowledge about science and medicine. This is the real harm of the antivaccine movement and autism quackery. I understand desperation, but desperation and credulity have made Mr. Heckenlively vulnerable to the blandishment of just about any quack with an autism “therapy” to peddle, no matter how implausible from a scientific basis. Worse, never does it seem to occur to him just to accept his daughter the way she is and stop subjecting her to IVs and invasive procedures like lumbar punctures for no benefit. Instead, he moves on to a new form of woo that is even more implausible than “heavy metal detoxification” or stem cell therapy, one I call the Magical Mystery Virus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this point I ran into a doctor who told me these children were infected with viruses that hid from the immune system and lowered cellular energy.  And he had a treatment.  Illumination with UV light and his magical mystery formula put onto a plastic sheet would activate an alternative energy pathway which would go after the viruses.  But of course, he wasn’t a big believer that heavy metals formed any part of the autism problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the treatment and started seeing changes.  Specifically, she’s had about a 50-75% drop in seizures, and started to gain in physical strength.  This was shown most dramatically in her ability to hold a marker and do some coloring.  I’ve included two of her pictures so you can see the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alternative energy pathway”? More like voodoo. If Mr. Heckenlively had a single clue about biology, he would know that “lowering cellular energy” and “alternative energy pathways” are almost always quackspeak. What does it mean for an “alternative energy pathway” to “go after” the (nonexistent) viruses. Nothing! It means nothing! But it sounds all science-y, good enough to suck in parents like Mr. Heckenlively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident also illustrates a principle of autism quackery. Because autism is a condition of &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=120"&gt;developmental delay, not stasis&lt;/a&gt;, and because it frequently has periods of stasis followed by periods of rapid development followed by periods of stasis again, if a parent tries enough quackery, sooner or later by sheer coincidence alone he or she will be seem to be able to match up a remedy with an apparent improvement. That is likely what occurred in this case. Even if it is not, because of the highly variable course of autism, it’s impossible to say if this magical mystery treatment did anything without subjecting it to a randomized clinical trial. Still, even then Mr. Heckenlively was not satisfied. He moved on, back to mercury, and, after forty-three tests, he finally got what he wanted: a finding of elevated mercury. In fact, this is a similar principle. Because of the variability in tests and because the reference ranges are set to encompass 95% of the population (at least in real labs; in dubious labs like DDI, I don’t know), if you do enough  tests, sooner or later an anomaly will occur, particularly if multiple values are measured in each test. That’s one of the first things I like to teach medical students on the wards. Panels of lab values, in which 7 or 13 or even 20 different things are measured may be convenient for the lab, but the more of them there are the more likely there will be an abnormality or two, even in a “normal” patient. Moreover, Mr. Heckenlively’s analysis of his own tests on Jacqueline do not mean what he thinks they mean, as Prometheus and Dad of Cameron showed in this &lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=258"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important question, however is: Is Mr. Heckenlively’s daughter any better? Not really. But because he so desperately wants to believe in what he is doing Mr. Heckenlively remains undeterred:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe after more than four months the stem cells are starting to kick in.  Maybe she’s got more cellular energy and it’s causing the mercury to be excreted.  Maybe after three years of chelation we’ve drained enough of the swamp that the mercury is finally coming out.  I have my opinions about which one is really at work, but I don’t have a definitive answer.  As you can probably guess, I’m running an additional test to confirm the results. (There is a 1 in 43 chance this is a coincidence, although the cadmium and nickel excretions are similarly high, and they usually increase shortly before or in combination with mercury excretion.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More cellular energy” causing the mercury to be excreted? It hurts me to read that sentence not so much because of the wishful thinking that is behind it but because of what that wishful thinking is causing a young girl who doesn’t know any better and depends upon her parents to give her the best treatments possible to be subjected to. Does anyone doubt that Mr. Heckenlively’s love for his daughter will lead him to continue in his quest indefinitely flitting from one quack to another looking for an answer? Sadly, I don’t. Does this mean that Mr. Heckenlively is stupid? I don’t think so. Ignorant of science? Yes? Stupid, probably not. Desperate? It would appear so. I like to look at this sort of behavior as the same phenomenon that we see when we see highly intelligent people believe in creationism, the 9/11 Truth movement, or other conspiracy theories. The mercury militia (and, indeed, the antivaccine movement of which the mercury militia is a subgroup) to which Mr. Heckenlively proudly proclaims membership has indeed become like a religion–more like a cult, in fact. It attracts parents desperate to need to believe that there is a cure for autism and willing to pursue it at almost any cost and, worse, it seems every bit as capable of coopting intelligence in pursuit of doctrine and of convincing parents that pseudoscience and even outright magical thinking (the Magical Mystery Virus, for instance) are science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do try to empathize with Mr. Heckenlively. He has an autistic daughter, and raising such a child is a huge challenge. I don’t know if I could handle it myself. It’s quite possible that I could not. I also have no doubt that he really and truly wants to help his daughter and that he loves her dearly. Unfortunately, he has no real understanding of science or medicine and is clearly a credulous soul, easily persuaded of the value of the quackery &lt;em&gt;du jour&lt;/em&gt;. Never does it occur to him that Jacqueline is not getting better because she is not mercury toxic; that she is not “brain damaged” and stem cells wouldn’t repair that “damage” even if she were; and that she is not infected with some magical mystery virus. In the meantime, Mr. Heckenlively subjects his daughter to round after round of chelation and even invasive procedures such as a lumbar puncture to inject “stem cells” of unknown origin, spending thousands upon thousands of dollars, both his and his daughter’s grandparents’, in the process. Both he and his daughters are victims of quackery, and I have sympathy for them both, although far more for his daughter. Mr. Heckenlively is being taken advantage of. His normal parental love for his daughter is being twisted into a useless and expensive search or a “cure” that doesn’t currently exist and is unlikely to come into existence in our lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories of “Mary” and Mr. Heckenlively demonstrate one thing. Once a parent becomes ensconced in the cozy, reinforcing world of the biomed movement, it becomes very difficult for them to leave that support system, even when all the various promises that their children’s autism can be cured come to naught. A few ultimately abandon the movement and move on. (Indeed, parents like Jim Laidler did just that.) But many of them do not. Many of them, unfortunately, listen to the blandishments and keep trying. Some, like Mr. Heckenlively, will try fake stem cell therapies. Others will even try &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=503"&gt;chemical castration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CASE STUDY #3: SUICIDE IS NOT PAINLESS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. Raising a severely autistic child is an incredible challenge. I probably couldn’t do it with my current job, and I don’t know if I could even do it at all, period. My admiration for parents who can pull it off and especially for (but not limited to) those who can continue to love their children unconditionally, rather than the idealized version of what they think their children would be were it not for autism, is immense. Having interacted with a number of parents with autistic children, I can understand, at least as much as it is possible for someone who is not one of them, just how stressful their lives must be. I also think that insurance coverage and support services for autistic children tend to be inadequate. That being said, there is another cost parents who fall into the rabbit hole of “biomed” sometimes pay, and that’s guilt. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key message of the anti-vaccine movement is that vaccines are responsible for a lot, if not most, autism. The key concept, in an amazing feat of confusing correlation with causation, is that autism diagnoses started skyrocketing in the 1990s, beginning around the same time the childhood vaccination schedule was expanded to include more vaccines. Never mind that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;numerous large epidemiological studies&lt;/a&gt; have utterly failed to find a link between either mercury in vaccines or vaccines themselves and autism. There is a corollary to the idea that vaccines cause autism, however, a corollary that is not lost on a lot of the parents of autistic children who fall into “biomedical” woo. That corollary is that, if vaccines cause autism, then the parents are responsible for having made their children autistic by getting them vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is sometimes suicidal impulses, as described in a post by a guest blogger at Age of Autism, Angela Warner, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/05/autism-when-enough-is-too-much.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Autism: When Enough Is Too Much&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it is important for this subject to be talked about in our community. I’m pretty sure that most at one point have considered taking this action. A last action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a dream for my own family, and my children, just as we all do. My dream, and our reality, for a long time were polar opposites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 14, 2005, I decided I had had quite enough. There was much more going on in my life at that time than autism and being a military spouse. I’ll spare you the details, but it was a lot of weight on my shoulders, weight that I had been carrying for over 20 years. Autism on top of this? Now I have to carry this too? I felt a tremendous burden of guilt, that I had caused the boys to have autism. I couldn’t take anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read it again: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I felt a tremendous burden of guilt, that I had caused the boys to have autism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; had done this. That &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was responsible. That night, because of the guilt, Warner tried to kill herself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dave got home, I had another drink. I don’t know if I was done with those gross catch plates, and that was my cue that I was done? I don’t remember. I was going to meet the porcelain God, and not in the way that you think. I think I may have had another drink. I needed to be numb before that “meeting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave greeted me, and went upstairs to change out of his uniform. I calmly stopped whatever it was I was doing, walked into the bathroom, got down in the puke position, lifted the toilet seat and proceeded to slam my head into the porcelain bowl. I slammed it so hard that Dave heard it all the way upstairs. There was more slamming of my head on that toilet I use every day, over the course of the evening. At one point I locked myself in the bathroom when Dave left me unattended to go do something, and he heard more slamming of my head. I remember him screaming at his co-worker that this person could not let me into the bathroom unattended. That is the only way I even remember that his co-worker was here. Dave had to take the door handle off to get to me. It’s still jacked up from that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am one determined bitch. I had simply had enough. Honestly, with how hard I hit my head, and how many times, I should be dead. I guess God had other plans. It was shortly after this that I made the pact with myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Warner failed to kill herself. Likely, she really did want to live and didn’t hit herself on the head as hard as she thought. Also fortunately, it’s really pretty difficult to kill oneself that way, given how hard the skull is and how painful it is to hit oneself on the head repeatedly with a hard object. That she even tried to do it, however, signals just how much the guilt that the “biomed” movement engenders in parents, in essence blaming them for having caused their children’s autism by having them vaccinated, can add to the already considerable life stresses that raising such children can produce. Indeed, a commenter on AoA &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/05/autism-when-enough-is-too-much.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e2011570741eca970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e2011570741eca970b" rel="nofollow"&gt;chimed in&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your authenticity. I feel, as a single mother of three, that I want to be around for every moment. However, its really interesting that I was heading to the accupuncturist today to request a treatment for dealing with the feeling of guilt that I caused this because I knew about the concerns of vaccines but did not follow my intuition or empower myself, and caved in to the pressures of the pedicatrician and school requirements thinking, we’ll be okay, chances are slim, perhaps I’m overreacting to the research, perhaps they’re right/I’m wrong, etc. I want to be able to somehow let go of that guilt as I believe it causes illness to be left incomplete on an issue so intensely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to imagine that parents, after having come to the end of all that “biomed” has to offer with no improvement in their children, could enter a deep and profound depression, full of despair, to the point that suicide starts to look like the only way out. After all, in the “biomed” world, not only did these parents cause their children’s autism, but they’ve failed to cure it. Then, there’s Jenny McCarthy out there saying things like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/postholiday_the_stupid_it_burns_part_1_j.php"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I could in two months turn Evan completely autistic again. I could do it completely through diet. And maybe getting some vaccine boosters. Through diet, I could load him up again with all the things that will aggravate the damage that was done. Right now, what happened now was that I healed him to the point where he got everything back to this baseline level and it stays there like this. But I mess with it at all–boom!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this quote, Jenny arrogantly asserted that she has complete control over whether her son stays “recovered” or “relapses” into autism, and the “biomed” movement promotes this sort of thinking. Thus, when a child fails to “recover” or even improve despite a parent’s maximal effort with “biomed,” it’s not so unreasonable to speculate that guilt over that failure could lead to depression severe enough to contemplate suicide or even &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1689"&gt;murder-suicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CASE STUDY #4: THE DEATH OF ABUBAKAR TARIQ NADAMA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Abubakar Tariq Nadama, a five year old boy with autism, was brought to Pittsburgh from the U.K. by his parents. The reason they brought him to America is in order for him to undergo chelation therapy for his autism. It’s not entirely clear why they didn’t have him undergo this treatment in England, but, whatever the reason, they brought him to an ENT surgeon turned “alternative” physician and DAN! doctor named Dr. Roy Kerry. Tariq did not survive repeated encounters with Dr. Kerry. He died during a session of IV chelation therapy designed to “detoxify” him of mercury. Worse, this complaint shows that Tariq’s end was not pleasant, as the &lt;a href="http://www.casewatch.org/board/med/kerry/complaint.shtml"&gt;district attorney’s charges&lt;/a&gt; show. Here’s the note in Tariq’s medical chart from his initial consultation with Dr. Kerry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t have the entire record at all. Mother left her entire volume of his records home. But we have been in communication with Dr. Usman regarding EDTA therapy. He apparently has a very high aluminum and has not been responding 10 other types of therapies and therefore she is recommending EDTA, which we do on a routine basis with adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Tariq had been subjected to ten different other forms of what was almost certainly non-evidence-based “therapy” before his parents found their way to Dr. Kerry’s office. Sadly, as the first two case reports above show, this is  not at all atypical of parents so desperate for a “normal” child that they will allow themselves to be seduced by any dubious treatments that come along. In addition, to me this sounds as though Kerry never treated a child with IV chelation before. There’s a saying in pediatrics: “Children are not just little adults.” It’s bad enough that Kerry was giving chelation therapy to treat autism, an indication for which it is most definitely not appropriate, but he didn’t even seem to know the dose for a child of Tariq’s size!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The note continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We therefore checked him to it … But on testing for the deficiency indicator we find him only indicating the need for EDTA at the present time. Therefore we agree with Dr. Usman’s recommendation to proceed with the treatment. She recommends 50mg per kilo. He is 42 pounds today. So we’ll treat him with a 20-kilo child and give 1 gram of EDTA. We diluted it 1:1 with saline. Started the IV with saline. After a good blood flow in the right antecubital fossa with 3 other assistants and mother controlling him and the papoose board. Had a good TV return flow. We then introduced the EDTA. Checked return flow frequently during administration. Gave the IV over approx. 5 minutes. Then rinsed with saline. He had no difficulty toleration it. No infiltration occurred. We’ll have mother collect the urine for 12 hours. The most important are the first six hours for toxic and essential minerals. When we get that report back we’ll proceed with further injections as indicated on approx. a weekly basis. Recheck the levels in 4-6 lV’s depending on his response … Initial impression: Autistic Syndrome, Heavy Metal Toxicity, Candidiasis, Multiple Food Allergies … Roy E. Kerry, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odd, there’s no mention of mercury, even though this was also in Dr. Kerry’s notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;wants to have iv … edta injection … an iv push. mother states Tariq is autistic due to immunization shots he was a normal pregnancy .. 1st shots were given the day he was born … no sx noted until age 18 mo … has had 12 other inoculation by time he was 18 mo old/…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, for the most part, all we see in the notes are mentions of lead. It just goes to show that, should the mercury militia finally be forced to accept that the evidence just doesn’t support their belief that mercury in the thimerosal used as a preservative in vaccines is the cause of autism, there’ll always be another bogey man in vaccines that will be blamed. The mercury militia is just a manifestation of a larger antivaccination movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the chilling part of the complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;58. On August 23, 2005, a third and final round of Disodium EDTA chelation therapy was administered to Tariq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;59. Theresa Bicker administered the IV Disodium EDTA to Tariq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;60. Bicker requested Doctor Mark Lewis, D.O.) to come to the treatment room to help restrain Tariq for the 1V push of Disodium EDTA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;61. Respondent was not present when Tariq received chelation on August 23, 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;62. Theresa Bicker administered the Disodium EDTA pursuant to Respondent’s orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;63. Tariq’s medical chart fur August 23, 2005 reads “TV push ordered by Dr. Kerry and his protocol…. prior to procedure patient was alert and oriented. No acute distress. Mother was present in room ….. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;64. During the IV push, Tariq’ s mother, Marwa Nadama said that something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;65. Doctor Lewis took Tariq’s vitals and then Tariq went limp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;66. Bicker called 911 and helped with CPR while the ambulance was en route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;67. Tariq was taken by ambulance to Butler Regional Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;68. On August 23, 2005, at Butler Memorial Hospital, Tariq was pronounced dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so a five year old child who did not have to die died. He was held down for an IV push, went into cardiac arrest, and died. Kerry recklessly used a dangerous IV push of disodium EDTA just because he didn’t think Tariq would sit still, and Tariq’s heart stopped because it dropped the calcium level in his blood to levels that interfere with the proper electrical activity of the heart. Among the actual charges, it still irritates me, for the same reason that it irritated me when Dr. Mary Jean Brown of the CDC blamed Dr. Kerry for using the “wrong” kind of EDTA, rather than blaming him for using chelation therapy at all for a condition for which it is not indicated and for which there is no evidence of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-564561/Charges-dropped-U-S-doctor-accused-killing-autistic-British-boy-giving-wrong-drug.html"&gt;ultimately the district attorney decided to drop all criminal charges&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criminal charges have been dropped against a U.S. doctor accused of causing the death of a British five-year-old autistic boy by giving him the wrong drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Roy Kerry was trying to use chelation therapy on Abubakar Tariq Nadama in 2005 after his parents moved to the U.S. to seek treatment for his autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chelation therapy, approved in the U.S. for treatment for acute heavy metal poisoning, is regarded by some as a promising treatment for autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugs authority disagrees and Kerry was charged last year with involuntary manslaughter, endangering the welfare of a child and reckless endangerment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, yesterday a judge in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, allowed the district attorney of Butler County to drop charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerry, 70, still faces a civil lawsuit from Abubakar’s parents, Mawra and Rufai Nadama, who have returned to Britain since their son’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a petition, prosecutor William Fullerton asked that the charges be dropped after reassessing the merits of the case and “given the existence of additional and more germane judicial avenues for addressing the conduct of Dr Kerry”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerry had surrendered his license during the case, but it will now be reinstated, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not find any information about what has happened with Dr. Kerry since May 2008. A recent search of the Pennsylvania Department of State shows &lt;a href="http://www.licensepa.state.pa.us/Details.aspx?agency_id=1&amp;amp;license_id=530946&amp;amp;"&gt;Dr. Kerry’s medical license&lt;/a&gt; to be under suspension. However, it also lists the last date of renewal as December 22, 2008, which was 7 months after charges were dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the belief that vaccines in general, and that mercury in vaccines in particular, cause autism led to the death of an autistic boy at the hands of Dr. Roy Kerry. Worse, Dr. Kerry appears almost certain to have gotten away with his incompetence in using implausible and unproven “treatments” that resulted in the completely avoidable and unnecessary death of a five year old boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IT’S NOT JUST PUBLIC HEALTH&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the “biomed” movement to treat autism is not strictly all about the vaccines, it is largely about vaccines. If you delve into various “biomed” websites, chat rooms, and discussion forums, it will not take you very long to see “vaccine injury” being blamed for autism and being used as a rationale for this treatment or that. Lately, the “biomed” movement has–shall we say?–broadened its focus, I suspect in response to the unrelenting stream of studies failing to find any link between vaccines and autism, to include various “environmental” factors. These factors include–of course!–heavy metals and the various unnamed and unmeasured “toxins” so beloved of alt-med. Even so, reversing “vaccine injury” is still a major, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; major, focus of the “biomed” movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, I’ve generally focused mainly on the problems with declining vaccination rates that result fromt he fear mongering of the anti-vaccine movement. Indeed, fourteen years ago in the U.K., measles was viewed as having been largely controlled, with very few cases every year. Since Andrew Wakefield’s dubious science, MMR vaccination rates have plummeted and measles has returned with a vengeance, to the point where it is &lt;a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18919"&gt;considered endemic again&lt;/a&gt;. This is one major harm that the anti-vaccine movement has brought about and is continuing to bring about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other harm, however, is directly to autistic children themselves. The anti-vaccine movement paints them as being “toxic” and “vaccine damaged,” with the “real child” hiding within, waiting to come out if only just the right combination of “biomedical” woo can be found to reverse the “damage” done by vaccines. This view results in a false hope that leads parents to subject their children to an ever lengthening list of dubious and unproven treatments, as Kent Heckenlively, “Mary,” and the parents of Abubakar Tariq Nadama did. Many of these treatments are not benign. Some are painful and invasive, as injecting “stem cells” into the central nervous system or, as was described on an NBC news special about Andrew Wakefield and Thoughtful House, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1222"&gt;subjecting autistic children to unnecessary colonoscopies&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, parents who buy into the “vaccines cause autism” myth torture feel duped and themselves with guilt over having had their children vaccinated, thus “causing” autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the harms that result from believing the unsupported myth that vaccines cause autism and that dubious therapies unsupported by science can do anything other than enrich the “practitioners” who sell them.&lt;/p&gt;

While promoting his new film, &lt;em&gt;The Invention of Lying&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/27/ricky-gervais-discusses-religion-atheism-and-the-invention-of-lying/"&gt;Ricky Gervais discussed religion and his atheism&lt;/a&gt;. In the film, Gervais’ character invents religion soon after inventing lying in the alternate world of the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We decided that in this world, that’s how religion started. It’s an alternative world. It’s in no way atheist propaganda. I love films about angels and things like that and I wouldn’t go, ‘Oh, they’re coming down on one side here.’ Like ‘It’s a Wonderful Life.’ I don’t leave the cinema with my faith or lack of it challenged. I don’t think people should take this as anything other than an artistic choice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Garner also chimed in about the film’s “controversial” take on religion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ever-earnest [Jennifer] Garner embraces the prospect of controversy. “Isn’t it great if [the film] does start a conversation? Religion is something worth examining and your faith is something worth questioning. So I think if this movie asks that of people, that’s not a bad thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gervais prods Garner for her own belief system. “Yes, I do believe in God,” she confirms. “Thank you for making that clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more in the link above and Gervais’ past appearance on &lt;em&gt;Inside the Actors Studio&lt;/em&gt; where he also discusses his atheism &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/01/22/ricky-gervais-discusses-his-atheism-with-james-lipton/"&gt;can be seen here&lt;/a&gt; (with transcript).&lt;/p&gt;

And I freakin’ love his explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my “coming out” album. I’ve been living with a secret for quite a while. It’s something that most of my friends know about me but I’ve never divulged it in public. Although at least 10 percent of the U.S. population openly admits to being part of this group, there is tremendous pressure not to be vocal about it. And it’s a political third rail. You will almost never hear a politician admit to being one. But I’m tired of dodging the issue and feel I do a disservice to all of those who are not afraid to be outspoken about who they are. It’s time to stand and be counted. The truth is that I’m an … &lt;em&gt;atheist&lt;/em&gt;. There, I said it. I guess I’ve known that I was one since I was a little kid. I experimented with theism in high school. Who didn’t? But I’d have to get drunk and kind of force myself. And I’d always feel “wrong” afterwards. And then I’d feel guilty for feeling “wrong.” It was a dysfunctional way to live. Then I moved to Greenwich Village. And all around me were these other atheists. Just doing their thing. It all felt very natural. And I’ve never looked back. Wait, what was the question again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, Arriiiaaaaannaaa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since its very &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/05/antivaccination-rhetoric-running.html"&gt;inception&lt;/a&gt;, I've been--shall we say?--&lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/05/more-antivaccination-puffery-on.html"&gt;less&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/06/dr-gordons-at-it-again.html"&gt;than&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/06/mercury-and-autism-more-huffington.html"&gt;enthusiastic&lt;/a&gt; about the Huffington Post's medical blogging. Indeed, the level of anti-vaccine rhetoric there from the very beginning, back in 2005, astounded me. If anything, HuffPo's record has gotten even worse over the last four years, be it &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/deepak_chopras_wooful_whine.php"&gt;Deepak Chopra&lt;/a&gt;, or, in 2009, the addition of a variety of quacks to its roster, not to mention a brain-blisteringly stupid &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fire_marshall_bill_discusses_vaccines.php"&gt;anti-vaccine rant by Fire Marshal Bill&lt;/a&gt;--I mean Jim Carrey--the promotion of "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/dr_mark_hyman_mangles_autism_science_on-.php"&gt;functional medicine&lt;/a&gt;" quackery by Mark Hyman, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/more_woo_on--where_else--the_huffington.php"&gt;"detox" woo&lt;/a&gt;, or several different &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/kim_evans_strikes_again_at_huffpo.php"&gt;varieties&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/more_quackery_at_huffpo.php"&gt;swine flu quackery&lt;/a&gt;. (Speaking of swine flu quackery, there's &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-frank-lipman/swine-flu-what-to-do_b_286245.html"&gt;been some more at HuffPo just the other day&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/prevention_you_keep_using_that.php"&gt;PalMD's on the case&lt;/a&gt;.) Heck, there's even at least one post advocating "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_huffington_post_delves_deeper_into_t.php"&gt;distant healing&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it seems to me that the quackery quotient of HuffPo has been escalating ever since Patricia Fitzgerald, acupuncturist and homeopath, was hired as HuffPo's "&lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/vital_signs/2009/07/30/huffington_post/"&gt;Wellness Editor&lt;/a&gt;." The trend has continued since &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-dean-ornish"&gt;Dr. Dean Ornish&lt;/a&gt; was hired to become HuffPo's medical editor. A more embarrassing title I'm hard pressed to come up with. HuffPo's "medical editor"? Is that like being the biologist in charge of Ken Ham's "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/expelled_from_the_creation_mus.php"&gt;Creation Museum&lt;/a&gt;"? Be that as it may what is the one thing that would nail down HuffPo's title as the "mainstream" blog with the highest quackery quotient of all? Let's see. Anti-vaccinationists? &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/the_huffington_post_adds_another_antivac.php"&gt;Check&lt;/a&gt;. Deepak Chopra. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/the_return_of_the_living_choprawoo.php"&gt;Check&lt;/a&gt;. Distant healing. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/more_quackery_at_huffpo.php"&gt;Check&lt;/a&gt;. Beck protocol? &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/more_quackery_at_huffpo.php"&gt;Check&lt;/a&gt;. What else? Well, there's been a little dabbling in discussing homeopathy (or, as I like to call it, The One Quackery to Rule Them All), but not that much, other than &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/more_quackery_at_huffpo.php"&gt;in passing&lt;/a&gt;. What HuffPo needed, apparently, to complete its transition into Whale.to was a real, honest-to-God homeopath, not someone like Fitzgerald, who's a multifunctional woo-meister and apparently only dabbles in homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HuffPo needed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=448"&gt;Dana Ullman&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman"&gt;HuffPo got Dana Ullman&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/even_more_quackery_at--where_else--the_h.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/even_more_quackery_at--where_else--the_h.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/iKMI0xUHI6Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254111397877"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4815465151429407193">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2d98ddb4924fcdf5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Monday's Molecule #138</title><published>2009-09-28T04:01:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-29T18:51:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/09/mondays-molecule-138.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/4815465151429407193/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=4815465151429407193" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> This is the earliest posting of a Monday&amp;#39;s Molecule.

Worst Cellphones… by Radiation Output</title><published>2009-09-28T02:14:24Z</published><updated>2009-09-28T02:14:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/09/28/website-rates-best-worst-cellphones-by-radiation-output/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cruising around the Internet I stumbled upon this website over at Engadget.com where they ask people to rate their cellphones – &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/27/website-rates-best-and-worst-cellphones-by-radiation-output-leve"&gt;by the amount of (spooky word here) RADIATION output!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony here is the fact that a website which seems to advertise itself as tech-savvy would appear to embrace such a stupidly pseudoscientific concept as cellphone radiation being dangerous.  As has been outlined repeatedly in the scientific literature – as well as in my &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/electromagnetic-fields-cancer-myths/"&gt;Electromagnetic Fields &amp;amp; Cancer Myths&lt;/a&gt; blog entry – there is NO danger from cellphone radiation… none!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Engadget article, note the scale they show and the subsequent commentary…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="cellphone radiation" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2009/09/screen-shot-2009-09-26-at-6.12.58-pm.png" alt="" width="418" height="484"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;You’re surely aware that your cellphone bleeds &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/radiation/"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; into your face the whole time you’re on the phone with your mom, best friend or lover, right? Yes, it’s a fact we try not to think about most of the time, but now there’s a tool out there on the internets for the more reality-facing folks among us. The Environmental Working Group’s launched a website dedicated to rating cellphones on their radiation output alone. Ranking highly (meaning they put out the lowest levels of radiation) are the &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/MotorolaRAZR/"&gt;Motorola RAZR&lt;/a&gt; V8, and AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/SamsungImpression/"&gt;Samsung Impression&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, it seems that Samsung is cranking out the healthiest phones these days! Phones with poor showings includes T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/myTouch3G/"&gt;myTouch 3G&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/BlackberryCurve8830/"&gt;Blackberry Curve 8830&lt;/a&gt;. So hit the read link and tell us, how does your phone rate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The scale leaves out one important fact… that all of these phones likely operate at the same &lt;em&gt;frequencies&lt;/em&gt; of radiation.  The only thing this scale is studying is the &lt;em&gt;intensity&lt;/em&gt;, which is entirely different!  For example, the frequency of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon"&gt;photon of electromagnetic energy&lt;/a&gt; is what determines how energetic (and therefore how dangerous in the context of causing cancer) the radiation is.  Low-frequency radiation like that from cellphones simply cannot cause cancer, as far as we know, because it is &lt;strong&gt;non&lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"&gt;ionizing radiation.&lt;/a&gt; The fact that these goofs at Engadget.com can’t even get this basic bit of physics right will ensure that they won’t be getting any of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I don’t know about you, but I know how I’d rate this website for scientific validity.  I give it a rating of FAIL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_oklahoma_bombing_video"&gt;Attorney: OKC bombing tapes appear edited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Long-secret security tapes showing the chaos immediately after the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building are blank in the minutes before the blast and appear to have been edited, an attorney who obtained the recordings said Sunday.
&lt;p&gt;“The real story is what’s missing,” said Jesse Trentadue, a Salt Lake City attorney who obtained the recordings through the federal Freedom of Information Act as part of an unofficial inquiry he is conducting into the April 19, 1995, bombing that killed 168 people and injured hundreds more. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… The tapes turned over by the FBI came from security cameras various companies had mounted outside office buildings near the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. They are blank at points before 9:02 a.m., when a truck bomb carrying a 4,000 pound fertilizer-and-fuel-oil bomb detonated in front of the building, Trentadue said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Four cameras in four different locations going blank at basically the same time on the morning of April 19, 1995. &lt;strong&gt;There ain’t no such thing as a coincidence&lt;/strong&gt;,” Trentadue said. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… “The interesting thing is they spring back on after 9:02,” he said. “The absence of footage from these crucial time intervals is evidence that &lt;strong&gt;there is something there that the FBI doesn’t want anybody to see.&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Nothing like an &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Argument_from_Ignorance"&gt;argument from ignorance&lt;/a&gt; to fill in the gaps, eh folks?  Some people fill in the gaps in our knowledge with fairies, others with god, still others with aliens — while Mr. Trentadue seems to prefer some kind of scary government cover-up.  And, in true conspiracy-mongering fashion which illustrates the &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Falsifiability"&gt;unfalsifiable&lt;/a&gt; nature of the argument, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; points to THE CONSPIRACY!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title="its_a_conspiracy" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/its_a_conspiracy1.jpg?w=400&amp;amp;h=300" alt="its_a_conspiracy" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;… The FBI in the past refused to release the security camera recordings, leading Trentadue and others to contend the government was hiding evidence that others were involved in the attack. …&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So because the FBI &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; sharing the video with him, Trentadue claimed they were hiding evidence. Yet when the FBI gave him the videos, because they apparently didn’t show what he wanted them to show, Trentadue continues to allege some kind of cover-up or conspiracy.  Wow, you’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t with these CT folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cue spooky music in 3… 2… 1…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I find it interesting that Mr. Trentadue, in his “quest for the truth”, laments the absence of video footage in the minutes leading up to the explosion, yet  apparently there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; video footage from the area leading up to the explosion at 9:02AM on April 19th, 1995 outside the Murrah Federal Building. &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing#Bombing"&gt;It’s all right here at Wikipedia’s link on the Oklahoma City Bombing…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;… At 8:57 a.m. CST the same Regency Towers Apartments’ lobby security camera—which had recorded Nichols’ pickup truck three days earlier—recorded the Ryder truck [containing the bomb] heading towards the Murrah Federal Building.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me all of five minutes to find this information online and easily debunk Trentadue’s claim.  Nice &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Cherry-Picking"&gt;cherry-picking&lt;/a&gt; there, Mr. Trentadue.  Never let something as trivial &amp;amp; annoying as the &lt;em&gt;facts&lt;/em&gt; get in the way of a good conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;

Z. Myers got it right in a terrific response to a Christian’s advice about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/advice_for_atheists.php"&gt;how atheists should behave more nicely. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christian sez:&lt;/strong&gt; 5. Try to deal with the actual notions of God seriously believed in by millions of people rather than inventing strawmen (or spaghetti monsters) to dismiss the concepts of God – and deal with the Bible paying attention to context and the broader Christological narrative rather than quoting obscure Old Testament laws. By all means quote the laws when they are applied incorrectly by “Christians” – but understand how they’re meant to work before dealing with the Christians described in point 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P. Z. sez:&lt;/strong&gt; . . . .We atheists actually do address the claims fervently held by millions of people. The sneaky trick the theological wankers pull, though, is that once we’ve smacked them down, they announce, “Oh, no — we didn’t mean those millions of believers. They’re stupid. We meant &lt;em&gt;these other&lt;/em&gt; millions of believers.” It’s a big game of whack-a-mole. What you call “obscure Old Testament laws,” someone else will call the core of their faith. What you value as the “Christological narrative,” a member of yet another sect will call pretentious confabulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheists just cut through all the noise and call it all sewage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s it exactly.  Whack-a-mole is what Terry Eagleton is playing, what Karen Armstrong is playing, what John Haught is playing — what the whole oleaginous and underemployed crew of academic theologians and their defenders are playing.  But we needn’t address this bait-and-switch tactic any longer: we can just dismiss it as the WAM Argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="Whack-A-Mole_1" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/whack-a-mole_1.png?w=368&amp;amp;h=291" alt="Whack-A-Mole_1" width="368" height="291"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Fig. 1.  Oh noes, we’re talking about the faith over &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say what you will about the quality of some of the blogs on that list, but it’s one barometer of the growth of the atheist blogosphere over the past few years.  It tells the world that there are more and more people offering opinions against the idea of theism — and it’s constantly growing in quality and quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may fondly remember previous such battles, like “should we teach kids about the ’second shooter on the grassy knoll’ theory?” and “should we take a fieldtrip to the studio where they filmed the ‘moon landing’?” and “are seventh-graders mature enough to learn about the small number of international elites (like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group"&gt;Bilderberg Group&lt;/a&gt;) who control most of the world’s major governments and corporations and media?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In case you &lt;i&gt;don’t&lt;/i&gt; remember, the answers were “no,” “no,” and “yes.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current battle is, unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/education/61999842.html"&gt;far less interesting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Peter Marshall, one of six “expert reviewers” appointed by the State Board of Education to help write the new standards, argues that children cannot get an accurate portrayal of American history without knowing about the religious motivations and Bible-based worldview of the original settlers and Founding Fathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t properly tell American history unless you teach the biblical motivations of the people who discovered the country like Christopher Columbus; the people that settled it like the Pilgrims and Puritans; the people who formed government like the Founding Fathers,” said Marshall, a Presbyterian minister and president of the Massachusetts-based Peter Marshall Ministries. “My point in all of this is that children of this nation need to be taught the truth about the biblical world view. The influence of the Bible and the Christian faith is absolutely gigantic in American history.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose he’s right.  Think about how Columbus &lt;a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1017/p05s01-woeu.html"&gt;refused to baptize the Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; so that he could legally enslave them.  That could totally count as “biblical motivation.”  And “torturing people to maintain order” is totally an Old Testament kind of tactic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What qualifies Marshall an “expert reviewer” of textbooks?  The article doesn’t say, but I’m guessing it’s related to his “&lt;a href="http://petermarshallministries.com/about/index.cfm"&gt;How We Can Restore America&lt;/a&gt;” plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[U]nless we have a rebirth of the Spirit of God in each new generation of Americans, our Constitution will not work, and we will not be able to have a society with liberty and justice for all. Why? The simple reason is that in order to have a just society we have to care for our neighbor. But the Bible tells us that every human being is born with a sinful and fallen nature — we are by nature self-centered. So, in order for us to care about our neighbors we need an infusion of the Spirit of God that will get us out of our natural self-centeredness. That is why we need revival in each generation of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t have said it better myself.  But if knowing about people’s biblical motivations is so important, why should we restrict it to “social studies”?  Let’s also devote mathematics classes to explaining how famous mathematicians were motivated by their theology, science classes to explaining how famous scientists were motivated by their theology, and home economics classes to explaining how famous home economists were motivated by their theology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

It wasn't long ago that I revised &lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-i-am-not-atheist.html"&gt;my own&lt;/a&gt; from "agnostic" to the more accurate and more useful "agnostic atheist" (in a nutshell, anyway--but this is a topic for a future post). The problem I have is that the relevant parts of my beliefs didn't change, only what I called myself did. I didn't have a belief in any gods when I called myself an agnostic, and I don't have any belief in any gods now that I call myself an atheist. From any objective standpoint, I was an atheist the whole time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this is the substance of the problem: the dissonance between what a person calls himself or herself, and what categories a person objectively falls into. These labels are frequently different, and frequently result in various confusions and complications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;On one hand, I think we're inclined to take people at their word with regard to what their personal labels are. It's a consequence of having so many labels that center around traits that can only be assessed subjectively. I can't look into another person's mind to know what they believe or who they're attracted to or what their political beliefs really are, or even how they define the labels that relate to those arenas. We can only rely on their self-reporting. So, we have little choice but to accept their terminology for themselves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But...there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; objective definitions for some of these terms, and we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;, based on a person's self-reporting of their beliefs, see that an objectively-defined label--which may or may not be the one they apply to themselves--applies to them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I fear I'm being obtuse in my generality, so here's an example: Carl Sagan described himself as an agnostic. He resisted the term "atheist," and clearly gave quite a bit of thought to the problem of how you define "god"--obviously, the "god" of Spinoza and Einstein, which is simply a term applied to the laws of the universe, exists, but the interventionist god of the creationists is far less likely. So Sagan professed agnosticism apparently in order to underscore the point that he assessed the question of each god's existence individually. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, he also seemed to define "atheist" and "agnostic" in unconventional ways--or perhaps in those days before a decent atheist movement, the terms just had different connotations or less specific definitions. Sagan &lt;a href="http://www.celebatheists.com/?title=Carl_Sagan"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; "An agnostic is somebody who doesn't believe in something until there is evidence for it, so I'm agnostic," and "An atheist is someone who knows there is no God." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I love Carl, but it seems to me that he's got the definitions of these terms inside-out. "Agnostic," as the root implies, has to do with what one claims to &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;--specifically, it's used to describe people who claim not to know if there are gods. Atheist, on the other hand, is a stance on belief--specifically the lack of belief in gods. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, if we're to go with the definitions of terms as generally agreed upon, as well as Carl's own self-reported lack of belief in gods and adherence to the null hypothesis with regard to supernatural god claims, then it's clear that Carl &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; an atheist. Certainly an agnostic atheist--one who lacks belief in gods but does not claim to know that there are no gods--but an atheist nonetheless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dilemma with regard to Sagan is relatively easy to resolve; "agnostic" and "atheist" are not mutually exclusive terms, and the term one chooses to emphasize is certainly a matter of personal discretion. In the case of any self-chosen label, the pigeon-holes we voluntarily enter into are almost certainly not all of the pigeon-holes into which we &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be placed. I describe myself as an atheist and a skeptic, but it would not be incorrect to call me an agnostic, a &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pearlist"&gt;pearlist&lt;/a&gt;, a secularist, an empiricist, and so forth. What I choose to call myself reflects my priorities and my understanding of the relevant terminology, but it doesn't necessarily exclude other terms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more difficult problems come when people adopt labels that, by any objective measure, do not fit them, or exclude labels that do. We see Sagan doing the latter in the quote above, eschewing the term "atheist" based on what we'd recognize now as a mistaken definition. The former is perhaps even more common--consider how 9/11 Truthers, Global Warming and AIDS denialists, and Creationists have all attempted to usurp the word "skeptic," even though none of their methods even approach skepticism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The danger with the former is when groups try to co-opt people into their groups who, due to lack of consistent or unambiguous self-reporting (or unambiguous reporting from reliable outside sources), can't objectively be said to fit into them. We see this when Christians try to claim that the founding fathers were all devout Christian men, ignoring the reams of evidence that many of them were deists or otherwise unorthodox. It's not just the fundies who do this, though; there was a poster at my college which cited Eleanor Roosevelt and Errol Flynn among its list of famous homosexual and bisexual people, despite there being inconsistent and inconclusive evidence to determine either of their sexualities. The same is true when my fellow atheists attempt to claim Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Paine (among others), despite ambiguity in their self-described beliefs. I think, especially those of us who pride ourselves on reason and evidence, that we must be careful with these labels, lest we become hypocrites or appear sloppy in our application and definition of terms. These terms have value only inasmuch as we use them consistently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The matter of people adopting terms which clearly do not apply to them, however, presents a more familiar problem. It seems easy and safe enough to say something like "you call yourself an atheist, yet you say you believe in God. Those can't both be true," but situations rarely seem to be so cut-and-dry. Instead, what we end up with are ambiguities and apparent contradictions, and a need to be very accurate and very precise (and very conservative) in our definition of terms. Otherwise, it's a very short slippery slope to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman"&gt;No True Scotsman&lt;/a&gt; territory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Case in point, the word "Christian." It's a term with an ambiguous definition, which (as far as I can tell) cannot be resolved without delving into doctrinal disputes. Even a definition as simple as "a Christian is someone who believes Jesus was the son of God" runs afoul of Trinitarian semantics, where Jesus is not the son, but God himself. A broader definition like, "One who follows the teachings of Jesus" ends up including people who don't consider themselves Christians (for instance, Ben Franklin, who enumerated Jesus among other historical philosophers) and potentially excluding people who don't meet the unclear standard of what constitutes "following," and so forth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is why there are so many denominations of Christianity who claim that none of the other denominations are "True Christians." For many Protestants, the definition of "True Christian" excludes all Catholics, and vice versa; and for quite a lot of Christians, the definition of the term excludes Mormons, who are also Bible-believers that accept Jesus's divinity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we start down the path of denying people the terms that they adopt for themselves, we must be very careful that we do not overstep the bounds of objectivity and strict definitions. Clear contradictions are easy enough to spot and call out; where terms are clearly defined and beliefs or traits are clearly expressed, we may indeed be able to say "you call yourself be bisexual, but you say you're only attracted to the opposite sex. Those can't both be true." But where definitions are less clear, or where the apparent contradictions are more circumstantially represented, objectivity can quickly be thrown out the window. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't really have a solution for this problem, except that we should recognize that our ability to objectively label people is severely limited by the definitions we ascribe to our labels and the information that our subjects report themselves. So long as we are careful about respecting those boundaries, we should remain well within the guidelines determined by reason and evidence. Any judgments we make and labels we apply should be done as carefully and conservatively as possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My reasons for laying all this out should become clear with my next big post.

&lt;p&gt;I'll be posting a longer remembrance tomorrow in my &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/"&gt;Word Routes&lt;/a&gt; column on the Visual Thesaurus, but for now I'd like to note one example where Safire, despite his occasional prescriptivist predilections, showed a willingness to heed the work of descriptive linguists. In a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/magazine/26wwln_safire.html"&gt;2006 column&lt;/a&gt;, he described political &amp;quot;template phrases&amp;quot; such as &amp;quot;No &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; left behind&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;We are all &lt;b&gt;X &lt;/b&gt;now.&amp;quot; At the time, I was &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7emyl/languagelog/archives/002877.html"&gt;disappointed&lt;/a&gt; that he was unfamiliar with the work of Language Loggers on &lt;a href="http://blog.oup.com/2007/08/patterns/"&gt;snowclones&lt;/a&gt;. But earlier this year, when Safire approached me for my thoughts on the expression &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/magazine/12wwln-safire-t.html"&gt;I don't do &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; I nudged him to an appreciation of snowclones, and of Language Log. He followed up the column with another one (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24wwln-safire-t.html"&gt;Abbreve That Template&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;) explicitly acknowledging Language Log&amp;#39;s pioneering work in snowclonology. Even at the end of his prolific career, he was eager to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the movie, lying leads to, among other things, the invention of religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Gervais has been talking about religion in many of the interviews he’s done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When [Gervais' character] Mark Bellison learns to lie, he learns it can be used to comfort people, not just for personal gain. Something close to Gervais’s heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been an atheist all my life,” he continues, “but I always knew that if my mum asked me when she was dying if there was a heaven I’d say yes. I’d lie. I think that’s how religion started – as a good lie. If you’re not an atheist you can watch this film without getting angry. I watch films about angels, love ’em. I don’t think you have to treat something that comes down on one side as propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="http://www.shortlist.com/movies/article/when-shortlist-met-ricky-gervais/2"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gervais insists he isn’t worried that his views about religion could ruin his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never tiptoed around the subject, not even in America,” he said. “I say it on TV in America; I say it on radio in America. I nail it to the mast. I did Inside The Actors Studio and the students were taken aback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="http://www.showbizspy.com/article/192302/ricky-gervais-religion-is-based-on-lies.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t see why we would ever get hate mail,” [Gervais] said at the movie’s press conference. “We decided that in this world, that’s how religion started. It’s an alternative world. It’s in no way atheist propaganda. I love films about angels and things like that and I wouldn’t go, ‘Oh, they’re coming down on one side here.’ Like ‘It’s a Wonderful Life.’ I don’t leave the cinema with my faith or lack of it challenged. I don’t think people should take this as anything other than an artistic choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as might be expected from a Gervais-led panel, every serious pronouncement about the film is countered with something funny. [Writer/director Matthew] Robinson adds, “I wrote this film to denounce one organized religion in particular and that’s Greek mythology. Because Zeus is not real. I don’t believe in him and I don’t think anyone else should.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever-earnest [Jennifer] Garner embraces the prospect of controversy. “Isn’t it great if [the film] does start a conversation? Religion is something worth examining and your faith is something worth questioning. So I think if this movie asks that of people, that’s not a bad thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gervais prods Garner for her own belief system. “Yes, I do believe in God,” she confirms. “Thank you for making that clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="http://entertainment.ca.msn.com/movies/tiff/article_tiff2009.aspx?cp-documentid=21724834"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gervais’ appearance on &lt;em&gt;Inside the Actors Studio&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/01/22/ricky-gervais-discusses-his-atheism-with-james-lipton/"&gt;can be seen here&lt;/a&gt; (with transcript).&lt;/p&gt;

Proceed at your own risk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I am an expert in the prevention and treatment of adult diseases.  That's what I do from well before the sun rises until well after it sets every day of every week.  To become an expert and retain this status is not a simple task.  After college I completed four years of medical school, three years of residency in my specialty, and chose to become "board-certified".  There are doctors who are not board certified in their specialties, and there's nothing nefarious about that---all that is required to practice medicine is a valid license from the state.  But my hospital doesn't allow physicians on staff if they are not board certified, recognizing that this status means something.  There is no good reason to eschew board certification. To fail the boards repeatedly betrays a lack of basic competency, given that most doctors are actually good test takers, otherwise they'd never have made it so far.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, once one was board certified in internal medicine, the certification was for life.  Several years ago this changed, with older doctors being grandfathered into permanent certification, and all new internists being required to re-certify every decade.  Since medicine is an ever-changing field, my license required fifty hours of continuing medical education yearly.  In addition to that, I'm now two years away from my re-certification, which requires more continuing education.  The American Board of Internal Medicine suggests spreading re-certification over a two year period.  I've started doing the required learning modules and they are &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt;.  Depending on the field, each question takes me about twenty minutes of research just to make a reasonable guess at the answer.  Most of the modules are knowledge-based, but I'm required to do at least one that helps me review my practices.  I could, for example, review a few dozen charts of hypertensive patients to see how well I am managing them, and come up with a plan to improve my practices.  After all of this, I may sit for my board exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is simply to serve as a bit of background---when I talk about medicine, I'm not pulling it out of my ass.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/06/you_say_you_want_a_revolution.php"&gt;Some doctors, though...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/prevention_you_keep_using_that.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/09/prevention_you_keep_using_that.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/Hs5WQGyCWto" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254087129743"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/what_is_investigative_science.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d1a1f2bd152c6bc4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Reporting"/><title type="html">What is 'Investigative Science Journalism'?</title><published>2009-09-27T20:58:52Z</published><updated>2009-09-27T20:58:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/aqcyDm0kMK8/what_is_investigative_science.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/what_is_investigative_science.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://futurity.org/" title=""&gt;Futurity.org&lt;/a&gt;, a new science news service, was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/new_science_news_service.php" title=""&gt;launched last week&lt;/a&gt;, there was quite a lot of reaction online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some greeted it with approval, others with a "wait and see" attitude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some disliked the elitism, as the site is limited only to the self-proclaimed "top" universities (although it is possible that research in such places, where people are likely to be well funded, may be &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/michaelnielsen/3b5619fe/plos-biology-real-lives-and-white-lies-in" title=""&gt;the least creative&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one person - notably, a journalist - exclaimed on Twitter: "&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/alexismadrigal/status/4069710587" title=""&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt;!", which led to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/alexismadrigal/status/4069985655" title=""&gt;a discussion&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the journalist's notion that &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/alexismadrigal/status/4070134293" title=""&gt;press releases&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/alexismadrigal/status/4070151571" title=""&gt;automatically suspect&lt;/a&gt; and scientists are never to be trusted and their institutions even less. That was a very anti-science sentiment from a professional science journalist, some of us thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exchange reminded me of a number of prior debates between the traditional Old Media journalists and the modern New Media journalists about the very definition of 'journalism'. The traditional journalists are fighting to redefine it in a narrowest possible way that keeps them in a position of gatekeepers (like the new proposed &lt;a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/09/shield-law-definition-of-journalist-gets-professionalized/" title=""&gt;shield law&lt;/a&gt; that defines a journalist as someone who gets paid by the Old Media organization, thus NOT protecting citizen journalists, accidental journalists, bloggers, etc.), while the new ones are observing the way the world is changing and trying to come up with new definitions that better reflect the world (and often go too far in the other direction - defining everything broadcast by anyone via any medium to the audience consisting of more than one person as journalism, including the crossword puzzle in a newspaper and the silliest YouTube video). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the frequently heard retorts in the "you'll miss us when we're gone" genre of defensiveness by the old guard is the slight-of-hand in which they suddenly, in mid-stream of the discussion, redefine journalism to equate &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; investigative journalism. This usually comes up in the form of "who will report from the school board meetings" question (to which the obvious answer is: "actually, the bloggers are already doing it a lot as the old media has quit decades ago").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, investigative journalism is just &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/defining_the_journalism_vs_blo.php" title=""&gt;one of many forms&lt;/a&gt; under the rubric of 'journalism'. And, if you actually go and buy a copy of your local newspaper today (it still exists in some places, on tree-derived paper, believe me), you are likely to find exactly zero examples of investigative journalism in it. Tomorrow - the same. Every now and then one appears in the paper, and then it is often well done, but the occasions are rare and getting even more rare as investigative reporters have been cut from many a newsroom over the past few decades, and even more rapidly over the last several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, what is 'Investigative Science Journalism'?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this train of thought brought me to the question, again, of what is 'investigative journalism' in science. And I was not perfectly happy with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/defining_the_journalism_vs_blo.php" title=""&gt;what I wrote about this question before&lt;/a&gt;. I had to think some more. But before doing all the thinking myself, I thought I'd try to see what others think. So I &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BoraZ/statuses/4320505463" title=""&gt;tweeted the question&lt;/a&gt; in several different ways and got a lot of interesting responses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: What is, exactly, 'investigative science reporting'?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@davemunger: @BoraZ To me, it means going beyond looking at a single study to really understand a scientific concept. Diff from traditional "inv. journo"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@szvan: @davemunger @BoraZ And looking at methodology, statistical analysis, etc. to determine whether claims made match what was studied.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LeeBillings: @BoraZ Re: "investigative science reporting," isn't it like all other investigative reporting where you dig deep and challenge your sources?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@Melhi: @BoraZ I thnk it means, "we cut/pasted from Wiki, all by ourselves." Seems to be what it means when "scientific" is removed from the term.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: @LeeBillings clarify: What's the story about? dig deep into what? who are the sources? why are you assuming they need to be challenged?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@soychemist: @BoraZ Any instance in which a reporter tries to uncover scientific information that has been concealed or distorted, using rigorous methods&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@john_s_wilkins: @BoraZ Reporting on investigative science, no doubt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LeeBillings: @BoraZ ?s you're asking only make sense in context of a specific story, not in context of defining "sci investigative journalism" as a whole&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LeeBillings: @BoraZ 1/2 but typically, the goal is to find out what&amp;#39;s true, and communicate it. you dig into primary literature &amp;amp; interview tons of ppl&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LeeBillings: @BoraZ 2/2 you don't assume they need to challenged. you *know* they need to be challenged based on your in-depth research into primary lit&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: When futurity.org was released, a journo yelled "propaganda"! Does every press release need to be investigated? Challenged?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: Are scientists presumed to be liars unless proven otherwise? All of them?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@NerdyChristie: Usually. Unless you're studying how herbal tea makes you a supergod. RT @BoraZ: Are scientists presumed to be liars unless proven otherwise?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@szvan: @BoraZ Not liars but not inherently less open to bias than anyone else. Some wrongs are lies. Some are errors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: Are journalists capable of uncovering scientific misconduct at all? All of those were uncovered by other scientists, I recall...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@lippard: @BoraZ Didn't journalist Brian Deer do the investigative work to expose Andrew Wakefield's MMR-autism data manipulation?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@JATetro: @BoraZ To be honest, there are some very good journalists out there who can spot misconduct but without backing from a source, it's liable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: @BoraZ: @JATetro yes, they need scientists to do the actual investigating, then report on what scientists discovered - fraud, plagiarism etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@JATetro: @BoraZ So it's not the journalists fault, really. They do their job as well as possible but without our help, there's little they can do.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LabSpaces: @JATetro @BoraZ Actual scientists cost too much.They're a luxury, and especially in these times, it's hard for pubs. to justify having 1&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@JATetro: @LabSpaces @BoraZ Apparently it's hard for universities to have them as well...not a prof or anything but damn it's ridiculous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LabSpaces: @JATetro @BoraZ I dunno, our PR dept. does a great job interacting with scientists and getting the right info out, but I guess that's diff.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@JATetro: @LabSpaces @BoraZ Oh, the media people at the U are great. It's the administrators that seem to forget who keep the students comin'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: Isn't investigating nature, via experimentation, and publishing the findings in a journal = scientific investigative reporting?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LeeBillings: @BoraZ 1/2 I'd say that's performing peer-reviewed scientific research, not doing investigative science journalism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LeeBillings: @BoraZ 2/2 No room to address your ?-torrent. What are you driving at, anyway? You think sci journos can't/don't do investigative stuff?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LouiseJJohnson: RT @BoraZ Isn&amp;#39;t investigating nature, via experimentation, &amp;amp; publishing findings in a journal, scientific investigative reporting? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@mcmoots: @BoraZ "Journalism" usually means you report the results of your investigations to the public; scientists report to a technical community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: @BoraZ: @mcmoots does the size and expertise of audience determine what is journalism, what is not? Is it changing these days?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: @BoraZ: Why is investigating words called 'investigative journalism', but investigating reality, with much more rigorous methods, is not?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LeeBillings: @BoraZ 1 more thing: A press release isn't a story--it should inspire journos to look deeper. Sometimes that deeper look reveals PR to be BS&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: @BoraZ: @LeeBillings Journal article is reporting findings of investigation. Press release is 2ndary. Journo article is 3tiary. Each diff audience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LeeBillings: @BoraZ Glad you raised ? of audience, since relevant to yr ? of &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;reality.&amp;quot; Words make reality for audiences, some more than others&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: @BoraZ: Journos investigate people, parse words. Scientists investigate nature. What is more worthy?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@lippard: @BoraZ I would say that there are instances of investigative journalism that have had more value than some instances of scientific research.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: @BoraZ: @lippard possible, but that is investigating the rare instances of misconduct by people, not investigating the natural reality. Science?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@john_s_wilkins: @BoraZ You're asking this of a profession that thinks it needs to "give the other side" when reporting on science, i.e., quacks&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LeeBillings: @BoraZ Twitter is useful tool, but probably not best way to interview for the story you seem to be after, as responses lack depth and nuance&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@LeeBillings: @BoraZ Still looking forward to reading your resulting story, of course&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Me: @BoraZ: @LeeBillings you can add longer responses on FriendFeed: http://friendfeed.com/coturnix that's what it's for  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@1seahorse1: @BoraZ Do you mean that I have to be nostalgic about my ape tribe and life in caves ? :-)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@TyeArnett: @BoraZ parsing data can be as dangerous as parsing words sometimes&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@ccziv: @BoraZ Do not underestimate or devalue the importance of words, ever.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that different people have very different ideas what 'investigative reporting' is and have even more difficulty figuring out how that applies to science!  Let's go nice and slow now, explore this a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I think that what Dave meant in his first tweet - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@davemunger: @BoraZ To me, it means going beyond looking at a single study to really understand a scientific concept. Diff from traditional "inv. journo"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- is not 'investigative reporting' but 'news analysis' (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/defining_the_journalism_vs_blo.php" title=""&gt;again, see my attempt at classification&lt;/a&gt;), something akin to 'explainers' done occasionally by the mainstream media (think of This American Life on NPR and their '&lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355" title=""&gt;Giant Pool of Money&lt;/a&gt;' explainer for a great recent example). It is an equivalent of a Review Article in a scientific journal, but aimed at a broader audience and not assuming existing background knowledge and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The different worlds of journalists and scientists&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion, as well as many similar discussions we had in the past, uncovers some interesting differences between the way journalists and scientists think about 'investigative' in the context of reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists, when investigating, investigate &lt;b&gt;people&lt;/b&gt;, almost exclusively. Scientists are much more open to including other things under this rubric, as they are interested in investigating the &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists focus almost entirely on &lt;b&gt;words&lt;/b&gt;, i.e., what people say. In other words, they are interested mainly on the &lt;b&gt;process&lt;/b&gt; and what the words reveal as to who is winning and who is losing in some imaginary (or sometimes real) game. Scientists are interested in &lt;b&gt;results&lt;/b&gt; of the process, obtained by any means, only one of which is through people's utterances - they are interested in investigating and uncovering the &lt;b&gt;facts&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists display an inordinate amount of &lt;b&gt;skepticism&lt;/b&gt; - even deep cynicism - about anyone's honesty. Everyone's a liar unless proven not to be. Scientists, knowing themselves, knowing their colleagues, knowing the culture of science where 100% honesty and trust are the key, knowing that exposure of even the tiniest dishonesty is likely The End of a scientific career, tend to &lt;b&gt;trust&lt;/b&gt; scientists a great deal more. On the other hand, scientists are deeply suspicious of people who do not abide by high standards of the scientific community, and The List of those who, due to track record, should be mistrusted the most is topped by - journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explains why scientists generally see Futurity.org as an interesting method of providing scientific information to the public, assuming &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt;, knowing the track record of these institutions and what kind of reputation is at stake, that most or all of it will be reliable, while a journalist exclaims "propaganda".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Question of Trust&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this light, it is very instructive to read &lt;a href="http://christineottery.blogspot.com/2009/09/which-scientists-can-you-trust.html" title=""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by a young science journalist, and the subsequent &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/coturnix/2d832f95/which-scientists-can-you-trust-by" title=""&gt;FriendFeed discussion&lt;/a&gt; of it. It is difficult for people outside of science to understand who is "inside" and thus to be trusted and who is not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those on the "inside", the scientists, are already swimming in these waters and know instantly who is to be trusted and who not. Scientists know that Lynn Margolis was outside (untrusted) at first, inside (trusted) later and outside (untrusted) today again. Scientists know that James Lovelock or Deepak Chopra or Rupert Shaldrake are outside, always were and always will be, and are not to be trusted. Journalists can figure this out by asking, but then they need to figure out whose answer to trust! Who is inside and trusted to say who else is inside and trusted? If your first point of entry is the wrong person, all the "sources" you interview will be wackos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the mistrust by journalists is often 'schematic' - not based on experience or on investigating the actual facts. They have a schema in their minds as to who is likely to lie, who is likely to use weaselly language, who can generally be trusted, etc. They use this rule-of-thumb when interviewing criminals, corrupt cops ("liars"), politicians, lawyers, CEOs ("weaselly words"), other journalists ("trustworthy") and yes, scientists ("suspicious pointy-heads with hard-to-uncover financial motives"). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automatic use of such "rule" is why so many D.C. reporters (so-called Village) did not understand (and some still do not understand) that someone who is supposed to be in the "use weaselly language" column - the politicians - should actually have been in the "lying whenever they open their mouths" column for eight years of the Bush rule (or, to be fair, the last 30 years). It did not occur to them to fact-check what Republicans said and hastily move them to the appropriate "chronic liars" category and report appropriately. They could not fathom that someone like The President would actually straight-out lie. Every sentence. Every day. Nobody likes being shown to be naive, but nobody likes being lied to either. Their need for &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/search?q=church+of+the+savvy&amp;amp;from=jayrosen" title=""&gt;appearance of savviness&lt;/a&gt; (the opposite of naive), for many of them, over-rode the need to reveal they've been lied to and fell for it ("What are you saying? Can't be possible. They are such nice guys when they pat my back at a cocktail party over in The Old Boys Club Cafe - they wouldn't lie to &lt;b&gt;me&lt;/b&gt;!"). And many in their audience are in the same mindset - finding it impossible (as that takes courage and humility) to admit to themselves that they were so naive they fell for such lies from such high places (both the ruling party and their &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/09/25/brooks/" title=""&gt;loyal stenographers&lt;/a&gt;). And we all suffered because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heavy reliance on such rules or mental schemas by journalists is often due to their self-awareness about the lack of knowledge and expertise on the topic they are covering. They just don't know who to trust, because they are not capable of uncovering the underlying facts and thus figure out for themselves who is telling the truth and who is lying (not to mention that this would require, gasp, work instead of hanging out at cocktail parties). To cover up the ignorance and make it difficult for it to be revealed by the audience, they strongly resist the calls to provide &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/ethic_of_the_link.php" title=""&gt;the links&lt;/a&gt; to more information and especially to their &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/the_ethics_of_the_quote.php" title=""&gt;source documents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2009/04/12/hesaid_shesaid.html" title=""&gt;He Said She Said&lt;/a&gt; journalism is a great way for them to a) focus on words, people, process and 'horse-race' instead of facts, b) hide their ignorance of the underlying facts, c) show their savvy by "making both side angry" which, in some sick twist, they think means they are doing a good job (no, that means all readers saw through you and are disgusted by your unprofessionalism). Nowhere does that show as clearly as when they cover science. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A more systematic investigation into 'investigation'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I raised everyone's ire, let me calm down again and try to use this blog post the way bloggers often do - as a way to clarify thoughts through writing. I am no expert on this topic, but I am interested, I read a lot about it, blog about it a lot, and want to hear the responses in the comments. Let me try to systematize what I think 'investigative reporting' is in general and then apply that to three specific cases: 1) a scientist investigating nature and reporting about it in a journal, 2) a journalist investigating scientists and their work and reporting about it in a media outlet, and 3) a science blogger investigating the first two and reporting how good or bad job each one of them did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/defining_the_journalism_vs_blo.php" title=""&gt;defined 'investigative journalism'&lt;/a&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Investigative reporting is uncovering data and information that does not want to be uncovered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see how that works in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steps in Investigative Reporting:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Someone gets a hunch, wiff, a tip from someone or an intuition (or orders from the boss to take a look) that some information exists that is hidden from the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) That someone then uses a whole suit of methods to discover that secret information, often against the agents that resist the idea of that information becoming available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) That someone then puts all of the gathered information in one place and looks for patterns, overarching themes, connections and figures out what it all means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) That someone then writes an article, with a specific audience in mind, showing to the public the previously secret information (often including all of it - the entire raw data sets or documents or transcripts) and explaining what it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) That someone then sends the article to the proper venue where it undergoes an editorial process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) If accepted for publication, the article gets published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) The article gets a life of its own - people read (or listen/view) it, comment, give feedback, or follow up with investigation digging up more information that is still not public (so the cycle repeats).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case I: Scientist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1) Someone gets a hunch, wiff, a tip from someone or an intuition (or orders from the boss to take a look) that some information exists that is hidden from the public.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keeper of the secret information is Nature herself. The researcher can get a hunch about the existence of hidden information in several different ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- delving deep into the literature, it becomes apparent that there are holes - missing information that nobody reported on yet, suggesting that nobody uncovered it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- doing research and getting unexpected results points one to the fact that there is missing information needed to explain those funky results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- going out into nature and observing something that, upon digging through the literature, one finds has not been explained yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- getting a photocopy of descriptions of three experiments from the last grant proposal from your PI with the message "Do this". Great method for introducing high school and undergraduate students into research, and perhaps to get a brand new Masters student started (of course, regular discussions of the progress are needed). Unfortunately, some PIs continue doing this to their PhD students and even postdocs, instead of giving them freedom of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;2) That someone then uses a whole suit of methods to discover that secret information, often against the agents that resist the idea of that information becoming available to the public.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/11/biology_and_the_scientific_met.php" title=""&gt;scientific method&lt;/a&gt; includes a variety of methods for wresting secret information out of Nature: observations, experiments, brute-force Big Science, natural experiments, statistics, mathematical modeling, etc. It is not easy to get this information from Nature as she resists. One has to be creative and innovative in designing tricks to get reliable data from her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;3) That someone then puts all of the gathered information in one place and looks for patterns, overarching themes, connections and figures out what it all means.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the collected data from a series of observations/experiments are put together, statistically analyzed, visualized (which sometimes leads to additional statistical analyses as visualization may point out phenomena not readily gleaned from raw numbers) and a common theme emerges (if it doesn't - more work needs to be done).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;4) That someone then writes an article, with a specific audience in mind, showing to the public the previously secret information (often including all of it - the entire raw data sets or documents or transcripts) and explaining what it means.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three potential audiences for the findings of the research: experts in one's field, other scientists, and lay audience (which may include policy-makers or political-action organizations, or journalists, or teachers, or physicians, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts in one's field are the most important audience for most of research. The proper venue to publish for this audience is a scientific journal of a narrow scope (usually a society journal) that is read by all the experts in the same field. The article can be dense, using the technical lingo, containing all the information needed for replication and further testing of the information and should, in principle, &lt;a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2009/09/21/show-us-the-data-now-damnit-excuses-are-running-out/" title=""&gt;contain all the raw data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific community as a whole as the target audience is somewhat baffling - on one hand, some of them are also experts in the field, on the other hand, all the rest are essentially lay audience. It is neither-nor. Why target scientific community as an audience then? Because the venue for this are GlamourMagz and publishing in these is good for one's career and fame. The format in which such papers are written is great for scientists in non-related disciplines - it &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/commonknowledge/2009/09/this_post_was_prompted_by.php" title=""&gt;tells a story&lt;/a&gt;, but it is extremely frustrating for same-field researchers as there is not sufficient detail (or data) to replicate, re-test or follow-up on the described research. Publishing this way makes you known to a lot more scientists, but tends to alienate your closests colleagues who are frustrated by the lack of information in your report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lay audience is an important audience for some types of research - ones that impact people's personal decisions about their health or about taking care of the environment, ones that can have impact on policy, ones that are useful to know by health care providers or science educators, or ones that are so cool (e.g., new fossils of dinosaurs or, erm...Ida) that they will excite the public about science. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/07/scientists_are_excellent_commu.php" title=""&gt;scientists are excellent and exciting communicators&lt;/a&gt; and can speak directly to the audience (online on blogs/podcasts/videos or offline in public lectures or science cafes), or will gladly accept to do interviews (TV, radio, newspapers, magazines) about their findings. Those researchers who know they are not exciting communicators, or do not like to be in public, or are too busy, or have been burned by the previous interactions with the media, tend to leave the communication to lay audience to professionals - the press officers at their institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we have all screamed every now and then at some blatantly bad press releases (especially the titles imposed by the editors), there has been generally a steady, gradual improvement in their quality over the years. One of the possible explanations for this is that scientists that fall out of the pipeline as there are now so many PhDs and so few academic jobs, have started replacing English majors and j-school majors in these positions. More and more institutions now have science-trained press officers who actually understand what they are writing about. Thus, there is less hype yet more and better explanation of the results of scientific investigation. Of course, they tend to be excellent writers as well, a talent that comes with love and practice and does not necessitate a degree in English or Communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;5) That someone then sends the article to the proper venue where it undergoes an editorial process.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first draft of the article is usually co-written and co-edited by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/11/on_my_last_scientific_paper_i.php" title=""&gt;a number of co-authors&lt;/a&gt; who "peer-review" each other during the process. That draft is then (2nd peer-review) usually given to other lab-members, collaborators, friends and colleagues to elicit their opinion. Their feedback is incorporated into the improved draft which is then sent to the appropriate scientific journal where the editor sends the manuscript to anywhere between one and several experts in the field, usually kept anonymous, for the 3rd (and "official") peer-review. This may then go through two or three cycles before the reviewers are satisfied with the edits and changes and recommend to the editor that the paper be published (or not, in which case the whole process gets repeated at lesser and lesser and lesser journals...until the paper is either finally published or abandoned or self-published on a website).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;6) If accepted for publication, the article gets published.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Champaign time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, next morning, back to the lab - trying to uncover more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;7) The article gets a life of its own - people read (or listen/view) it, comment, give feedback, or follow up with investigation digging up more information that is still not public (so the cycle repeats).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Nature closely guarded her secrets for billions of years, and after intrepid investigators snatched the secret information from her over weeks, months, years or decades of hard and creative work, the information is finally made public. The publication date is the date of birth for that information, the moment when its life begins. Nobody can predict what kind of life it will have at that point. It takes years to watch it grow and develop and mature and spawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/article-level_metrics_at_plos_1.php" title=""&gt;download it and read it&lt;/a&gt;, think about it, talk about it, &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/category/functionality/" title=""&gt;interact with it&lt;/a&gt;, blog about it and, most importantly, try to replicate, re-test and follow up on the information in order to uncover even more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that is not 'investigative reporting' at its best, I don't know what is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case II: Science Journalist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1) Someone gets a hunch, wiff, a tip from someone or an intuition (or orders from the boss to take a look) that some information exists that is hidden from the public.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hidden information, in this case, is most likely to be man-made information - documents, human actions, human words. It is especially deemed worthy of investigation if some wrong-doing is suspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;2) That someone then uses a whole suit of methods to discover that secret information, often against the agents that resist the idea of that information becoming available to the public.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the journalist cannot "go direct" and investigate nature directly (not having the relevant training, expertise, infrastructure, funding, manpower, equipment, etc.), the only remaining method is to investigate indirectly. The usual indirect method for journalists is to ask people - a very, very, very unreliable way of getting information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since investigating the facts about nature is outside the scope of expertise of journalists, they usually investigate the behavior and conduct of scientists. This is "investigative meta-science reporting". In a sense, there is not much difference between investigating potential misconduct of scientists and misconduct of any other group of people. The main difference is that the business of science is facts about the way the world works, thus knowing who got the facts right and who got the facts wrong is important and who misrepresents lies as facts is even more important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to lack of scientific expertise, journalists find this kind of investigation very difficult - they have to rely on the statements of scientists as to the veracity of other scientists' facts or claims - something they are not in position to verify directly. If they ask the wrong person - a quack, for example - they will follow all the wrong leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the usual fall-back is HeSaidSheSaid model of journalism, reporting who said what, not committing to any side, not evaluating truth-claims of any side, and hoping that (also science-uneducated) audience will be able to figure it out for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since they cannot evaluate the truth-claims about Nature that scientists make, journalists have to use proxy mechanisms to uncover misconduct, e.g., discover other unseemly behaviors by the same actors, unrelated to the research itself. Thus discovering instances of lying, or financial ties, is the only way a journalist can start guessing as to who can be trusted, and then hope that the person who lies about his/her finances is also lying about facts about Nature - a correlation that is hard to prove and is actually quite unlikely except in rare instances of industry/lobby scientists-for-hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual research misconduct - fudging data, plagiarism, etc - can be uncovered only by other scientists. And they do it whenever they suspect it, and they report the findings in various ways. The traditional method of sending a letter to the editor of the journal that published the suspect paper is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/not-so-self-correcting_science.php" title=""&gt;so ridiculously difficult&lt;/a&gt; that many are now pursuing other venues, be it by notifying a journalist, or going direct, on a blog, or, if the journal is enlightened (COI - see my Profile), by posting comments on the paper itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;3) That someone then puts all of the gathered information in one place and looks for patterns, overarching themes, connections and figures out what it all means.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all the information is gathered in one place, any intelligent person can find patterns. Scientific expertise is not usually necessary for this step. Thus, once the journalists manages to gather all the information (the hard part), he/she is perfectly capable of figuring out the story (the easy part).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;4) That someone then writes an article, with a specific audience in mind, showing to the public the previously secret information (often including all of it - the entire raw data sets or documents or transcripts) and explaining what it means.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalist advantage - they tend to be good with language and writing a gripping story. If the underlying information is correct, and the conclusions are clear, and the journalist is not afraid to state clearly who is telling the truth and who is lying, the article should be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;5) That someone then sends the article to the proper venue where it undergoes an editorial process.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The editor who comes up with titles usually screws up this step. Otherwise, especially if nobody cuts out important parts due to length limits, the article should be fine. Hopefully, the venue targets the relevant audience - either experts (who can then police their own) or general public (who can elicit pressure on powers-that-be).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;6) If accepted for publication, the article gets published.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadline for the next story looms. Back to the grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;7) The article gets a life of its own - people read (or listen/view) it, comment, give feedback, or follow up with investigation digging up more information that is still not public (so the cycle repeats).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the information is public, people can spread it around (e-mailing to each other, linking to it on their blogs, social networks, etc.). They bring in their own knowledge and expertise and provide feedback in various venues and some are motivated to follow up and dig deeper, perhaps uncovering more information (so the cycle repeats).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of science journalism is, thus, not investigative journalism. Most of it is simple reporting of the findings, i.e., second-hand reporting of the investigative reporting done by scientists (Case I). Or, as science reporters are made so busy by their editors, forced to write story after story in rapid succession, stories about many different areas of science, most science reporting in the media is actually third-hand reporting: first-hand was by scientists in journals, second-hand was by press officers of the institutions, and the journalist mainly regurgitates the press releases. As in every game of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers" title=""&gt;Broken Telephones/Chinese Whispers&lt;/a&gt; , the first reporter is more reliable then the second one in line who is more dependable than the third one and so on. Thus a scientist "going direct" is likely to give a much more reliable account of the findings than the journalist reporting on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/why_good_science_journalists_a.php" title=""&gt;There are exceptions, of course&lt;/a&gt;. Each discussion of science journalism always brings out commenters who shout the names of well-known and highly respectes science journalists. The thing is, those people are not science reporters. They are science journalists only in the sense that 'Science Writers' is a subset of the set 'Science Journalists'. This is a subset that is very much in a privileged position - they are given freedom to write what, when, where and how they want. Thus, over many years, they develop their own expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl Zimmer has, over the years, read so many papers, talked to so many experts, and written so many books, articles and blogposts, that he probably knows more about evolution, parasites and E.coli than biology PhDs whose focus is on other areas of biology. Eric Roston probably knows more about carbon than many chemistry PhDs. These guys are experts. And they are writers, not reporters. They do not get assignments to write many stories per week on different areas of science. They are not who I am talking about in this post at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do they do investigative reporting? Sometimes they do, but they chose other venues for it. When George Will lied about climate change data in a couple of op-eds, Carl Zimmer used his blog, not the NYTimes Science section, to dig and expose the facts about the industry and political influences, about George Will's history on the issue, about cowardly response by Washington Post to the uncovering of these unpleasant facts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Skloot did investigative journalism as well, over many years, and decided to publish the findings in a form of a book, not in a newspaper or magazine. That is not the work of a beat reporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case III: Science Blogger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1) Someone gets a hunch, wiff, a tip from someone or an intuition (or orders from the boss to take a look) that some information exists that is hidden from the public.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggers are often looking for blogging materials from two distinctly different sources: the Tables of Content of scientific journals in the fields they have expertise in, and services that serve press releases (e.g., EurekAlert, ScienceDaily, etc.). They are also usually quite attuned to the mass media, i.e., they get their news online from many sources instead of reading just the local paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What many bloggers do and are especially good at doing is comparing the work of Case I and Case II investigative reporters. They can access and read and understand the scientific paper and directly compare it to the press releases and the media coverage (including the writings by other bloggers). Having the needed scientific expertise, they can evaluate all the sources and make a judgment on their quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the research in the paper is shoddy but the media does not realize it and presents it as trustworthy. Sometimes the paper is good, but the media gets it wrong (usually in a sensationalist kind of way). Sometimes both the paper and the media get it right (which is not very exciting to blog about).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;2) That someone then uses a whole suit of methods to discover that secret information, often against the agents that resist the idea of that information becoming available to the public.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replicating experiments and putting that on the blog is rare (but &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/not-so-self-correcting_science.php" title=""&gt;has been done&lt;/a&gt;). But digging through the published data and comparing that to media reports is easy when one has the necessary expertise. Consulting with colleagues, on the rare occasions when needed, is usually done privately via e-mail or publicly on places like FriendFeed or Twitter, and there is no need to include quotes in the blog post itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggers have done investigative digging in a journalistic sense as well - uncovering unseemly behavior of people. I have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/defining_the_journalism_vs_blo.php" title=""&gt;gathered a few examples&lt;/a&gt; of investigative reporting by science bloggers before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whose investigative reporting led to resignation of Deutch, the Bush's NASA censor? &lt;a href="http://scientificactivist.blogspot.com/2006/02/nasa-science-censor-resigns.html" title=""&gt;Nick Anthis&lt;/a&gt;, a (then) small blogger (who also later reported on the Animal Rights demonstrations and counter-demonstrations in Oxford in great detail as well).

&lt;p&gt;Who blew up the case of plagiarism in dinosaur palaenthology, the so-calles Aetogate? &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=pub-5976931228913298&amp;amp;cof=FORID%3A13%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%3BCX%3AScienceBlogs%252Ecom%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fchannel%2Fimg%2Flogo_science-blogs.gif%3BLH%3A66%3BLP%3A1%3BVLC%3A%23551a8b%3BGFNT%3A%23666666%3BDIV%3A%23cccccc%3B&amp;amp;adkw=AELymgUEzy1KrQ0DW6j5c_BfJ7ch69HiCoAqJLKfqYtZWXRBJsLeGQvXiSDkQNW-ennKi1OuW7xxrhYTmMqvDSNhed39eAkOZqliTAxit19doCXd-fWXAFhqwBz6BT5U8jkbVDzQ2JrzOg17kGyhxBYLqeaqE09S5z9ACEVV7tJ8HoaN96V8DQTx8VreQ0N7jzrd3MHHOkidMKSnupludH29WFTXlvRCFw&amp;amp;boostcse=0&amp;amp;num=100&amp;amp;newwindow=1&amp;amp;q=aetogate&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0" title=""&gt;A bunch of bloggers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who blew up, skewered and castrated the PRISM, the astroturf organization designed to lobby the Senate against the NIH Open Access bill? A &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/08/this_prism_does_not_turn_white.php" title=""&gt;bunch of bloggers&lt;/a&gt;. The bill passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/tripoli_6/" title=""&gt;Tripoli 6&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who pounced on George Will and WaPo when he trotted out the long-debunked lie about global warming? And forced them to squirm, and respond, and publish two counter-editorials? A &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2009/02/the_buzz_facts_as_cold_and_har.php" title=""&gt;bunch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/category/the-george-will-on-ice-affair/" title=""&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who dug up all the information, including the most incriminating key evidence against Creationists that was used at the Dover trial? A &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/" title=""&gt;bunch of bloggers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on, and so on, this was just scratching the surface with the most famous stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;3) That someone then puts all of the gathered information in one place and looks for patterns, overarching themes, connections and figures out what it all means.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is often a collective effort of multiple bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;4) That someone then writes an article, with a specific audience in mind, showing to the public the previously secret information (often including all of it - the entire raw data sets or documents or transcripts) and explaining what it means.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The target audience of most science blogs is lay audience, but many of the readers are themselves scientists as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;5) That someone then sends the article to the proper venue where it undergoes an editorial process.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most blogs are self-edited. Sending a particularly 'hot' blog post to a couple of other bloggers asking their opinion before it is posted is something that a blogger may occasionally do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;6) If accepted for publication, the article gets published.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click "Post". That easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;7) The article gets a life of its own - people read (or listen/view) it, comment, give feedback, or follow up with investigation digging up more information that is still not public (so the cycle repeats).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback in comments usually comes in really fast! It is direct, straightforward and does not follow the usual &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/12/the_shock_value_of_science_blo.php" title=""&gt;formal kabuki dance&lt;/a&gt; that ensures the control and hierarchy remains intact in more official venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other bloggers may respond on their own blogs (especially if they disagree) or spread the link on social networks (especially if they agree).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If many bloggers raise hell about some misconduct and persist in it over a prolonged periods of time, this sometimes forces the corporate media to pick up the hot-potato story despite the initial reluctance to do so. But this applies to all investigative reporting on blogs, not just science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, bloggers are not bound by 20th century journalistic rules - thus the exposure by impersonation, what the conservative activists did to ACORN, is perfectly &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/opinion/27pubed.html?_r=1" title=""&gt;legitimate way&lt;/a&gt; of uncovering dirt in informal venues, but not legit in corporate venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more point that needs to be made here. Different areas of science are different!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biomedical science is a special case. It is huge. It has huge funding compared to other areas, yet not sufficient to feed the armies of researchers involved in it. It attracts the self-aggrandizing type disproportionately. Much is at stake: patents, contracts with pharmaceutical industry, money, fame, Nobel prizes... Thus it is extremely competitive. It also uses laboratory techniques that are universal and fast, thus it is easy to scoop and get scooped, which fosters the culture of secrecy. It suffers from CNS disease (necessity to publish in GlamourMagz like Cell, Nature and Science). It gets inordinate proportion of media (and blog) attention due to relevance to human health. All those pressures make the motivation to fudge data too strong for some of the people involved - very few, for sure, out of 10,000s involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum is, for example, palaeontology. Very few people can be palaeontologists - not enough positions and not enough money. There is near-zero risk of getting scooped as everyone knows who dug what out, where, during which digging season (Aetogate, linked above, was a special case of a person using a position of power to mainly scoop powerless students). Your fossil is yours.  The resources are extremely limited and so much depends on luck. Discovering a cool fossil is not easy and if you get your hands on one, you have to milk it for all it's worth. You will publish not one but a series of papers. First paper is a brief announcement of the finding with a superficial description, the second is a detailed description, the third is the phylogenetic analysis, the fourth focuses on one part of the fossil that can say something new about evolution, etc. And you hope that all of this will become well-known to the general public. The palaeo community is so small, they all already know. They will quibble forever with you over the methodology and conclusions (so many assumptions have to go into methods that analyze old, broken bones). It is the lay audience that needs to be reached, by any means necessary. Many paleontologists don't even work as university professors but are associated with museums, nature magazines, or are freelancing. The pressure to publish in GlamourMagz is there only as a means to get the attention of the media, not to impress colleagues or rise in careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of science and most scientists, on the other hand, do not belong to one of these two fields and do not work at high-pressure universities. They do science out of their own curiosity, feel no pressure to publish a lot or in GlamourMagz, do not fear scooping, are open and relaxed and have no motivation to fudge data or plagiarize. They know that the reputation with their peers - the only reputation they can hope to get - is dependent entirely on immaculate work and behavior. Why keep them suspect because two media-prominent sub-sub-disciplines sometimes produce less-than-honest behavior? Why not trust that their papers are good, their press releases correct, their blogging honest, and their personal behavior impeccable? I'd say they are presumed innocent unless proven guilty, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see an equivalent of Futurity.org for state universities and small colleges. What a delightful source of cool science that would be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; blogging at its best. After a couple of hit-and-run curmudgeounly comments posted early on, this post started receiving some very thoughtful and useful comments (e.g., especially one by David Dobbs) that are edifying and are helping me learn - which is the point of blogging in the first place, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/what_is_investigative_science.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/aqcyDm0kMK8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254085392144"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/?p=1887">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a28a0bc7d3e47367</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Tattoo Emporium"/><title type="html">CMP For Short [Science Tattoo]</title><published>2009-09-27T20:26:20Z</published><updated>2009-09-27T20:26:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/09/27/cmp-for-short-science-tattoo/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="serotonin-cmp-crop-440" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/09/serotonin-cmp-crop-4401.jpg" alt="serotonin-cmp-crop-440" width="440" height="259"&gt;Chrissy writes, “My science is microbiology, and my tattoo is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomipramine"&gt;CMP&lt;/a&gt;, which happen to be my initials.”&lt;/p&gt;

Once the prospect is raised – or even merely feared – of a libel claim, the contribution to a debate will probably not take place. As a consequence, the output of that debate will be less useful and less efficient. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Public debate is debased; the terms of the debate are counterfeit and - indeed - bogus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mere existence of the English law of libel has a negative effect. This is called the chilling effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the right to protect reputation should not be absolute. And indeed it is not in many areas: the defence of "qualified privilege" has expanded over the years to cover many situations where there is a public interest, regardless of whether the damaging statement can be "justified" or be deemed "fair comment".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Areas of qualified privilege include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- reports to the police;&lt;br&gt;- reports to social services;&lt;br&gt;- complaints at work;&lt;br&gt;- regulatory communications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In these areas, an aggrieved potential claimant can only bring a case if malice can be shown - and the onus is on the claimant to show this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is in areas where there is no qualified privilege where there is the most severe "libel chill" - the chill caused of course because a libel action can be brought without proof of loss and the burden of proof is on a defendant to show justification or fair comment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where there is qualified privilege there is little or no libel chill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historically, qualified privilege often arose when there was a "common interest" between the person making a statement and the person receiving the statement. Other areas of qualified privilege were introduced by statute, for example covering certain official publications and reports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my view, each development of qualified privilege has been a response by the Courts or by Parliament to some new idiocy thrown up by the law of libel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1999 the House of Lords departed from the narrow basis of qualified privilege where there had to be a close proximity between the maker of a statement to its reader and, in &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd991028/rey01.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reynolds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, extended its protection to investigative journalists writing for the public as a whole, as long as certain demanding requirements were met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In practice the &lt;em&gt;Reynolds defence&lt;/em&gt; has been difficult to deploy by newspapers, as it takes arguably an unrealistic view of investigative journalism: for example, putting the statements to the subject before publication merely leads to a protective injunction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, the principle remains - there are certain publications &lt;em&gt;to the world &lt;/em&gt;which should be protected, without needing to show justification or fair comment, because the public interest in their publication outweighs the private interest in a reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps there should be a general public interest basis for qualified privilege for general publications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, that may be too ambitious request. I would settle for there being qualified privilege in respect of matters of public safety and public health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This would have protected the fine journalists who sought to expose the&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/16/trafigura-oil-ivory-coast"&gt; 2006 Trafilga oil scandal&lt;/a&gt; as well as Simon Singh's critique of chiropractic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a clear public interest in statements being published to the general public which regard public safety and public health; so clear a public interest that it is difficult to conceive of a better example. If the statements are malicious, then the claimant can still sue; if the statements are merely incorrect or unfair then the claimant can still point this out - I would accept a statutory right of reply or a duty to make an appropriate correction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But reputation should not be the primary issue in debates about public health and public safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some things are just more important.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so my practical proposal for libel reform is for Parliament to enact - either in a new Act or as an amendment to existing legislation - for a publisher of a statement concerning public health or public safety to have the automatic benefit of qualified privilege.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This could perhaps be called the "Simon Singh Amendment".)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And then only the malicious will feel libel chill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-6488428398234255741?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254083912725"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/fahrenheit_454_not_fiction.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e6576d87865de9c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Republicans"/><title type="html">Fahrenheit 451 not fiction</title><published>2009-09-27T20:00:27Z</published><updated>2009-09-27T20:00:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/9JOSQSbC3eg/fahrenheit_454_not_fiction.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/fahrenheit_454_not_fiction.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/2009/09/the-day-the-right-wing-lost-its-last-shred-of-moral-standing/"&gt;You think this was bad?&lt;/a&gt;  It gets worse.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is my “coming out” album. I’ve been living with a secret for quite a while. It’s something that most of my friends know about me but I’ve never divulged it in public. Although at least 10 percent of the U.S. population openly admits to being part of this group, there is tremendous pressure not to be vocal about it. And it’s a political third rail. You will almost never hear a politician admit to being one. But I’m tired of dodging the issue and feel I do a disservice to all of those who are not afraid to be outspoken about who they are. It’s time to stand and be counted. The truth is that I’m an … &lt;em&gt;atheist&lt;/em&gt;. There, I said it. I guess I’ve known that I was one since I was a little kid. I experimented with theism in high school. Who didn’t? But I’d have to get drunk and kind of force myself. And I’d always feel “wrong” afterwards. And then I’d feel guilty for feeling “wrong.” It was a dysfunctional way to live. Then I moved to Greenwich Village. And all around me were these other atheists. Just doing their thing. It all felt very natural. And I’ve never looked back. Wait, what was the question again?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always nice to hear someone — &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; — come out publicly as an atheist.  It makes it all the more acceptable for the next person to do it, too, as Allison himself experienced in Greenwich Village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to him for doing it in such a public way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Ben&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

If you just read Wright, you&amp;#39;ll have to agree — Coyne does say things that are directly contradicted by the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then you miss the point. &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/correspondence-defending-the-evolution-god?page=0,1"&gt;Coyne has a short reply in TNR&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/09/18/response-to-wright/"&gt;longer reply on his blog&lt;/a&gt; where he quotes Wright several times saying exactly what Wright says he didn't say. Wright's true name seems to be Legion, and he contains multitudes. One of the problems with his book is that it hares off in all kinds of directions, and you can find pieces that say one thing, and others that say something very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a lot like the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to fans of Wright: that's not a compliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there's more! The few comments are from Wright fans whose response is to demand that &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;the Editors … step in on this one and review the original essay by Jerry Coyne. The author provides some strong evidence that his book was either misunderstood or not actually read by the reviewer.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Quite the contrary. The evidence shows to me that the reviewer seems to have read the book more carefully and perceptively than the author.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/an_amusing_back-and-forth.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/hBr938h1X0Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254081524018"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9546">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0484892e5c732acb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: The Scent of a Skeptic</title><published>2009-09-27T19:00:45Z</published><updated>2009-09-27T19:00:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/ai-the-scent-of-a-skeptic/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5fbe618e00e7572fe179f8952e0d6d2a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in a department store a few months ago when I could suddenly smell my mother. She wasn’t there, and it must have been a perfume she once wore. I tried to follow the scent throughout the store, walking around and sniffing like a coke head, but then it was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could only detect vanilla in the scent. It recalled to me an otherwise unmemorable moment in the 80s when I was walking beside my mum, and I felt a moment of happiness and calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a comforting scent to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Loudon's a singer/songwriter who's been around for even longer, and who I like even better than Rufus.  His song &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3gwASqR3gE&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;Father and Son&lt;/a&gt; was written for Rufus, but I think the Peter Blegvad song &lt;a href="http://www.moron.nl/lyrics.php?id=117133&amp;amp;artist=Peter%20Blegvad"&gt;Daughter&lt;/a&gt; that he performs here is more appropriate for today.

&lt;p&gt;Why?  Because I just learned about the &lt;a href="http://www.asgarda.org.ua/Special-features-of-martial-art-for-women.html"&gt;Asgarda&lt;/a&gt; women of the Ukraine, via &lt;a href="http://www.planet-mag.com/blog/2009/art/jenna-martin/asgarda/#http://www.planet-mag.com/blog/2009/art/jenna-martin/asgarda/"&gt;Planet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bust.com/blog/2009/09/24/amazon-glory.html#more-3504"&gt;Bust&lt;/a&gt; magazines.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/weekend_diversion_an_amazing_g/asgarda_cover.jpg" width="400" height="442" alt="asgarda_cover.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take so many things for granted in this country that I don't often think about having to fight for my very basic freedoms, such as the freedom not to be sold into a slave trade.  But in many countries, people (especially women) don't have that freedom.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is why I'm happy to share with you what I learned about the Asgarda.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/weekend_diversion_an_amazing_g/page53.jpg" width="500" alt="page53.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Ukraine, women are often victims of exploitation and sexual trafficking.  And since Stalin, women in the entire former Soviet Union were decidedly second-class citizens (and still are treated as such in many places).  One movement that's gaining momentum against this sort of thing (and against oppression in general) is the female-only tribe, &lt;i&gt;Asgarda&lt;/i&gt;, that's growing in the Carpathian Mountains.  The legend that inspired them?  From their website:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is said that Ukrainian women were always most beautiful, merry, good-natured, talented, and generous, as well as courageous, selfless, faithful, and wise. Foreign historians were amazed at the span of knowledge of our women. They could read, write, they had equal rights with men, they were respected, and their advice was taken.
&lt;br&gt;
In Ukraine a woman was always a guardian, protector, and priestess. She had the knowledge of medicine, treatment of illnesses, medicinal herbs, and laws of nature, universe, and religion. She was able to sing, dance, play musical instruments, and write poetry and songs. She knew astronomy and astrology... Everything she did, she did with goodness and love.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/weekend_diversion_an_amazing_g/page213.jpg" width="500" alt="page213.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personifying the modern incarnation of this is Katerina Tarnovska.  She is the 30-year old woman who founded Asgarda, which currently has about 150 members (all women, mostly teenage girls) living together and studying martial arts, independence, literacy, life skills, and science.  Everything she can think of -- including traditionally male traits -- that these young women will need to be autonomous, powerful, brave and successful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she has to say about it is simply wonderful and timeless, and her message comes out clearly even through the difficulty of going from Russian to English:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In spite of aspects girls-amazons study all sciences necessary in every day life. Laws and rules of life. Ability how to associate correctly and how to achieve your purpose. Skills of creating family, housekeeping or your business activity, growing up children. Woman-warrior - is a perfect woman.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/weekend_diversion_an_amazing_g/page193.jpg" width="500" alt="page193.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another teacher at the school, Volodymyr Pylat, says the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The most important fight in the life person conducts with itself. Working upon its body the person becomes not only healthier, achieves progress in its measures, but also becomes self-discipline, develops skills in controll of its spirit, mind and body, further develops its adroitness, personality, strength of beliefs, firmness, courage, bravery in deeds.
&lt;br&gt;
All these skills are as necessary for women as for men. Now women don't occupy second-rate role in the society, so if they are improving themselves, they are improving society. That's why they need martial systems as means of stamping body, spirit and mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's shameful that women are &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; treated unequally in many, many circumstances, I think it's wonderful that something like Asgarda exists, and that literally hundreds of women will have their lives improved by taking advantage of this opportunity.  It always makes me feel good as a human being to know that there are amazing people out there doing things as amazing as this.  It's just got &lt;b&gt;"this is the right thing to do"&lt;/b&gt; written all over it.

The devices play music and videos to teach these students how to fit in. Fraser staff came up with the idea of programming iPods to act as an electronic substitute for “that missing [inner) voice for those with Asperger&amp;#39;s, the voice that governs appropriate behavior. Staff have helped students create short videos and slide shows on how to behave in different social settings: How to carry on a conversation; how to respect other people’s boundaries and think before they speak; and others. The &lt;a href="http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer"&gt;Autism Society of America&lt;/a&gt; says similar projects are popping up around the country, and include adaptations for smart phones, Palm Pilots and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;

There may be times when you feel your wife or long-term girlfriend has been sleeping with another man.  You may suspect she is even pregnant from this activity, and you are not the father.  There is a way to fix this, using traditional medicines and some magic, so that your wife/girlfriend will have a spontaneous abortion if you are not the father of the child.  You will need an ancient Canaanite or Hebrew priest to help mix up the concoction, and you have to go find &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/bible_as_ethnography/"&gt;The Lord himself &lt;/a&gt; (Plan ahead!  He is not always available!) to help out as well, but overall, the procedure is not that difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

Polanski has been hidden deep underground in the caves of Southern France for more than 30 years, only emerging from his dark lair to make the rare film or receive the occasional accolade bestowed upon him.&lt;/p&gt;

The Swiss Directors Association has called this "not only a grotesque farce of justice, but also an &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,556141,00.html"&gt;immense cultural scandal&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; A scandal, indeed, to insist that a man who sodomized and raped a drugged 13 year old girl be formally sentenced!  What kind of unjust nation is the United States??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; French authorities also believe that Polanki&amp;#39;s years of living in squalor with the sustained psychological stress of evading the authorities&amp;#39; clever plots to apprehend him have been sufficient punishment.   French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33042460/ns/entertainment-celebrities/"&gt;told the press&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;strongly regrets that a new ordeal is being inflicted on someone who has already 
experienced so many of them.&amp;quot;  French President Nicolas Sarkozy &amp;quot;is following the case with great attention and shares the minister&amp;#39;s hope that 
the situation can be quickly resolved.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, here, France!  Roman Polanski is extremely talented and has been through a lot in his life.  Surely, Samantha Gailey can be coerced to shut her mouth and take one for the team.*&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/after_years_of_stealth_evasion.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/after_years_of_stealth_evasion.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/1hup87wRxZM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254076821407"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/where_texans_file_science.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d44a0764054f061a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">Where Texans file science</title><published>2009-09-27T19:20:08Z</published><updated>2009-09-27T19:20:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/CXIWkXRLcxY/where_texans_file_science.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/where_texans_file_science.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Hastings bookstore in Lubbock, Texas, has a peculiar way of organizing their books.&lt;/p&gt;

Look and laugh at this list: &lt;a href="http://st-eutychus.com/2009/five-things-that-would-make-atheists-seem-nicer/"&gt;Five things that would make atheists seem nicer&lt;/a&gt;. It's gone awry even with the title. I especially appreciate the word "seem," because Lord knows there's nothing that could make us &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; nice, and obviously we need the suggestions of a Christian, since we&amp;#39;re all such not-nice people. I should make a counter-list of &amp;quot;five things that would make Christians seem intelligent&amp;quot; — maybe then one of them would notice the nasty implications of this clown&amp;#39;s title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m the wrong guy to do it. You see, I&amp;#39;m not nice, and proud of it. I have no interest in being nice, and I think it&amp;#39;s rather pathetic to start an argument by baring your throat to my teeth and begging for mercy before you&amp;#39;ve even started. It just makes me smirk and snap. It doesn&amp;#39;t help, either, that his list is so snide and feeble…so &lt;i&gt;sneebly&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Stop being so smug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, you start an argument, you don't get to whine at your opponent to be humble about his ideas &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; you've even taken a stab at criticizing them. Show me a reason not to be smug about atheism, and reason, and science, and the superiority of our beliefs over that pile of superstitious dogma you call faith. Don't simply instruct me to stop regarding atheism as possibly not superior to your cultish apologetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christians also don't get to play the humility card, anyway. People who believe they have privileged access to mysterious information direct from the brain of a cosmos-spanning super-intelligence, and who believe everyone else is damned to eternal torment, aren't exactly poster-children for modesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Don't assume every piece of Christian evangelism is directed at you - we want the undecideds, not the decided-uns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, my, no. You think we see the inane dreck Christians propose as an argument, and you think &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; assume it&amp;#39;s directed at us? We&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;smug,&amp;quot; remember — we figure there&amp;#39;s no way you can really be so stupid as to think we&amp;#39;re going to be swayed by Pascal&amp;#39;s Wager or handwaving at vague quotes from the Bible or threats of an imaginary Hell or promises of an imaginary paradise. We&amp;#39;re after the undecideds, too. We love tearing up your stupidity in public for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, I know that the Christian who wrote this list wasn't directing it at me, and probably never even heard of me. That doesn't stop me from pissing on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Admit that the debate about God's existence is complex - and that it can, depending on your presuppositions, be quite possible for intelligent and rational people to intelligently believe in an intervening deity who communicates through a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate is complex because a lot of intelligent, educated people buy into those ridiculous presuppositions and then toss a lot of noisy chaff in the air. There is a simplicity at the core that is not in Christian interests to expose: is there a god or gods, and is there any reasonable evidence for him, it, her, or them? And further, is there a reason to believe in your specific god over Thor or Xenu or Moroni or whatever other fiction some cunning con artist chose to peddle to the gullible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And your 'intervening deity' (the existence of which is an assertion not supported by any evidence) 'communicates' (you are using that word in some strange fashion that is not reasonable) 'through a book' (that was cobbled together from scattered scraps of theological rants, old poetry, and self-serving pseudo-history over 1500 years ago)? That's crazy talk right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Admit that the scientific method - which by its nature relies on induction rather than deduction (starting with a hypothesis and testing it rather than observing facts and forming a hypothesis) - is as open to abuse as any religious belief, and is neither objective nor infallible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. We are not going to get anywhere if you expect your opponents to simply fall over and accept a bogus mischaracterization of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science uses &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; inductive and deductive logic. Induction is the idea generator, the process that spins out tentative hypotheses that can be evaluated by observation, experiment, and deductive logic. Science is not infallible, and no one ever claims that it is, but it has something that religion lacks: a process of &lt;i&gt;testing claims against real-world observations&lt;/i&gt;. To claim that science is as open to abuse as religion is ignorant nonsense. You can claim virtually &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; about gods in religion, and all that matters is how many rubes you can persuade to believe it. Scientific claims are constrained by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course individuals can abuse both religion and science. The difference is that science provides objective criteria to assess the viability of truth-claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Try to deal with the actual notions of God seriously believed in by millions of people rather than inventing strawmen (or spaghetti monsters) to dismiss the concepts of God - and deal with the Bible paying attention to context and the broader Christological narrative rather than quoting obscure Old Testament laws. By all means quote the laws when they are applied incorrectly by "Christians" - but understand how they're meant to work before dealing with the Christians described in point 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, explain Ganesh to me. Explain the prosperity gospel. Explain why Christians reject the prophecies of Mohammed, while millions of Muslims think they're just peachy. Explain premillennial dispensationalism. Explain whether Episcopalians or Baptists are right. Explain how Spong is wrong. Or right. Who would win a cage match between Karen Armstrong and Pat Robertson?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; Christological narrative? There is none, or rather, there&amp;#39;s a thousand of them. We know the context, too — that the Bible is an evolving mess of over-interpreted poetry and tribal stories and crackpot history. Why you guys choose to selectively declare one interpretation of one subset of the conglomeration to be the absolute truth as dictated by anthropomorphic vapor, while another arbitrary subset is archaic and doesn&amp;#39;t apply anymore, is completely incomprehensible…not just to us, but to you, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We atheists actually &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; address the claims fervently held by millions of people. The sneaky trick the theological wankers pull, though, is that once we&amp;#39;ve smacked them down, they announce, &amp;quot;Oh, no — we didn&amp;#39;t mean &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; millions of believers. They're stupid. We meant &lt;i&gt;these other&lt;/i&gt; millions of believers." It's a big game of whack-a-mole. What you call "obscure Old Testament laws," someone else will call the core of their faith. What you value as the "Christological narrative," a member of yet another sect will call pretentious confabulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atheists just cut through all the noise and call it &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; sewage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some of us see no reason to be nice to sewage, and get really cranky at demands to respect your steaming pile of ordure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have received a report from N. Innaiah, Chairman of CFI India, and M. Subba Rao, concerning the condition of our colleague Basava Premanand, the revered and justly famous Indian rationalist with whom I have had the honor to be associated for many decades. Premanand is the publisher of "The Indian Skeptic," a journal devoted to exposing the tricks of such frauds as Sai Baba, who is worshiped as a living god by countless naifs around the world. The excellent documentary film "Guru Busters" by British film maker Robert Eagle shows Premanand and his crew zealously exposing supposedly supernatural stunts such as levitation, flesh-piercing and live burials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premanand is now hospitalized with a terminal condition, his friends are caring for him, but he's not lost any of his zeal or determination to maintain his rational philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>randi@randi.org (James Randi)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254066663703"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/help_us_name_our_baby.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44454004c060e3f0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Birthdays"/><title type="html">Help us name our baby</title><published>2009-09-27T16:22:32Z</published><updated>2009-09-27T16:22:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/nTlKa9udAFo/help_us_name_our_baby.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/help_us_name_our_baby.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We expect to have a new male baby on November 20th +/-.

Maybe they were separated at birth! In any case, perhaps we should see how many of us can be blocked by Maher by telling him that if you call people who get their flu shots idiots, &lt;em&gt;you're&lt;/em&gt; the real idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a hint, Bill. If crackpots like those at Age of Autism &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/bill-mahers-new-rule-on-swine-flu-vax.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;love your stand on vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, you've gone down the same road as the Gardasil crackpots you criticize.

(Lately Maher has been issuing &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/billmaher/status/4403617471"&gt;Tweets&lt;/a&gt; that call people who get flu shots “idiots.”) Indeed, I even included in the post perhaps the most hilariously spot-on riposte to Maher’s crankery. This occurred when Maher proclaimed that he never gets the flu and wouldn’t get the flu on an airplane, which his guest Bob Costas to exclaim in exasperation, “Oh, come on, Superman!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Costas won my respect that day. My favorite part was when Maher looked at his guests, who were shifting in their seats, all embarrassed and unsure of what to say, and observed, “You all look at me as though I’m crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, yes, Bill, we do. Let’s put it this way. When &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/bill-mahers-new-rule-on-swine-flu-vax.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism likes you&lt;/a&gt;, you have a serious problem when it comes to being credible about medical science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that same post, I complained about Maher’s being awarded the Richard Dawkins Award by the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org"&gt;Atheist Alliance International&lt;/a&gt; (AAI). I liken giving Bill Maher an award that lists “advocates increased scientific knowledge” anywhere in its criteria, not to mention being named after Richard Dawkins, to giving Jenny McCarthy an award for public health, given that, at least when it comes to medicine, Maher is anti-science to the core. Along the way, I’ve ruffled the feathers of some of both Dawkins’ and Maher’s fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I regret nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do I regret nothing, but on September 18, a mere two weeks before the AAI Convention, Maher provided me with more ammunition. In fact, this is probably the most blatant bit of crankery I’ve seen from Maher in a long time. Watch and learn. The “alternative medicine” nuttery begins at around the 0:50 mark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/9-jLhv8t04g%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laetrile? Really? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laetrile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?? How 1970s cancer quackery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The segment above comes from something called &lt;em&gt;Overtime With Bill Maher&lt;/em&gt;. Basically, it’s a segment in which the &lt;a href="http://boards.hbo.com/topic/Maher-Overtime/Submit-Questions-Overtime/2000008747"&gt;audience submits questions&lt;/a&gt;, a few of which Maher and crew pick to respond to on the web after &lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher"&gt;Real Time with Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt; airs. This particular edition aired last Friday, and in it Maher makes several nonsensical and obviously erroneous claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with a question from an audience member: “Will the implication of universal health care help or hinder alternative medicine?” You know that’s just like holding a piece of bloody, dripping meat in front of a pit bull that hasn’t eaten in two days, and Bill goes after it just like the pit bull would tear into a piece of meat–and with just as much grace. Well, Bill doesn’t do it immediately. Rather, he does it after his guest,&lt;a href="http://www.jeffreytoobin.com"&gt; Jeffrey Toobin&lt;/a&gt;, paraphrases one of my favorite sayings by pointing out that “medicine is medicine,” continuing, “If it works, it works. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which Bill hops in ranting, “That’s not how this country works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t we at SBM know it, Bill! Quackademic medicine is &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=28"&gt;infiltrating medical academia at every level&lt;/a&gt;. How this country works these days is to accept pseudoscience and quackery as being on par with scientific medicine. How this country works is for woo-friendly legislators like Senator Tom Harkin to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=394"&gt;force pseudoscience upon the NIH&lt;/a&gt; and to try to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=574"&gt;slip provisions&lt;/a&gt; in one of the Senate versions of health care reform legislation declaring “alternative” medicine practitioners to be considered legitimate health care practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this keeps Maher from proclaiming that “alternative medicine often is illegal in this country.” As if that would be such a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; thing. Personally, I’d say right to Maher’s face that it’s a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing to protect patients from charlatans who claim to be able to cure terminal cancer, like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/requiem_for_a_quack.php"&gt;Hulda Clark&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1430"&gt;Nicholas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1545"&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, every bit as good as Bill thinks it would be to protect the public from large pharmaceutical companies. In fact, I’d tell Maher that, in my not-so-humble opinion, the problem with this country is not that “alternative medicine” often is illegal, but rather that the most egregious examples of quackery are not illegal often enough and that quacks all too frequently quite literally get away with murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher then goes on to say that you can go to jail for “so much as suggesting any alternative treatment for cancer.” Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, Bill. I bet Bill can’t name a single person who has ever been sent to jail for “suggesting any alternative treatment for cancer.” (Not even &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1574"&gt;Kevin Trudeau&lt;/a&gt;, although he did go to jail for credit card fraud years before he discovered “alternative medicine.”) But Maher can go on to rant about how Toobin supposedly doesn’t “understand how much the pharmaceutical companies have their tentacles wrapped around the government in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toobin then (weakly) challenges Maher by asking, “For selling people Laetrile?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher responds that he “doesn’t know whether Laetrile works,” but that he knows that “the shit we’ve tried for the last 50 years doesn’t. I know they’ve made no progress as far as cancer in this country. So, yes, there are people who actually go out of this country when they get cancer. Some of them come back alive after a death sentence. But in this country you can’t talk about that. I might get arrested right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong, again, Bill. No one’s going to throw you in jail for spouting your ignorant nonsense. I would, however, love to know who these patients are who went out of the country for “alternative” medicine and survived? Coretta Scott King? Farrah Fawcett? Michael Landon? Steve McQueen (who, by the way, used Laetrile, among all sorts of other “alternative” or “unconventional treatments”)? Really, Bill, who are these survivors who were given death sentences and then remarkably cured at foreign clinics? Inquiring minds want to know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know that Laetrile doesn’t work. The studies were done well over 20 years ago and were &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/laetrile.html"&gt;resoundingly negative&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient"&gt;NCI states&lt;/a&gt; that Laetrile doesn’t work against cancer, and patients can suffer complications of cyanide toxicity from it. If you “don’t know” whether laetrile works or not, it’s because you’ve drunk the Kool Aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill’s other problem is a common one. Like all too many people, he appears to view cancer as one disease. It’s not. In some cancers, we’ve made enormous progress in the last 50 years. For instance, most leukemias and lymphomas were death sentences 50 years ago. Now many of them are highly treatable and even curable. Lest you think that I’m cherry picking the easy, another example is colorectal cancer. For patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, for example, the time of survival and quality of life can both be significantly improved by the new generation of chemotherapeutic, antiangiogenic, and targeted therapies, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thecheerfuloncologist/2007/03/post_76.php"&gt;The Cheerful Oncologist&lt;/a&gt; pointed out two years ago. In fact, I liked The Cheerful Oncologist’s posts so much that I’m going to steal the graph that he stole from this &lt;a href="http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/content/full/10/4/250"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; to drive the point home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/3958134397/" title="crcsurvival by David SBM, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3496/3958134397_afb94de56f_o.gif" width="440" height="317" alt="crcsurvival"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one can see, the survival for untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is in the range of 4-6 months. Older adjuvant chemotherapy regimens could result in median survivals of approximately 12 months. Over the last decade or so, recently developed chemotherapy regimens have pushed the median survival to nearly two years. In fact, my best friend’s father is evidence of that. He has metastatic colorectal cancer but has been doing well for quite a while now. He even still plays golf regularly. He knows that sooner or later his cancer will claim him, but in the meantime he’s enjoying his life for as long as possible, which is all that any of us can really do. As the authors conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;FU has been the cornerstone of treatment for mCRC for over 40 years. In the past few years, the introduction of more effective chemotherapeutic agents and targeted agents with their promising activities and mild toxicity profiles has pushed the overall median survival time from 12 months to 2 years. However, as discussed, there are still many challenges facing oncologists. Research is ongoing to understand these issues, and significant advances are expected through the implementation of well-designed clinical trials and continued preclinical investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if you look at the &lt;a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2006/results_merged/topic_survival_by_year_dx.pdf"&gt;SEER Database&lt;/a&gt;, you will see a much different story. For all cancers, five year survival has improved from 50.2% in 1975 to 68.2% in 2001, and 10-year survival has increased from 44.5% in 1975 to 60% in 1996. Moreover, it’s not just quantity of life but quality of life. For instance, thirty or forty years ago, women underwent either radical or modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer. These days, maybe 25% still require mastectomy and virtually none of them require radical mastectomy. (Indeed, I’ve never even seen a radical mastectomy, and I began my surgical residency in the late 1980s.) That’s because surgeons, as part of multidisciplinary teams including medical oncologists and radiation oncologists, figured out that it’s usually not necessary to do a mastectomy to treat breast cancer. The same survival rates can be obtained with less invasive surgery. The same is true in other areas, such as the aforementioned colorectal surgery, where more and more colon operations are being done using minimally invasive methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was science that accomplished this. Not the outrageous quackery that Bill Maher promotes. Science. Bill Maher doesn’t know what he’s talking about. As usual, at least when it comes to medical science. True, we have definitely not made as much progress as we would desire, and there are still a depressing number of cancers for which we still can’t do much, if any better, than a couple of decades ago, but overall there has been slow progress. It remains incredibly hard to have to tell so many cancer patients that we cannot cure them, but that there remain a number of patients with cancer that we can’t cure doesn’t mean we’ve made “no progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t stop Maher from parroting the usual alt-med nonsense about “wholistic” medicine as opposed to drugging people with the evil products of the even more evil big pharma, after which he finiishes with his usual rant about Western medicine, in which he claims that the reason “people are so sick” is because “Western medicine…only treats symptoms. That’s how they keep the scam going. If you only treat symptoms, of course people are always going to be sick. Yes, Nasonex will stop you from sniffling. It will shove the mucus right down your throat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish someone would shove the utter nonsense that Bill Maher spews on such a regular basis back down his throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some of my readers will think I’m beating a dead horse over this. I also know that I haven’t exactly endeared myself to AAI members by harping on just how idiotic it was to have chosen Maher for any award that has the word “science” anywhere in its criteria, given his support of anti-vaccine views, his apparent &lt;a href="http://www.aliveandwell.org/html/top_bar_pages/whatif_eng.html"&gt;sympathy for HIV/AIDS denialism&lt;/a&gt;, and now his belief in cancer quackery shown in the video clip above. It wouldn’t have mattered on iota to me if the AAI had chosen to give Maher a “best atheist movie” award or some sort of activism award. But it didn’t. It chose to give Maher and award, one of the criteria of which involves advocating “increased scientific knowledge,” and that irritated me mightily. I even realize that my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_gets_the_richard_dawkins_awar.php"&gt;expressing just how disappointed&lt;/a&gt; I was in Richard Dawkins’ nonchalant, “he’s anti-religion; I don’t know about his views on alt-med and really don’t care” &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_problem_with_writing_by_co.php#comment-1789758"&gt;reaction&lt;/a&gt; to criticism of the selection doesn’t endear me to Dawkins’ fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t care. His “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shruggie&lt;/a&gt;” attitude towards someone who should have been featured in the second part of Dawkin’s documentary, &lt;em&gt;The Enemies of Reason&lt;/em&gt;, as one of the quacks he skewered demands his being called out, preferably at the AAI conference, preferably along with Bill Maher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone wanted a symbol of their faith allowed in the building after that and officials had to put a moratorium on further displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, those officials do not want to see this all happen again.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, they issued a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/26/no-religious-displays-in-the-capitol-building-this-year/"&gt;temporary ruling on the matter&lt;/a&gt;, banning such displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, they’re trying to make it permanent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Under the proposed rules, display or exhibits could not be placed in the public areas of buildings on the Capitol campus, except for a state-sponsored “holiday” tree in the rotunda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a public hearing Tuesday, some argued that the rules violated free speech rights. Others testified in support of the rules, saying they didn’t want to see a repeat of last year, when protests erupted over competing private holiday displays.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has a section on their website where they &lt;a href="http://www.ga.wa.gov/Rules/rules_proposed.htm"&gt;discuss current rules&lt;/a&gt; and invite comments from the public.  The period for offering comments &lt;a href="http://www.ga.wa.gov/Rules/PublicCommentExtendedNotice.pdf"&gt;has been extended&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) until Thursday, October 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/ga/apps/RuleComment/Default.aspx?a=3"&gt;make a comment here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let state officials know that you want to see NO display of anyone’s faith (including atheists) in the Capitol building.  The government must either endorse no belief system or allow for all beliefs systems to host their own display.  The latter would lead to chaos as it did last year.  The state officials and the citizens of Washington would be much better off simply banning such displays.  If Christians want to put up a nativity scene, let them do it on their own property, in their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/07/watermelon-planet/"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/01/15/messenger-at-mercury-hawesome/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; have been nothing short of frakkin’ amazing, so I’m really looking forward to this final pass. Even though it was 1.3 million kilometers away from the tiny planet on the 25th, &lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&amp;amp;image_id=328"&gt;it snapped this serene shot&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/pics/CN0162359963M_RA_3_web.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/messenger_sep2509.jpg" alt="messenger_sep2509" title="messenger_sep2509" width="608" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love moody astronomical pictures. Here, a crescent Mercury sits in the inky black as MESSENGER screams down on it at 3.3 km/sec (2 miles per second). ON this final pass, the spacecraft will slow enough that it will be able to enter orbit around Mercury in &lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/the_mission/MESSENGERTimeline/TimeLine_content.html"&gt;March 2011&lt;/a&gt;. The nominal lifespan of the mission will be for one solid (Earth) year of observations, and will map the planet with &lt;em&gt;18 meter&lt;/em&gt; resolution. That’s the size of a house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is so going to rock. But that’s 1.5 years away, and we’re still waiting on this third pass. I hope to be able to post pix when they come in, but I’m traveling to the UK for TAM London not long after, so we’ll see. But you can always keep an eye on &lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu"&gt;the MESSENGER website&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/"&gt;Emily Lakdawalla’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll be up-to-date… especially, if I know her, Emily, who will be spending the flyby looming over her keyboard and hitting &amp;quot;refresh&amp;quot; every 30 seconds or so. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254057074506"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/i-look-away-briefly-and-stuff/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/09982af1df7a8643</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">I look away briefly and stuff …</title><published>2009-09-27T12:47:06Z</published><updated>2009-09-27T12:47:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/09/i-look-away-briefly-and-stuff/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I look away briefly and stuff starts happening, disappointingly dull race up to now #f1&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254055681565"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=5435">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6506f352e6a84699</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Free Harvard course on justice</title><published>2009-09-27T11:55:15Z</published><updated>2009-09-27T11:55:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/09/27/free-harvard-course-on-justice/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Sandel’s course at Harvard, “Justice,” is enormously popular, and is highlighted in &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/arts/television/26sandel.html?em"&gt;today’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; The course is now being made free online, and can be found &lt;a href="http://justiceharvard.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  There are videos of every lecture, and online study material.   You can neglect all the ancillary stuff, but this is a fantastic opportunity to see a great teacher for free, and I for one plan to watch every episode (there’s a new one every week, and two are already up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 1989, shortly before I left the industrial research job that I had held for the previous 15 years, corporate headquarters appointed me to a committee to decide on a procedure for evaluating methodologies for prioritizing follow-up actions in the wake of a "technology portfolio fair" where researchers had explained new technologies to heads of product development in various branches of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We weren't authorized to decide what to do, nor even to suggest priorities for alternative actions, nor yet to suggest a methodology for assigning priorities to alternative actions, nor for that matter to evaluate alternative methodologies for assigning priorities to alternative actions. Instead, we were tasked with designing a procedure for evaluating methodologies for assigning priorities to possible decisions.  From a certain perspective, the mere ability to conceive and communicate such a task was a triumph of the human intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My level of admiration for this achievement was not unconnected to my decision to move to academia.  But my feelings of awe had no linguistic focus — it was the content, not its expression, that was awful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254053661059"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16494">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b7468a34e1ac2cf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Statue of Ganesh Offends Visitors at Calgary Zoo</title><published>2009-09-27T11:00:57Z</published><updated>2009-09-27T11:00:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/27/statue-of-ganesh-offends-visitors-at-calgary-zoo/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When the “Elephant Crossing” exhibit opened at the Calgary Zoo in 2006, a private donor gave the zoo a statue of the Hindu god Ganesh — it was in honor .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/photos/2009/09/24/cgy-ganesh-zoo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/photos/2009/09/24/cgy-ganesh-zoo.jpg" title="Ganesh" width="250" height="282"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the zoo accepted it and stripped it of “all religious symbolism.”  Which is ridiculous because an elephant in that pose is itself a well-known image of Ganesh.  That’s like saying someone donated a statue of a man on a cross, and the zoo accepted it because there’s no indication that it’s Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right thing to do would be to simply remove the statue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the zoo &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/09/25/calgary-zoo-elephant-statue-christians-response.html"&gt;isn’t doing that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Our desire in putting the statue here was to demonstrate to our visitors the connection between cultures and animals, much like the same way the bald eagle for example depicts the American culture, the lion Britain, the beaver Canada,” explained Grahame Newton, the zoo’s director of corporate services, on Friday.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the problem is simply that most people don’t have enough cultural knowledge to make the connection that the statue is considered sacred for a part of the population.  They don’t know it’s a religious icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/09/24/calgary-zoo-elephant-sculpture-christians-ganesh.html"&gt;one Christian is very angry about all this&lt;/a&gt;… he actually makes some sense, up until the last sentence, when he gives away his true feelings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jim Blake, national chair of Concerned Christians Canada, sent a letter to the zoo on Thursday, calling for the sculpture to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The zoo is not a place of religious indoctrination, it is supposed to be a safe family environment free of religious icons and selective religious partiality,” Blake wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The displaying of different gods in a public place like this is an offence to our beliefs and does not represent the diversity of views that should be reflected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the zoo wants to keep the statue and “[embark] on teaching the public about world religions, Blake suggested that the facility also erect the cross of Jesus Christ, the Ten Commandments and Noah’s Ark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The display of foreign gods is offensive and does not reflect the views of the majority of Canadians,” he continued.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9ob9v/you_cant_erect_a_statue_to_your_elephant_god/"&gt;headline at Reddit&lt;/a&gt; summarizes that argument perfectly: “You can’t erect a statue to your elephant god because my sky fairy will be offended.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Malik said, “This is not a protest, it is a day of prayer, of devotion, hoping that we can work … for the betterment of the world community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added, “We can come together and work together for the common good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a few weeks after the Christian “9/12″ gathering in Washington. Both groups have a constitutional right to peacefully assemble, and each were just getting together for, at least in their minds, the betterment of mankind. And they were weeks apart, so what could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the Christians can’t learn to share. So they showed up on the same day as the Muslims to protest Islam. Hey, I’m all for protesting Islam. It’s a hideous and repulsive ideology. But I don’t like it when large bodies of Christians and large bodies of Muslims are all together in one place while at least one of them is being particularly hostile to the other. That usually doesn’t end well. Fortunately, no violence broke out. But it is interesting to hear the Christians justify their protest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important for Christians to understand that Friday’s Muslim prayer initiative is part of a well-defined strategy to Islamize American society and replace the Bible with the Koran, the cross with the Islamic crescent and the church bells with the Athan [the Muslim call to prayer],” the Rev. Canon Julian Dobbs, leader of the Convocation of Anglicans in North America’s Church and Islam Project, said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a really simple solution there. Just keep all religious out of government affairs and you won’t have to worry about whether or not Islam becomes the dominent religion in the country. Then everybody wins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Maher knows what he’s talking about. He’s an awesome proctologist. He just has a special way of pulling things out of the rectum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This info. comes courtesy of my old friends at &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/bill-mahers-new-rule-on-swine-flu-vax.html"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;.

But if Abu Graib taught us anything it’s that even some of the worst criminal offenders still deserve to be treated with some compassion. And the 20th century, more than any before it,  showed us what societies are capable of when they start to dehumanize others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090925/od_nm/us_castration"&gt;Poland has just passed a new law mandating chemical castration for pedophiles&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Donald Tusk said late last year he wanted obligatory castration for pedophiles, whom he branded ‘degenerates’. Tusk said he did not believe “one can use the term ‘human’ for such individuals, such creatures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do we draw the line? And how far is going too far in punishing criminals in the name of security? These are not easy questions. This theme has always interested me. In fact, I’m touching on it in a screenplay I’m writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d think Poland, of all places, would understand the terrible consequences of regarding a group of people as not human or less than human.&lt;/p&gt;

The most popular one is about Najibullah Zazi, the 24 year old shuttle driver and coffee server,&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1925270,00.html"&gt;who apparently is at the center of an Al Qaeda cell that tried to launch a domestic terror attack on sept 11.&lt;/a&gt; In brief:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An FBI affidavit says Zazi admitted under questioning to receiving weapons and training from al-Qaeda, and a series of searches in New York City turned up evidence that Zazi may have been looking to manufacture either truck or backpack bombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Apparently they found videos of how to make a make on his computer and he hit up hair supply distributors in order to get chemicals to make a liquid bomb. (ignore the dumb articles saying the bomb was made out of hydrogen peroxide - thats idiotic, H2O2 is not explosive, how it IS a reagent for making &lt;a href="http://www.hyscience.com/archives/2006/08/acetone_peroxid_1.php"&gt;triacetone triperoxide&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Meanwhile &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jCITROrzT6aUhUyO5N3iOgxVjz9QD9AU2JF04"&gt;another couple of kookoo&lt;/a&gt;s had their goals set for blowing something up. Michael Finton and Hosam Maher Husein Smad, separately, and unrelatedly also wanted to blow some shit up on sept 11. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;How were these guys caught?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Well Zazi had decided to go to Pakistan (ok, guess what, if you are born in Afghanistan and are going to travel to Pakistan for "pleasure", you are getting flagged). Then while under surveillance, he started hitting up places where you can get hydrochloric acid, pure hydrogen peroxide (consumer H2O2 is only about 30% pure), and acetone. After that he rented a car and headed for NYC where he was intercepted. I'm sure between wire taps and other surveillance methods they had plenty on this guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Finton had a different story. He got out of jail for robbery and aggravated assault. He had told the guards that he had converted to islam, then he received money from someone in Saudi Arabia for a plane ticket. Finton spent a month there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Finton had been monitored by this time. At this point the feds seem to have a standard procedure that they keep using. You and I would call in entrapment, probably because we are not familiar with the intricacies of the law. they do this as a practice so i doubt its illegal. Nor do I care. I think this is OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Basically they passed themselves off as al Qaeda operatives and got him a bomb to blow up in a federal building. Finton went ahead and did it. The bomb was fake. When Finton called the number that was supposed to blow up the bomb, he just called the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Anyway, I didn't really intend on rehashing the news.I dont even want to jump to the conclusion that these three people are actually guilty. &lt;a href="http://www.caedefensefund.org/overview.html"&gt;The FBI have made plenty of mistakes with regard to terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. I just wanted to point something out here. They were able to catch three terrorism suspect, who may have caused a lot of damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;And they did it without any torture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/26613182-6028799433808045336?l=techskeptic.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Techskeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Effort Sisyphus</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1254026958951"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/diversity_in_science_carnival_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8c989656b4336c4f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Diversity in Science"/><title type="html">Diversity in Science Carnival - Viva!</title><published>2009-09-27T03:41:43Z</published><updated>2009-09-27T03:41:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/PB0t_JVxdJ8/diversity_in_science_carnival_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/09/diversity_in_science_carnival_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/03/check_out_the_new_edition_of_d/DiSBadge_300.png" style="margin:0pt 20px 20px 0pt;float:left" height="300" width="300"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Back from a couple of month hiatus, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/09/diversity_in_science_carnival_1.php"&gt;Diversity in Science Carnival&lt;/a&gt; is being hosted this month by &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey"&gt;DrugMonkey&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;#39;s carnival honors Hispanic scientists and coincides with National Hispanic Heritage Month.  HHM was first established as an observance by Lyndon Johnson in 1968 lengthened to a full month by Ronald Reagan in 1988.  It covers the 30 days between September 15th and October 15th.  It might seem odd to have a month of observation begin and end in the middle of two calendar months, but these date have special significance.  September 15th is the day in 1821 in which Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua became independent nations.  Mexico declared independence on September 16th (not May 5th), Chile on September 18th, and Belize on September 21st.  This year&amp;#39;s theme for the month, coined by Jorge Ponce, Director of the Policy and Evaluation Division of the Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Commerce, is &amp;quot;Embracing the Fierce Urgency of Now!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Of interest is that the phrase "fierce urgency of Now" is from Martin Luther King Jr.'s &lt;a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm"&gt;I Have a Dream&lt;/a&gt; speech.  The words were spoken in this quite uncivil context:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;We have also come to this hallowed spot 
to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the 
luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is 
the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from 
the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial 
justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial 
injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a 
reality for all of God's children.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;It would be fatal for the nation to 
overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's 
legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of 
freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And 
those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content 
will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there 
will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his 
citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the 
foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly this theme was chosen for a purpose and I wonder what it means that this theme was chosen for this year.  Previous themes have been much more benign.  Here are the l&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_Heritage_Month"&gt;ast several&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2001: Paving the Way for Future Generations 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2002: Strength in Unity, Faith in Diversity 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2003: Ascending to New Heights 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2004: Making a Difference in Our Communities and Nation 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2005: Strong and Colorful Threads in the American Fabric 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2006: Honoring Our Past, Surpassing Our Present and Leading Our Future 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2007: Hispanic Americans: Making a Positive Impact on American Society 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2008: Getting Involved: Our Families, Our Community, Our Nation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the previous years&amp;#39;  themes highlight how the Hispanic can integrate into American society and strengthen their community.  2007&amp;#39;s theme especially was targeted at how the Hispanic can offer something to society-- is this year&amp;#39;s theme a message that perhaps it is time for the Hispanic people to refuse to continue to be marginalized as a source of cheap labor?  That it is time for them to host a revolt of their own and not be concerned about whether they are thought to be &amp;quot;blow[ing] off steam.&amp;quot;  Is this theme telling us that the Hispanic people need to follow in the footsteps of their African American brethren and begin a civil rights movement of their own? Dare I say, &amp;quot;orale güey?&amp;quot;  (As a point of interest, if you google &amp;quot;orale güey,&amp;quot; you get the blog of &lt;a href="http://extrovertscientist.wordpress.com/2009/02/03/orale-guey/"&gt;my favorite Hispanic science blogger&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/09/diversity_in_science_carnival_1/hispanicbatsignal.jpg" alt="hispanicbatsignal.jpg" height="486" width="407"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;David:&lt;/span&gt; We were...I was...fixing Zach's computer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;David:&lt;/span&gt; You weren't supposed to see this! You aren't supposed to be home for another three hours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Zach: &lt;/span&gt;I should leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;David:&lt;/span&gt; No, you know what? I'm done hiding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;David:&lt;/span&gt; Zach and I are in love! With Warcraft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Zach:&lt;/span&gt; Magic is a complex game of strategy! It's not for kids!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;David:&lt;/span&gt; Listen, Cheryl. We may be working class nobodies in the real world.

It's scary. And seems accurate enough even to an undergrad with limited experience. (Shit, I've been jaded already before even going to grad school...)Within the article is this quote:“Scientists might have had a Hippocratic oath of their own. They might have promised their gifts to mankind. But instead, I have fathered a race of inventive dwarfs who can be hired for anything.”—Bertolt Brecht “The Life of Galileo,” version by David HareTo be fair, doctors aren't exactly saints these days either, being tied up by the madness of insurance policies and a culture that deems it acceptable to SUE(!) a doctor for trying to help a patient. But at least doctors can have their own practice. You pretty much cannot set up your own business as a researcher, unless you're an engineer of sorts. Or if you blatantly contract yourself out to some organisation somewhere, which makes the research even more obviously not objective. There is hardly any real freedom or self-employment. A scientist must become a minion of their funding sources just to make ends meet.You know how we scientists are fundamentally different from artists, how we hail from different universes and all that? I'm deeply amazed by the parallels between us! It is also nearly impossible for an artist to survive as a self-expressing independent individual - they too must subscribe to fads and funding sources (commissions, etc). They too spend most of their time freaking out over funding rather than actually practising their art. And just like our research, their art is also skewed to please the sugar daddy commissioner. We are just artists who use a different medium with different rules. But many of the common stereotypes used to ward people off foolish career choices (such as those of the fine arts) are eerily as applicable to us. After all, most of us do embark on our chosen foolish careers to satisfy some absurdly naïve inner yearnings and desires; only to find the world absolutely indifferent to our dreams.We are all but artists-turned-businessmen.PS: What keeps me trying to stay on this path is the realisation that I'm absolutely worthless for any other kind of job. It's been observed that having limited options often forces one to be quite happy, since there's no point in constantly reflecting upon your choice, so you adapt to it. Yay! =DLawrence, P. (2009).

(&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/14/ffrf-sues-over-in-god-we-trust-at-capitol-visitor-center/"&gt;FFRF is suing&lt;/a&gt;, but they’ve had no success yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess how conservatives are celebrating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/click/stories/0909/capitol_center_gets_motto_movie.html"&gt;premiering a movie in the building&lt;/a&gt;.  The title: &lt;em&gt;Rediscovering God in America II: Our Heritage&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary by &lt;strong&gt;Newt Gingrich&lt;/strong&gt; and his wife Callista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The film explores the role of religion in early American history and features a lineup of history experts, including Catholic author Michael Novak. “We tried to match the location of the premiere with something to do with the film, and this was just a natural fit for us,” said David Bossie, executive producer and president of Citizens United Productions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the movie premiere and the engraving come just months after Congress passed legislation this summer ordering the words “In God We Trust” to be added to a large pillar in the complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our intention was never to have the center somehow Protestantized but to accurately reflect America’s godly heritage,” said Gingrich spokesman Rick Tyler, who also runs Gingrich’s Renewing American Leadership, an organization that brings together conservative evangelicals and Catholics.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to go out on a limb and assume America’s “godly heritage” happens to be whatever the Religious Right currently believes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever our heritage was, I’m certain the ties we now have between government and faith would be &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805077766?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0805077766"&gt;shocking to our nation’s founders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they are referring to is a paper by Mojib Latif in which he notes that the media often misrepresent global warming as a continuous, year by year increase in temperature.  The truth, of course, is that annual temperature varies up and down but the baseline for this variation has been going continuously up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a road going up a mountain.  Often the road goes up and down and up and down cross the complex terrain of the mountain side.  If, while driving up this hypothetical mountain, the road dips down for a moment, one does not say "Oh, we're going home now.  This whole driving up the mountain thing is over. We just dipped down.  No more up.  That's the end of it."  and then turn around and drive home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, really, this is pretty freakin' simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noted this morning that &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1768"&gt;Scott Adams&lt;/a&gt; is far from the only one to suggest that "at the end of the day" (in the meaning "when all is said and done" or "in the final analysis") is typical of "the vacuous way managers speak".  This phrase is often cited as  "over-used" as well as "irritating", and  I did a little &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1769"&gt;lunch-time experiment™&lt;/a&gt; earlier today suggesting that over the past 30 years or so,  it's indeed been taking over its rhetorico-ecological niche from competing cliches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an unsystematic scan of my searches seemed inconsistent with the hypothesis that it's especially likely to be used by "managers", however we define that much-maligned class.  I speculated that this might be another example of the common process of stereotype-formation, where some behavior perceived as annoying comes to be associated with a class of people who are also perceived as annoying, and the association is then repeatedly strengthened by confirmation bias. (See "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004244.html"&gt;The social psychology of linguistic naming and shaming&lt;/a&gt;", 2/27/2007, for some discussion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several commenters were not persuaded to abandon their prejudices, and so I decided to do a slightly more systematic check across sources, by comparing the frequency of "at the end of the day" to the frequency of "in the final analysis" in texts on the sites of 13 business, finance or management magazines, and 21 other diverse kinds of magazines and weblogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results, sorted by the ratio of "at the end of the day" to "in the final analysis":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the top 10 end-of-the-day-users include just two likely outlets of management-speak (Management Today and Black Enterprise), whereas the bottom ten include five (Harvard Business School Working Knowledge, Government Executive magazine, Inc magazine, Workforce Management magazine, and Chief Executive magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to claim that "managers" and other coporate types are actually &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to use the expression &amp;quot;at the end of the day&amp;quot; than (say) liberal intellectuals and fashion- or gossip-magazine writers are — but this tabulation certainly gives no comfort to those who hold the opposite view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2009/POLITICS/09/25/muslim.prayer.day/art.prayer.cnn.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2009/POLITICS/09/25/muslim.prayer.day/art.prayer.cnn.jpg" title="Muslims1" width="292" height="219"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“America is not perfect,” Abdul Malik, an organizer of the event called Islam on Capitol Hill, told the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But I will say something it took me my whole adult life to come to: America is not perfect, but I want to tell the truth: It is one of the best places in the world to live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also anti-Muslim protesters near the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Malik said, “This is not a protest, it is a day of prayer, of devotion, hoping that we can work … for the betterment of the world community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added, “We can come together and work together for the common good.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds harmless enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since tens of thousands of Christians descended upon the city a couple weeks ago for the FOXNews-sponsored 9/12 event, you imagine they’d be cool with other groups showing up to display their own faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just kidding.  They’re going &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/25/AR2009092502183.html?hpid=sec-religion"&gt;batshit insane&lt;/a&gt; over this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Across the street from the service, Christian protesters gathered with banners, crosses and anti-Islamic messages. One group, which stood next to a 10-foot-tall wooden cross and two giant wooden tablets depicting the Ten Commandments, was led by the Rev. Flip Benham of Concord, N.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would suggest you convert to Christ!” Benham shouted over a megaphone. Islam “forces its dogma down your throat.” A few Christian protesters gathered at the rear of the Muslim crowd, holding Bibles and praying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is important for Christians to understand that Friday’s Muslim prayer initiative is part of a well-defined strategy to Islamize American society and replace the Bible with the Koran, the cross with the Islamic crescent and the church bells with the Athan [the Muslim call to prayer],” the Rev. Canon Julian Dobbs, leader of the Convocation of Anglicans in North America’s Church and Islam Project, said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The time has come for the American public to call Islam to account,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right… Islam “forces its dogma down your throat.”  Christians never do that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not all Christians who feel this way, of course, but more than enough to make anyone uncomfortable.  Where’s the backlash from Christians standing up for the Muslims’ right to pray?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Crickets chirp&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one member of the Christian Left, &lt;strong&gt;Brian McLaren&lt;/strong&gt;, is &lt;a href="http://97.74.65.51/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=36063"&gt;doing something about it&lt;/a&gt;.  Not in reaction to the prayer protests, but well before it, he decided to &lt;a href="http://www.brianmclaren.net/archives/blog/ramadan-2009-part-1-whats-going.html"&gt;fast for Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; along with his Muslim friends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This year, I, along with a few Christian friends (and perhaps others currently unknown to us will want to join in) will be joining Muslim friends in the fast which begins August 21. We are not doing so in order to become Muslims: we are deeply committed Christians. But as Christians, we want to come close to our Muslim neighbors and to share this important part of life with them. Just as Jesus, a devout Jew, overcame religious prejudice and learned from a Syrophonecian woman and was inspired by her faith two thousand years ago (Matthew 15:21 ff, Mark 7:24 ff), we seek to learn from our Muslim sisters and brothers today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice gesture, even though I don’t see what fasting alone will accomplish.  I think Muslims would rather appreciate Christians taking action against what more conservative Christians are doing.  Get younger Christians to join together in defense of pluralism and against the hateful practices of the Religious Right.  Be subversive from the inside.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, I’ve seen Christians reacting to McLaren’s call to fast, but I haven’t read about any Muslims saying it has made any difference to them.&lt;/p&gt;

Also I look forward to reading your new book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like to mail you a copy of my freethought songs CD [Edited]. You can also find it on my website [Edited] in case you wanna check me out before you give me an address - ha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I grew up in a parsonage...my dad is a minister. But I am an avid member of Freedom From Religion Foundation, Council for Secular Humanism, Americans United..., American Atheists, and a few other groups. I've also read dozens of books on the subjects of atheism, freethought, humanism, religious origins, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you'd like to email me an address, I'd be happy to send you my CD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take care,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for writing and for the encouragement. I listened to several of your songs and I must say that while they are musically creative you don't sing that well and the lyrics themselves are too complicated for the most part. John Lennon's &lt;i&gt;Imagine&lt;/i&gt; was simple and powerful, as was "Dear God." Do simple with power in the lyrics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you need not send me anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;John W. Loftus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wow - now I understand why so many freethinkers criticize you.  You are not a very kind person, so it seems.  That's very sad.  I wondered why there's so much negative about you out there, now I understand.  I never claimed to be a good singer.  And I also think your offer to criticize was unwarranted when being offered a gift.  But to each his own.  I guess I'll abandon your website and join those who think so negatively of you now that you've left a bitter taste in my mouth, since you don't seem to have good manners, in my opinion.  I hope something happens to you that causes you to become a kinder gentler person.  That would be good for you and for atheism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not angry with you - just puzzled and sad that you would be so rude.&lt;br&gt;Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, you never have to wonder where I stand. If you want honesty you'll get it with me. Sorry to have offended you though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Freethinkers do not criticize me when it comes to my arguments:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-i-became-atheist.html"&gt;Why I Became an Atheist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;John W. Loftus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you will recall, my remarks are not about your arguments; they are simply about your manners.&lt;br&gt;If I may be so blunt, WHAT AN ASS YOU ARE!&lt;br&gt;I bet you get called that often.&lt;br&gt;So sad that you are so arrogant about your arguments that the rest of your personality is completely unlikable.&lt;br&gt;Oh well, I've had my say.&lt;br&gt;You won't hear anymore from me.  And I have removed your blog link from my website.&lt;br&gt;What a sad sad man you are.&lt;br&gt;And I shall communicate my opinon when your name comes up in my freethinker circles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I said you are musically creative. I liked your music. And I said I was sorry to have offended you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;John&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------------&lt;br&gt;John again:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few last things, if you don't mind. I am swamped with requests like yours and am just swamped generally. As my automated email told you I probably wouldn't even respond. But I did take the time to visit your site and I did take the time to listen to your music. That's a compliment. And while my hastily written email back to you offended you I was trying to offer some good sound advice in hopes of making your music better, if you heard what I said. It does bother me to offend people though, so I don't know where or why you get the impression I am not a kind person. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do hope you check out my books, especially my forthcoming one, &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/site/thechristiandelusion/"&gt;The Christian Delusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's not let a misunderstanding ruin what we can do together to change the religious landscape, even if I am rude. As far as rudeness goes, some of the most important skeptics in history have been rude. Socrates was extremely rude. In Plato's Euthyphro dislogue Socrates basically humiliates Euthyphro by showing he simply does not know what piety is and cannot answer even the simplest questions about it. When Euthyphro hits rock bottom and admits he cannot answer them Socrates sarcastically says at the end:&lt;blockquote&gt;Soc. Then we must begin again and ask, What is piety? That is an enquiry which I shall never be weary of pursuing as far as in me lies; and I entreat you not to scorn me, but to apply your mind to the utmost, and tell me the truth. For, if any man knows, you are he; and therefore I must detain you, like Proteus, until you tell. If you had not certainly known the nature of piety and impiety, I am confident that you would never, on behalf of a serf, have charged your aged father with murder. You would not have run such a risk of doing wrong in the sight of the gods, and you would have had too much respect for the opinions of men. I am sure, therefore, that you know the nature of piety and impiety. Speak out then, my dear Euthyphro, and do not hide your knowledge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Euth. Another time, Socrates; for I am in a hurry, and must go now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soc. Alas! my companion, and will you leave me in despair? I was hoping that you would instruct me in the nature of piety and impiety; and then I might have cleared myself of Meletus and his indictment. I would have told him that I had been enlightened by Euthyphro, and had given up rash innovations and speculations, in which I indulged only through ignorance, and that now I am about to lead a better life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;John W. Loftus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frankly, it's actually quite stressful to even respond to your arrogant response.  Let me explain: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your response is not contrite or repentant - you simply use your attempt at an apology to further convey your hopes that I will read your book.  No way!  And then you have the audacity to compare yourself to "important skeptics in history", as if their rudeness excuses yours, and as if you are "one of the important skeptics".  YOU JUST DON'T GET IT, DO YOU???  Apparently you simply don't have the behavior skills to know how to treat people.  Perhaps I should excuse you for that, except that a man of your learning SHOULD know how to treat people, especially strangers.  No thanks; I'll continue to read after the many wonderful atheist intellects who actually know how to treat people, and yet are quite direct/blunt about their subject, NOT toward their constituents.  You sir, need to take a good long look at your personality, humble yourself, and become a person who treats others (especially strangers) with a dose of kindness instead of unwarranted slap-in-the-face arrogant opinions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I read quite a few blogs/research on you, so at least I now realize I'm not the only one you've offended - that seems to be your nature, no matter your claim that "it does bother me to offend people though, so I don't know where or why you get the impression I am not a kind person."  Well take a look in the mirror, sir, your actions (arrogant inappropriate criticism in your 2 replies to me) speak much louder.  I fear you are more harm than good for the atheist, freethought, naturalism causes. I will respond accordingly when I hear your name in a conversation, etc.&lt;br&gt;With sadness,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would find it very surprising that you concluded all of this from my initial comment to you. I suspect you already thought this way about me. If I'm so abrasive and rude why do you think I care about what you think of me? Why wouldn't such a person just ignore you or tell you off? What blogs are you talking about anyway? Yes there is criticism of me, plenty of it. I could respond to it if I knew what you were talking about. In my book I tell some pretty embarrasing things about myself which believers have mischaracterized and misrepresented all over the web because they don't like my arguments, my influence, or me as an atheist debunking their religion. And yes, when personally attacked I have not responded kindly. Actually I did, but when that didn't work I blasted them. I tried humor, everything I could think of to no avail. Their goal is to poison the well so that my books are not read and it's worked with you. I don't know what to say anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Call me and I'll explain more if you'd like. I'm no saint, that's for sure. But please call. *Phone number*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best,&lt;br&gt;John&lt;br&gt;------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether he calls me or not and whether we eventually see eye to eye isn't the issue here, although I hope we do. I'm looking for some helpful advice on his view of me. I'm personally attacked every day. What's the best response to people who personally attack me? Should I respond at all?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3585526443138848928?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an indication of the length of my personal ‘to-do’ list that, though I managed to see and even review the new movie about &lt;a href="http://www.lablit.com/article/543"&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve only just got around to uploading &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/sets/72157622460226830/"&gt;my photos&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.thamesfestival.org/"&gt;Thames Festival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3956774102/" title="jazz hands by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2423/3956774102_044331f099.jpg" height="479" alt="jazz hands" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jazz hands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had planned to wonder and pontificate on the wondrousness of fireworks, and how the heck you you get those beautiful shapes, and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3956006841/" title="Butterfly by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2634/3956006841_3512b5515f.jpg" height="500" alt="Butterfly" width="491"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Butterfly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m so tired right now that I think what I’m going to do is link to a site that tells you &lt;a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Fireworks/"&gt;how to make fireworks&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3956765880/" title="Here come the Vorlons by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2488/3956765880_566d441104.jpg" height="500" alt="Here come the Vorlons" width="377"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Vorlons on approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and simply marvel at the prettiness of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to know how they get some of those effects, though. I found a website that probably tells me—even me!—too much about &lt;a href="http://www.pyroguide.com/index.php?title=Main_Page"&gt;pyrotechnics&lt;/a&gt; (although looking at the writing on that page, I do wonder if they think &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/ennis/blog/2009/09/23/cbc-crazy-broadcasting-comments#comment-43919"&gt;swine flu is a conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’m just going to say ‘Oooh’ and ‘Aaah’. And point out that you don’t need a &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/scurry/blog/2009/09/23/virus-illusion-confusion"&gt;crap camera in an iPhone&lt;/a&gt; to get cool effects: sometimes it’s deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;

I am trying to tell myself that I am going to see some amazing science and that this will be very good for my career.  I am telling myself that I am going to have the opportunity to share some of our exciting new data with some collaborators, but the reality is that my heart is a little sick about leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday I had a conversation with folks in the lab about goals for the week while I am gone, and I feel very comfortable that they will achieve them while I am away.  I know that the time away will give me the opportunity to finalize the two articles that are sitting on my desk (er, harddrive) waiting to go out, finish the planning for our next study, and look at new data that we've collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn't make leaving home for this long any easier.  Little Isis is at an age where each week presents some new achievement or interest.  These last few weeks Little Isis has been all about &lt;a href="http://www.nickjr.com/shows/blue/index.jhtml"&gt;Blue's Clues&lt;/a&gt; and on Thursday we took him out and bought him his very own handy, dandy notebook.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today he decided that our dog had been a very, very good boy this morning and that he deserved a sticker....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is also very excited about dressing himself...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/09/dr_isis_is_leaving/Picture%20013.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/09/dr_isis_is_leaving/Picture%20013-thumb-350x262-19724.jpg" alt="Picture 013.jpg" height="262" width="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! We are making a dent in the calloused shells of the media psychics out there! &lt;strong&gt;FORCE ONE &lt;/strong&gt;is prying the lid off this slimy can of weasels and we are starting to make a difference. Despite the spamming maneuvers and several vicious death threats from those who know their days are numbered, it has come to the attention of the Skeptologist team that many of the bottom feeders who are the most egregious peddlers of woo are now beginning to run for cover. Our recent coded &lt;strong&gt;FORCE ONE&lt;/strong&gt; operation has shown positive signs of success. We have just begun to fight.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;That’s right. Not only has Psychic Guy been forced to amend his phony on-line A&amp;amp;E resume, but Sylvia Browne is now officially cancelling Los Angeles ”Final Tour ” extravaganzas. Final indeed…  We can only hope she crawls back to the rock she lived under before the 90’s and stays there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people, who I need not mention but who are also getting “edgy” with the dawning of a more militant skepticism, are trying in vain to pin the tail on a fast-moving donkey that is hitting with guerrilla swiftness and planting the seeds of discontent deep within the most secure websites of woodom. We need to go viral and are working on those vectors. &lt;strong&gt;FORCE ONE &lt;/strong&gt;has both short term and very long term plans in motion to cause big ripples in even the most placid pools of blissful flim-flam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:148px"&gt;&lt;img title="es" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/es3.jpg" alt="Dude, where&amp;#39;s my Sylvia?" width="138" height="103"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dude, where&amp;#39;s my Sylvia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the going gets tough and people start to come out of the woodwork with an incredibly horrifying spewing of their hatred at us, we must be doing something right.  Threats are piling up. I’m not sure any of the people here at Skepticblog really deserve all the vitriol being thrown our way, but I would like to thank the radical elements who are showing their true colors and giving us all a chance to read for ourselves the kind of knuckle-dragging cro mags that are so outraged by anyone who would ask for proof for any single one of the claims they are feeding on. It’s amazing really. We only want to help, but any questioning is being met with total overreaction and hostility. We must be touching a nerve of some prehistoric form of mortal blasphemy. So Mote it BE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:143px"&gt;&lt;img title="K34CAKLD34ZCAUXUBZECA33RTJ0CATUPHG2CA5TG5NVCA9G6IKDCA0NVNPKCAYV23G1CAC50OD6CAO42Z9RCA2VYmanM" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/K34CAKLD34ZCAUXUBZECA33RTJ0CATUPHG2CA5TG5NVCA9G6IKDCA0NVNPKCAYV23G1CAC50OD6CAO42Z9RCA2VYmanM.jpg" alt="Family Values 2009?" width="133" height="127"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family Values 2009?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wake up all you sleeping skeptical giants out there! Catch the wave and join in the fray. So far, the Internet shuddering has been a non-violent reaction and I can promise that those who are making the most violent threats against myself and others can expect to be visited upon by dark forces far more corporeal than the demons and ghosties their psychic gurus tell them are lurking over their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more heinous among these acomplices to fraud are performing illegal Internet applications. These actions shadow the blatant criminality practiced by their revered psychic mediums who are semi-protected by their handlers who keep them in the media spotlight. The cyber- henchmen believers are so fascinated with their quest for psychic “gifts” from The Other Side and so deluded in their obsession, they obey the woo with a charateristic zombie-like devotion. It’s some scary stuff folks. And just in time for Halloween…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the law provides stiff penalties for making threats against free thoughts or actions against thinking people who might choose to non-violently express those thoughts. Those who rail and promote violence against common sense critical thinking in matters of the paranormal – or anything else that doesn’t have some solid proof to back it up –  are just plain crazy people and absolute nut-bags. There’s no excuse for their maniacal bullying. In previous eras these miscreants might have been locked up in a rubber room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not taking or planning any illegal actions or threatening physical harm to anyone. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;As an adjunct to The Skeptologists,&lt;strong&gt; FORCE ONE&lt;/strong&gt;simply shines the light of scientific knowledge into neglected places where treacherous deceit and stupyfying ignorance are taking a terrible toll. If we cause any one of the phonies out there to think twice before making outrageous claims they know damn well they can’t back up with even a speck of solid evidence, those losers are going to find themeselves under a very powerful publicity microscope. It starts with a tiny committment to actually get out and do something. We are growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Yes, … and all this without having to boil a single frog on television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

"What if someone won the JREF $1,000,000 Challenge?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what if? Let's consider. In order for someone to win the challenge, one of two things would have to happen. Either someone would have to fool us into believing they had paranormal powers, or they'd actually have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first situation is carefully guarded against. The claimant's protocols are reviewed by magicians and statisticians before approval, and a lot of effort is expended to ensure that a crafty conjurer can't get past us. Those who were at TAM 7 can testify that the situation was carefully controlled, and the audience was unaware of many other precautions that were in place. So far, so good—no one has fooled us yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The second situation is much more interesting.</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253995647735"><id gr:original-id="http://www.opticalfutures.com/vitamin_d_sun_bed_study">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c3b20974c98ce9dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Vitamin D and sun bed UV</title><published>2009-09-26T14:52:11Z</published><updated>2009-09-26T14:52:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/8rGb5PK-p0s/vitamin_d_sun_bed_study" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.opticalfutures.com/vitamin_d_sun_bed_study"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Light is good for your health.

Sometimes I’m walking past a group of people, or at a party when the room suddenly goes quiet, except for one person shouting something over a din which is no longer there.  The best ones are the kind that leave me mystified as to what could possibly have led to such a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent example happened at Dragon*Con, as Tim3P0 and I were navigating the elevators in one of the hotels, trying to get from one place to another.  This girl passed us, very agitated, asking her friend, “What is it with Hermione?!  Everyone’s got a hard-on for Hermione?!”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you share this appreciation?  What are some of the best out of context moments you’ve witnessed?&lt;br&gt;

But what is the source of MMP-9 ? In a study published in 2006, Nozawa and co-workers, using the RIP1-Tag2 transgenic mouse as a model, identified two inflammatory cell types, neutrophils and macrophages, as the major sources of MMP-9.The RIP1-Tag2 transgenic mouse is a well characterized model of multistep carcinogenesis involving the pancreatic islets. Nozawa and co-workers first isolated constituent cell types from a tumor and cell-sorted Gr-1+ and Mac-1+ cells and then carried out a semi-quantitative RT-PCR (see Fig.1)Fig. 1: Semi-quantitative RT-PCR. MMP-9+ is expressed by Gr-1+ and Mac-1+cells innate immune cells (Adapted from Nozawa et. al, 2006)Clearly, MMP-9 was expressed predominantly by innate immune cells positive for the Gr-1 and Mac-1 markers.In order to determine the localization of these cells , a double label immunohistochemical staining of various leukocyte markers in normal and neoplastic tissue was performed. CD68 and F4/80 are two macrophage markers. Cells positive for both markers were observed inside as well as on the periphery of angiogenic islets and tumors (see Fig. 2). However, the cells inside were MMP-9- while those along the periphery were MMP-9+ Fig. 2: MMP-9+ macrophages located along the periphery of the angiogenic islet.Macrophages inside the islet were MMP-9- (Adapted from Nozawa et. al, 2006)Along similar lines, an antibody against the "7/4" (a neutrophil marker) was used to localize neutrophils. Suprisingly, the situation, this time, was the opposite. 7/4+ cells inside the lesions were also MMP-9+ while 7/4+ cells along the periphery were not (see Fig. 3). All  7/4+ cells also displayed polymorphic nuclei, strongly indicating that these cells were neutrophils.Fig. 3: MMP-9+ neutrophils located inside the angiogenic islet. Neutrophils along the periphery of the islet were MMP-9- (Adapted from Nozawa et. al, 2006)Neutrophils (7/4+ and Gr-1+) represented only 0.4% of the total tumor cells and expressed high levels of MMP-9. In contrast, macrophages (CD68+) represented 2% of the total tumor cells and expressed low levels of MMP-9.The researchers then tried to determine the role of these MMP-9+...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

His wife Erla took over his estate and she died in 2003.  After that, their five grandchildren stood to inherit at least $250,000 apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was &lt;a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2009/September/106982.pdf"&gt;only one catch&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).  According to Max’s will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… any such descendant who married outside the Jewish faith or whose non-Jewish spouse did not convert to Judaism within one year of marriage would be “deemed deceased for all purposes of this instrument as of the date of such marriage” and that descendant’s share of the trust would revert to [Max&amp;#39;s two children] Michael or Leila.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Feinberg specified in his will that the grandchildren would only receive the money &lt;em&gt;if they married a Jewish person&lt;/em&gt;, essentially to carry on his own heritage and faith — Marry a gentile and you’re cut from the will.  (If the grandchildren were “deceased” or married to a non-Jew, Max’s children would split that share of the money.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the dis-inherited grandchildren filed a lawsuit.  Lower courts sided with her.  It made sense because of all the theoretical problems — for example, would the will encourage a grandchild to marry a Jew, get the inheritance money, then get divorced the next day and marry someone else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case made it to the Illinois Supreme Court.  That court had to decide whether or not it was legal to allow wills to “base inheritance on someone’s marriage and religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j8QwP4ZvRjh-5EDghmS7q9wwP_DgD9ATU9L80"&gt;the court issued its ruling&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The will was acceptable.  Max could say that his beneficiaries would only receive their share of the inheritance if they followed his personal wishes about their religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The state Supreme Court based much of its decision on the fact that [now deceased wife] Erla Feinberg’s will awarded set amounts of money based on the marriage status of the grandchildren at the time of her 2003 death — either they qualified for the money or they didn’t. The court said that meant the will didn’t try to control what the grandchildren would do in the future and didn’t offer any incentive for a particular couple to divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A will that provided money year after year if the heir did not marry a gentile might not pass muster, the court suggested. That’s because it would amount to a dead man trying to control actions for years to come and would encourage divorces so that people could claim an inheritance.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court &lt;a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2009/September/106982.pdf"&gt;said in the ruling&lt;/a&gt; (PDF):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There is no question that a grandparent in Max’s situation is entirely free during his lifetime to attempt to influence his grandchildren to marry within his family’s religious tradition, even by offering financial incentives to do so. The question is, given our public policy of testamentary freedom, did Max’s beneficiary restriction clause as given effect by Erla’s appointment violate any other public policy of the state of Illinois, thus rendering it void?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their answer was no, it did not.  In fact, they sided with Max in large part because all the hypotheticals were eliminated.  The money would be awarded, they said, based on the status of the grandchildren in 2003, the day that his wife Erla died — “either they qualified for the money or they didn’t.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The court said that meant the will didn’t try to control what the grandchildren would do in the future and didn’t offer any incentive for a particular couple to divorce.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, did they get the decision right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyer and atheist activist &lt;strong&gt;Rob Sherman&lt;/strong&gt; says &lt;a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/godless-in-chicago/2009/09/il-sup-court-got-it-right-in-jews-only-inheritance-case.html"&gt;they did&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The disgruntled granddaughter doesn’t seem to understand that it’s Grandpa’s and Grandma’s money, to do with as they please.  They didn’t owe her a cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max and Erla could have given all of their money to their children, instead of to the grandchildren.  They could have given all of their money to charity, leaving nothing to family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the granddaughter doesn’t seem to understand is that the executor of the estate is required to act in the same way that the deceased would have acted if the deceased were still alive to distribute the money himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Max and Erla’s money.  They could have given their own money to anybody they wanted to.  It’s their money, to do with as they please.  If granddaughter doesn’t like it, too bad.  It’s not her money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-jewish-will-disinherit-25-sep25,0,6525128.story"&gt;Scholars also agree&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Steven Resnicoff, co-director of the DePaul College of Law’s Center for Jewish Law &amp;amp; Judaic Studies, hailed the court decision as consistent with Illinois public policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just a Jewish clause. It’s a Catholic clause. It’s a Muslim clause,” Resnicoff said. “It’s not uncommon that people want to encourage children to follow in their footsteps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today’s decision emphasizes the principle that, with some exceptions, a person is free to allocate his or her assets as the person sees fit.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, just up on the National Center for Science Education website: three reviews of evidence-for-evolution books:  &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/rncse/29/3/review-only-theory"&gt;Andrea Bottaro &lt;/a&gt;reviews Kenneth Miller’s &lt;em&gt;Only a Theory&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/rncse/29/3/review-evolution-what-fossils-say-why-it-matters"&gt;Peter Dodson&lt;/a&gt; reviews Donald Prothero’s &lt;em&gt;Evolution&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters&lt;/em&gt;, and, coincidentally, &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/rncse/29/3/review-why-evolution-is-true"&gt;Donald Prothero&lt;/a&gt; reviews &lt;em&gt;Why Evolution is True&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodson is a bit critical of Prothero’s book (which I’ve praised highly &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/22/don-protheros-superb-book-on-the-fossil-record/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and I want to say a few words about this.  Dodson calls out Prothero for being too harsh about creationism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do have a complaint, however. The book preaches to the converted. Its polemical tone can become wearying and may produce the unintended effect of nudging undecided readers in the wrong direction. Poorly disguising his contempt, Prothero’s rhetoric is sometimes over the top, as when he refers to “hard working, dedicated, self-sacrificing biologists who spend years enduring harsh conditions in the field” in contrast to “creationists who sit in their comfortable homes and write drivel” (p 113). Please! The facts of paleontology stand on their own. They do not need to be undermined by rhetorical shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins’s new book, &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/em&gt;, was also criticized by several reviewers for being too hard on creationists — for labeling them “history deniers” and comparing them to those who would deny, for instance, that the Roman Empire ever existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to defend Dawkins and Prothero here (I haven’t suffered such accusations about my book) on two counts.  First, the whole &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to write books like mine, Donald’s, and Richard’s comes from resurgent creationism.  You don’t write a book about the evidence for evolution in a vacuum: you have to have a &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt;, and the most pressing reason is that religiously-motivated creationists keep denying that evolution is true.  They offer the alternative hypothesis of creationism, whether it be Biblical literalism or intelligent design.  It therefore seems perfectly fair to discuss evolution as one of the two main going hypotheses for the origin and diversity of life, and to show — vigorously — that only the evolutionary alternative has empirical support.  You simply cannot do this without discussing creationists and their claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, most of us who teach evolution simply get frustrated with the witless nattering of creationists who refuse to honestly address the mountain of evidence for evolution.  Some of that frustration seeps into our writings. And that &lt;em&gt;humanizes&lt;/em&gt; our writings. We are not emotionless drones; we have feelings and we show them. As Philip Pullman has pointed out,  one reason why Dawkins’s books are so popular is because the reader not only senses a human being behind the prose, but discerns what that person is &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the degree of seepage varies: Richard, for example, talks more about creationism than I do.  But I don’t think that he, or Prothero, crosses the line into pure invective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is a matter of taste.  Some people like their evolution with a bit of bite, others like it completely unsullied by criticism of creationism. To each their own.  Certainly Dawkins’s and Prothero’s books have found legions of appreciative readers.  But more important is Dodson’s claim that Prothero’s rhetoric “may produce the unintended effect of nudging undecided readers in the wrong direction.”  This is the familiar claim that if we are &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; vociferous in criticizing creationism, its religious roots, or religion in general, we’ll actually turn people &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from evolution.  Well, at least Dodson hedges by saying “may,” instead of asserting, like Mooney and Kirshenbaum, that it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; nudge the undecided toward creationism. In the end, we simply have no data.  Maybe such rhetoric actually helps &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt; evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bjørn Østman discusses the matter (he thinks Prothero doesn’t go far enough!) on his website &lt;a href="http://pleion.blogspot.com/2009/09/ncse-reviews.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pleiotropy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (note the comment by Prothero).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.europlanet-eu.org/demo/images/stories/ep/news/epsc2009/cabeus_a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/smart-1_cabeus_a.jpg" alt="smart-1_cabeus_a" title="smart-1_cabeus_a" width="610" height="504"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact site is the crater Cabeus-A, the largish crater to the left of center. The resolution of the image is about 50 meters/pixel, and the field of view is about 50 km (30 miles) across. The crater is near the Moon’s south pole, and the bottom is permanently in shadow. See the shadow across the crater? As the Moon spins and orbits the Earth, that shadow never lifts, but instead moves around the crater floor like the hand of a celestial clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know there is water all over the Moon in small quantities, but is there a lake of frozen water under the crater’s dusty floor? When LCROSS impacts, we may find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image was taken by &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/SMART-1/SEMKTCBUQPE_0.html"&gt;SMART-1&lt;/a&gt;, an ambitious ESA spacecraft that orbited the Moon for nearly two years. Its ultimate fate? &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/09/03/lunar-smackdown/"&gt;It too impacted the lunar surface&lt;/a&gt; in September 2006. While that impact wasn’t meant to hunt for water, it did kick up some dust, &lt;a href="http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/News/Smart1/"&gt;and made a flash bright enough to be detected from Earth&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of five remarkable new fossils has confirmed that birds evolved from dinosaurs, Chinese scientists said last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . . . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feathers cover the arms and tail, but also the feet, suggesting that a four-winged stage may have existed in the transition to birds. The fossils will also help scientists work out the mechanics of how early birds flew. The specimens have been identified as types of Anchiornis huxleyi. The details of the find will also be announced in &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These are known as private or publicly limited companies. The word &lt;em&gt;Limited&lt;/em&gt; - so familiar that it is hardly noticed - has to be added to the company name so as to signal to investors and customers that the company members - the shareholders - only have &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt; liability in the case of business failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The limited company exists separate from its (company of) &lt;em&gt;shareholders&lt;/em&gt;. It can enter into contracts and own property; it will legally exist, even if every shareholder died the next day; and it can sue and be sued, and also be prosecuted as a defendant under criminal law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;All this because a company in law is a corporation, and so has legal personality; and in law, as with dogs, personality can go a long way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/Sr5Eyi-atiI/AAAAAAAAAMs/4Ghz9DaAjNM/s1600-h/PF.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:225px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/Sr5Eyi-atiI/AAAAAAAAAMs/4Ghz9DaAjNM/s400/PF.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are other corporations which cannot sue for libel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A local authority is a corporation. Like a limited company, it can contract and own property; it exists separate to the councillors and the officers; it can (generally) sue and be sued, and sometimes even prosecuted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, a local corporation cannot sue for libel, and nor can most other statutory corporations discharging public functions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is because of an important &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/6.html"&gt; House of Lords decision&lt;/a&gt; reported in 1993.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Derbyshire County Council had sued the Times Newspaper for libel. As a corporation under English law, it was presumed that it could sue for libel. It had personality, and it had a reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the House of Lords held - as a matter of principle - a local authority could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sue for defamation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a public body to do so would be an unwarranted and undesirable limitation upon freedom of speech. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was not even a "defence" - the right to sue did not exist in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However damaging the allegation - and it was not doubted that a local authority had a reputation which could be defamed (ie, de-&lt;em&gt;famed&lt;/em&gt;, or damaged) - the public interest meant that such actions could not be brought. And this ruling has been taken to mean by lawyers that no public authority - not just local authorities - can sue for libel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if a libel case cannot be brought, they cannot be threatened; and so there is not even a chilling effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accordingly, I can type the following about a particular statutory corporation without any fear whatsoever:-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The General Chiropractic Council happily promotes (and regulates) bogus treatments for which there is not a jot of evidence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am safe because the GCC are a statutory corporation discharging a public function, and so I have the protection of the &lt;em&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/em&gt; rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All this of course brings me to the British Chiropractic Association.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA are suing Simon Singh for libel for saying about the BCA what I have just said about the GCC, but the BCA can sue because they are a company. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, perhaps crucially, they are &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a limited company. They do not have shareholders; they do not pay dividends; they do not make a commercial profit. They do not need to put the word "Limited" at the end of their name.  It legally exists for a non-commercial purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA are a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_limited_by_guarantee"&gt;Company Limited By Guarantee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Their company details are &lt;a href="http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/a13a287d63ecd0522548b70e8134c095/compdetails"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(It is interesting to read the examples in Wikipedia of other companies limited by guarantee.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such legal entities exist so that charities and non-profit entities can still have legal personality: so they can contract and hold property.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But should such entities really be able to sue for defamation?  Or to have the benefit of a chilling effect which comes from being able to sue?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On one hand, they are indeed corporations with a reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, they are corporations legally structured so to give effect to non-commercial activities, usually promoting a public or charitable good. They are classed as "companies" really just as a matter of legal convenience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some may think that this makes companies limited by guarantee more akin to the public authorities barred from suing under the &lt;em&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/em&gt; rule, rather than to commercial companies with shareholders and dividends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is (as far as I know) no legal authority directly on this point. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon Singh had asked the High Court to rule on this in the preliminary hearing, but there was an adjournment immediately after the unfavourable ruling on meaning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The issue is therefore still entirely open, and so even if Simon Singh loses the Court of Appeal application on the meaning point, he can still ask for a High Court ruling on this "corporate point" - and in turn appeal any adverse ruling to the Court of Appeal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA do not really have a trading reputation to protect; they have legal personality just so to promote (happily or otherwise) chiropractic and their member chiropractors, both of which are health matters for legitimate public debate and scrutiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if the House of Lords is correct in &lt;em&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/em&gt;, why can I not then criticise the BCA when I can happily criticise the GCC for exactly the same failings?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this a bogus distinction?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please use a name when posting, as it facilitates references by others in the discussion.

These include wildly inflated publication and citation counts (which Jacso compares to Bernie Madoff's profit reports), numerous missing author names, and phantom authors assigned by the parser that Google elected to use to extract metadata, rather than using the metadata offered them by scholarly publishers and indexing/abstracting services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its stupor, the parser fancies as author names (parts of) section titles, article titles, journal names, company names, and addresses, such as Methods (42,700 records), Evaluation (43,900), Population (23,300), Contents (25,200), Technique(s) (30,000), Results (17,900), Background (10,500), or—in a whopping number of records— Limited (234,000) and Ltd (452,000). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this a serious problem is that many people regard the Google Scholar metadata as a reliable index of scholarly influence and reputation, particularly now that there are tools like the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/citations-gadget/"&gt;Google Scholar Citation Count&lt;/a&gt; gadget by Jan Feyereisl and the &lt;a href="http://www.harzing.com/pop.htm"&gt;Publish or Perish&lt;/a&gt; software produced by Tarma Software, both of which take Google Scholar's metadata at face value. True, the data provided by traditional abstracting and indexing services are far from perfect, but their errors are dwarfed by those of Google Scholar, Jacso says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you could argue that Google's responsibilities with Google Scholar aren't quite analogous to those with Google Book, where the settlement has to pass federal scrutiny and where Google has obligations to the research libraries that provided the scans. Still, you have to feel sorry for any academic whose tenure or promotion case rests in part on the accuracy of one of Google's algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoff Nunberg</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253982777642"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1769">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e7b63fd2d56c30be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Peeving"/><title type="html">Memetic dynamics of summative cliches</title><published>2009-09-26T16:10:31Z</published><updated>2009-09-26T16:10:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1769" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following up on &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1768"&gt;this morning's post&lt;/a&gt; about phrases that some people find irritating, I thought that I'd take a look at the recent history of one of them, "At the end of the day", which was the Plain English Campaign's 2004 &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000633.html"&gt;"most irritating phrase in the language".&lt;/a&gt; Geoff Pullum ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000638.html"&gt;Irritating cliches? Get a life&lt;/a&gt;", 3/25/2004) took this phrase to "have a meaning somewhere in the same region as &lt;em&gt;after all&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;all in all&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the bottom line is&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;when the chips are down&lt;/em&gt;", and he observes that it "may shock people by its complete bleaching away of temporal meaning", resulting in things like "at the end of the day, you've got to get up in the morning".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22at+the+end+of+the+day%22&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;btnG=Search+Archives"&gt;Google News Archive search for "at the end of the day"&lt;/a&gt; shows a rapid recent rise in hits from around 1985 onward.  But so do some similar phrases, like  &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22when+all+is+said+and+done%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;amp;scoring=a"&gt;"when all is said and done"&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn't seem to have incurred the ire of peevers to nearly the same extent. So I thought I'd look at the relative frequency of four phrases with similar meanings: "in the last analysis", "in the final analysis", "when all is said and done", and "at the end of the day".  I queried the Google News archive in 5-year increments from 1951 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raw counts are &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/EndOfDay.txt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a plot of proportions shows a striking increase, from about 1975 on, in the frequency of "at the end of the day" relative to the other alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's nice to see that peevers like the PEC are responding, even if irrationally, to a genuine change in their linguistic environment, rather than amplifying purely internal psychic noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — The OED has an entry for the &amp;quot;hackneyed phrase&amp;quot; glossed as &amp;quot;eventually; when all&amp;#39;s said and done&amp;quot;, with citations only from 1974:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1974&lt;/strong&gt; H. MCKEATING &lt;em&gt;God &amp;amp; Future&lt;/em&gt; vi. 96 Eschatological language is useful because it is a convenient way of indicating..what at the end of the day we set most store by. &lt;strong&gt;1976 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Notts. Echo&lt;/em&gt; 16 Dec. 1/4 ‘At the end of the day,’ he stated, ‘this verifies what I have been saying against the cuts in public expenditure.’ &lt;strong&gt;1978&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Jrnl. R. Soc. Arts&lt;/em&gt; CXXVI. 213/2, I want to make a number of points to you, which we believe invalidate..the recommendations they make at the end of the day. &lt;strong&gt;1982&lt;/strong&gt; B. BEAUMONT &lt;em&gt;Thanks to Rugby&lt;/em&gt; iii. 39 But, at the end of the day, it is an amateur sport and everyone is free to put as much or as little into the game as he chooses. &lt;strong&gt;1986&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt; 17 Nov. 4 At the end of the day businessmen can talk to the city in a way chief executives cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1974 is way late for the first &amp;quot;hackneyed&amp;quot; usage — was this phrase born hackneyed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy enough to antedate it — W.H. Auden wrote in &lt;em&gt;Passenger Shanty&lt;/em&gt; (from Poems 1936-39):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8   The passengers are rather triste ,&lt;br&gt;
9   There's many a fool, and many a beast,&lt;br&gt;
10   Who ought to go west, but is bound for the East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11   Mr. Jackson buys rubber and sells it again,&lt;br&gt;
12   He paints in oils and he drinks champagne,&lt;br&gt;
13   Says: 'I should have been born in Elizabeth's reign.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14   His wife learns astrology out of a book,&lt;br&gt;
15   Says: 'Your horoscope's queer and I don't like its look.&lt;br&gt;
16   With the Moon against Virgo you might be a crook.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17   The planter tells us: 'In Malay&lt;br&gt;
18   We play rugger in March and cricket in May&lt;br&gt;
19   But feel starved for sex at the end of the day.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20   The journalist Capa plays dicing games,&lt;br&gt;
21   He photographed Teruel Town in flames,&lt;br&gt;
22   He pinches the bottoms of all the dames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23   The Dominican monks get up with the sun,&lt;br&gt;
24   They're as fond of their dinner as anyone,&lt;br&gt;
25   And they have their own mysterious fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though perhaps Auden's planter meant that literally, I'm not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, even earlier, ambiguous antedating — a poem by William Canton with the title &amp;quot;At the end of the day&amp;quot;, 1902:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1   Two on a moor befogged I found. One sat,&lt;br&gt;
2      Hunched on a stone, beside a burnt-out fire.&lt;br&gt;
3   One posed with drabbled peacock-feathered hat.&lt;br&gt;
4      And both were old, starved, squalid in attire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5   "You seem," said I to him upon the stone,&lt;br&gt;
6      "Old friends new met in unexpected woe."&lt;br&gt;
7   "Yes," sighed the man; "my name is &lt;em&gt;Had-I-known&lt;/em&gt; ."&lt;br&gt;
8      &amp;quot;And his?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Oh, his!&amp;quot; he laughed—&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;I-told-you-so&lt;/em&gt; ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely unambiguous is Ella Wheeler Wilcox's 1916 &lt;em&gt;The Things That Count&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1   Now , dear, it isn't the bold things,&lt;br&gt;
2   Great deeds of valour and might,&lt;br&gt;
3   That count the most in the summing up of life at the end of the day.&lt;br&gt;
4   But it is the doing of old things,&lt;br&gt;
5   Small acts that are just and right;&lt;br&gt;
6   And doing them over and over again, no matter what others say;&lt;br&gt;
7   In smiling at fate, when you want to cry, and in keeping at work when you want to play—&lt;br&gt;
8   Dear, those are the things that count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this phrase was "born hackneyed" after all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even earlier is Benjamin Disraeli's 1847 &lt;em&gt;Tancred&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;As for Keferinis, although he was very conversable, the companions observed that he always made it a rule to dilate upon subjects and countries with which he had no acquaintance, and he expressed himself in so affected a manner, and with such an amplification of useless phraseology, that, though he was always talking, they seemed at the end of the day to be little more acquainted with the Ansarey and their sovereign than when Baroni first opened the subject of their visit to Darkush at Damascus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, they are still &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; — sick people, damaged people, often abused people, sometimes psychopathic people. They have to be treated with due process and concern — we want to end the behavior, not the individual. So now &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090925/od_nm/us_castration"&gt;Poland has passed a law requiring mandatory chemical castration for pedophiles&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;#39;s a frightening prospect, not just because it&amp;#39;s a punishment that can and will be abused — who judged Alan Turing but the state? — and the attitudes behind it are even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Donald Tusk said late last year he wanted obligatory castration for pedophiles, whom he branded 'degenerates'. Tusk said he did not believe "one can use the term 'human' for such individuals, such creatures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not human? Wow. Forget castration, let's just have summary executions. Perhaps we'll soon see pedophile meat on sale in Polish markets? Wouldn't want them to go to waste, after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the temptation to go organic, though, I don't think we want to have free-range pedophiles. Instead, we'll have to go with battery 'philes, raised in the cells of the local monasteries and churches. And if you find that offensive, I suggest you direct your complaints to the Polish government officials who have just branded a small portion of their citizenry as inhuman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/barbarism_in_poland.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/KhsLyWEWgts" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253979323991"><id gr:original-id="http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/09/panic-in-fmri-scanner.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c2859f7110c353df</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Panic!

The scan lasted 40 minutes, and everything was going smoothly until quite near the end, when out of the blue, she had a panic attack.Obviously, the scan had to be abandoned, but the researchers, not wanting the data they had got to go to waste, decided to see what happened in the woman&amp;#39;s brain just as the panic started.The top graph here shows her heart rate. It starts increasing a bit and then spikes, which shows exactly when the attack occurred. What about the brain? Well, amygdala and left insula activity sort of increase around this time. A bit. If you stare at the lines hard enough.If you believe they did, it makes sense because the amygdala is known to be involved in anxiety (amongst other things) while the insula is responsible for the perception of the body&amp;#39;s internal state, which is rather out of whack during a panic attack.What doesn&amp;#39;t make sense is the middle temporal gyrus bit, which was statistically the only part of the brain where activity was significantly correlated with heart rate (in whole-brain analysis). That region is not believed to have anything to do with panic, and to be honest, it&amp;#39;s probably just a fluke.This is only the second published report about panic during fMRI. There was one previous paper from 2006 about an attack in someone with a history of panic, which also found amygdala activation. But there are sure to be others out there which haven&amp;#39;t made it into print - anxiety and panic during scans is not unheard of (the scanner is rather claustrophobic). It would be interesting to get more data on this, because it&amp;#39;s obviously rather hard to research real-life panic attacks, on account of them being unpredictable.Spiegelhalder, K., Hornyak, M., Kyle, S., Paul, D., Blechert, J., Seifritz, E., Hennig, J., Tebartz van Elst, L., Riemann, D., &amp;amp; Feige, B.

Three You Might Have Missed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“And he tells me he loves me… and then he’s not there anymore.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“And then how do you feel?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Okay, fine. Well, I feel looked after, I suppose. I feel watched over. You see, he never says anything profound or earth-shattering - you know, he doesn’t say ‘God thinks this’… or the planet or world events or ‘there is no God’. Just ‘go to bed, brush your teeth’ or the way I brush my teeth, because I always brush them side to side and he’ll say ‘Down at the top! Come on, down at the top, up at the bottom!’ … or ‘lock the back door’…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How long ago did Jamie die? Nina? Jamie? When was it he died?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0841027/"&gt;Truly, Madly, Deeply&lt;/a&gt; - Directed by Anthony Mingella. With Alan Rickman, Juliet Stevenson and Bill Paterson.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdBl0opvUp0"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdBl0opvUp0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the films that I can pretty much recite from heart and recently embarrassed the hell out of myself at Dragon*Con whilst sitting around in the lounge on the nineteenth floor by STARTING to recite by heart, in front of a group of people. Thankfully, they didn’t throw empty bottles at me. I think some of them were rather fond of it too. Or just too bloody polite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s two reasons that immediately spring to mind (apart from it being a great film, of course) - firstly, it stars Alan Rickman and the woman that the director wrote it for, Juliet Stevenson. Secondly, it was part of the reason why I trained to become an English as a Second Language teacher, because I could relate to the frustration felt by the overseas characters who were being scammed and taken advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the poem by Pablo Neruda. Okay, that’s three, whatever. Hmph. There’s more, but that gives an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truly, Madly, Deeply&lt;/em&gt; is a film which frankly investigates the death of a loved-one and what realistically (considering it is, after all, a ghost movie) &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; happen if they return… ‘and things have changed’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if they’ve got new interests? What if you have moved on with your life? &lt;em&gt;What if they have suddenly developed a fetish for twenty-four hour movie marathons and start shifting about your furnishings around to accommodate this??&lt;/em&gt; I bet you thought being a ‘World of Warcraft Widow’ would be bad enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That and the fact that when I take a Russian novel (it must &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be a Russian novel) and &lt;em&gt;throw it into the air&lt;/em&gt;, it turns into a pigeon. It’s also the inspiration behind the &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=467"&gt;Australian song ‘Truly, Madly, Deeply’, by Australian band Savage Garden.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things being as they are, I found this film an enjoyable distraction during a difficult time. So, add more to the list if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

I have this magic  belief that gluten is not good for him. I went gluten-free myself for a couple  of months last year based on something someone I met in Central Park told me so I’m hardly one to make informed decisions about diet. It seemed like a harmless thing to do, and it dovetailed with my general calorie-cutting. In Alex’s case, I think I’d like him to go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:285px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/09/betty-crocker-cake.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/09/betty-crocker-cake.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of Betty Crocker" width="275" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of Betty Crocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wheat-free because he pretty much lives on wheat. Pretzels … Goldfish … saltines when he can get them. (Because of the crumbs, saltines are a controlled substance in our house.)  Almost from the minute he wakes up to the few minutes before bedtime, Alex stuffs his face with starchy crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I dream Alex and I are having an actual conversation. And my other dream is that Alex is eating real food. Not just an occasional grape or strawberry, but actual food. Part of this fantasy has me throwing out everything that Alex survives on — perhaps not the hot dogs, but the pretzels and crackers. In their place Alex could eat crunchy celery sticks, cucumber and apple slices, and the occasional piece of chocolate cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since lots of people do have their kids on gluten-free diets, they  might want to know that Betty Crocker now has &lt;a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/products/gluten-free"&gt;gluten-free baking mixes&lt;/a&gt;. I find this thrilling for reasons that are still unclear to me. Maybe I’m just glad to know that the  corporate world is starting to take note that there are special-needs people out  there, either with autism or celiac sprue or some other condition that makes it  difficult to find what they need in a traditional supermarket. And I still dream of Alex’s wheat-free or at least pretzel-free diet. I’d reward him with a piece of this delicious-looking &lt;a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes.aspx/chocolate-orange-cake"&gt;chocolate orange cake&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand the &lt;a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes.aspx/banana-cupcakes-with-browned-butter-frosting"&gt;banana cupcakes with browned butter frosting&lt;/a&gt; look awesome, too. All mixes and recipes seem to be getting quite a few high reader ratings. The company ran out of coupons good for a free box, so obviously these products are selling well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it’s no surprise that General Mills, which owns Betty Crocker,  started advertising their Rice Chex as gluten-free about a year ago. (I was very  pleased until everyone in the house decided that Rice Chex were the cereal they  had to have that very minute.) Now they seem to have &lt;a href="http://www.chex.com/Recipes/GlutenFree.aspx"&gt;expanded their gluten-free  offerings&lt;/a&gt; to include Corn Chex and some sugary varieties (strawberry, chocolate,  cinnamon, honey nut).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gluten-free or just thinking about it, it seems like changing your diet is much easier these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.inforum.com/event/comments/id/254062/"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; are a mix of the sane and the deranged. Fargo has some interesting people living up there—a lot of smart, sensible, rational people, and some some very noisy lunatics. It&amp;#39;s strange how the lunatics rarely show up for any of my talks, however, but they always have the most vivid opinions of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem is the end. The writer just had to do the usual thing of looking for a dissenting voice and giving them the unquestioned last word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rev. Jeff Sandgren, pastor at Olivet Lutheran Church in Fargo, said Thursday that he doesn't think science and religion need to be at odds.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He tells the story of an astronomy course he took in college and his introduction to the professor who taught it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Here comes this well-known physics professor and the guy is carrying two books, one was this great big astronomy book and the next one was the Bible," Sandgren recalled.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Mind you," Sandgren added, "this is a guy who has been working for NASA, he's a brilliant physicist and he says: 'I have two books in my hand, this one tells us how - and he holds up the astronomy book - and this book tells us who.'
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"For me," Sandgren said, "that's always been the dialectic I've lived with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, fine. He's always lived with insipid opinions. He's a pastor, I'm unsurprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But tell me…what, exactly, does that Bible contribute to students&amp;#39; understanding of astronomy, huh? It may say &amp;quot;who&amp;quot;, but so does the Bhagavad Gita, so do the Eddas, so do the local Anishinabe myths, so does Dr Seuss (it&amp;#39;s Cindy Lou Who, in case you forgot). Being a &amp;#39;guy who worked for NASA&amp;#39; does not confer infallibility or even a smidgen of authority in a discussion of the identity of invisible intelligent vapor wafting about outside the universe. Let&amp;#39;s hear some of the &lt;i&gt;arguments&lt;/i&gt;, rather than waving about holy books and second-hand physics degrees, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also feeling a bit cranky about the asymmetry of the situation. You won't catch me striding boldly into my classes with a biology textbook in one hand and &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; in the other, triumphantly announcing to the students that one book explains biology, and the other is the philosophy of atheism they should follow — that would be inappropriate, a distraction from the subject students were there to learn, and an unprofessional violation of my responsibilities as an instructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet here&amp;#39;s this guy proudly recounting tales from his college days when a bible-thumping bozo would come into a science class and preach Christian superstition. No wonder he&amp;#39;s a benighted peddler of hoary dogmas now, instead of an astronomer — he got screwed over in his education, and he&amp;#39;s not even aware of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/my_fargo_visit_makes_the_local.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/jr_LZc0HZe4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253976005282"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=9537">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/757940d1a5ab5744</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="YouTube"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><category term="Homeopathy"/><title type="html">David Mitchell and Dara O’Briain on Homeopathy &amp;amp; Psychics</title><published>2009-09-26T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-26T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/david-mitchell-and-dara-obriain-on-homeopathy-psychics/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve featured videos of &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/07/that-mitchell-and-webb-look-homeopathy/"&gt;both these guys&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/07/homeopathy-nutritionists-vs-real-science/"&gt;past Skepchick posts&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/DilbertCliches.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/DilbertCliches.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strip's first panel displays a number of stock items from the inventory of peevology, fixed-expression department.  For example, "at the end of the day" was at the top of the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000633.html"&gt;Plain English Campaign's 2004 list&lt;/a&gt; of the "most irritating phrases" in the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual complaint is that these phrases violate Orwell's injunction    to "Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print". But the complainers, in the very text of their complaints, generally &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000633.html"&gt;use their own collection&lt;/a&gt; of common "metaphors, similes, or other figures of speech", which typically occur in print even more often than the phrases that they're complaining about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Dilbert strip, Scott Adams suggests two different reasons for irritation. One is that the offending phrases are  stereotypically associated with a despised minority, in this case "managers". That's clearly a central part of the picture ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004244.html"&gt;The social psychology of linguistic naming and shaming&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, 2/27/2007) — but as we&amp;#39;ll see below, it&amp;#39;s not clear that these stereotypes are fair ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second charge is that the offending phrases are part of a broader pattern of linguistic crime, here "the vacuous way that managers speak". And again, the validity of this charge is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first place, each of the peeve-provoking phrases has apparently inoffensive counterparts, which are more or less equally frequent, and neither more nor less vacuous: "From now on, we'll skim the cream when all is said and done". This isn't stereotypical manager-speak, but it's not much of a contribution to corporate strategizing either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, if we look at how the constituent clichés are used in real life,  we don&amp;#39;t see a preponderance of  managers — at least not corporate ones — and we do see reasonable contributions to non-vacuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving forward&lt;/strong&gt;: As an adverbial meaning "from now on; in the future as distinct from the past", &lt;em&gt;going forward&lt;/em&gt; seems somewhat commoner than &lt;em&gt;moving forward&lt;/em&gt;. And on 1/2/2009, Toni Monkovic &lt;a href="http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/going-forward-cliches-for-a-new-year/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;going foward&amp;quot; as her &amp;quot;pick for cliche of 2009″ in football, using the criteria that is has to be &amp;quot;essentially meaningless, exhaustively overused, and I have to really really hate it&amp;quot;, thus validating Scott Adams&amp;#39; ear for irritants. There are certainly plenty of examples in the world of football, like Kellen Clemens&amp;#39; comment on the Jets&amp;#39; decision to start Mark Sanchez (&amp;quot;Going forward it is Mark’s job and I’ll support him&amp;quot;), or Roger Goodell&amp;#39;s statement on Michael Vick&amp;#39;s reinstatement (“I’m a believer personally that if somebody recognizes either mistakes in judgment or things, they can do better going forward, that the general public will recognize that and give people an opportunity to prove themselves&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;going|moving forward&lt;/em&gt; seems to be more commonly used by politicians and journalists than by corporate types or  sports figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama and his administration seem to be &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=site:www.whitehouse.gov+%22going%7Cmoving+forward%22&amp;amp;start=10&amp;amp;sa=N"&gt;especially fond of it&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Going forward, we cannot tolerate the same old boom and bust economy of the past&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Going forward, we will not blindly stay the course&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Going forward, we can make a difference on several fronts&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;And going forward, we can build a lasting relationship founded upon mutual interests and mutual respect as Iraq takes its rightful place in the community of nations&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Going forward, my administration will continue to consult closely with Congress and with our allies as we deploy this system&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;The biggest concern that I have moving forward is that the toll that job losses take on individual families and communities can be self-reinforcing&amp;quot;; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Republican National Committee is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=site%3Awww.rnc.org+%22going%7Cmoving+forward%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;almost as committed&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;…concerned about the current negotiations and feel that it is necessary to restate our strong position on several issues and provisions going forward&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;This is a subject that needs to be focused on going forward&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;But from that point going forward, I felt it was best to stand on principle&amp;quot;; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Freakonomics blog is also &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?s="&gt;a fan of this phrase&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Going forward, we’ll be cross-posting Robin’s Freakonomics-relevant blog entries here on the blog&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;I do not think this has a negative impact on lending going forward because everyone knows the rules of how things work in bankruptcy reorganizations, especially these days when lots of folks who made secured loans to pretty iffy organizations will have to take haircuts&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;If anything, we anticipate them taking a larger and more direct role going forward&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;And the questioner explained that her friends were thinking that going forward, these foreign locales were likely to be much more economically successful than the West&amp;quot;; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so is Thomas Friedman: &amp;quot;But going forward, if peace talks get under way, there are a few style points Mr. Obama should keep in mind&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;But the message going forward to every car buyer and carmaker would be this: The price of gasoline is never going back down&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;The big question I have going forward in Iraq is this&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;And the question I have going forward is whether that will be the case with President Bush&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Tell the American people how you would deal with Iraq going forward&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;But going forward, this will be less and less true&amp;quot;; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-hanging fruit&lt;/strong&gt;: There were only 29 instances of this phrase in the NYT&amp;#39;s archive for the past year. Of these, seven were about business and finance (mostly about the recent financial crisis), five were about energy use and climate change, four were about public health, and two were about sports. None seemed especially vacuous: &amp;quot;A variety of experts […] have long recognized that, compared with other tacks like building solar farms and extracting oil from algae, improving efficiency across all sectors, from transportation to housing, is low-hanging fruit&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;the Obama administration cannot overlook the low-hanging fruit — the gains to be had from making existing technologies more efficient&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;reducing black carbon is one of a number of relatively quick and simple climate fixes using existing technologies — often called &amp;quot;low hanging fruit&amp;#39; — that scientists say should be plucked immediately to avert the worst projected consequences of global warming&amp;quot;; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the day&lt;/strong&gt;: There were 408 instances of this phrase in the NYT over the past year. Of the 46 in the past 30 days (some of which were used literally, rather than in the metaphorical sense of &amp;quot;in the final analysis&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;when all is said and done&amp;quot;), sports (10) and politics (9)   were commoner contexts (for the metaphorical examples) than business (7). And again, the uses didn&amp;#39;t seem especially vacuous: &amp;quot;Again, at the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s about how we can get the last six or nine outs&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;“You can try to work walks. But at the end of the day, if you can hit home runs, you want to hit home runs&amp;quot;; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if these phrases are usually non-vacuous and non-managerial, they've certainly become more common. Thus "&lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;amp;pz=1&amp;amp;cf=all&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22at+the+end+of+the+day%22"&gt;at the end of the day&lt;/a&gt;" has 14,452 hits on Google News this morning, compared to 539 for "&lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;amp;pz=1&amp;amp;cf=all&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22in+the+final+analysis%22"&gt;in the final analysis&lt;/a&gt;", 28 for "&lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;amp;pz=1&amp;amp;cf=all&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22in+the+last+analysis%22"&gt;in the last analysis&lt;/a&gt;", and 1,376 for "&lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;amp;pz=1&amp;amp;cf=all&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22when+all+is+said+and+done%22"&gt;when all is said and done&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. The ratio of  &amp;quot;at the end of the day&amp;quot; to its common alternatives seems to have become quite a bit greater in recent decades — this morning&amp;#39;s ratio is 14452/(539+28+1376) = 7.44, compared to the ratio for the Google News archive from 1950 to 1960 of 1750/(2750+1660+304) = 0.371.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This order-of-magnitude increase in relative frequency is no doubt the real source of the irritation, with vacuity and source statistics being secondary (or entirely imaginary) factors.&lt;/p&gt;

"SAME-SEX MARRIAGE CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE TAUGHT IN MAINE SCHOOLS. HERE IS WHY. ERGO, YESONONE IS LYING." This is a nice ad, but "nice" doesn't win elections. You can't expect your audience to make the leap in logic that you're asking them to make. You said Yesonone was lying, but you didn't tell us how or why. Do that, and you have a﻿ chance.  &lt;i&gt;(from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/azelmaroark"&gt;azelmaroark&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think azelmaroark may not have it quite right (repeating the opposition's claims, even if the next thing you do is to debunk them, still means one extra time those claims get repeated on TV, i.e. one more chance for the meme to replicate) but I went back and watched the video again after that, and I think he/she is right that No on 1 is playing softball.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only "negative" stuff in the ad is the brief moment of static and the "outsiders will HARM OUR KIDS" rhetoric.  That's a good start, but notice that the music stays happy even during these dire pronouncements, and about 2/3 of the ad by time is people smiling and talking about happy things.  This will probably motivate the base to get out and vote, but it ain't gonna change any minds.  There's no &lt;i&gt;fear&lt;/i&gt;, and that, unfortunately, is what drives the average American voter these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not sure what the right thing is.  I'm tempted to go one step further than azelmoark even and propose that No on 1 should outright &lt;i&gt;lie&lt;/i&gt;, by implying that Prop 1 would take children away from their parents or something.  But then again, that's a whole lot of "stooping to their level", and I'm not a fan of that either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't know.  As of a week ago, the &lt;a href="http://crooksandliars.com/julia-rosen/poll-results-save-marriage-equality-ma"&gt;poll numbers&lt;/a&gt; were not encouraging (as the blogger I linked to points out, the poll was essentially tied &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the bigots' ad campaign got into full swing).  I guess I should take the longview and remember that this can't go on for very many more years -- especially since young people overwhelmingly support gay marriage.  It's just so depressing that things are moving so slowly..&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-6457424581194531360?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253971198733"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=16338">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/774aec930262c3ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Generosity"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Blogging About Philanthropy and Humanism</title><published>2009-09-26T13:00:40Z</published><updated>2009-09-26T13:00:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/26/blogging-about-philanthropy-and-humanism/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://foundationbeyondbelief.blogspot.com/"&gt;Foundation Beyond Belief&lt;/a&gt; (that’s the placeholder website) officially opens shop on January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2010, we’ll be needing bloggers to &lt;a href="http://www.atheistnexus.org/group/foundationbeyondbelief/forum/topic/show?id=2182797%3ATopic%3A512524"&gt;help us out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this photo on my Facebook page and was transfixed. It was taken by &lt;a href="http://www.blk-cat-mtn-trilobites.com/contributors.html"&gt;Stephen Marley&lt;/a&gt;, who gave me permission to post it here (the image is under his copyright).  As he said on FB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a type of eye called schizochroal, photographed on a Devonian trilobite &lt;em&gt;Hollardops mesocristata&lt;/em&gt; (there are two other major trilobite eye types and literally thousands of individual lens configurations at the species level). What’s really cool about this specimen is that the individual calcite lenses have been preserved with some sort of iron oxide, which makes them clearly stand out from the rest of the dark exoskeleton.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve added later that this specimen dates from 409-394 mya and is from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a serious interest in evolution, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; read about trilobite eyes. They represent the first evolutionary appearance of a compound eye, and their construction and diversity are stunning. Unlike the compound eyes of insects, trilobite eyes were hard, as they were composed of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate).  As Richard Fortey quipped, this gives new meaning to the term “stony gaze.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good introduction to trilobite eyes is &lt;a href="http://www.trilobites.info/eyes.htm"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s short, but if you don’t have the attention span at least check out the photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is a paper with an irresistible title, and some even weirder photos, “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/301/5640/1689"&gt;A Devonian Trilobite with an Eyeshade”&lt;/a&gt;, by Richard Fortey and Brian Chatterton.  Fortey is a paleontologist, but also a great science writer whose books have not gotten the attention they deserve on this side of the pond.  He’s the author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trilobite-Eyewitness-Evolution-Richard-Fortey/dp/0375406255/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trilobite!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a popular book on the beast that I recommend highly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;:  Accessing the Fortey and Chatterton paper might require a subscription, so I’ll post the picture of the “eyeshade” trilobite eye below. It’s also from a Devonian fossil collected in Morocco, and the authors claim that these bizarre columnar eyes allowed the beast a full 360-degree view of the sea floor around it. The “eyeshade,” or overhanging lip on the top of the eye, supposedly prevented overhead light from striking the eye (see demonstration in D and E below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;img title="se3631858001" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/se3631858001.jpeg?w=504&amp;amp;h=371" alt="se3631858001" width="504" height="371"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 1.&lt;/strong&gt; “Eyeshade” eye from Fortey and Chatterton paper.  Here’s their caption: &lt;em&gt;Erbenochile erbeni&lt;/em&gt; (Alberti). Devonian (Emsian) Timrahrhart Formation (Jebel Gara el Zguilma, near Foum Zquid), southern Morocco. (&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;) Posterior view showing overhanging eyeshades. (&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;) Lateral view. (&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;) Dorsal view. The headshield is 32 mm across. (&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;) Side view detail of right eye showing lenses under optimum illumination, and (&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;) how the eyeshade cuts out light from above, when directed as a parallel beam above the palpebral lobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation and photography of &lt;em&gt;H. mesocristata&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(from SM):&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“This specimen was prepared by Mike Thomas using skillful application of micro air-abrasive techniques to preserve the delicate details. The photo was taken with a 55mm micro-Nikkor lens on a 35mm “film based” Nikon F2 Camera using a fiber optic illumination system.

Now, the authors of a new study of honeybees argue that colony-level traits can override the genetic predispositions of individual bees [$-a].

Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one? Photo by Max_xx.The study&amp;#39;s authors, Linksvayer et al.,

made use of artificially-selected colonies of bees that were first developed for a 1995 study [$-a]. The original selection experiment crossed queen bees with drones to create lines of honeybee colonies that collected and stored more pollen (&amp;quot;high pollen&amp;quot; lines) or less pollen (&amp;quot;low pollen&amp;quot; lines) than un-selected colonies do. The total amount of pollen a colony stores is supposed to be a &amp;quot;group&amp;quot; trait -- an emergent property of the individual foraging decisions of every worker bee in the hive. But the genetics underlying that trait is encapsulated within the individual workers.

In the new experiment, Linksvayer et al. placed larvae from &amp;quot;high pollen&amp;quot; lines in &amp;quot;low pollen&amp;quot; colonies, and vice-versa. The larvae developed under the care of workers from the adoptive colony; when transplanted larvae reached adulthood, the team dissected them and measured the size of their ovaries -- apparently big-ovaried workers collect lots of pollen. They found that &amp;quot;high pollen&amp;quot; larvae reared by &amp;quot;low pollen&amp;quot; workers had smaller ovaries than than those raised by workers of their own type. &amp;quot;Low pollen&amp;quot; larvae reared by &amp;quot;high pollen&amp;quot; workers didn&amp;#39;t end up with larger ovaries, though; and the &amp;quot;high pollen&amp;quot; larvae had substantially larger ovaries than the &amp;quot;low pollen&amp;quot; larvae regardless of who raised them.

There was a statistically significant effect of rearing environment, even if it was (apparently) entirely driven by the change seen in &amp;quot;high pollen&amp;quot; larvae. The authors conclude that this points to a mechanism whereby a bee colony keeps its workers in line with the colony-wide policy:Thus, our results show that the network of social interactions that shapes development and expressed phenotypes has changed as a result of the colony-level selection program on pollen hoarding. Just as selection shapes physiological networks within organisms, our study shows that selection also shapes regulatory networks of superorganisms.So the metaphor, then, is that the authors have observed in the hive something like what happens to a transplanted organ -- the new host system incorporating the transplant for its own needs. I&amp;#39;m not sure the observed effect is strong enough to justify the meaning they assign to it; but it is an interesting observation.

As a postscript, I&amp;#39;m not sure social insects are a good model of group selection, because we know that they&amp;#39;re probably also experiencing kin selection, in which each worker&amp;#39;s fitness comes from helping the closely-related queen produce more sisters who share the same genes. Rarely, &amp;quot;anarchic&amp;quot; workers are born fertile and mate with drones [$-a] (there&amp;#39;s an open-access paper on the genetics underlying this trait); but in hives without anarchists, &amp;quot;group fitness&amp;quot; is hard to separate from the fitness of individual workers. A paper published in Nature this June showed that in another classic group selection system (parasites within a single host) kin selection is really the more important process.

This was of course the army of atheists and scientists from the Secular Student Alliance who organized a massive group trip to the Creation “Museum.” Well this Bill Frische also wrote his complaint to the Alumni Association at PZ’s school insisting that he’ll never donate to University of Minnisota ever again. I surmise he never did before either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well in his email, Frische included 2 examples of articles written about the event. One of them was the Answers in Genesis article and the other Frische seemed to think was “a more balanced report” (not necessarily more than the AiG one, since that link appeared after this one). That “more balanced report” was &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-9090-NY-Atheism--Skepticism-Examiner~y2009m8d9-Atheists-expelled-from-Creation-Museum"&gt;my Examiner article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, this was one of the hate emails PZ got that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/i_get_email_42.php"&gt;he decided to post in its entirety on his blog with its gigantic readership&lt;/a&gt;, links included. The Pharyngula readership is so large that PZ’s infamous for using it to crash online polls. There’s even a verb in the Urban Dictionary “&lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pharyngulate"&gt;pharyngulate&lt;/a&gt;“:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1. verb: to skew results of an online poll, usually having to do with religion, science, or politics, in order to reflect a more rational result.
&lt;p&gt;from the blog of the great PZ Myers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Dude, we totally pharyngulated that ridiculous Texas-based poll about creationism being taught in schools. Count that a win for science.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This morning my brother called me and told me that his friend (all 3 of us are Atheist Examiners) saw that PZ Myers had linked to my site on Pharyngula.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;And I have indeed seen a spike in readers today, though so far it hasn’t been as much of a spike as I expected. But maybe the PZ Bump will continue for awhile.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So I’d just like to thank PZ and Bill Frische for helping to draw massive amounts of traffic to my Examiner site.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ancestors of living cetaceans—whales, dolphins and porpoises—first dipped their toes into water, a series of evolutionary changes were sparked that ultimately nestled these swimming mammals into the larger hoofed animal group. But what happened first, a change from a plant-based diet to a carnivorous diet, or the loss of their ability to walk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new paper published this week in &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt; resolves this debate using a massive data set of the morphology, behavior, and genetics of living and fossil relatives. Cetacean ancestors probably moved into water before changing their diet (and their teeth) to include carnivory; Indohyus, a 48-million year-old semi-aquatic herbivore, and hippos fall closest to cetaceans when the evolutionary relationships of the larger group are reconstructed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The team showed how ordinary mouse skin cells could be transformed into cells that turned out to be pluripotent, just like embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The new cells were called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Although &amp;quot;ground-breaking&amp;quot; is an over-used term, this research genuinely deserved the description.Aside from the fact that it could be done at all, the surprising thing was that the transformation could be effected by adding transcribable genes for just four transcription factors to the skin cell DNA. Those genes were Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4. And now very recent research shows that, under the right conditions, just the addition of Oct4 alone can accomplish the same feat.We discussed some of the early research here, with additional reports here, here, and here.In the three years since the original announcement, research has extended and improved the process in a number of ways. The ultimate goal is to be able to produce pluripotent human stem cells that are in all important respects equivalent to embryonic stem cells, by a process that meets several important criteria:Cells to be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state should be readily obtainable from human subjects (unlike embryonic cells or rare types of adult stem cells).No permanent changes to cellular DNA should be made, only changes to gene expression.The process should be relatively quick and efficient, so that reasonable number of pluripotent cells can be obtained for routine therapeutic or experimental uses.Reprogramming of other cell types into pluripotent cells is important not just as a technical feat to prove it can be done. There are two other important objectives. The first is to develop human cell lines that model many types of pathology (cancer, Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease, or whatever) to facilitate research into therapeutics for these diseases. The best way to develop such lines is first to obtain pluripotent cells with the appropriate pathology, derived from human subjects with the disease, which can&amp;#39;t generally be done from embryonic sources. From there, several techniques can be used to produce appropriate cell cultures with the desired model pathology.The second objective is longer-range but even more important: to manufacture cells, for patients with certain diseases, that can be used as therapeutic replacements for the patient&amp;#39;s own malfunctioning tissue. This would be accomplished by obtaining pluripotent cells derived from the patient, correcting genetic problems in those cells, and then inducing the cells to differentiate into the required tissue type. Diseases that should be treatable in this way include Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease, Type 1 diabetes, and heart disease. Starting with cells from the actual patient eliminates the problem of tissue incompatibility.The criteria listed above that are imposed on the process are important for meeting both of these objectives.In the three years since the original work was announced, dozens of research groups have set about testing improvements to the original procedures in order to progress towards the ultimate objectives. The improvements that have been made include:adapting the procedures to work in species other than mice – including pigs and fruit flies, as well as humansreducing the number of transcription factors that need to be introduced, or finding other suitable transcription factorsfinding other cell types besides skin cells to start with, generally various types of non-pluripotent stem cells – which makes other improvements in the process easier to accomplishchanging the way that the transcription factors are introduced into the target cells, in order to avoid alteration of the original DNA (since such alterations may introduce risks of cancer or other cellular malfunction)finding other proteins or small molecule compounds that can be added to enhance the efficiency and speed of the processQuite a few important improvements have been announced within the past several months, along with other related news. The most interesting related news is a demonstration that iPSCs really are not only equivalent to ESCs in terms of gene expression, but are in fact equally pluripotent. This latter fact was convincingly demonstrated by cloning several generations of live, healthy mice from iPSCs. (We&amp;#39;ll discuss that in a separate article, but here&amp;#39;s an overview.)What I want to discuss here is how the list of transcription factors (or their genes) that need to be added to a non-pluripotent cell has been reduced to just one: Oct4. The work was done by a mostly German team led by Hans Schöler of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine.So how was this accomplished? Well, the trick is, you have to start with the right kind of cells. In this case the researchers used human fetal neural stem cells (HFNSCs). While such cells aren&amp;#39;t pluripotent, they are &amp;quot;multipotent&amp;quot;, which means they can normally differentiate into various other cell types.Back in February the researchers in this study reported that reprogramming with just Oct4 could be done in mouse neural stem cells (see here, here, or here). But would this also work with human cells?Yes. The latest report shows that HFNSCs can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state using only Oct4 and Klf4, and (generally) even with Oct4 alone. How is this possible? It is known that mouse neural stem cells already express Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4. As for the human case, the paper says, cautiously, that &amp;quot;The feasibility to reprogram directly NSCs by OCT4 alone might reflect their higher similarity in transcriptional profiles to ES cells than to other stem cells like haematopoietic stem cells or than to their differentiated counterparts.&amp;quot;And the main indication of this is that the process works: &amp;quot;One-factor human NiPS cells resemble human embryonic stem cells in global gene expression profiles, epigenetic status, as well as pluripotency in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate that the transcription factor OCT4 is sufficient to reprogram human neural stem cells to pluripotency.&amp;quot;What this is saying is that there are several criteria for similarity to embryonic stem cells that the reprogrammed HFNSCs meet. At a molecular level the reprogrammed cells express the same genes and have the same epigenetic markers as ESCs. In addition, they can differentiate into many adult cell types both in vitro and in vivo (in the latter case, by forming teratomas (mixed masses of cell types) when implanted in mice).There are still several drawbacks to this method for practical purposes, even of research. For one thing, human fetal neural stem cells are not exactly easily obtainable. And in addition, retroviruses were used (as in the original Yamanaka work) to introduce Oct4 into the cells. For therapeutic applications it would be absolutely necessary to use one of the other methods that have been explored and that do not disrupt the existing cell DNA or leave exogenous DNA in derived cells – since either alternative means the derived cells might revert to a more undifferentiated state. On top of all that, the process is still inefficient and slow.Reprogramming methods that have been explored in other research include the introduction of genetic material in forms other than retroviruses, as well as direct delivery of the transcription factor proteins. The researchers in this study intend to investigate such possibilities, as well as use of other initial cell types: &amp;quot;Future studies will show if direct reprogramming is possible with small molecules or OCT4 recombinant protein alone. ... It will be interesting to extend this study to human NSCs derived from other sources, such as dental pulp, as well as to other stem-cell types.&amp;quot;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Most research so far has been on trying to predict shifts in species distributions and changes in interactions within local habitats. But what many of these studies assume is that the basic biological processes and requirements of the individual species will not change -that is their biology is fixed and they simply need to find the place that best suits them. Not so, say Mary O&amp;#39;Connor and colleagues, in a just-released study in PLoS Biology.O&amp;#39;Connor and colleagues experimentally warmed marine microcosms and tested two alternative hypotheses on food web structure: 1) that productivity increases with warming; and 2) warming increases metabolic rates, thus changing consumer-autotroph (i.e., primary producers) interactions. What they found was that warming  indeed altered consumer-autotroph interactions. Warming increased base metabolic rates of consumers, as well as primary production, and the net effect was that food webs shifted towards increasing consumer control (i.e., top-down control).What this research means is that global warming may alter food web interactions by increasing resource needs of organisms as their metabolic rates increase. This may increase the stress on communities and change diversity patterns as increased needs may shift competitive hierarchies or affect autotroph&amp;#39;s ability to withstand consumer effects.O&amp;#39;Connor, M., Piehler, M., Leech, D., Anton, A., &amp;amp; Bruno, J.

This is a whopper of a proposal and definitely interesting.Margulis is famous for proposing the endosymbiont hypothesis to explain mitochondria and chloroplasts and other organelles.  The gist of it is that some ancestral eukaryote took in a guest species and in the long run integrated it fully into its operations so that the two could not be separated.  An important observation which this explained is the fact that mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own genomes, which encode (almost?) entirely for proteins and RNAs used in these structures.  However, their genomes do not encode many of the proteins required -- indeed in metazoans such as ourselves only a tiny pittance of genes are encoded by the mitochondrial genome.  A further observation which fits into this framework is the curious case of Cyanophora paradoxa, a photosynthetic organism whose chloroplast-like structure is surrounded by a rudimentary cell wall.When I was an undergraduate, there was still significant controversy on the validity of the endosymbiont hypothesis.  I remember this well, as I wrote a term paper on the subject. What really nailed it down was the careful comparison of gene trees in the cases where the same function is required both in the organelle and in the cytoplasm and both are nuclear encoded.  In the vast majority of these cases, the two are evolutionarily distant from one another and in the case of chloroplasts the gene whose protein goes to the chloroplast looks more like homologs in cyanobacteria and the copy producing cytoplasmic protein looks more like homologs in non-photosynthetic eukaryotes.  There are some fascinating exceptions, such as cases in which one gene does double duty -- via (for example) alternative splicing or promoters including or excluding the chloroplast targeting sequences.Margulis and others have tried to extend this notion to other systems.  There are definitely other success -- unicellular organisms which appear to carry three genomes &amp;amp; the always challenging to classify Euglena, which appears to be a genome fusion.  But there have also been some prominent non-successes, such as the eukaryotic flagellum/cillium.  Also when I was an undergraduate a Cell paper made a big splash claiming to find a chromosome associated with the basal body, the organelle associated with flagellum synthesis.  However, this work was never repeated and the publication of the Chlamydomas genome failed to find such a chromosome. After reading the paper at hand, I&amp;#39;m both confused and disappointed.  The confusion is embarassing, but the paper goes into a lot of detail on taxonomy and gross development of which I&amp;#39;m horribly ignorant.  But, conversely the disappointment comes from what I do understand and how cursorily that is treated.  And since it is the stuff I understand which is the route Williamson proposes to test his hypothesis, that is a big let down.A key part that I do understand (minus a few terms I hadn&amp;#39;t encountered before), with my emphasis:Many corollaries of my hypothesis are testable. If insects acquired larvae by hybrid transfer, the total base pairs of DNA of exopterygote insects that lack larvae will be smaller than those of endopterygote (holometabolous) species that have both larvae and pupae. Genome sequences are known for the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, the honeybee, Apis mellifera, the malarial mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and the silkworm, Bombyx mori: holometabolous species, with marked metamorphoses. I predict that an earwigfly (Mercoptera Meropeidae), an earwig (Dermaptera), a cockroach (Dictyoptera), or a locust (Orthoptera) will have not necessarily fewer chromosomes but will have fewer base pairs of protein-coding chromosomal DNA than have these holometabolans. Also the genome of an onychophoran that resembles extant species will be found in insects with caterpillar or maggot-like larvae. Onychophoran genomes will be smaller than those of holometabolous insects. Urochordates, comprising tunicates and larvaceans, present a comparable case. Larvaceans are tadpoles throughout life. Garstang  regarded larvaceans as persistenttunicate larvae, and, if so, their genomes would resemble those of tunicates. But if larvaceans provided the evolutionary source of marine tadpole larvae, their genomes would be smaller and included in those of adult tunicates. The genome of the larvacean Oikopleura dioica is about one-third that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, consistent with my thesisWilliamson is obviously not an expert on genomics, but Margulis should have known better and pushed him to improve this section.  In the &amp;quot;communicated by&amp;quot; path, the academy member can basically hand-pick the reviewers and is supposed to act as an editor would.  The first problem is a rather naive view of genome size and evolution.  Genome sizes vary all over the map even within related species; Fugu to salmon is several fold as is fruit fly to malaria vector.  The latter pair is particularly relevant since these are both dipteran insects, and therefore in the same bin by Williamson&amp;#39;s standard (as stated in the quoted text).  Now, that is overall genome size; if you restrict to protein coding regions these pairs are more similar, which leaves some wiggle room.  But, by the same token the Oikopleura and Ciona genomes contain about the same number of genes (~15-16K).But furthermore, his hypothesis should be quite testable right now, at least in a basic form.  If a genome fusion occurred, then genes active in larval stages and genes active in the adult should show different gene trees if they are homologs.  Given that there is a lot of data to annotate which Drosophila genes are active when, this should be a practical exercise.  While I leave this as an exercise for the student, I would point out that it is already known that in Drosophila many proteins are active in both phases.  This can probably also be tallied in some fashion.  I&amp;#39;m guessing that the fraction of genes shared between stages will be quite large, which would not be very supportive of the fusion hypothesis.Should a paper like this get into a journal such as PNAS?  Given what I&amp;#39;ve written above, I think not, simply on its demerits.  On the other hand, crazy hypotheses do need a place to go because they are sometimes the right hypotheses -- Margulis&amp;#39;s formulation of endosymbiont hypothesis had very tough sledding on its path to the textbooks.  However, in the modern world there is a place for odd speculations and journeying outside your expertise.  It&amp;#39;s called a blog!Williamson DI (2009).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007180" title=""&gt;Neuroanatomical Variability of Religiosity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We hypothesized that religiosity, a set of traits variably expressed in the population, is modulated by neuroanatomical variability. We tested this idea by determining whether aspects of religiosity were predicted by variability in regional cortical volume. We performed structural magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in 40 healthy adult participants who reported different degrees and patterns of religiosity on a survey. We identified four Principal Components of religiosity by Factor Analysis of the survey items and associated them with regional cortical volumes measured by voxel-based morphometry. Experiencing an intimate relationship with God and engaging in religious behavior was associated with increased volume of R middle temporal cortex, BA 21. Experiencing fear of God was associated with decreased volume of L precuneus and L orbitofrontal cortex BA 11. A cluster of traits related with pragmatism and doubting God's existence was associated with increased volume of the R precuneus. Variability in religiosity of upbringing was not associated with variability in cortical volume of any region. Therefore, key aspects of religiosity are associated with cortical volume differences. This conclusion complements our prior functional neuroimaging findings in elucidating the proximate causes of religion in the brain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007208" title=""&gt;Evolutionary Descent of Prion Genes from the ZIP Family of Metal Ion Transporters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the more than twenty years since its discovery, both the phylogenetic origin and cellular function of the prion protein (PrP) have remained enigmatic. Insights into a possible function of PrP may be obtained through the characterization of its molecular neighborhood in cells. Quantitative interactome data demonstrated the spatial proximity of two metal ion transporters of the ZIP family, ZIP6 and ZIP10, to mammalian prion proteins in vivo. A subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed the unexpected presence of a PrP-like amino acid sequence within the N-terminal, extracellular domain of a distinct sub-branch of the ZIP protein family that includes ZIP5, ZIP6 and ZIP10. Additional structural threading and orthologous sequence alignment analyses argued that the prion gene family is phylogenetically derived from a ZIP-like ancestral molecule. The level of sequence homology and the presence of prion protein genes in most chordate species place the split from the ZIP-like ancestor gene at the base of the chordate lineage. This relationship explains structural and functional features found within mammalian prion proteins as elements of an ancient involvement in the transmembrane transport of divalent cations. The phylogenetic and spatial connection to ZIP proteins is expected to open new avenues of research to elucidate the biology of the prion protein in health and disease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An emerging air-borne or contact based pathogen could use these transportation routes to rapidly spread an infection throughout an entire population in a short time. Further, in many developed countries, the aging population is increasing. The family structure in these societies may also affect the course of a disease. To help understand the impact of an epidemic on family structure in a networked population, an individual based computer model that randomly generates networked cities with a specified range of population and disease characteristics and individual schedules, infectivity, transmission and hygiene factors was developed. Several salient issues emerged. First, a city of highly active individuals may in fact diminish the number of fatalities because the average duration of the interactions between agents is reduced. Second, home schooling can significantly improve survival because the institutional clustering of weak individuals is minimized. Third, the worst scenario for an aging population is the nuclear family where the aged population is confined to large housing facilities. Naturally, hygiene is the first barrier to infection. The results suggest that societies where extended families and small groups manage most of their own affairs may also be the most suitable for defense against a pandemic. This may prove applicable in city planning and policy making.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meet Dr. Frank Lipman and his &lt;b&gt;Misconception and Misinformation Traveling Salvation Road Show!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because he's been an infection to rational thought already, the great PalMD at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/06/you_say_you_want_a_revolution.php"&gt;WhiteCoatUnderground&lt;/a&gt; has already pounded Lipman over &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-frank-lipman/2-questions-to-ask-that-a_b_220293.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;this older piece&lt;/a&gt;, but the new bit on Swine Flu is just painful.  As though there were not already enough fear-mongering assholery &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2009/09/23/flu-shots-h1n1-seasonal.html"&gt;being bandied about&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know, I know...coming from the Huffington Post, it's not surprising.  &lt;i&gt;"What? Pseudoscientific horseshit coming from HuffPo?  No...no I won't believe it!"&lt;/i&gt;  Oh, believe it, brother.  Get a load of &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-frank-lipman/swine-flu-what-to-do_b_286245.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;this woo woo garbage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;My patients are wondering whether or not they should get vaccinated and the simple answer I give most of the time is ..NO!&lt;/blockquote&gt;Then he goes right into the standard canard of all anti-vaccination assholes:&lt;blockquote&gt;From the outset, let me say, I am not anti all vaccinations, rather I am pro vaccine safety and freedom of choice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Riiiiiight.  You and &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; and Jim Carrey and Andrew Wakefield.  Couldn't be a smarter group of cabbages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, after saying that, &lt;i&gt;"We don't know if the vaccine will be effective"&lt;/i&gt;, he says:&lt;blockquote&gt;Vaccines are only useful against the specific viral strain that was available at the time of their manufacture. But influenza viruses mutate quickly, and as the WHO has already said, the real concern with H1N1 swine flu is that it will combine with seasonal flu in the Fall, creating a new strain that will of course be immune to all available vaccines.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yes, it mutates quickly.  We all know that.  The 2009 H1N1 vaccine, because it is manufactured specifically for the pandemic virus, should impart immunity to about 95% of patients after one dose.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, there are questions about mutation, the odds of getting the flu and so on.  I will quote here from one of the ScienceBlogs, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/09/seasonal_flu_why_i_got_vaccina.php"&gt;Effect Measure&lt;/a&gt;, and show Revere's potential outcomes for the seasonal flu and the 2009 H1N1 flu and why he got both vaccines:&lt;blockquote&gt;i. Pandemic swine flu A/H1N1 2009 almost completely replaces both subtypes of seasonal flu (seasonal H1N1 and seasonal H3N2) and there's hardly any of it around. Then I get no or little benefit from getting vaccinated (except for the flu B part, which is significant). Since last week 2% of the isolates were seasonal flu, it's hard to say what will happen. We don't usually see much seasonal flu virus this early in the year anyway. Will the future be different?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ii. Pandemic flu and seasonal flu co-circulate. We don't know if that can or will happen. But since I'm in the age group that dies from seasonal flu, I've done the right thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;iii. Pandemic flu and seasonal flu are out of phase. For example pandemic flu has a sharp but short history and by virtue of using up susceptibles and vaccination it's essentially gone by January, leaving an opening for the seasonal viruses to return and act as they usually do. Again, I've done the right thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;iv. Pandemic flu changes character and starts to infect my age group, crowds out seasonal flu or something else. Depending on the nature of the changes (maybe it reassorts with something the vaccine works for) I might or might not have come out ahead and everyone else, of all age groups, might or might not come out ahead if they are vaccinated with the seasonal flu vaccine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So, yes, 2009 H1N1 &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; recombine with the seasonal Influenza A H1N1 or A H3N2 to create something entirely new.  But that's &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; potential outcome from many and to scare people into not getting a potentially life-saving and safe vaccine because of that is irresponsible...not that that slows Lipman or HuffPo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lipman says that, &lt;i&gt;We don't know if the vaccine is safe&lt;/i&gt;, and then says:&lt;blockquote&gt;Since it's never been used before and they have not had time to conduct any sufficient human testing, by getting vaccinated you are being a human guinea pig.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ummm...&lt;a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/sep1009vaccine.html"&gt;really&lt;/a&gt;?  Let's get a quote from that link, shall we?&lt;blockquote&gt; As for safety, 70% of the Novartis trial volunteers reported pain at the injection site and 42% had muscle aches, the report says. Two of the vaccinees had a fever after the first dose...By 21 days after vaccination, an immune response (an antibody titer of 1:40 or more) was observed in 116 of 120 volunteers (97%) who received 15 mcg and in 112 of 120 (93%) who received 30 mcg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report says 46% of the volunteers reported injection-site tenderness or pain, while 45% had systemic symptoms such as headache. Nearly all the problems were described as mild to moderate, and there were &lt;b&gt;no serious adverse events.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Still want to stick by that, &lt;i&gt;"human guinea pig"&lt;/i&gt; comment, Lipman?  Of course you do.  Why change your mind with, you know, evidence?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, because it's too good, Lipman includes in his, &lt;i&gt;"Top 10 Recommendations"&lt;/i&gt; - of which this is number 14 to a brief addendum, because a &lt;b&gt;Top 10&lt;/b&gt; list is just so much sexier than a &lt;b&gt;Top 14&lt;/b&gt; - to keep homeopathic Oscillococcinum close at hand and to use it, &lt;i&gt;"at the earliest sign of cold or flu."&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.homeowatch.org/history/oscillo.html"&gt;Right.&lt;/a&gt;  There is no such thing as an "oscillococcinum" bacteria.  Fucking guy who "discovered" it likely just saw &lt;a href="http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/more_stuff/Applets/brownian/brownian.html"&gt;Brownian motion&lt;/a&gt; (nice applet description and visual) and didn't realize it.  Then he decided that a duck was the way to go to prepare his stupid, useless homeopathic elixir (diluted to 200C!  Are you kidding me?!) and, voila, we still see this shit pushed by unqualified, unscientific, uncritical morons like Dr. Lipman.  No, you know what?  "Dr." Lipman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah yeah, he got his MD, but when you're that stupid, your qualifications are suspect regardless of where and when he got them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Way to go, HuffPo.

DDH is a drama presented by NOVA and National Geographic.  It was written by the British screenwriter John Goldsmith and directed by John Bradshaw.  It stars Henry Ian Cusick as Darwin.  You may find an interview with the playwright and a wealth of other material, not least the &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/" rel="external "&gt;WGBH Evolution website&lt;/a&gt;, linked to the website of the program.

I have to admit that when I first saw the headline for this story (which I've used as the title of this post) in the 365-gay-news service (a GLBTA news aggregator), my first thought was "Is this something happening on Cape Cod, out in P-Town?  Or is this something happening in South Africa, in Cape Town."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, both are wrong. It is something happening on the guy's cape.

I’ve read papers on anthropology and dentistry, spoken to neuroscientists and classicists, and searched through many pop culture references as well.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;Kissing for one minute burns 26 calories&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Preposterous of course, but I couldn’t help wonder why ‘26′ was popping up &lt;a href="http://www.romancestuck.com/kissing/kissing-trivia.htm"&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.

In places where light pollution is low enough to see it, its beauty is unmistakable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/gigagalaxy_zoom/milkyway2-6589-20081029-7.jpg" width="500" title="Just a single person with a camera took this." alt="milkyway2-6589-20081029-7.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the above image is what you might see with your naked eye.  But even a small telescope can get you so much more.  The darkest skies, with your naked eye, can provide you with the opportunity to see a few thousand stars.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But get yourself a small telescope?  You're talking about tens of millions of stars, almost instantly.  A small telescope, taking a large number of pictures and stitching them together, produced this image of a section of the Milky Way, which is today's &lt;a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html"&gt;Astronomy Picture of the Day&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/gigagalaxy_zoom/Guisard_MilkyWay_4_8bit_dse_1500-ps12_h600.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/gigagalaxy_zoom/Guisard_MilkyWay_4_8bit_dse_1500-ps12_h600.jpg" width="500" title="And you can see millions and millions of stars in this image.  Just click to enlarge it." alt="Guisard_MilkyWay_4_8bit_dse_1500-ps12_h600.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where did this picture come from?  Well, a number of contributors got together and started the &lt;a href="http://www.gigagalaxyzoom.org/G.html"&gt;Gigagalaxy Zoom&lt;/a&gt; project, where you can take a region of the Milky Way of your choosing and just zoom on in, enjoying the beauty and wonder of it all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I did, and I thought I'd share some of my favorite finds with you.  You can, of course, click my images to see them full-size, or go to the &lt;a href="http://www.gigagalaxyzoom.org/B.html"&gt;Gigagalaxy Zoom page&lt;/a&gt; and play around on your own!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/gigagalaxy_zoom/zoommilkyway1.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/gigagalaxy_zoom/zoommilkyway1.jpg" width="500" title="Just zoom in as far as you like!" alt="zoommilkyway1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the image above?  That's zoomed in to an area about 2% of the previous image before it.  Simply stunning, of course.  But we can zoom in even farther...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/gigagalaxy_zoom/zoommilkyway2.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/gigagalaxy_zoom/zoommilkyway2.jpg" width="500" title="Well, don&amp;#39;t stop here!  Keep going!" alt="zoommilkyway2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although this is the limit for this region, there are a few select regions of the galactic plane that are imaged at particularly high quality.  Here's a shot of the snake nebula, which is only a couple of degrees away from the zoomed in image above:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/gigagalaxy_zoom/zoommilkyway3.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/09/gigagalaxy_zoom/zoommilkyway3.jpg" width="500" title="Looks pretty snaky to me!" alt="zoommilkyway3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I'm a cosmologist, and I mostly think about the largest scales on the Universe, I don't need to leave our galaxy to feel small.  Every point of light in this image is a Sun, massive and complicated, with its own star system and its own satellites to worry about.  And there are literally thousands to millions of them in just these small images I've posted here.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are you still doing over here?  Go!  &lt;a href="http://www.gigagalaxyzoom.org/G.html"&gt;Go play!&lt;/a&gt;  But come back and share your favorite find with all of us!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/09/gigagalaxy_zoom.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253910188141"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/some_science_links_for_you.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/868157cdd9396a37</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogospherics"/><title type="html">Some science links for you</title><published>2009-09-25T20:57:20Z</published><updated>2009-09-25T20:57:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/kK63Vo_7JA8/some_science_links_for_you.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/some_science_links_for_you.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2009/09/survival_of_the_kindest.php"&gt;Eric Johnson&lt;/a&gt; has a review of Frans de Waal's book in Seed, &lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/survival_of_the_kindest/"&gt;readable here at Seed Dot Com. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You should go. The recipient of the profits this year will be the Richard Dawkins Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, you say? They're raising money to promote secular science? In &lt;i&gt;North Carolina&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are. And the organizer, James Deem, says he is doing it to raise awareness for science and science education. I blow kisses his way — what a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are problems. Sponsors have pulled out, meaning that they had to cut some bands from the schedule, and of course, &lt;a href="http://www.wbtv.com/global/story.asp?s=11195959"&gt;some members of the public are unhappy&lt;/a&gt;. You knew that was coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thorne stressed that the bands are there to play music, not give out a message about atheism or anything else.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Pop Festival attendee Debbie Aintrazi of Mint Hill hopes they don't.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"If they start going around saying, 'no, you shouldn't believe in this, you shouldn't believe in that'-- that's when I [get upset]," she said.  "I don't believe in not believing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, what did she say? I'm going to have to let the idea of not believing in not believing curdle in my brain for a bit, because it's kind of indigestible right now.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the more interesting aspects of the survey is the demonstration that there is a sex difference in patterns of religions identification.  Below I give some links where this has been discussed, but I want to note that in many discussions one of the first things people say ... quite reasonably ... is that the differences seem small and potentially well within the normal sampling error of a survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason people think that is because they are accustom to survey data in relation to political polling where sample error is usualy 5% or 3% because of standard methodologies and sample sizes.  The ARIS survey has a much lower error rate.  The lower error rate does not mean the the conclusion is stronger than it might otherwise be.  It means that it is less likely spurious than it might otherwise be. But, in this case, this certainly means that the differences between groups (mainly male vs. female) can not be written off as statistical artifacts.  (Though they could easily be of little consequence.  Or not.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are obvious, but this is an interesting observation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Republicans will have to choose between becoming a more overtly religious party and reaching out more seriously to the growing secular middle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secular voters once constituted an important part of the GOP coalition, but fewer than 10 percent of religious nones under age 30 are Republican. “Republican nones are getting older and continue to show an affinity to the GOP,” says Juhen Navarro-Rivera, a Trinity College research fellow who helped compile the new report. “But they’re not making new Republican nones.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t sound like a future decision.  They’ve already made it — goodbye to the secular middle —  and as more people grow weary of the ultra-religious, they’ll leave the party.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has nothing to do with the other party, either.  Gilgoff points out that the Democrats aren’t picking up all those drifters.  Rather, many of the non-religious nones are just becoming Independents, which is better for our country, anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reaching out to the faithful, both parties are alienating the people who are slowly but steadily becoming a larger and more vocal constituency — those of us who don’t believe in a god or at least organized religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won’t be long before a candidate can run a strong (though probably still unsuccessful) campaign on a platform of complete church/state separation.&lt;/p&gt;

After the site Boing Boing has to post something atrocious, they post a unicorn story or picture to cleanse the brain’s palate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is my version of a unicorn: &lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5815/Shadow_South_of_Another?js=1"&gt;a soothing picture of Saturn from Cassini&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view_media/28984/Shadow_South_of_Another"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/09/saturn_enceladus.jpg" alt="saturn_enceladus" title="saturn_enceladus" width="610" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another in the series of beautiful equinox images from Cassini, as the Sun shines straight along the rings. While the icy moon Enceladus is not in the picture itself, you can see its shadow just below the shadow of the rings on Saturn’s cloudtops. The moon you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see in the image, just below the rings, is Mimas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, take a deep breath… remember that reality is real… and that we can investigate it, examine it, learn from it, and drink deeply of its beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What paranormal and pseudoscientific phenomena do you want to be true?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Child is the iconic figure of popularizing&lt;i&gt; haute cuisine,&lt;/i&gt; blazing a trail on television long before anyone dreamed up The Food Network or &lt;i&gt;Top Chef&lt;/i&gt;, and publishing her bestselling classic, &lt;i&gt;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&lt;/i&gt; in 1961. Her entire kitchen is now on permanent display in Washington, DC, at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Child had a fascinating life apart from cooking. After an idyllic New England childhood, she worked for the OSS during World War II -- at 6'2", she was far too tall for the Women's Army Corps, or to be part of the Navy's WAVES. She lived all over the world, and first fell in love with French cooking while living in Paris with her husband, Paul Child. The rest, one might say, is history. Her cooking show was watched by millions, with loads of cameos in film and TV.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And her influence went even beyond cooking. Here she is demonstrating the fundamentals of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"&gt;abiogenesis&lt;/a&gt;. Not to be confused with Darwin's theory of evolution, abiogenesis refers specifically to the science behind how life on Earth may have evolved out of a primordial soup of inanimate matter. She made the educational film in 1976 for the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. It's nice to see her legacy passed on to the YouTube generation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7pt0rIZ3ZNE%26rel%3D0%26border%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=349" width="425" height="349"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-8702046979932737966?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may remember, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/05/australian-skeptics-strike-back-against-antivaxxers/"&gt;a complaint was filed against the AVN&lt;/a&gt;, claiming they were dispensing medical advice. Meryl Dorey, the mouthpiece for AVN, denied that, saying they are not a medical group. This determination by the HCCC contradicts her… and the HCCC is the actual official agency that can say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad to see this! Dorey says a lot of things that don’t come within a glancing blow of reality (like the AVN is not antivax, when their slogan is &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/the-anti-vacc-movement-an-australian-perspective/"&gt;&amp;quot;Love them, protect them, never inject them&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;), so I’m very happy that they will get scrutinized by the HCCC. This could result in anything from an official censure to having the AVN shut down completely. That wouldn’t break my heart, though I know that, like a virus, the AVN would mutate slightly and rise again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love free speech, but the cost of free speech is never free. With words comes responsibility, and the AVN needs to be held responsible for what they say.&lt;/p&gt;

We were both atheists by the time we got married, and yet, I am finding myself following more and more in the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_atheism"&gt;Jewish atheism&lt;/a&gt;" tradition as time goes on.  For instance, I now celebrate Channukah and Passover (and I would have celebrated Rosh Hashanah&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, if only I'd planned ahead enough to get a kick-ass &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shofar"&gt;shofar&lt;/a&gt;); I absolutely love lox, with the capers and everything; and now I am finding that my new favorite non-alcoholic beverage is seltzer.  Not seltzer mixed with anything, just plain seltzer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can I do this?  Can I convert directly from gentile-turned-atheist to secular Jew, without actually practicing Judaism first?  Does this make me a poser?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meh, even if this is totally lame, I don't care.  You'll have to pry my seltzer from my cold, dead, atheist, gentile hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;I refuse to celebrate Yom Kippur because I find the idea of religious atonement to be highly distasteful.  Even with the Channukah and Passover ceremonies, I am pretty sure the only reason I am able to stomach it is because most of the "Oh God you are so awesome, I totally kiss your ass" stuff is in Hebrew, which I don't understand.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-5869317086839630911?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1253898747607"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25327006.post-556046505913917701">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e099bef998b26cc3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="skepticism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Why can&amp;#39;t the US manage this?</title><published>2009-09-25T16:20:00Z</published><updated>2009-09-25T17:07:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2009/09/why-cant-us-manage-this.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/556046505913917701/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25327006&amp;postID=556046505913917701&amp;isPopup=true" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="html">Over in the UK, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/sep/23/asa-religious-poster-blessed-oil"&gt;a group in charge of monitoring ads has panned one that implies magic oils can cure caner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wouldn't this be great if we could get rid of all the bunk that makes claims completely unsupported by the evidence and, even worse, pose serious health risks for the benefit of those snake oil salesmen?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should have these groups, but the UK is at least wise enough not to give religious groups a free pass.

This of course would be awesome news for people who enjoy sex (and terrible news for people who think sex is the Devil's work and should be punished by disease and pestilence) if it were true. But as soon as you start digging behind the headlines, the claims start to look very ropey indeed.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Let's start with the reported facts, from the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8272113.stm"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. They relay the claims from the 16,000 person US/Thai trial run in Thailand as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that it reduced by nearly a third the risk of contracting HIV, the virus that leads to Aids. It has been hailed as a significant, scientific breakthrough, but a global vaccine is still some way off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, reducing AIDS by a third in vaccinated individuals sounds like quite an impressive result, but let's look at the actual numbers here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;74 [out of 8198] people who did not get the vaccine infected and 51 [out of 8197] of the vaccinated group infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, these are very small numbers, and testing them for stastical significance gives some interesting results. For a result to be statistically significant, it needs to have a &lt;i&gt;p-value&lt;/i&gt; of less than 0.05. That means that there is less than a 5% chance of the result occuring purely by chance. In the case of these results, I calculate that p = 0.048, which is pretty much right on the boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Edit: &lt;a href="http://badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=11954#p243611"&gt;DMcIlroy gets the same results here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the results then were statistically significant... barely. In fact, if just one or two people had gone the other way, the results would have fallen below the level of statistical significance - that's how precarious the findings are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That on its own should be enough to make people a bit cautious, but in combination with some other information coming out of this trial, alarm bells should be ringing. The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8272113.stm"&gt;BBC note that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was a combination of two older vaccines that on their own had not cut infection rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical company Sanofi developed one of the two vaccines combined for this study, and even they &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/health/research/25aids.html?_r=2&amp;amp;hp"&gt;admitted to the NYT&lt;/a&gt; that they were surprised by the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This came out of the blue," said Chris Viehbacher, Sanofi’s chief executive. Even 31 percent protection "was at least twice as good as our own internal experts were predicting," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this surprise result into further context, back in 2004 an array of scientists in the United States lined up to write &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/303/5656/316"&gt;a joint letter to Science magazine&lt;/a&gt; in which they heavily criticised the decision to fund the $100m+ trial, describing the scientific rationale as "weak" and pointing out that the components of the new vaccine had been shown to be either ineffective or poorly immunogenic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but there are serious anomalies in the trial results, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/health/research/25aids.html?_r=2&amp;amp;hp"&gt;as reported by the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...those who became infected had as much virus in their blood whether they got the vaccine or a placebo — suggests that RV 144 does not produce neutralizing antibodies, as most vaccines do, Dr. Fauci said."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several possible explanations for this unexpected result. It could be consistent for example with the vaccine's effect working through a different pathway in the immune system, perhaps stimulating effector cells as Dr. Fauci of NIAID speculates in the NYT article. However, it would also be consistent with the vaccine simply not working, and the cold facts are that there is no evidence for an alternative hypothesis, certainly not without going back and studying the collected blood samples very closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, the newspapers are suggesting we have a vaccine that is 30% effective. The scientists involved to their credit seem to be playing things down a bit, but frankly their results are tenuous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a result that is barely statistically significant, using a vaccine comprised of two components previously shown not to work, a methodology heavily criticised by a galaxy of experts in a joint letter to Science, and quirks in the results which would be consistent with the vaccine not working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to stick my neck out and call this trial a failure, but no self-respecting skeptic can look at this results are declare them to be anything other than tenuous. A lot more evidence needs to be presented before we can take these results too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

Previously, infantry would operate in large blocks that would move forward, turn and open or close ranks, and winning an infantry engagement would involve getting your columns around the side or back of the enemy's columns, or simply overrunning them head on.  This worked in part because although everybody had a firearm of some kind, the firearms held few bullets, took time to reload, and were inaccurate, and since they tended to be inaccurate, the soldiers were generally not trained to shoot as well as they might. So, a rifle was really a spear (with a bayonet attached, of course) that also made a lot of noise and fired a few relatively useless bullets.  Previously, the cavalry was effective because it consisted of swordmen up on big and/or fast horses who could move quickly across the landscape and would wade into the enemy's infantry slicing up the foot soldiers.  The cavalry could not be stopped easily by the infantry because the  infantry would shoot a relatively small number of relatively bogus bullets at the cavalry, knock a few guys off a few horses, then get ripped to shreds with the swords.  The fact that the cavalry often consisted of members of the elite classes and the infantry consisted mainly of working class men made it all the more ...

(Yes, I said I quit two weeks ago, but what I technically did was give my notice. I am, believe it or not, an honorable person.) I believe you’ll notice the increase in quality of this week’s COTW, written from my couch while watching this week’s episode of &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt; (AWESOME), compared to last week’s COTW, which was written between bites of salad during a harried lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;

And also because it’s a little chilly in here. Note: the actual hoodie is spelled forwards. Thanks, Photo Booth. THUMBS UP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to Comment o’ the Week, which is chosen from amongst the comments you nominate by clicking the little arrow by the comment and writing “COTW!” somewhere in your response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THUMBS UP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s prizewinner was posted in response to Sam’s Afternoon Inquisition, in which he asked whether or not Texas schools should remove Neil Armstrong from textbooks because he’s not a scientist. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/09/ai-one-giant-leap-out-of-a-textbook/comment-page-1/#comment-78791"&gt;Mark Hall responded&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Armstrong is a good figurehead for one of the greatest scientific achievements of the 20th century. He may not have been the one who did all the mathematical heavy lifting of sending humans to the moon, but he was definitely willing to participate in testing the question of “Is all this shit gonna work?” with the hypothesis of “I really fucking hope so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s not cutting edge science, I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to see that on a science fair display board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats, Mark! Your prize is to choose next Wednesday’s Afternoon Inquisition. Send it in using the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1227/"&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
