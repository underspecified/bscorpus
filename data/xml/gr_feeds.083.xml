First, he was surprised to find out that it was relatively ‚Äúcutting-edge‚Äù to have a layperson involved in the research of clinical trials.¬† And this is in fact true with the exception of some private organizations.¬† He also notes that some researchers were not happy with his appointment, but he took it in stride.¬† After surviving some of the bureaucracy that comes with clinical research, he came to several conclusions:     if emerging therapy does not receive institutional support, then it is easy for it to reside outside of the institution&amp;#39;s embrace (I would say the same for particularly diseases)     National collaboration is essential given the low incidence of CJD cases-he discusses the political nature of having two national organizations work together on a project     involvement of laypersons should be welcomed by researchers     one must first analyze existing research prior to planning new research     ‚ÄúAcademic status and fiefdoms must take second place to patients‚Äô interests, particularly when funding for research is coming from the public purse, and there must be a totally open culture of sharing and publication‚Äù (my personal favorite)     citizens should be encouraged to learn more about clinical trials and to participate in them as a public service    Although my research often overlaps with caregivers, I find discussing my research with laypersons one of the most gratifying pieces to doing clinical research.¬† I also tend to agree with having some layperson involvement on clinical research committees, much like how members of the general public are often included on institutional review boards.¬†¬†   I‚Äôm hoping to get a lot of feedback from this post, so please share your comments below.  del.icio.us Tags: prion,CJD,research,advocacy    Firkins, L.

Who isn‚Äôt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was just watching CNN (a rarity these days) and they were talking about what Obama has so far achieved. Here‚Äôs my own take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you have to credit the stimulus for pulling us out of some serious doldrums, even if the recovery is still only lackluster at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think the president has made stellar appointments, particularly in the science infrastructure; and I have been thrilled at the emphasis on science funding and science education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am less pleased with the relative lack of progress on solving the extremely urgent climate problem. Agency-wise, the administration has made all the right moves at places like EPA; but as Copenhagen approaches, we ought to be able to point to a lot more progress than that relatively easy stuff. Alas, we can‚Äôt, and Congress isn‚Äôt the only party responsible here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So overall, I give Obama a B.&lt;/p&gt;

Handley's shitty rebuttal to Wallace's article is sitting, waiting to be pounced on like a fucking limp gazelle on the African plains, surrounded by hungry hyenas.  If you must, check it out &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/wired-magazine-and-amy-wallace-drink-paul-offits-kool-aid.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just a note: the original article included a title that suggested Paul Offitt "intellectually" raped Wallace and that he must have slipped her a roofie.  Joke, sure, but if I had written the article instead of Ms. Wallace, I'm sure that lame, misogynistic joke wouldn't have made it in there.  Handley is a low-hanging-fruit type of douchebag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some gems from his little piece are as follows, obviously with my hilarious commentary to follow: &lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from a low-profile visit to Autism One, it seems Ms. Wallace never actually bothered to interview anyone from our side of the fence...&lt;/blockquote&gt;Why would she?  Hey J.B., ever seen this video? (watch the whole thing, but for the relevant portion to this post, pay attention starting at 3'10")&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/VIaV8swc-fo%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  &lt;br&gt;You're Barry.  Who the fuck would listen to Barry?  Why would any serious writer or reporter listen to Barry?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Handley references the website for "14 Studies" as though it were proof of harm from vaccination, which I'm not going to link to - rather, I'll link to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;David Gorski's excellent post on Science Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt; taking Handley to task for being a douche (my word, not Gorski's - he's too classy for that...I'm the low-brow around these parts, thank you).  Once you read that post and, hopefully, the others on the same topic, you'll see why I refuse to link to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In response to Wallace's statement that no study has linked death or serious injury to the DTaP vaccine (specifically pertussis), Handley says this:&lt;blockquote&gt;Wow, did you ever go to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program website? It‚Äôs hosted by our lovely government. It shows 792 claims of death from DTaP vaccine, and more than 1,200 claims of injury from DTaP where an award was paid by the government. You can read it all HERE (link to government table). Is that your definition of ‚Äúnonexistent‚Äù? Unbelievable!&lt;/blockquote&gt;It really is unbelievable.  Handley seems to not know the definition of the word, "claims".  See, J.B., a "study" is a scientific way to determine if there is actually any underlying truth to what you're saying or thinking.  A "claim" is something anyone can do, even if they have a tulip in their head where their brain should be.  Because "claims" were made and paid out by the government doesn't mean that the injury suffered was actually &lt;i&gt;caused&lt;/i&gt; by the vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He quotes Wallace's point that, counter-intuitively, more educated people tend to have a higher percentage of unvaccinated people/children.  To this he replies:&lt;blockquote&gt;Most people, hearing that rich, well-educated people vaccinate less, would stop and figure out why! Maybe with their brains, education, and free time, they know something you don‚Äôt seem to get?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Maybe, just maybe, J.B., it's because of the tendency of well-educated people to think they're educated in areas that they're not.  You could talk to James Randi about that, what with the whole &lt;a href="http://www.banachek.org/nonflash/project_alpha.htm"&gt;Project Alpha&lt;/a&gt; thing.  You're familiar with the term, &lt;i&gt;"arrogance of ignorance"&lt;/i&gt;, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wallace mentions that the internet empowers woo-woos to peddle their nonsense, wo which J.B. says:&lt;blockquote&gt;The mainstream media helps us? Which planet are you living on? And, the internet democratizes truth, you‚Äôd think Wired magazine would embrace that!&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm sorry, but anyone who says that the "truth" is democratic deserves this reaction:&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/1xUa4mOfaY8%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh yeah.  The laughing baby.  It's in your face, J.B., and you can do nothing but hang your head in shame.  Your grasp of reality is weak at best and if you think that "democratizing the truth" is a good idea, you must live inside a Colbert sketch.  You're a joke, and the baby's having a great laugh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rest of his article is a bunch of self-referencing bullshit.  Feel free to go check it out, but please, have a good book and some thing soft to land on when you stop laughing.  It's painful, but when a good piece like Wallace's comes out in a major publication, the loons come out of the woodwork to take a shit on it.  All we have to do is turn on the light so they scatter and sweep up the remains.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

I looked up in the manual to see what the semantics was.  The relevant diagram was clear and explicit.  The line pointing to that light on the picture of the base station unit said: "TAM LED".  Neither "TAM" nor "LED" had been previously glossed anywhere in the manual (the diagram was fairly near the beginning, on page 10).  That is a classic example of the sort of thing I refer to as &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=nerdview+Pullum&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;nerdview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You don't need to tell me what a TAM LED is; I did figure it out. I have a Ph.D., and years of experience as a linguist, and a broad acquaintance with technology.  I just wonder whether my old mum would have puzzled this out or would have just thrown the manual away in disgust.  Is there any excuse for being so utterly cryptic in a document that is intended to &lt;b&gt;help&lt;/b&gt; the uninitiated?

&lt;br&gt;And all I remember is thinking, "I want to be like them!" &lt;i&gt;--Gnarls Barkley&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And here's a new discovery (to me): the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/01%20Crazy%201.mp3"&gt;Violent Femmes version&lt;/a&gt; to help you through your post-Halloween Monday:

&lt;p&gt;The Ares I-X rocket has been all over the news recently.  I'm not sure that the news coverage sufficiently showcases how impressive this rocket actually is.  Sure, you've all seen a picture of the rocket on the launchpad.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/aresixlaunchpad.jpg" width="500" height="416" title="Taken in the early morning just before launch!" alt="aresixlaunchpad.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the rocket has &lt;a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum39/HTML/000134.html"&gt;a long history&lt;/a&gt;.  Yes, it's nearly twice as high as the space shuttle (at a whopping 327 feet, or 99.7 meters).  But did you know that when it was rolled out, it was attached to the launch pad by only &lt;i&gt;four bolts&lt;/i&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/a13.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/a13.jpg" width="500" title="327 feet tall and only 4 bolts holding it down.  Amazing!" alt="a13.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps most impressively, do you realize how tall 327 feet actually is?  Perhaps this vertical panorama of the rocket before it was rolled out expresses it better than words can.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/io9/2009/10/a11.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/500x_a11.jpg" width="500" height="982" title="Wow." alt="500x_a11.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, before you're ready for launch, you had better test your engines.  And that means testing the multiple different stages of the engines.  Take a look at the following two images to get an idea of the thrust involved.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/a2.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/a2.jpg" width="500" title="Those are some impressive engines!" alt="a2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both initial stages (above) and subsequent (below) need to be tested.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/a4.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/a4.jpg" width="500" title="The black smoke is from the exhaust kicking the ground up, not from the burning of the rocket fuel." alt="a4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2.6 million pounds of thrust that Ares I-X can produce is enough to accelerate it from 0-60 in under 8 seconds.  Not bad, considering it's accelerating &lt;i&gt;a rocket&lt;/i&gt;, and it continues to accelerate for minutes, rather than topping out after a few seconds like your car does.  We got a great view of this last week, at &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/flighttests/aresIx/index.html"&gt;Ares I-X's maiden launch&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/a16.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/a16.jpg" width="500" title="This &amp;#39;simple test&amp;#39; reached an altitude of 150,000 feet, nearly 30 miles up, and easily enough to make it into the stratosphere." alt="a16.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get your rocket going quickly enough, and you wind up making a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl-Glauert_Singularity"&gt;shock collar&lt;/a&gt;, as the difference in pressure at high speeds is enough to pull water vapor out of the air in a cone-like shape.  Rory Duncan captured this beautifully:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/ares1_duncan.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/ares1_duncan.jpg" width="500" title="Thanks, APOD!" alt="ares1_duncan.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, because of a slight malfunction in one of the parachutes, part of the rocket that splashed-down into the ocean got damaged upon impact with the water.  Amazing what a "soft" surface like water can do to a hard one like high-grade metal alloys used in constructing this rocket.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_ares_i-x_rocket_special/800px-Ares_I-X_booster_damage_2009-5997.jpg" width="500" title="That is one *huge* dent in some incredibly high-grade metal.  That one&amp;#39;s on you, kinetic energy." alt="800px-Ares_I-X_booster_damage_2009-5997.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We routinely find ourselves converging in speech and mannerisms to our friends and associates, or even the characters of our favorite TV shows. And it is also not unusual that, while engaged in conversation, we subconsciously adjust our posture to be similar to the stance of the person we are talking to. This type of subtle mimicry in social situations has convincingly been shown to have an effect on the person being mimicked; the effect usually occuring to the end that people have more positive feelings for those who mimic them than for those who do not mimic them.

In 1983, for example, Psychologists Richard Maurer and Jeffrey Tindal were able to show that when a counselor mimicked a client's posture, the client would perceive the counselors as possessing higher levels of empathy. Or more recently, a study from the Netherlands found that "a waitress who mimicked the verbal behavior of her customers by literally repeating their order received significantly larger tips".

It has been argued, from an evolutionary psychology perspective, that mimicry might function as a sort of "social glue", and one explanation for why humans like being (subtly) mimicked, entails that mimicry functions as a signal for similarity on other personal traits. However, as a recent study in the context of speed dating finds, mimicry does more than just affect our attribution of personal traits to another person. Mimicry also affects perceived physical attractiveness.

The study design is quickly explained: 66 (self-reportedly) single males were assigned to a speed-dating event, in which three female confederates randomly mimicked/did not mimic their behavior. 

The instructions for mimicry included subtle mimicking of verbal and non verbal behavior. For example, if a man would ask "‚ÄòDo you really do this?'' the confederate in the non-mimicking condition would simply answer ‚ÄòYes'', while in the mimicking condition there would be a repetition of the spoken words, as in ‚ÄòYes, I really do this'. Non-verbal mimicry included e.g. assuming a similar posture, or repeating gestures such as scratching ones ear. Confederates in the experiment were instructed to mimic 5 verbal and 5 non-verbal cues in each of the mimicry conditions, and were uninformend about the researcher's hypothesis.

A survey session following the speed-dating experiment showed that

"Women who mimicked men during the round of dating were more favorably chosen by men to give them their contact information than the same women who did not mimic them.The women's mimicking of men during the round of dating was associated with an increase in the men's evaluation of the quality of the interaction compared to when the women did not mimic them.The women confederates who mimicked men during the round of dating were evaluated as having greater sexual attractiveness than the women who did not mimic."

While the first two findings can be seen as a mere confirmation of previous findings regarding mimicry, the last of the above findings is surprising in that it indicates the power of mimicry

"to influence not only the perception of the personal or social attributes of the female mimicker but also her physical attributes"

As with so many studies, there remain caveats. For example, we do not know if the mimicry effect also holds when - in contrast to the cited study - men mimic women. Given that women tend to be less concerned with physical attractiveness (as I will discuss in the fourth installment of the science of speed dating series), it is especially unclear whether mimicry would affect women along the dimension of perceived attractiveness in the same way that men seem to be affected. This, along with some statistical concerns, will need to be investigated in greater detail in future studies, but for now at least it seems that mimicry is not only the sincerest form of flattery but also a good strategy for becoming a successful speed-dater.

Another post on the same study can be found at bps-research, and the other parts to the series are also published over at my evolved primate blog.

Stoic, rational, logical, critical, evidence-based, scientific are just a few of the adjectives that help define us. But in the context of skepticism, you seldom hear a skeptic embracing fantasy as a practical tool on our skeptical utility-belts. It‚Äôs time to make room for a new tool: fantasy sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, fantasy sports is being utilized in classrooms, and is apparently playing a big role in helping students achieve higher math scores. According to a &lt;a href="http://news.olemiss.edu/index.php/Ole-Miss-News/News-Releases/Fantasy-Math.html"&gt;University of Mississippi research report&lt;/a&gt; presented back in September, math scores of middle school students increased by nearly 50% in areas of mathematics ranging from fractions to algebra. The report also reveals that math scores for both boys and girls have improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of the impact that fantasy sports has had in the classroom is not all that new. For years, there have been numerous individual news stories reporting the anecdotes of teachers and students. But the University of Mississippi report appears to be the first research to collect the data on the relationship between fantasy football and math scores. Kim Beason, associate professor of park and recreation management at UM lead the examination of the data and described the results as ‚Äúhuge‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeptic in me knows that any one positive study or data set does not qualify as an established fact. And with so much anecdotal evidence and testimonials associated with the reporting of these incidents, I try to be careful to separate the facts from the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the investigation into the phenomena is proceeding correctly, and that is an encouraging sign. The process began with observation, then moved on to experimentation, which led to positive results. That led research and systematic data collection, which verified the results. This is a classic example of the scientific method in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to conduct more research, construct better quality studies if possible, collect more data, and analyze more results. Another encouraging aspect to all of this is that the data is math, which makes it less subjective to biases, prejudices and other pesky human factors that need to be closely guarded against in other types of studies. It should be easy enough to figure out if the results are positive or negative. I am hopeful that more institutions will continue to study the scores. So far, I see no reason to not embrace this approach to learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been a regular fantasy football player since 1996. My math skills were typically my strongest skills throughout my primary education well before fantasy sports ever became the popularity it currently enjoys (an estimated 20 million people in the US participate in fantasy sports.) When I came across this news just a few days ago I stood up and cheered (in my mind, at least) and was genuinely pleased to read these findings. Without math skills, it is almost impossible for science skills to take root. And without science skills, it is very difficult to achieve skepticism skills. So anything that society can utilize to better educate students in mathematics should be used to its fullest advantages, and if one of the tools to achieving those results is steeped in fantasy, then more power to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports fans reading this might be familiar with the ESPN show ‚ÄúOutside The Lines‚Äù. Not too long ago, they presented a segment on this very subject which you can link to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq6V6A3LF9M"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for you fantasy sports fans reading this, my team won 60-59 this weekend (my opponent and I have no players in tonight‚Äôs game, so our game is complete.) When Joseph Addai, running back for the Indianapolis Colts, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xC2Ducj5vw&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata"&gt;threw that touchdown pass&lt;/a&gt; late in the game against the San Fransisco 49ers yesterday, it was just enough of a bonus score to put me over the top and on to victory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evan Bernstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257188454954"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=10242">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da5168e21e6dc8c9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Aliens/UFOs"/><category term="Anti-Science"/><category term="Bottled Water"/><category term="Conspiracy Theories"/><category term="Cults"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Scientology"/><category term="Sylvia Browne"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><category term="cryptozoology"/><title type="html">AI: Whatcha doin‚Äô?</title><published>2009-11-02T19:00:35Z</published><updated>2009-11-02T19:00:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/11/ai-whatcha-doin/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ed3b633b3ae45bd985c3032e0ea349f0&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs in your shampoo.

For me, it is doing Darwin &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;. I have read &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species &lt;/em&gt;numerous times. I have read several of Darwin‚Äôs other works as well. I have read many of the letters, several bios, numerous scholarly papers, and so on. I have taken several classes in which Darwin has been taught and assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin Darwin Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species &lt;/em&gt;is one of the most brilliant books every written. It has been picked over and studied so much, there is scarcely anything new that one can say about it‚Äìalthough with its 150 year anniversary coming up, on November 24, surely many will try.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, trying to think about Darwin a bit differently than I had before, I was struck by Shapin‚Äôs reference to him as a ‚Äúsecular saint.‚Äù Indeed, there are apparently (Shapin said, I haven‚Äôt looked) well over 1,000 Darwin celebrations coming up this November. Which inspires me to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How is this possible? Why does this happen? Is there any other historic scientist that we celebrate nearly as much? And is it merely because of Darwin‚Äôs most famous theory on a scientific level, or is it something more than that?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Darwin means far, far more to us than anything his science, alone, can convey. He epitomizes something else, and I want to hazard that it is the following: A secular worldview, and moreover, a way to live a good scientific, or science-focused, life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the Darwinian version of the good life? Well, let‚Äôs look at how he lived it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a guy who, alongside his more famous episodes in big think (&lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Descent of Man&lt;/em&gt;), fastidiously studied earthworms, barnacles, and orchids; was a pigeon fancier and loved collecting beetles; and sat in his study virtually every day for 40 years and fiddled, coming up with bizarre experiments regarding, say, whether a seed shat through a bird will still be able to germinate, as reported in the &lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;I forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds, after an interval of many hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement; and several of these seeds retained the power of germination. Certain seeds, however, were always killed by this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(That passage always makes me crack up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through his life and how he spent it, then, it seems to me that Darwin embodies a worldview and a set of values which say something like the following: &lt;em&gt;Not only is religion not particularly important to my life, but what &lt;/em&gt;is&lt;em&gt; important is reveling in the complexity of nature, most emphatically including the smallest and meanest and most measly things‚ÄìDarwin‚Äôs barnacles, E.O. Wilson‚Äôs ants, the tiny freshwater microorganisms of my grandfather Gerald Cole‚Äôs research&lt;/em&gt;. And it is in the value judgment of saying that these things matter, that one should be gloriously nerdy and study them, and that in fact, this is an exceedingly worthy task for a human being, that Darwin becomes our epitome and our model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, Darwin‚Äôs unforgettably undramatic, and yet vividly recorded life, tells us is that it‚Äôs a good thing to be a scientist who studies ‚Äúall things great and small‚Äù (Shapin invoked the hymn), &lt;em&gt;even if&lt;/em&gt; they‚Äôre tiny and nasty and certainly not intelligently designed‚Äìbecause the amazing and the wonderful can now to be found in what a secular process created, and the satisfaction of understanding that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there were naturalists who exulted in the intricacies of life, in a markedly aesthetic way, long before Darwin. But were there naturalist heroes, naturalist saints, on a par with this country gentleman? I‚Äôm dubious. It is because Darwin merges a secular outloook with the earlier naturalist tradition (which was, previously, heavily theological) that he gives us the modern, scientific set of values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, of course, Darwin was the first to conceive of evolution by natural selection. But he also represents a lifestyle, an aesthetic, and a source of meaning that every life scientist, every birdwatcher, every fossil collector, still carries around today. Darwin isn‚Äôt just a guy who was brilliant‚Äìhe‚Äôs a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257185872033"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/on_why_misogynists_shouldnt_mess_with_th.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/48c6d9fe0e01541e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Autism"/><title type="html">On why misogynists shouldn't mess with the Goddess...</title><published>2009-11-02T18:00:43Z</published><updated>2009-11-02T18:00:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/09zGpNpNsig/on_why_misogynists_shouldnt_mess_with_th.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/on_why_misogynists_shouldnt_mess_with_th.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;...Isis shows us why by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/the_boys_call_out_misogyny_amo.php"&gt;calling out the anti-vaccine movement in general and J.B.

The flak Wallace has gotten, as detailed in her &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/msamywallace"&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; (from which &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/10/when_critics_disagree_with_me.php"&gt;Abel constructed a compilation&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I've been called stupid, greedy, a whore, a prostitute, and a "fking lib." I've been called the author of "heinous tripe."

&lt;p&gt;J.B. Handley, the founder of Generation Rescue, the anti-vaccine group that actress Jenny McCarthy helps promote, sent an essay title" "Paul Offit Rapes (intellectually) Amy Wallace and Wired Magazine." In it, he implied that Offit had slipped me a date rape drug. "The roofie cocktails at Paul Offit's house must be damn good," he wrote. Later, he sent a revised version that omitted rape and replaced it with the image of me drinking Offit's Kool-aid. That one was later posted at the anti-vaccine blog Age of Autism. You can read that blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/wired-magazine-and-amy-wallace-drink-paul-offits-kool-aid.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been told I'll think differently "if you live to grow up." I've been warned that "this article will haunt you for a long time." Just now, I got an email so sexually explicit that I can't paraphrase it here. Except to say it contained the c-word and a reference to dead fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the scientific issues around vaccination (including the lack of evidence to demonstrate a link between vaccinations and autism) are well-covered in these parts (especially at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/medicine/antivaccination_lunacy/"&gt;Orac's&lt;/a&gt; pad and by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/vaccination/"&gt;Mike The Mad Biologist&lt;/a&gt;), I just want to speak briefly about the strategy that seems to be embodied by these reactions to Wallace's article.&lt;br&gt;

We all know how a good cup of coffee wakes you up, makes you more alert, and helps you concentrate - thanks to caffeine.Or does it? Are the benefits of coffee really due to the caffeine, or are there placebo effects at work? Numerous experiments have tried to answer this question, but a paper published today goes into more detail than most. (It caught my eye just as I was taking my first sip this morning, so I had to blog about it.)The authors took 60 coffee-loving and gave them either placebo decaffeinated coffee, or coffee containing 280 mg caffeine. That&amp;#39;s quite a lot, roughly equivalent to three normal cups. 30 minutes later, they a difficult button-pressing task requiring concentration and sustained effort, plus a task involving mashing buttons as fast as possible for a minute.The catch was that the experimenters lied to the volunteers. Everyone was told that they were getting real coffee. Half of them were told that the coffee would enhance their performance on the tasks, while the other half were told it would impair it. If the placebo effect was at work, these misleading instructions should have affected how the volunteers felt and acted.Several interesting things happened. First, the caffeine enhanced performance on the cognitive tasks - it wasn&amp;#39;t just a placebo effect. Bear in mind, though, that these people were all regular coffee drinkers who hadn&amp;#39;t drunk any caffeine that day. The benefit could have been a reversal of caffeine withdrawl symptoms.Second, there was a small effect of expectancy on task performance - but it worked in reverse. People who were told that the coffee would make them do worse actually did better than those who expected the coffee to help them. Presumably, this is because they put in extra effort to try to overcome the supposedly negative effects. This paradoxical placebo response reminds us that there&amp;#39;s more to &amp;quot;the placebo effect&amp;quot; than meets the eye.Finally, no-one who got the decaf noticed that it didn&amp;#39;t actually contain caffeine, and the volunteer&amp;#39;s ratings of their alertness and mood didn&amp;#39;t differ between the caffeine and placebo groups. So, this suggests that if you were to secretly someone&amp;#39;s favorite blend with decaf, they  wouldn&amp;#39;t notice - although their performance would nevertheless decline. Bear that in mind when considering pranks to play on colleagues or flatmates.It looks like science has just confirmed another piece of The Wisdom of Seinfeld:Elaine: Jerry likes Morning Thunder.George: Jerry drinks Morning Thunder? Morning Thunder has caffeine in it. Jerry doesn&amp;#39;t drink caffeine.Elaine: Jerry doesn&amp;#39;t know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.George: You don&amp;#39;t tell him?Elaine: No. And you should see him. Man, he gets all hyper, he doesn&amp;#39;t even know why! He loves it. He walks around going, &amp;quot;God, I feel great!&amp;quot;- Seinfeld, &amp;quot;The Dog&amp;quot;Harrell PT, &amp;amp; Juliano LM (2009).

In this new paper, Dr Gabrielle Turner-McGrievy and colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill examined the impact of listening to a weight-loss podcast on body weight, physical activity, and fruit and vegetable consumption in overweight men and women. Subjects were randomly allocated to one of two groups; the control group which received a popular and freely available podcast focused on avoiding over-eating, and the experimental group, which received an &amp;quot;enhanced&amp;quot; podcast created by the study authors.  This enhanced podcast was based on Social Cognitive Theory, and included specific information on what to expect when attempting to lose weight, specific goals to achieve, and knowledge about how to achieve these goals.  Both groups received 2 podcasts each week for 12 weeks, and only met face-to-face with the researchers at the baseline and post-testing sessions....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It features &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446697966?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0446697966"&gt;God is Not Great&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,  and evangelical theologian &lt;strong&gt;Doug Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, November 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, I will be co-sponsoring a screening of that movie along with &lt;a href="http://www.thepainteddoor.org/"&gt;The Painted Door&lt;/a&gt;, a Chicago church.  Following the screening will be a discussion about the movie featuring myself and &lt;strong&gt;Chad Meister&lt;/strong&gt;, editor of of the forthcoming &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844744175?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1844744175"&gt;God is Great, God is Good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a refutation of Hitchens‚Äô book.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not a debate.  Just a discussion of ideas discussed in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets cost $5 (you pay when you get there), but you must &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=204357380883"&gt;RSVP here&lt;/a&gt; so we can add you to the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like an easy enough question. &lt;a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/physical_science/physics/atom_particle/cosmic_rays.html"&gt;Cosmic rays&lt;/a&gt; are little subatomic particles zipping across the Universe. We‚Äôve known about them for decades, and just about any astronomer who has used a space telescope knows and loathes them; cosmic rays zap our detectors, leaving bright streaks in the images which need to be tediously cleaned out before we can do any real science. I spent a large fraction of my time with Hubble doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what‚Äôs generating them? They seem to come from all directions in the sky, making it difficult to pin down their source. They‚Äôre moving at fantastic speeds, so they must have a huge energy source behind them. For years, astronomers have suspected that they are accelerated to high velocities in supernovae explosions as well as in the fierce solar winds from massive stars. Recent evidence has been making that supposition seem more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now &lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2009/pr200921.html"&gt;new results from the VERITAS gamma-ray telescope array&lt;/a&gt; have added fuel to that fire. VERITAS stands for Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, and it‚Äôs located atop a mountain in Arizona. When energetic gamma rays (a form of light) hit the Earth‚Äôs air, they create a shower of subatomic particle that rains down and can be detected by the telescopes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If cosmic rays come from supernovae and massive stars, then we should see more of them coming from galaxies that have a lot of stars being born. That‚Äôs because massive stars don‚Äôt live long. A nearby galaxy vigorously cranking out baby stars will therefore have lots of massive stars making cosmic rays. As a happy by-product, those same massive stars are the ones that blow up as supernovae, giving us a two-fer as far as cosmic ray production goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a galaxy exists: M82, a weird-looking one located a mere 12 million light years away (it‚Äôs close enough to see in binoculars, in fact). &lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/image_archive/2009/82/lores.jpg"&gt;The image above&lt;/a&gt; is M82 as seen by Hubble, Chandra, and Spitzer. Astronomers trained VERITAS on M82 and took a very, very long exposure. What they found is that is is a weak source of gamma rays, but definitely above the background level. The amount detected is consistent with cosmic rays being generated in the violent environment of the galaxy which then slam into the gas surrounding the stars, generating gamma rays. Another process, called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering"&gt;inverse Compton scattering&lt;/a&gt;, is probably behind this as well: when a low energy particle of light called a photon hits a cosmic ray, its energy is pumped waaaay up, and it becomes a gamma ray. Think of it like gently throwing a rubber ball in front of a speeding truck on the highway; the ball suddenly and violently finds itself with a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all may not seem like a big deal, but it is. For one thing, there are a lot of cosmic rays flitting about out there, so knowing what they are and how they formed is clearly a big piece of understanding the high-energy Universe. Also, these cosmic rays may have an effect here on Earth. Scientists have been studying how they may interact with the Earth‚Ä¶ and while the effect, if any, is incredibly small (people still argue over whether there is anything to this at all, like cloud formation and such) it‚Äôs worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I want to add something that makes me smile. The cosmic rays (which, remember, are subatomic particles) from M82 were detected because while still inside that galaxy they make gamma rays, a form of light, which then travel straight to Earth. But once those gamma rays hit our air they create subatomic particles once again, which are what VERITAS detects. So there are several steps to this process, with cosmic and gamma rays going back and forth until we actually detect their effect. It goes to show that sometimes the key to our understanding the Universe can involve subtle processes piled one atop the other, and it‚Äôs up to us to carefully peel back those layers to get to the underlying processes underneath. &lt;/p&gt;

This could be useful, I thought, but they actually mailed me copies of the forms, and‚Ä¶umm, no, they weren&amp;#39;t. As I rather expected, the evaluations are highly bimodal, with a majority giving me an enthusiastic thumbs up, and a substantial minority giving me a thumbs down. The negative reviews might have had some potential for helping me out, except, well, take a look at one example.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, a few of us: he mentions Dawkins, Dennett, Coyne, and me as the people who bring atheism into disrepute. We're in a schism, don't you know; I just wish he'd used the term &lt;b&gt;"Deep Rifts"&lt;/b&gt;, since that seems to be the fashionable phrase for everyone who wants to find consolation in the imminent demise of the New Atheist movement (to which we have to reply that we're very fond of our rifts, and consider our willingness to plunge into battle with even our fellow unbelievers to be part of our plucky, feisty charm).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here's the problem with Ruse. He believes that people who are atheists but are not Michael Ruse are all lacking in rigor and a charitable appreciation of the profundity of theological belief. At the same time, he believes that all those religious people whose beliefs he does not share must have built those ideas on a robust intellectual foundation, and that because they are nice people who invite him to give talks, maybe there could be something to that god-chattering stuff. And you should pat him on the back and congratulate him on his wisdom for seeing worth in even the most absurd proponent of creationism. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't have faith. I really don't. Rowan Williams does as do many of my fellow philosophers like Alvin Plantinga (a Protestant) and Ernan McMullin (a Catholic). I think they are wrong; they think I am wrong. But they are not stupid or bad or whatever. If I needed advice about everyday matters, I would turn without hesitation to these men. We are caught in opposing Kuhnian paradigms. I can explain their faith claims in terms of psychology; they can explain my lack of faith claims also probably partly through psychology and probably theology also. (Plantinga, a Calvinist, would refer to original sin.) I just keep hearing Cromwell to the Scots. "I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken." I don't think I am wrong, but the worth and integrity of so many believers makes me modest in my unbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modest in his unbelief, perhaps, but at the same time remarkably immodest in his self-congratulatory appreciation of his own uncritical, unquestioning acceptance of his fellow human beings' twisty theological rationales. &lt;i&gt;Of course&lt;/i&gt; any and all of us could be mistaken, and certainly are on many matters ‚Äî but that does not mean that all of our critical faculties must be discarded, that we look wise when we listen to both the bible-thumping bumpkin claiming that god made the earth by magic 6000 years ago, and the geologist rattling off a long list of detailed, technical explanations of the evidence for a 4¬Ω billion year old earth that got to its current state by the long accrual of natural events‚Ä¶and we say to both, &amp;quot;think it possible you may be mistaken&amp;quot;.  He looks like a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/michael_ruse_probably_wont_be.php"&gt;clueless gobshite&lt;/a&gt;, instead. Ruse's game is to suspend judgment when looking at the most appalling foolishness, a body of superstitions which he does not personally find believable, and to dial up the judgmental denial to 11 when he's looking at atheists who are not Michael Ruse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now fortunately, Jerry Coyne also found another good columnist in the Guardian, Marina Hyde, who instead of the phony and peculiarly biased objectivity Ruse demands, actually suggests that &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/30/scientology-religion-france-alien-fraud"&gt;looking at &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; religious claims critically is enlightening&lt;/a&gt;. She's discussing the recent bad PR that scientology has received, and suggests that when you step back and look at other religions, Jehovah isn't any more sensible than Xenu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when I think of Mel Gibson building his $42m church compound in Malibu, blithely telling interviewers at the time of the Passion of the Christ's release that his then wife would unfortunately be going to hell, because she was Church of England ... well, I can't find it in myself to find him any less barking than Tom Cruise.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Clearly, Scientologists should be forced to justify their doctrinal lunacies - the only sadness is that other religions are apparently exempt from having to do the same. Imagine for a moment a Bashir-type interviewing some senior cardinal. "So," he might inquire, "you're saying that by some magic the communion wafer actually becomes the flesh of a man who died 2,000 years ago, a man who - and I don't want to put words into your mouth here - we might categorise as an imaginary friend who can hear the things you're thinking in your head? And when you've done that, do you mind going over the birth control stuff?"
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What a shame that we see rather fewer of these exchanges, however amusing and useful a sideshow Scientology may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure, if I stop for a moment and put myself in a Rusian frame of mind, that Tom Cruise is wealthier and better-looking than me, and has achieved a remarkable level of success that suggests that we shouldn't dismiss his abilities as entirely without worth. I am also sure that McMullin, Plantinga, and Williams have also navigated the shoals of life successfully and acquired personal and professional reputations of which they can be proud. That does not in any way imply, however, that I should regard &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of their views as having earned some measure of respect; rather, we should learn from these fellows that some measure of lunacy and belief in groundless, overwrought nonsense is not a barrier to worldly success, and even that a whole-hearted frolic in a superstition shared by an influential community can be a personal benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could I be wrong in my belief that there is no god? Sure. Cromwell's cry applies to me and to you and to everyone. But you will not sway me by telling me that the proponents of god belief are not bad men, which was not an issue in question anyway; you will not find me appreciative of an approach that says the first step is to learn to be uncritical of ideas and suspend judgment simply because the other guy is caught in a different "paradigm".  An understanding that we may be mistaken does not mean that everyone is equally mistaken. Some beliefs, such as in Xenu and his fleet of space-faring DC10s, or Jesus performing cheap tricks in Galilee and giving us a ticket to heaven by being tortured to death, are simply patently absurd and demand far more rigor in their defense than lame testimonials to the good character of some theologians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/schisms_rifts_and_apologia_for.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ikJiVzt1bQg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257182001184"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/scienceonline2010_-_introducin_5.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/961500cd4b3749bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SO'10"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline2010 - introducing the participants</title><published>2009-11-02T16:36:14Z</published><updated>2009-11-02T16:36:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/pY51DAx1Kzc/scienceonline2010_-_introducin_5.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/scienceonline2010_-_introducin_5.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scienceonline2010logoMedium.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As you know you can &lt;a href="https://mistersugar.wufoo.com/reports/scienceonline2010-look-whos-coming/" title=""&gt;see everyone who's registered&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;, but I highlight 4-6 participants every day as this may be an easier way for you to digest the list. You can also look at the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Program/" title=""&gt;Program&lt;/a&gt; so see who is doing what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trevor Owens&lt;/b&gt; is the community lead for the &lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org/" title=""&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; project at the &lt;a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" title=""&gt;Center for History and New Media&lt;/a&gt; and a doctoral student in the &lt;a href="http://gse.gmu.edu/" title=""&gt;Graduate School of Education at George Mason University&lt;/a&gt;. He blogs at &lt;a href="http://www.trevorowens.org/" title=""&gt;the eponimous blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tjowens" title=""&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conference, Trevor will do an Ignite-style talk "Data mining the literature with Zotero" and will participate in the session about "Online Reference Managers".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marjee Chmiel&lt;/b&gt; (btw, Trevor and Marjee are married to each other) is a designer and producer of science video games at National Geographic's &lt;a href="http://www.jason.org/public/WhatIs/Games.aspx" title=""&gt;JASON Project&lt;/a&gt;. She is a PhD student in &lt;a href="http://it.gse.gmu.edu/" title=""&gt;Instructional Technology at George Mason University&lt;/a&gt;, blogs at &lt;a href="http://marjee.org/" title=""&gt;Science Games By Marjee&lt;/a&gt; and can also be found on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mchmiel" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conference, Marjee will do a demo of the JASON Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russ Campbell&lt;/b&gt; is the communications officer for the &lt;a href="http://www.bwfund.org/" title=""&gt;Burroughs Wellcome Fund&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.ncsmt.org/" title=""&gt;North Carolina Science, Mathematics and Technology Education Center&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;He can also be found &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/razoobe" title=""&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and I interviewed him &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_6.php" title=""&gt;a few months ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patric Lane&lt;/b&gt; is the &lt;a href="http://uncnews.unc.edu/content/blogcategory/23/71/" title=""&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://uncnews.unc.edu/content/blogcategory/25/74/" title=""&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; Editor at &lt;a href="http://uncnews.unc.edu/" title=""&gt;UNC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, he &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/patriclane" title=""&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Weston&lt;/b&gt; is the Director of Communication in the &lt;a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/" title=""&gt;College of Engineering at NC State University&lt;/a&gt; who is also &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Tuffysprite" title=""&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/scienceonline2010_-_introducin_5.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/pY51DAx1Kzc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257181553330"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/software_needed_enhanced_web_s.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b453f7ccec59efa9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">Software Needed: Enhanced web search</title><published>2009-11-02T16:07:05Z</published><updated>2009-11-02T16:07:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/YkxlXL6H2N4/software_needed_enhanced_web_s.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/software_needed_enhanced_web_s.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Google is great, and yes, I know all those tricks that make it greater.

And then from ‚ÄòJessica‚Äô followed by ‚ÄòCheyanne‚Äô. The link continued trickling in over the weekend‚Ä¶ Apparently readers are aware I occasionally have something to say about gender bias &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/01/21/on-sacrificing-reproductive-fitness-for-career-advancement/"&gt;in academia&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/05/28/%E2%80%98are-men-smarter-than-women%E2%80%98-the-conversation-continues/"&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2007/09/19/sex-in-the-blogosphere/"&gt;somewhere&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/03/25/singled-out/"&gt;the space between&lt;/a&gt;). My &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äôround &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/"&gt;tangled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencewoman/"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2009/03/is_sci_hot_or_not_who_cares.php"&gt;tubes&lt;/a&gt; don‚Äôt &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/"&gt;put&lt;/a&gt; up &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/"&gt;sort&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/"&gt;riffraff&lt;/a&gt; either. The piece begins like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a female professor, are you called rude and abrasive while your male colleagues who make similar statements are simply labeled assertive? Has your department head discouraged you from taking an assignment, saying that because you have children you might not be able to handle it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If things like that have happened to you, yell: ‚ÄúBingo!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California‚Äôs Hastings College of the Law is unveiling a new online game on Thursday called &lt;a href="http://www.genderbiasbingo.com/games.html"&gt;Gender Bias Bingo. &lt;/a&gt;The game is intended for women, although men who have overheard biased statements or have faced bias because they are fathers can also play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking &lt;a href="http://www.genderbiasbingo.com/games.html"&gt;the link&lt;/a&gt; led me to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/article/New-Game-Plays-on-Womens/48966/"&gt;&lt;img title="Picture 5" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/11/Picture-5.png" alt="Picture 5" width="505" height="581"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Visitors to this site are asked to choose a square and submit a representative story or quote from their experiences. The goal is to teach more of us to recognize gender bias while demonstrating the ways it can push women away from an academic career path. Director Joan C. Williams also explains the noteworthy economic angle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;‚ÄúIt does not make economic sense, particularly in these economic conditions, to keep recruiting women and then keep driving them out,‚Äù says Ms. Williams, who points out that a start-up package for a research scientist can cost as much as $1-million. ‚ÄúThere had never been built, as far as I could tell, a clear explanation of why it‚Äôs cheaper to keep her.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;While it‚Äôs too early to tell how the mission of &lt;a href="http://www.genderbiasbingo.com/games.html"&gt;Gender Bias Bingo&lt;/a&gt; will play out, it‚Äôs certainly a unique new initiative. Not only does the game highlight the myriad of struggles facing women in the ivory towers, but it serves as a kind of tangible record‚Äìa visible means to display the ugly marks left across academia by such behavior. In a small way, this might reflect that gender bias is less acceptable than ever. At least, I hope so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;What do readers think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

It can be poetic like in sea dragons or it can be lethal like in the spider on the left but, in general, it is not easy.

If the male of the Australian redback spider Latrodectus hasselti doesn&amp;#39;t try hard enough, he is immediately killed by the female he was trying to impress. Jeffrey Stoltz and Maydianne Andrade, from the University of Toronto Scarborough, in Canada, showed that the maiden demands at least 100 minutes of display (I saw the news here). If the suitor fails, the surviving rival wins. And there is more: in the paper they published in October in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the researchers also showed that a competent male mesmerizes the female in such a way that it becomes easy for a smart sneaker who didn&amp;#39;t make any effort to mate with her without anyone noticing. Cheateries of the wild world.

Less akin to Halloween, but not any easier, is the dance of the wild turkeys of the species Meleagris gallopavo, common in the United States. 

In the picture on the right, which I borrowed from flickr (johndykstraphotography, you can see some of the hardship. During the courtship season, the males puff up their feathers, fan out their tails, change their breathing in such a way that their heads become blue, bloodless, and some appendages on the head (the snood, the dewlap and the caruncles) become bright red and engorged with blood. They hold this posture for some time while they take short runs forward and gobble, which can be heard from far away, over the hills. They do this for hours on end, during weeks on end.

 

During my Ph.D I used to see these animals at Hastings, a research station managed by the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology of the University of California at Berkeley. My labmate Alan Krakauer was studying the turkeys and I had the privilege of helping him out sometimes. But more then helping, I used to get spellbound by the strutting of the turkeys. Unlike the turkey hens, who pecked at the ground looking blas√©. I even took loads of pictures, but can&amp;#39;t use one of them here because they&amp;#39;re on slides. Alan was trying to unravel a mistery: all this work to seduce a hen. The males display in pairs like in the picture. Do both win? Do they compete?

After much following the animals, setting huge traps, marking them, watching them and doing genetic analyses, he found that the wild turkeys are a textbook case of cooperative seduction. Only one of the males, always the same, scores. The other one helps with the synchronized dance, but leaves empty-handed. Genetics make up for it, according to Alan: the partners are closely related, so indirectly the secondary male ends up passing his genes forward. That&amp;#39;s kin selection, or Hamilton&amp;#39;s rule (William D. Hamilton mathematically described the theory). The turkey work earned Alan a paper in Nature in 2005.

But helping with seduction doesn&amp;#39;t always come from kin solidarity. Another Ph.D labmate, Emily DuVal (now a professor at the Florida State University, the picture is from her lab&amp;#39;s website), studies the charismatic lance-tailed manakin Chiroxiphia lanceolata, in Panama. There, a pair of males sits on a horizontal branch and they fly over each other like a cartwheel. Until the female is convinced. In their case, the dancing partners are not related. What seems to happen is that the subordinate male gains experience while at it, and some day he just might get there. 

Mercival Francisco, from the S√£o Carlos Federal University at Sorocaba, in Brazil, argues that the blue manakin Chiroxiphia caudata, typical of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, follows another system. In a paper published this year in The Auk, he shows that groups of dancing males (several of them in this species, not just a pair) may or may not be related. As he told me when I wrote a story on his work for Pesquisa magazine, they tend to stay where they were born. By chance, they may end up dancing with kin. 

When I told my cousin Laura about the manakins, she expressed regret that the males of these birds are so spruced up but not ours aren¬¥t. &amp;quot;Men have Ferraris,&amp;quot; I joked. A guy was passing by, not in a Ferrari but with a blasting stereo, elbow sticking out of the window and watching out for any women who might be watching. I never saw a woman do this.

Recently, just as I was getting to S√£o Paulo, traffic stopped as it often does on that point. The Ferrari guy was as stuck as I was, but a lot more upset. I couldn&amp;#39;t help thinking that the males of the rest of the animal world face huge costs to impress the ladies. Ours are not much different. I don&amp;#39;t imagine it is very comfortable, much less economically viable, to own such a car in a city filled with potholes and where you can&amp;#39;t push the gas pedal very far down.

Darwin reserved a special room for sexual selection in his theories, it was one of the major disagreements he had with Alfred Russel Wallace, codiscoverer of natural selection. I&amp;#39;ll come back to this soon.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/saganday.jpg" alt="saganday" title="saganday" width="400" height="140"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs in honor of Sagan‚Äôs birthday, which is on November 9th. He would‚Äôve been 75 this year. Sagan inspired a generation of astronomers, and in reality a whole generation of people to look at the sky and appreciate the ‚Äî yes, I‚Äôll say it ‚Äî cosmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrating his life is a great idea, and the folks at BCCC have a full day planned (the schedule is online in &lt;a href="http://www.freethoughtflorida.com/carlsaganday.org/carlsaganday/Program.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.freethoughtflorida.com/carlsaganday.org/carlsaganday/Programgridlarge.doc"&gt;Word&lt;/a&gt; formats). A lot of good speakers will be giving talks, including my friend Jeffrey Bennett (who wrote &lt;em&gt;Max goes to the Moon&lt;/em&gt; series of kids‚Äô books), skeptic and &amp;quot;Point of Inquiry&amp;quot; podcast host D. J. Grothe, and NASA astrobiologist and impact expert David Morrison (via satellite). I‚Äôll be giving my &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt; talk at 4:00 (with David there, I‚Äôll have to be on my toes). They‚Äôll be showing &amp;quot;Cosmos&amp;quot; continuously in one room, with kids‚Äô activities in another. There‚Äôs a planetarium show in the evening, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this will be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; special: James Randi will be there, talking about Sagan. The two were friends. Randi has a lot of personal insight on the man and will have wonderful things to say. This is a don‚Äôt-miss opportunity, folks. I think I‚Äôm looking forward to that part most of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more info, there‚Äôs contact info &lt;a href="http://www.carlsaganday.com/"&gt;on the Carl Sagan Day website&lt;/a&gt;. Also, there‚Äôs a writeup in &lt;a href="http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/events/carl-sagan-day-970245/"&gt;the Broward/Palm Beach New Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really will be a fun and wonderful tribute to Sagan. I‚Äôm very pleased and honored to be a part of this great day for a great man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad puts special time and talent into carving unique and beautiful pumpkins each year.¬† He bases his design on a specific story, sketches out an elaborate image, and uses special carving tools instead of a knife.¬†¬† I thought that looking at pictures would be a nice way to start the week.¬† This pumpkin is actually from a couple of years ago, but it seems particularly appropriate for us.  All descriptions and pictures were taken by my dad, Barry Galef, and more pictures from other years‚Äô are up &lt;a href="http://www.home.earthlink.net/~barrygalef/index.html"&gt;on his website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a charity auction, my dad was challenged to show all of 20th century physics on his pumpkin.  My dad rose to the occasion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last few years I‚Äôve donated a Jack O‚Äô Lantern to a charity auction. A friend was the highest bidder this year, and I offered him the chance to weigh in on the design. He said I‚Äôd done enough old folk tales, and wanted something modern. ‚ÄúOh, like Kafka‚Äôs ‚ÄòMetamorphoses?‚Äô‚ÄùNo. I want . . . the whole history of 20th Century Physics! It must have both the special and general theories of relativity, quantum mechanics, Schrodinger‚Äôs Cat, and Einstein insisting that God does not play dice with the universe!‚Äù At first I thought he was out of his gourd, but later realized he was truly inspired. I proceeded to try my best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Galef Pumpkin" src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/FullImage.jpg" alt="FullImage" width="600" height="703"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my illustration, I show God the Father as pictured by Michaelangelo along with Albert Einstein. God is tossing the dice ‚Äî but every face on his dice has only a single pip! Thus, any way they fall, we end up with snake eyes. So Einstein is both right and wrong: the dice are tossed, but God has no doubt of the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einstein is shown as God‚Äôs right-hand man, perhaps an unintended blasphemy. Albert is flipping Schrodinger‚Äôs Cat, in a reference to the randomness of flipping a coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img title="Einstein" src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Einstein.jpg" alt="Einstein" width="200" height="150"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img title="FlippingCat" src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/FlippingCat.jpg" alt="FlippingCat" width="330" height="150"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;Einstein flipping Schrodinger‚Äôs cat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;Alive, dead, alive, dead‚Ä¶&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My take on Schrodinger‚Äôs cat is that (1) even before we open the box, the cat itself observes whether it‚Äôs been poisoned or not, thereby collapsing its own probability wave, and (2) unlike a flipped coin, which lands on heads or tails by random chance, a flipped cat always lands on its feet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could say that I‚Äôve left out a lot of 20th century physics. In response, I can claim to have included dark matter, dark energy, and black holes in the design. You just can‚Äôt see them. And I do show the curvature of space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give my dad a lot of credit for my love of science and my cleverness, and I think this pumpkin is an excellent illustration of why.¬† It‚Äôs a shame he didn‚Äôt pass on his artisic talent as well‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.¬† I know theology and you don‚Äôt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . unlike the new atheists, I take scholarship seriously. I have written that &lt;a title="The God Delusion" href="http://richarddawkins.net/godDelusion"&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/a&gt; made me ashamed to be an atheist and I meant it. Trying to understand how God could need no cause, Christians claim that God exists necessarily. I have taken the effort to try to understand what that means. Dawkins and company are ignorant of such claims and positively contemptuous of those who even try to understand them, let alone believe them. Thus, like a first-year undergraduate, he can happily go around asking loudly, ‚ÄúWhat caused God?‚Äù as though he had made some momentous philosophical discovery. Dawkins was indignant when, on the grounds that inanimate objects cannot have emotions, philosophers like &lt;a title="Mary Midgley criticised his metaphorical notion" href="http://qotd.me/q2005-06-05.html"&gt;Mary Midgley criticised his metaphorical notion&lt;/a&gt; of a selfish gene. Sauce for the biological goose is sauce for the atheist gander. There are a lot of very bright and well informed Christian theologians. We atheists should demand no less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assertion that ‚ÄúGod exists necessarily‚Äù is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a satisfactory answer to critiques of First Cause arguments. As Dawkins and many REAL PHILOSOPHERS have pointed out, one could equally well say that the &lt;em&gt;Universe&lt;/em&gt; exists necessarily.¬† It is not fatuous to ask ‚ÄúWhat caused God?‚Äù ‚Äî not a bit. What was God doing before he created the Universe?¬† Yes, there are a lot of very bright Christian theologians, but I haven‚Äôt seen any of them make a satisfactory argument for why God exists.¬† Theology is the business of turning empirical necessities into religious virtues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.¬† Atheists aren‚Äôt nice or humble enough.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .how dare we be so condescending? I don‚Äôt have faith. I really don‚Äôt. Rowan Williams does as do many of my fellow philosophers like &lt;a title="Alvin Plantinga" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga"&gt;Alvin Plantinga&lt;/a&gt; (a Protestant) and &lt;a title="Ernan McMullin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernan_McMullin"&gt;Ernan McMullin&lt;/a&gt; (a Catholic). I think they are wrong; they think I am wrong. But they are not stupid or bad or whatever. If I needed advice about everyday matters, I would turn without hesitation to these men. We are caught in opposing &lt;a title="Kuhnian" href="http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/kuhnsyn.html"&gt;Kuhnian&lt;/a&gt; paradigms. I can explain their faith claims in terms of psychology; they can explain my lack of faith claims also probably partly through psychology and probably theology also. (Plantinga, a Calvinist, would refer to original sin.) I just keep hearing Cromwell to the Scots. ‚ÄúI beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I am wrong, but the worth and integrity of so many believers makes me modest in my unbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord help me, why would anybody turn first to a theologian if they needed advice about ‚Äúeveryday matters‚Äù? Do they have any special expertise?¬† And besides, how can we be ‚Äúmistaken‚Äù in our view that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no evidence for God‚Äù?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Atheists are politically incompetent and should shut up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want evolution taught in the schools and I can think of no way better designed to make that impossible than to spout on about religion, from ignorance and with contempt. And especially to make unsubstantiated arguments that science refutes religion. I never conceal my nonbelief. I defend to the death the right of the new atheists to their views and to their right to propagate them. But that is no excuse for political stupidity. If, as the new atheists think, Darwinian evolutionary biology is incompatible with Christianity, then will they give me a good argument as to why the science should be taught in schools if it implies the falsity of religion? The first amendment to the constitution of the United States of America separates church and state. Why are their beliefs exempt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/14/michael-ruse-whinges/"&gt;For a long time&lt;/a&gt; Ruse has been making the ridiculous argument that if you feel that evolution promotes atheism, then teaching evolution is the same thing as denigrating religion in the pubic schools.¬† Apparently the man is serious.¬† Although Ruse loudly and constantly praises himself for his perspicacity and deep understanding of philosophy and politics, he seems unable to comprehend this simple fact: the erosion of one‚Äôs faith by the facts of biology, astronomy, geology, biblical scholarship and the like does not mean that these fields are equivalent to atheism.¬† Is that so hard to understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here‚Äôs my ‚Äúgood argument,‚Äù Dr. Ruse:¬† lots of things that we teach students make them question not only their faith, but their fundamental values. This is GOOD.¬† Questioning your principles is one of the main aims of education, as Socrates knew well.¬† As biology teachers, our job is to teach evolution, for that is the true account of the history of life.¬† If that account leads some people to question or leave their faith, that‚Äôs just too bad.¬† But it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;not the same thing&lt;/em&gt; as telling students that there is no god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the one bringing us into disrepute? Ruse should look in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;______&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:¬† P.Z. , who has been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/shocking_evidence.php"&gt;photographed in passionate embrace with Ruse&lt;/a&gt;, noticed Ruse‚Äôs screed simultaneously and has posted about it &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/schisms_rifts_and_apologia_for.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/11/supposed-atheist-schism-article-coming.html"&gt;Russell Blackford&lt;/a&gt; has also posted.&lt;/p&gt;

How about one where you set your own hours, you don't have a boss, you have nothing to do but write at your own pace, you end up receiving fat royalty checks, and &lt;b&gt;you don't have to know anything at all about the topic that you write about&lt;/b&gt;?  The job is to write non-fiction (textbooks and handbooks), only it's OK if you &lt;b&gt;don't have a clue&lt;/b&gt; about the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word about your new career (and it's not "&lt;a href="http://distributionbizwiz.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/remember-dustin-hoffman-in-the-graduate/"&gt;Plastics&lt;/a&gt;"): &lt;b&gt;grammar&lt;/b&gt;!  The field where nobody much cares about anything that's been discovered since the 18th century, and you don't even need to get the 18th-century stuff right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll give you some examples over the next few days or weeks ‚Äî it depends how much time I get (unfortunately I have a real job where I have to attend meetings, teach things that are true, respond to questions, write sensible exam questions, and so on).  Here&amp;#39;s just one example for today.  &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Collins Good Writing Guide&lt;/i&gt; (HarperCollins, 2003; anonymous according to the title page but copyrighted by the estate of Graham King; ISBN-13 978-0-00-720868-5, ISBN-10 0-00-720868-5) is a successor to an earlier book by Graham King called &lt;i&gt;The Times Writer's Guide&lt;/i&gt; (2001).  On page 52 it points out that this sentence is an error:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Ask Tony and I for any further information you need.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows this up by telling you why the sentence is not acceptable:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; To correct this you need to recognise that &lt;i&gt;Ask&lt;/i&gt; is the subject and the phrase &lt;i&gt;Tony and¬†I&lt;/i&gt; is the direct object, because Tony and¬†I are receiving the action as the result of the verb ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right: the verb &lt;i&gt;ask&lt;/i&gt; is claimed to be the &lt;b&gt;subject&lt;/b&gt; of this imperative clause.  Graham King simply didn't have any idea what "subject of a clause" means!  Yet he wrote a best-selling book, republished after his death in 1999!  You could do likewise (not dying, I mean publishing a best-seller).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remark above isn't a typo or anything.  Graham King really was clueless about the notion of a grammatical subject, and so are the editors at HarperCollins.  On page 20 of the book, King defines SUBJECT as "what it is" and defines PREDICATE as "what we're saying about it", and his &lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt; illustrative example is this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;SUBJECT&lt;/b&gt;¬†¬†¬†¬†&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;PREDICATE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;My&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;word!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right; he thinks that when you say &lt;i&gt;My word!&lt;/i&gt; (as perhaps you do, if you are over about 70 and somewhat conservative of disposition), the thing you are talking about is &lt;b&gt;my&lt;/b&gt;, and the thing you're saying about it is &lt;b&gt;word&lt;/b&gt;.  And he thinks that means that the genitive pronoun &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; in this expression (which has the form of a noun phrase) is the subject.  This man simply had no idea what he was doing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just an embarrassing but isolated slip by an editor, you are thinking?  No, he really didn't get the concept. Lower down on the same page he claims that lots of English sentences have the predicate before the subject.  And his first example is this one:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;PREDICATE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;SUBJECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;It gradually became apparent that it was&lt;/i&gt;¬†¬†¬†&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;the odour of death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's quite a predicate, isn't it?  (Putting the alleged subject and predicate back in the normal order yields *&lt;i&gt;The odour of death it gradually became apparent that it was&lt;/i&gt;.  Doesn't sound so good, does it?)  In the sentence as given, of course, &lt;i&gt;the odour of death&lt;/i&gt; is a complement to the copular verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (preterite form &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;); it is not the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not making this stuff up.  I am copying it out of a reference book by the highly respectable HarperCollins firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, when I say respectable, I mean they are respectable in all sorts of subjects; but not in English grammar, obviously, because that's the subject where nobody needs to know anything to be an expert and respectability isn't defined.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set yourself up as a grammar expert it's better than being an expert on plastics.  To be an expert on plastics you actually have to know something about plastics.  With grammar the analogous thing doesn't hold.  Nobody asks, nobody checks, nobody knows enough to get suspicious. You are free as a bird to publish any garbage you might want to type out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your only problem, at least with people who have Internet access, will be Language Log, which does have a history of fingering this sort of thing and holding it up to ridicule.  Deal with that one awkward  stumbling block ‚Äî the giant Language Log corporation and its tens of thousands of readers ‚Äî and you could have a career ahead of you in writing grammatical poppycock for the masses.  You could get on the grammar gravy train.  Best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

And thoroughly uninformative. For real this time. Seriously, I say this every freaking time and end up writing a minireview on the damn thing... it&amp;#39;s just so damn alluring to go and read up random stuff on these organisms!We&amp;#39;ve been ignoring Archaeplastids again. Here, have some Scenedesmus:Scenedesmus dimorphus(?) 40x obj, DICOk, my images are shitty (damn thing is motile!), let&amp;#39;s look at a professional one:Source here; Scenedesmus in DICWhat you see here is a green alga that divides multiple times without splitting off to form a coenobium - a clonal &amp;#39;colony&amp;#39; of cells sharing an immediate ancestry. The sizes of coenobia depend on environmental conditions, such as availability of nutrients and sunlight, as well as presence of predators (they grow bigger to avoid being eaten). Often the end cells grow spikes (like the ones in the lower image).Actually, this thing is somewhat relevant to the slides I&amp;#39;m working on - regulation of mitosis (and &amp;#39;counting&amp;#39; cell divisions) is a very important aspect of multicellular development, since it&amp;#39;s not helpful to have cells that divide too much or too little. Actually, of extreme interest to humans is this slight issue that arises when cells divide too much - we call it cancer. As some may sadly know personally, the effects of uncontrolled division can lead to rather dire consequences.In Arabidopsis, stomata consist of a pair of guard cells surrounding a pore. Those guard cells come from a common precursor, called a guard mother cell (GMC). The stomatal lineage has a few specific genes seemingly responsible for enhancing the regulation of GMC division to ensure it happens once and only once. A double mitosis at that stage would result in guard cell clusters (which poses a problem to their opening and closing). There are some mutants where the regulation of this division gets screwed up - in some lines, you get single guard cells (ie no mitosis, and no pore); in others, you get clusters, sometimes massive ones. The molecular and genetic details behind cell cycle regulation are a fucking mess, and make one&amp;#39;s head spin. Which is what makes giving talks on the subject so much [evil] fun! XP bwahahaha!Now another question regarding those clusters is whether the nuclei go wild first, and then cell division follows to ensure each is separated off (sorta like palintomy), or whether the cells fail to exit the cell cycle upon division, and keep going into mitosis over and over again (with the complete set of mitotic events). When speaking of division, one must be careful to keep track of nuclear ploidy levels (DNA replication), karyokinesis (nuclear division) and cytokinesis (cell division). Now &amp;#39;mitosis&amp;#39; is one of those words that&amp;#39;s used to describe most, some, or all of the above, as if the cell cycle isn&amp;#39;t confusing enough as is. Note that each of these proceses interact with a million other things, and have regulatory checkpoints and so on. Which results in wonderful diagrams like this or papers like this or this Annual Review from hell. Seriously, you do NOT want that latter paper as a first intro to cell cycle. You just don&amp;#39;t.If any of the above confuses you, the point is that the cell cycle is bloody complicated.Back to Scenedesmus. The coenobium produced offspring inside each of its cells, which then vacate their parent cells and go on to explore the great world beyond. The characteristic divisions happen while the daughter colony coenobium is still inside the parent cell. (Pickett-Heaps &amp;amp; Staehelin 1975 J Phycol), and depend on the conditions present during the division. The details are descibed in (Zachleder et al. 2002 Eur. J. Phycol), which I&amp;#39;ll try to walk you through (and hopefully not fail too badly). So this is roughly how Scenedesmus regulates its length (in terms of cell number) in response to the length of light periods:Cell cycle events in daughter coenobia under various conditions. A) Typical cell cycle. G1 - &amp;#39;gap&amp;#39; one (main growth phase), S - &amp;#39;synthesis&amp;#39; (DNA replication), G2 - &amp;#39;gap&amp;#39; two (post replication growth phase), M- mitosis. B) Cell cycle of Scenedesmus under high temperature and low irradiance. CP - commitment point, where the cell &amp;#39;commits&amp;#39; to divide regardless of environmental conditions to follow. Unlike the canonical model (A), where the cell immediately undergoes cytokinesis after karyokinesis, the daughter coenobium undergoes another growth phase (G3) prior to undergoing cell division. Thus, this is a nice model for separating nuclear mitosis and cytokinesis. C) Placing the synchronised cells into the dark after the first commitment point results in only one round of mitotic divisions. (the bar above represents amount of time spent in light and dark) (presumably, the cells don&amp;#39;t divide in the dark)D) Cells placed in the dark after the second commitment point. This results in two rounds of mitotic divisions, which also overlap (so the S of the second stage hits the nuclei when the first division stage is at M; ie during mitosis, the nuclei undergo replication. It would be so much fun to prod at this at the molecular level! *drools* E)Darkness after the third commitment point. Three overlapping cell cycles. Note how G3 of the first cycle is elongated in order to undergo cytokinesis after all the nuclear divisions have been carried out. Seriously, how does the organism coordinate its cell cycles carefully enough to allow this madness to proceed smoothly?(Zachleder et al. 2002 Eur. J. Phycol)So what...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

A typical news story on Jennings can be seen here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not a neurologist, which made me reluctant to take this on, but right from the beginning something didn't seem right. I had never heard of a case of dystonia that looked anything like the above, particularly the part where walking backwards reversed (if you'll excuse my word choice) her jerky motions or where she could run but not walk. Moreover, it seemed highly unlikely that a vaccine could cause such a problem. However, I didn't have the expertise to take this on; so I waited a while in the hope that someone who does have the expertise would do so eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Steve Novella did.

You know, the frights, spooks, willies, nerves, jitters, heebie-jeebies? Do you get these feelings when you have to enter a dark room alone, or if you find yourself on a lonely street at night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the most hardcore skeptic can still be frightened by dark or scary places. One does not have to believe in ghosts to be a little apprehensive about staying in a large medieval castle alone through the dead of night. Sure, being rational is a distinct advantage, as we¬† skeptics can reassure ourselves that there is nothing to be afraid of. However, sometimes it seems that our imaginations did not get the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fears are innate and primal. We can rise above them ‚Äì but they are still there. Apparently we are descended from those hominids who had such an innate fear of the dark, who wanted to stick close to their parents at night, or seek the comfort of fire‚Äôs light. Those who were fearless and more comfortable hanging out alone near the shadows probably did not fare very well. So fear is always with us, lurking in the more primitive parts of our gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Fear of the dark is also not the only innate fear. The first time I had an MRI scan, I never thought for a moment it would cause me any fear, but then the sensation of being completely helpless inside that small tight tunnel resulted in a primal claustrophobic sensation. I was able to distract myself and get through it ‚Äì but the fear was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us also like to be scared. Halloween is a favorite holiday in my family (especially with by brother, Bob, who actually runs a haunted corn maze in October). We like to be brought to the brink of terror, but then relieved in our own safety. It gives us a thrill. Perhaps it is also a way to experiment with the boundaries of our own fear ‚Äì to know what is safe, or perhaps how we will react when real fear rears its head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other reasons than fear that belief in ghosts persists. Our brains are not perfect tools ‚Äì they are subject to a host of anomalies in perception and altered states. Our hardwiring can easily generate a sensation of an entity, perhaps right at the periphery of our vision. We can hear noises that are nothing more than neuronal echoes. We have have waking dreams ‚Äì a fusion of the awake and dreaming states. Sleep deprivation (not uncommon on late night ghost hunts) can result in hallucinations and altered perception. And we are highly suggestible, often seeing and experiencing strange phenomena simply because we expect to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has also shown that the more frightened we are, the more likely we are to see patterns where they do not exist. It is as if when our nervous system is put on alert for danger, we shift into hyper-pattern-recognition mode. When sifting reality for real patterns, we tend to err on the side of seeing patterns that are not there, rather than missing genuine patterns. Fright and anxiety shifts the balance further in favor of seeing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore no surprise that during ghost-hunting, or a seance, or hunting for EVP‚Äôs, etc. that people will experience strange things and attribute them to the paranormal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scientists have also tried to explain such experiences (not that it is really necessary) as a response to physical phenomena ‚Äì such as magnetic fields or infrasound. &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427321.200-where-do-ghosts-come-from.html?full=true"&gt;Research into these effects&lt;/a&gt;, however, have been mixed, with the best double-blind studies showing no difference in strange experience when the magnetic fields or infrasound were on or off. It is not implausible that physical phenomena contribute to spooky experiences, but the evidence for these specific causes is thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding human nature itself is one of the key skill sets for critical thinking and skeptical analysis. We are, generally speaking, a jittery species, with some built in fears ‚Äì fears that kept our ancestors alive (and still likely have some survival benefit today), and now feed the horror movie and Halloween industries, as well as the annoying ghost-hunting genre of reality TV.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257168616451"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/todays_carnivals_446.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f12fab6ef6f4033e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-11-02T12:34:29Z</published><updated>2009-11-02T12:34:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/0JvZrC1Pv6c/todays_carnivals_446.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/todays_carnivals_446.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Festival of the Trees&lt;/strong&gt; #41 is up on &lt;a href="http://arvoresvivas.wordpress.com/2009/10/31/festival41/" title=""&gt;Blog do √Årvores Vivas/Living Trees Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/todays_carnivals_446.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/0JvZrC1Pv6c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257167769141"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=6203">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6cc02aff8ad103c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Theological hypocrisy</title><published>2009-11-02T12:49:37Z</published><updated>2009-11-02T12:49:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/theological-hypocrisy/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yay for the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; ‚ÄúComment is Free‚Äù section!¬† True, the paper suffers under the burden of Andrew Brown and Madeleine Bunting, but it also has Anthony Grayling and Marina Hyde.¬† In her &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/30/scientology-religion-france-alien-fraud"&gt;column last Friday&lt;/a&gt;, Hyde points out that the viral posting of news videos about Scientology (my own example &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/28/nightline-piece-on-scientology/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) has done tremendous damage to the reputation of that&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt; cult&lt;/span&gt; religion.¬† There‚Äôs something about seeing a Church official stonewall about Lord Xenu that brings home how truly ridiculous their belief system is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the internet wot dun it. Did I lose you on the intergalactic tyrant stuff? Then Google it immediately, as you are fortunate enough to be able to do these days. During his lifetime, the religion‚Äôs inventor L Ron Hubbard deemed the chief enemies of Scientology to be tax inspectors and psychiatrists (it is not desperately difficult to figure out why). Even a sixth-rate science fiction writer such as himself would not have been able to predict that it would be the web that would pose the gravest threat to his church since his inception, facilitating everything from the circulation of whistleblower accounts and cult-busting advice to videos of Tom Cruise chuckling maniacally while repeating ‚Äú&lt;a title="KSW! Keep Scientology Working!" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article3199668.ece"&gt;KSW! Keep Scientology Working!&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù Strangely, there are times when ‚ÄúLol!!‚Äù ‚Äì normally the seal-honk of the internet‚Äôs least self-aware halfwits ‚Äì really is the most eloquent dismissal on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you haven‚Äôt seen the Bashir interview, you can do so &lt;a title="on YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUiUyVqOuJI"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Challenged on the old Xenu chestnut, Davis knows how utterly loony tunes it sounds, and walking out evidently seems less damaging than even having the discussion. And so with the French court case. How could the Scientologists possibly have argued that the readings from their Fisher Price-style Play‚Äôn&amp;#39;Polygraph machine justified a penny in the collection tin, let alone hundreds of euros worth of books?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyde floats the possibility that the internet could do to Christianity what it did to Scientology.¬† After all, when you put down Christian theology in black and white, it doesn‚Äôt look much saner than the soul-sniping exploits of Xenu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Scientologists should be forced to justify their doctrinal lunacies ‚Äì the only sadness is that other religions are apparently exempt from having to do the same. Imagine for a moment a Bashir-type interviewing some senior cardinal. ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he might inquire, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre saying that by some magic the communion wafer actually becomes the flesh of a man who died 2,000 years ago, a man who ‚Äì and I don‚Äôt want to put words into your mouth here ‚Äì we might categorise as an imaginary friend who can hear the things you‚Äôre thinking in your head? And when you‚Äôve done that, do you mind going over the birth control stuff?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a shame that we see rather fewer of these exchanges, however amusing and useful a sideshow Scientology may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not holding my breath.¬† The question of why bizarre Christian beliefs are treated with more respect than the equally bizarre tenets of Scientology has a simple answer. ¬† ‚ÄúModern‚Äù religions, like Scientology and Mormonism, seem more bizarre simply because they‚Äôve arrived on the scene only recently, making their¬† man-made nature more apparent, and because their adherents &lt;em&gt;are not in the majority&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, next to the problem of evil, the problem of Why My Religion Is The Only True One is the greatest of all arguments against faith.¬† Christians ‚Äî or adherents to any other religion ‚Äî can simply give no good account of why their beliefs are the right ones, while those of Hindus, Scientologists, and Muslims are badly wrong.¬† It would be a dishonest Christian who would deny that had he been born in Saudi Arabia, he would be as big an advocate for Muhammed as he is now for Jesus.¬† Ask an evangelical Christian how he knows for certain that all Muslims and Jews are going to hell!¬† Believe me, the answer won‚Äôt satisfy you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this irrational certainty that enables people like Andrew Sullivan to&lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/10/the-unbelievers-huddle.html"&gt; whine and cavil&lt;/a&gt; when we nasty militant uncivil atheists treat Catholicism without kid gloves, and yet to feel free to heap scorn on other faiths.¬† For the past couple of weeks over at &lt;em&gt;The Daily Dish&lt;/em&gt;, Sullivan has been conducting a campaign against Scientology, calling it &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/10/shilling-for-the-super-adventure-club.html"&gt;‚ÄúThe Super Adventure Club‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;, linking to South Park videos that mock it, calling it a &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2006/03/the_super_adven.html"&gt;‚Äúsuper-secret brainwashing cult‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; and the like. (See &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/fs/esearch.php?sort=time&amp;amp;source=sullivan&amp;amp;words=super+adventure+club&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for all his posts on Scientology.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now don‚Äôt get me wrong.¬† I agree with Sullivan:¬† Scientology is exactly as ludicrous as he makes it out to be.¬† The &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/10/shilling-for-the-super-adventure-club.html"&gt;South Park video&lt;/a&gt; is a hoot.¬† But what Sullivan fails to get is that the beliefs of Catholicism and Christianity are just as weird as those of Scientology.¬† Here, from &lt;a href="http://atheistcamel.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atheist Camel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is a summary of Christian theology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The belief that a walking dead Jewish deity who was his own father although he always existed, commits suicide by cop, although he didn‚Äôt really die, in order to give himself permission not to send you to an eternal place of torture that he created for you, but instead to make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh, drink his blood, and telepathically promise him you accept him as your master, so he can cleanse you of an evil force that is present in mankind because a rib-woman and a mud-man were convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this summary sound offensive? It‚Äôs no more so than Sullivan‚Äôs summary of Scientology, and although it‚Äôs humorous, it‚Äôs also &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôve said before, in some ways I like Andrew Sullivan.¬† I find many of his political views agreeable, and I sympathize with the plight of a gay man whose faith is completely inimical to his sexual life.¬† But I‚Äôm fast losing any remaining respect for the guy.¬† With his sneering dismissal of Scientology, he shows himself to be nothing more than a hypocrite.¬† By all means whale away at Lord Xenu, Mr. Sullivan, but don‚Äôt complain when the rest of us go after your magical wafers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a bit more context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have figured out by now that it's speech played backwards.¬† The original was part of a question that Kurt Andersen addressed to Richard Powers in an interview discussed &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1845"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's especially interesting how different many of the vowel-qualities seem in the forwards and backwards versions, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Forwards&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Backwards&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

My humble blog has nothing of the reach of Hitchens‚Äô writing, but it is still occasionally the case that after posting a blog I am contacted by people I really wish I had spoken to before I finished writing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1152"&gt;on Friday I discussed the case&lt;/a&gt; of Desiree Jennings, the 25 year old woman who claims to have developed dystonia 10 days after receiving the seasonal flu vaccine. I reported that all of the neurological experts who viewed the videos of Jennings that were made public (including me) are of the opinion that she does not have dystonia. Rather, the signs she displays are more typical of a psychogenic movement disorder, and therefore not due to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another angle to this story, however, that I was not aware of. I was mostly interested in the vaccine angle, as the Jennings story has been exploited by the anti-vaccine movement to further scare-monger about the flu vaccine. There is also a dystonia community, and they were not happy about the Jennings affair either. In particular, a woman by the name of &lt;a href="http://www.lifewithdystonia.com/"&gt;Rogers Hartmann&lt;/a&gt;, who suffers from dystonia, and who has been one of the main faces of dystonia activism to the media, contacted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dystonia community is concerned that the fact that neurology experts are forced to go on public record that Desiree Jennings‚Äô symptoms are more consistent with a psychogenic disorder rather than a true neurological disorder may generate confusion in the public about the nature of dystonia itself. Fair enough ‚Äì although I thought the doctors who were interviewed on Fox were pretty clear. I will also add here that dystonia is a perfectly legitimate movement disorder. It is, in fact, a brain disorder that results in involuntary muscle contractions. It can be very debilitating. The Desiree Jennings case should not confuse anyone about the nature of true dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is more still. Generation Rescue, the anti-vaccine group started by J.B. Handley and now fronted by Jenny McCarthy, was quick to jump on this case as a legitimate vaccine injury. But they then quickly distanced themselves from the case, removing the web page they had set up for Jennings. Here‚Äôs why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story appears to have been broken by the &lt;a href="http://loudountimes.com/blogs/loudoun-lowdown/2009-10-13/loudoun-lowdown-nicholas-graham-flu-shot-desiree/"&gt;Loundountimes.com&lt;/a&gt;. Reporter Nicholas Graham discloses the Jennings is a colleague of his, and undoubtedly that is how he heard of her story. The story was then picked up by a&lt;a href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/health/101309_woman_disabled_by_flu_shot_reaction_dystonia"&gt; Fox affiliate in DC&lt;/a&gt;, reported by Claudia Coffey. From there it was picked up nationally by Fox News and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGT0r-udstQ"&gt;Inside Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generation Rescue president, Stan Kurtz, apparently saw the Jennings story as an opportunity to get some free press for their anti-vaccine nonsense. They ‚Äúreached out‚Äù to Jennings. Here is what Kurtz had to say in an interview with Coffey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAnd the story is, anyone that sees‚Äì it is just so compelling, Jenny was crying over it,‚Äù says Kurtz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurtz also believes with the proper treatment, some of her symptoms may be reversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWell, unfortunately we happen to be very good at handling vaccine injury. We‚Äôve got a lot of doctors that have experience in doing that, so our doctors and our resources are completely available to her, and we‚Äôre going do everything we can to give her a lot of options to, to help take care to help recover from this condition as best we can,‚Äù says Kurtz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor Jenny was in tears, and Kurtz was ready to help by unleashing anti-vax quackery to treat Jennings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then Kurtz and Generation Rescue ran into a real patient advocacy group ‚Äì Rogers Hartmann and dystonia activism. Hartmann runs an independent dystonia charity, &lt;a href="http://www.lifewithdystonia.com/"&gt;lifewithdystonia.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was clear to Hartmann (as it was to anyone sufficiently familiar with dystonia) that Jennings did not have dystonia. She called Fox and Stan Kurtz ‚Äì and then the furious backpedaling began. Until then Coffey had accepted the story at face value, without any journalistic due diligence in evidence. When she learned that perhaps she had been snookered, the panicked calls to Hartmann began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not until after Hartmann became involved, and the e-mails and phone calls of many other dystonia activists putting pressure on Fox, did they do follow up reporting, such as interviewing &lt;a href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/health/102109_desiree_jennings_dystonia_explained"&gt;Dr. Stephen Grill about dystonia&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that Jennings does not have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also due to Hartmann that Generation Rescue was (partially) saved from its own stupidity and zealotry. Stan Kurtz was going full-steam ahead, as if Generation Rescue had the expertise to diagnose and treat vaccine-induced dystonia (an entity never reported in the medical literature). And then (after being contacted by Hartmann and having the truth of the matter explained to them) suddenly and without a word, Generation Rescue backed away from Jennings and took down the web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they will be as interested in helping Jennings now that they cannot exploit her case to fear monger about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously,&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/vaccine-injury-isnt-just-for-babies-the-desiree-jennings-flu-shot-story.html"&gt; the Age of Autism blog&lt;/a&gt; (never ones to let the facts get in the way) is still treating the case as a legitimate story of vaccine injury. Although they are being a bit cagey. They are just printing a letter from Jennings, with a preamble dismissing expert opinion that her disorder is psychogenic. They do this by explaining the etymology of the word ‚Äúhysteria‚Äù, which is not exactly a synonym for psychogenic (in fact ‚Äúhysteria‚Äù is no longer used because of its connotation). I guess they deny all psychogenic illness, even though it is very well described in the neurological literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have personally seen cases that were proven to be psychogenic. These are not just cases where we cannot find a neurological cause ‚Äì it is not a guess or a last resort. There are cases in which the neurological signs and symptoms on display are anatomically impossible ‚Äì where a psychogenic cause is the only plausible explanation. And it is treated as a real and serious disorder ‚Äì just a psychological disorder, rather than a neurological one. Ironically, AoA is trying to imply that neurologists who invoke the psychogenic diagnosis are being insensitive, but in reality they are basing their implications on a premise that is itself insensitive ‚Äì a rather unsophisticated and harmful denial of psychological illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, AoA is still running with the story, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/jenny-mccarthy-and-jim-carrey-reach-out-to-disabled-redskins-cheerleader.html"&gt;writing in follow up&lt;/a&gt; about how Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carey were so kind to reach out to Jennings. I guess they didn‚Äôt get the memo from their sponsor, Generation Rescue, to back off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an unfortunate story, and I wish Desiree Jennings the best. I hope she finds her way to a competent clinician and does not get caught in the maelstrom of quackery that is sure to follow her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not a story of a woman injured by a vaccine. This is not even a rare vaccine reaction. It is something else. Neurological experts know it, and the dystonia community knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a story of irresponsible journalism. As Hartmann pointed out to me ‚Äì most national media outlets did not touch this story, because even basic journalism would have uncovered that there is something fishy here, and no good journalist wants to get caught with their pants down. This is also a story of how irresponsible the anti-vaccine movement is. They were quick to exploit this case for its emotional appeal, pretending to have expertise they lack, and got it completely wrong. That‚Äôs a good summary of the anti-vaccine movement as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generation¬† Rescue has &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/desiree_jennings.html"&gt;put back their page&lt;/a&gt; about Desiree Jennings. Apparently they decided that the propaganda value outweighed the risk. They are attacking those of us who felt obliged to say that the public videos of Jennings do not support a diagnosis of dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They again attack the concept of psychogenic, minimizing in the process all mental illness, and comparing it to outdated notions that autism was due to cold mothers. This is an absurd comparison. The only point being made is that Jennings symptoms, those that are in the public domain, are not compatible with the diagnosis of dystonia. It can further be added that there is no evidence or plausible reason to conclude that her symptoms are due to the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also repeat the anti-vax canard of using the vaccine injury compensation program as scientific evidence for specific types of injury caused by vaccines. This is not legitimate ‚Äì the vaccine compensation program has a very low threshold of evidence for accepting claims. They only conclude that ‚Äúcompensation is appropriate‚Äù ‚Äì not that it has been established that the alleged injury is in fact caused by vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Generation Rescue if being very intellectually sloppy in their presentation of this case, the public discussion of this case, and the nature of the evidence for vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;

Sunsara made travel plans to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, they rescinded their offer for her to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sunsara‚Äôs publicist, there was some controversy about her other social/political views (she‚Äôs a Communist, for one) ‚Äî some of them distortions of her actual views ‚Äî and she was disinvited rather quickly.  This seems quite‚Ä¶ shall I say‚Ä¶ unethical?  You don‚Äôt disinvite a speaker after you invite them ‚Äî especially when you‚Äôre an Ethical Society that purports to be open to different ideas, including ones you may disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunsara &lt;a href="http://sunsara.blogspot.com/2009/10/stop-unprecedented-effort-to-cancel.html"&gt;wrote them a letter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This attempt to cancel my talk has clearly been driven by political and ideological disagreements with me by some on the EHSC program committee. This is shameful for any organization, but coming from [an] organization that prides itself on ethical action and promoting intellectual, philosophical and artistic freedom it is all the more disturbing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in that letter were blurbs of support for Sunsara from myself and a few other people you might have heard of (&lt;strong&gt;Chris Hedges&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Massimo Pigliucci&lt;/strong&gt;, etc).  Later on, &lt;a href="http://sunsara.blogspot.com/2009/10/letter-from-sunsara-protesting-ehs.html"&gt;there were supportive blurbs&lt;/a&gt; from people like anti-war activist &lt;strong&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/strong&gt; and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060560053?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0060560053"&gt;The Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Sharlet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me step back for a moment and say I think this whole thing has been blown up way out of proportion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the EHSC ‚Äî a group I‚Äôve also spoken to before ‚Äî did the wrong thing in revoking their offer for her to speak.  They should‚Äôve simply done the right thing and let her talk ‚Äî and if she said anything members disagreed with, allow them to debate and question her afterwards.  That‚Äôs what they did when I spoke there, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that‚Äôs about as far as it goes, right?  This isn‚Äôt life or death.  I don‚Äôt think many people are losing sleep over this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out one member of the EHSC agreed with Sunsara and &lt;a href="http://sunsara.blogspot.com/2009/10/undeterred.html"&gt;offered to host her&lt;/a&gt; at his own home &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the EHSC‚Äôs normally scheduled meeting time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut to a couple days ago.  On Saturday, Sunsara was running an unrelated workshop at the EHSC and made a statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/yU8rFQ2YTls%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the last 30 seconds, if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slight tangent: In the video above and in this letter written to the EHSC, Sunsara makes a strange comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Further, the fact that it is the bureaucratic ‚Äúright‚Äù of the Board of Trustees to reach the decision to dis-invite me does not make that decision morally right, any more than the ‚Äúright‚Äù of California voters to ban gay marriage through Proposition 8 made that decision morally or ethically defensible.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs trivializing a serious issue and just hurts her case.  Just like her use of the word ‚Äúexile.‚Äù  She‚Äôs not a martyr and there‚Äôs no need to make her one over this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regardless of her rhetoric, she shouldn‚Äôt have been disinvited.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So‚Ä¶ cut to yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She still wasn‚Äôt re-invited to speak, but she showed up to the Sunday meeting as promised.  She made a statement similar to the one in the video, while standing near her seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One man was videotaping her statement with her permission.  Then, chaos ensued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunsara‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://sunsara.blogspot.com/2009/11/newsflash-from-chicago.html"&gt;personal blog explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
‚Ä¶ plainclothes and uniformed police who had been called in earlier by officials of the Ethical Humanist Society of Chicago (EHSC) dragged out, maced and arrested a man for videotaping Sunsara Taylor as she stood near her seat and made a statement before the start of that morning‚Äôs program about the shameful cancellation of her long planned talk to EHSC that day on the topic ‚ÄúMorality without Gods.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shocking incident took place at the insistence of the president of EHSC. About 40 people witnessed the videographer being brutalized by the police in the foyer of the facility. An attorney demanded that the police stop brutalizing him when five officers piled on him as he lay face down on the floor. 6 police cars arrived within minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What.  The.  Hell‚Ä¶?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I feel like the kids on &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt; right now‚Ä¶ not sure why everybody around me is making such a big deal out of something that‚Äôs clearly not one.  Somehow, everyone‚Äôs getting involved and nothing good can possibly come from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe some of you can shed more light on this story, because I‚Äôm really only seeing one side of it.  The EHSC hasn‚Äôt said anything to my knowledge. I‚Äôm still confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd love to know why police were involved on Sunday, why the EHSC really disinvited Sunsara, and what ramifications this issue will have in the future, if any.&lt;br&gt;

Within less than a day two of the most powerful Earth-based telescopes had begun studying the quickly fading light of the object, known as GRB 090423. (There were other observatories investigating it as well.)Because the light from GRBs fades so rapidly, most such objects are detected from space-based instruments that are especially designed for the purpose, like Swift. On average about 1 GRB is detected every 2 or 3 days. But GRB 090423 turned out to be, perhaps, the most interesting one yet observed.I&amp;#39;ve written about GRBs a couple of times before, such as here and here.You can refer to those articles for more details, but the most widely accepted hypothesis concerning the nature of GRBs is that they result from either the core collapse supernova explosion of a massive star or the merger of neutron stars in a binary system. Both processes most likely occur. In the former case, the emission of light lasts somewhat longer than in the latter, so the corresponding types of GRBs are called either &amp;quot;long&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;short&amp;quot;. The long type lasts for more than 2 seconds and tends to be brighter than the short type (whose emissions last less than 2 seconds). Since short GRBs typically appear in locations where new star formation is not occurring, they must result from some cause other than the explosion of a very massive star, which is necessarily quite young. In both cases, there is a prolonged, but much dimmer &amp;quot;afterglow&amp;quot;, which is the only part of the event that can be observed except from satellites such as Swift. Not just any supernova or neutron star collision will result in a detectable GRB. Most of the energy from the event must also be directed in two very narrow and oppositely directed beams, and the Earth must be in the path of one of those. It is because the energy is so narrowly concentrated that a GRB can appear to be far brighter than an entire galaxy or quasar. For such narrowly focused beams to be produced, the progenitor star (or binary system) must have a great deal of angular momentum, due to rapid rotation.The afterglow is thought to result from the interaction between the matter and energy contained in the beam and the interstellar medium at the location of the GRB. Although it&amp;#39;s a secondary effect, there is a wealth of information that can be deduced from this afterglow. However, the information concerns more than just details about the nature of GRBs ‚Äì events that occur much closer to us are much more useful for that. There are two other things of far greater interest about which we can learn from very distant GRBs, such as 090423 and subsequent examples we are likely to observe.Since this event had a redshift of z‚Äâ‚âà‚Äâ8.2 it actually occurred very long ago, a comparatively short time after the big bang. About 630 million years after, to be more exact. GRB 090423 is farther and earlier than any other object or event we&amp;#39;ve actually observed, except for the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is more distant in time and space than even any galaxy or quasar we&amp;#39;ve ever seen. (See here if you want to review how redshift works.) GRBs, directly or indirectly, tell us about the nature of the largest stars at that time, which is one thing that&amp;#39;s presently very difficult to study with other observations. There&amp;#39;s simply no way to observe individual stars 13 billion light-years away. The other thing astronomers are very curious about regarding that time period is the nature of the intergalactic medium (IGM) then.Let&amp;#39;s start with the second of these things. 630 million years after the big bang is somewhere in the middle of what astronomers call the &amp;quot;cosmic dark ages&amp;quot;. Precisely where it falls is what we don&amp;#39;t know. I wrote about that subject here, last March. We do know pretty closely when the &amp;quot;dark ages&amp;quot; began ‚Äì about 380 thousand years after the big bang. That&amp;#39;s when the CMB appeared. The time is equivalent to a redshift of z‚Äâ‚âà‚Äâ1100. The CMB was, and still is, &amp;quot;blackbody&amp;quot; radiation, so wavelengths are distributed around a peak. At the peak of the distribution now, CMB photons have a wavelength of 1.9 mm, in the short microwave part of the spectrum. (That&amp;#39;s a lot shorter, so more energetic, than in your microwave oven, where microwaves are about 12 cm.) But when the CMB actually appeared, its photons had a wavelength 1100 times shorter, around 2200 nm ‚Äì in the infrared part of the spectrum. That&amp;#39;s still much cooler and &amp;quot;darker&amp;quot; than human eyes can see.Effectively, then, there wasn&amp;#39;t much light in the universe, certainly not human-visible light, until the first stars showed up. So the time after the CMB appeared but before the first stars is known as the &amp;quot;dark ages&amp;quot;. However, we don&amp;#39;t know very closely when those first stars appeared ‚Äì they&amp;#39;re far too faint to observe, and even the first galaxies and quasars are too dim to be detected by our present instruments. GRBs seem to be our best observational hope, and GRB 090423 is the earliest we&amp;#39;ve seen yet. Since existing GRB models presuppose an origin that involves massive stars, at least indirectly, we now know there were such stars 630 million years after the big bang. There is evidence in the GRB 090423 observations that the progenitor of this object was not one of the first population of stars to form. (Astronomers call such stars &amp;quot;Population III&amp;quot;.) Also, GRB 090423 doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have been one of the most powerful GRBs ever, so astronomers now figure that with current technology we may be able to find GRBs back to z‚Äâ‚âà‚Äâ20. That would correspond to 250 million years after the big bang. Theoretical models suggest that the first stars may have appeared even earlier than that, at perhaps 150 million years after the big bang.  When they formed, these first stars did not contain elements heavier than helium, as such elements were created (in other than trace quantities) only in the first generation of stars. (See here for a discussion of the earliest stars.)The observations of GRB 090423 give some evidence that the galaxy in which it occurred did have small amounts of elements heavier than helium. Further, the afterglow that occurs following the peak brightness of any GRB is generally similar between both GRB 090423 and much closer GRBs. These facts are hints that the progenitor of GRB wasn&amp;#39;t one of the Population III stars.How does a GRB give us information about the intergalactic medium at z‚Äâ‚âà‚Äâ8.2? That turns out to be closely related to the way that the redshift was estimated in the first place. Normally this is done by identifying known emission or absorption lines in a spectrum and simply calculating the amount of shift directly. However, GRB 090423 is so faint, and declined in brightness so quickly, that it wasn&amp;#39;t possible in the time available to obtain a detailed spectrum.Instead, an important feature of the IGM at that time comes to the rescue. The feature is that there is at that time a substantial, though not precisely known, quantity of un-ionized hydrogen atoms in the IGM. This hydrogen is left over from the period of &amp;quot;recombination&amp;quot; in which the CMB appeared. CMB photons are far too weak to &amp;quot;scatter&amp;quot; from hydrogen atoms, because quantum mechanics requires that a photon must have a certain minimal amount of energy to raise an electron bound in a hydrogen atom out of its &amp;quot;ground state&amp;quot; of lowest energy.The minimum amount of energy required is that possessed by a 10.2 eV photon of wavelength 121.6 nm, which is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. This spectral point is known as &amp;quot;Lyman-Œ±&amp;quot;. (We covered this concept in detail here.) Ordinary stars like the Sun in the universe at present emit little light at this wavelength, but much larger, hotter, and brighter stars emit quite a bit of this ultraviolet light.Consequently, as soon as such hot stars began to shine, the atomic hydrogen in the IGM began to reionize. There was a price to be paid for this, of course: all the photons with enough energy lost some of their energy in the process of reionizing the hydrogen. And so, most of the light whose photons had enough energy was absorbed or &amp;quot;scattered&amp;quot; in this reionization period.Eventua...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of weeks, articles have appeared in newspapers such as the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, radio networks like NPR, and magazines such as TIME Magazine pointing out that a ‚Äúrethinking‚Äù of routine screening for breast and prostate cancer is under way. The articles bear titles such as &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2009/10/a_rethink_on_cancer_screening.html"&gt;A Rethink On Prostate and Breast Cancer Screening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/health/21cancer.html"&gt;Cancer Society, in Shift, Has Concerns on Screenings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/27canc.html"&gt;Cancers Can Vanish Without Treatment, but How?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-preventive-health-calendaroct26,0,7937222.story"&gt;Seniors face conflicting advice on cancer tests: Benefit-risk questions lead some to call for age cutoffs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://wellness.blogs.time.com/2009/10/23/rethinking-the-benefits-of-breast-and-prostate-cancer-screening/"&gt;Rethinking the benefits of breast and prostate cancer¬†screening&lt;/a&gt;. These articles were inspired by an editorial published in JAMA last month by Laura Esserman, Yiwey Shieh, and Ian Thompson entitled, appropriately enough, &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/302/15/1685"&gt;Rethinking Screening for Breast Cancer and Prostate Cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The article was a review and analysis of recent studies about the benefits of screening for breast and prostate cancer in asymptomatic populations and concluded that the benefits of large scale screening programs for breast cancer and prostate cancer tend to be oversold and that they come at a higher price than is usually acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For regular readers of SBM, none of this should come as a major surprise, as I have been writing about just such issues for quite some time. Indeed, nearly a year and a half ago, I first wrote &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=116"&gt;The early detection of cancer and improved survival: More complicated than most people think.&lt;/a&gt; and then followed it up with &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=133"&gt;Early detection of cancer, part 2: Breast cancer and MRI&lt;/a&gt;. In these posts, I pointed out concepts such as lead time bias, length bias, and stage migration (a.k.a. the Will Rogers effect) that confound estimates of benefit due to screening. (Indeed, before you continue reading, I strongly suggest that you go back and read at least the first of the aforementioned two posts to review the concepts of lead time bias and length bias.) Several months later, I wrote an analysis of a fascinating study, entitling my post &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=300"&gt;Do over one in five breast cancers detected by mammography alone really spontaneously regress?&lt;/a&gt; At the time, I was somewhat skeptical that the number of breast cancers detected by mammography that spontaneously regress was as high as 20%, but of late I‚Äôm becoming less skeptical that the number may be somewhere in that range. Even so, at the time I did not doubt that there likely is a proportion of breast cancers that do spontaneously regress and that that number is likely larger than I would have guessed before the study. Of course, the problem is that we do not currently have any way of figuring out which tumors detected by mammography will fall into the minority that do ultimately regress; so we are morally obligated to treat them all. My most recent foray into this topic was in July, when I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=565"&gt;analyzed another study&lt;/a&gt; that concluded that one in three breast cancers detected by screening are overdiagnosed and overtreated. That last post caused me the most angst, because women commented and wrote me asking me what to do, and I had to answer what I always answer: Follow the standard of care, which is yearly mammography over age 40. This data and these concerns have not yet altered that standard of care, and I am not going to change my practice or my general recommendations to women until a new consensus develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I discuss the JAMA analysis, let me just sample a bit of how this issue is being portrayed in the popular press:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week the conversation garnered national attention when physicians at the University of California, San Francisco, and University of Texas, San Antonio, published an analysis in the¬†&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt; expounding on their concerns about the ongoing harm inflicted on patients who undergo prostate and breast cancer screening. One problem is that screening often picks up harmless or non-life-threatening tumors that could have gone unnoticed for a lifetime, leading to unnecessary and aggressive treatment for patients. In the days before widespread mammography, for instance, physicians rarely encountered ductal carcinoma in situ (or DCIS), a type of low- to intermediate-grade breast cancer that grows slowly and may even regress, meaning that the body may rid itself of the tumor. But today DCIS accounts for nearly 30 % of all breast cancer diagnoses (more than 60,000 cases a year), leading to an untold amount of treatment and patient distress.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://wellness.blogs.time.com/2009/10/23/rethinking-the-benefits-of-breast-and-prostate-cancer-screening/"&gt;TIME Magazine&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The purpose of screenings is to detect cancer early, when treatments are most likely to be effective, and to save lives. That the tests do so for colon, breast and cervical cancer has been well-established for middle-age adults but is not indisputable for those who are older, as most studies have been done in people younger than 65. Research on routine PSA screening has yet to prove a definitive benefit at any age. On the other side are the potential costs, which can include unnecessary treatments for cancers that never would have become life-threatening, the anxiety and distress associated with cancer diagnosis, the complications associated with screening procedures or therapies, and medical expenses&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-preventive-health-calendaroct26,0,7937222.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call it the arrow of cancer. Like the arrow of time, it was supposed to point in one direction. Cancers grew and worsened. But as a paper in The Journal of the American Medical Association noted last week, data from more than two decades of screening for breast and prostate cancer call that view into question. Besides finding tumors that would be lethal if left untreated, screening appears to be finding many small tumors that would not be a problem if they were left alone, undiscovered by screening. They were destined to stop growing on their own or shrink, or even, at least in the case of some breast cancers, disappear.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/27canc.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The American Cancer Society, which has long been a staunch defender of most cancer screening, is now saying that the benefits of detecting many cancers, especially breast and prostate, have been overstated. It is quietly working on a message, to put on its Web site early next year, to emphasize that screening for breast and prostate cancer and certain other cancers can come with a real risk of overtreating many small cancers while missing cancers that are deadly.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/health/21cancer.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest kerfuffle is simply the latest bubbling up of a controversy that has been going on for years. It‚Äôs also a classic example of the difficulty of applying messy science to public health issues. Science is messy, but public health initiatives, to be successful, arguably need a simple message that resonates with the public, a message like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screening for cancer catches cancers at an earlier stage when they are more easily treated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screening for cancer saves lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should get screened if you‚Äôre older than N years old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when evidence that calls into question any of these messages appears, it causes consternation among the lay public. Worse, cranks leap to take advantage of such controversies and make claims, such as ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/026880_cancer_brst_cancer_cancer_screening.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;mammography is useless&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù and publish cartoons like &lt;a href="http://www.NaturalNews.com/027038_cancer_chemotherapy_cancer_industry.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Even &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1504"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who should know better &lt;a href="http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/index.php/2009/02/09/this-just-in-breast-cancer-screening-essentially-useless/"&gt;say similar things&lt;/a&gt;. As I‚Äôve said before, science-based medicine is hard and not always clear-cut. Moreover, I would argue that debates such as this demonstrate that the claims of cranks that physicians all march in lockstep or that there is a ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù to keep shortcomings of SBM from patients are nothing but the rankest nonsense. Finally, cranks often conflate, either through ignorance, willful ignorance, or often outright hostility to ‚ÄúWestern medicine,‚Äù screening mammography with diagnostic mammography. Screening mammography is designed to detect disease in &lt;em&gt;asymptomatic&lt;/em&gt; women. If a woman feels a suspicious lump, nothing‚ÄìI repeat, nothing‚Äìin any of this data says that she should not have a physical exam and appropriate imaging, including mammography and ultrasound at the minimum, posthaste. That‚Äôs diagnostic mammography, and that is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; what this kerfuffle is over. Suspicious lumps, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; in women over 40, need to be worked up, period. I can‚Äôt emphasize that strongly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did Esserman &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; say? They lay out the problem thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large fraction of the US population participates in screening for prostate cancer and for breast cancer. About 50% of at-risk men have a routine prostatespecific antigen (PSA) test and 75% have previously had a PSA test.&lt;sup&gt;3,4&lt;/sup&gt; About 70% of women older than 40 years reported having a recent mammogram.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Two decades of screening have resulted in a significant increase in detection of early cancers. Prostate-specific antigen testing has nearly doubled the chance that amanwill be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime: In 1980, a white man‚Äôs lifetime risk of prostate cancer was 1 in 116; today it is 1 in 6.1 A woman‚Äôs lifetime risk of breast cancer was 1 in 12 in 1980; today it is 1 in 8.1 If ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is included, the risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer, like prostate cancer, has almost doubled as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in early cancers as a fraction of total cancers detected is not necessarily beneficial. The introduction of an optimal screening test should be followed by an increase in the rate of early disease followed by a decrease in regional disease while the overall detection rate remains constant.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; FIGURE 1 illustrates hypothetical optimal, worst case, and intermediate-case scenarios, using 1980 breast cancer incidence rates as a starting point. In the worst case, screening leads to an increase in local disease detection without a corresponding decrease in regional disease, thereby increasing costs and morbidity due to overdetection and overtreatment of non‚Äìlife-threatening cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conclude that current screening protocols for breast and prostate cancer result in a case that is intermediate between the worst case and optimal case scenarios. Because their graph illustrates this problem better than words can, I present it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/4064391475/" title="Fig1"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2431/4064391475_4bdb488d4f.jpg" width="500" height="278" alt="untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(Click for larger image.)
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esserman &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; then point out that the incidence of early stage breast and prostate cancers has increased dramatically as a fraction of total cancers detected, while regional and metastatic cancers have decreased dramatically as a fraction of those cancers detected. One example is the form of breast cancer known as ductal carcinoma &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;, abbreviated DCIS. DCIS is considered to be breast cancer, but ‚Äúpre-invasive‚Äù cancer, given that the &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; for its diagnosis is seeing cancerous-appearing breast epithelial cells confined within the ducts with no evidence of their having invaded through the basement membrane that separates the ducts from the surrounding tissue. Thus, DCIS has been labeled ‚Äústage zero‚Äù cancer, and its 5 year survival is close to 100%, although a small proportion of patients does recur and ultimately die of breast cancer. There is even a debate over whether DCIS truly represents a precursor to cancer, as it is unclear what percentage of DCIS lesions progress to frank cancer, making the treatment of DCIS &lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/cancer/2009/10/22/the-confusion-over-dcis-what-to-do-about-stage-zero-breast-cancer.html"&gt;very confusing to patients&lt;/a&gt;. Before the mammographic screening era, which began in earnest after 1980, diagnoses of DCIS were uncommon. Now DCIS makes up nearly a third of new breast cancer diagnoses. Again, because we don‚Äôt know which of these lesions will progress and which won‚Äôt (or even which ones might regress), we treat them all, and this treatment involves nearly all the treatments used for breast cancer, with the only treatment not used on DCIS being chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for more advanced regional tumors (tumors with lymph node metastases or involvement of local structures) and metastatic tumors, the absolute numbers have also decreased, but not very much. If screening were having a huge effect on breast cancer, the expectation would be that removing tumors at a smaller stage would, nearly three decades later, ultimately result in fewer advanced cancers being detected, their having been preempted by screening and appropriate treatment by surgical excision and adjuvant therapy. (This is one reason why screening for colorectal cancer has been more effective; removal of polyps is effective at preventing the subsequent development of colorectal cancer.) The conclusion, which again should be nothing surprising for anyone who saw &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=116"&gt;my post from last year&lt;/a&gt;, is that screening by nature preferentially detects slower growing, more indolent cancers, which by their very nature tend to be less lethal and some of which may not even ever progress enough to endanger the life of the patient. The fastest-growing, most lethal cancers grow so fast that they seem to ‚Äúpop up‚Äù between screenings. As a breast cancer surgeon, I see such tumors occasionally. A woman will come in with a palpable mass and an very ugly mammogram after having had a mammogram less than a year before that shows no trace of abnormality or, sometimes, an abnormality that is only appreciated in retrospect because it was so subtle. Naturally, such women are distraught because they have ‚Äúdone everything right‚Äù and obtained their yearly mammography just as their primary care doctors told them too. However, no practical screening program could catch tumors such as these because it would require too frequent screenings, which would also, unfortunately, increase the chances of finding abnormalities that lead to overdiagnosis. The dilemma, again, was discussed in my &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=116"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, and, indeed, Figure 3 in the JAMA article is in essence the same figure that I reproduced to help me discuss length bias, only with much better design sensibilities and a dash of color:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/4065284542/" title="Fig3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2549/4065284542_990458a9ba.jpg" width="500" height="316" alt="untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most distressing conclusion of Esserman‚Äôs analysis is just how many patients need to be screened to save one life. It is well-accepted that screening women over age 50 for breast cancer does decrease mortality due to breast cancer by approximately 30%, but what does this reduction &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; mean? &lt;a href="http://wellness.blogs.time.com/2009/10/23/rethinking-the-benefits-of-breast-and-prostate-cancer-screening/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, mammography reduces the odds of a 60-year-old woman dying of breast cancer in the next decade by 30%. Sounds impressive, until you look at her absolute risk: by getting her annual mammogram, her chances of dying from breast cancer are whittled from 0.9% to 0.6%. Overall, for every 1,000 women in their 60s screened for breast cancer in the next 10 years, mammograms will save the lives of 3 people but 6 others will still die. (The numbers edge up or down in lockstep with a woman‚Äôs age.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esserman &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; conclude that, to avert one death from breast cancer with mammographic screening for women between the ages of 50-70, an age range intentionally chosen because it is the age range for which mammographic screening is the least controversial, 838 women need to be screened over 6 years for a total of 5,866 screening visits, to detect 18 invasive cancers and 6 instances of DCIS. The additional price of this was estimated to be 90 biopsies and 535 recalls for additional imaging, as well as ‚Äúmany cancers treated as if they were life threatening when they are not.‚Äù For prostate, to prevent one death from cancer, 1,410 men need to be screened over 9 years, for a total of 2,397 screening visits and 48 cancers detected. In other words, screening takes a lot of effort for, on an absolute basis, not as many lives saved as we had hoped. The authors also point out that technology exacerbates this problem. We push for ever greater sensitivity at the cost of lower specificity, which means that we detect more and more lesions that turn out not to be cancer or to be indolent, non-lifethreatening cancer. Yet all of these cancers end up being treated the same, again because we cannot distinguish between them. The addition of hypersensitive modalities such as MRI only exacerbate this problem even further. As Esserman et al state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 2-1/2 decades of screening for breast and prostate cancer,conclusions are troubling: Overall cancer rates are higher, many more patients are being treated, and the absolute incidence of aggressive or later-stage disease has not been significantly decreased. Screening has had some effect, but it comes at significant cost, including overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and complications of therapy, problems likely to be exacerbated as the US population ages. Additional gains are unlikely with the current approach and may inadvertently add to the burden of treatment and diagnosis for relatively indolent disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what‚Äôs the solution? Should we give up on screening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll answer the second question with an emphatic &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;absolutely not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. There is no doubt that screening can save lives; the problem is that we‚Äôre doing it ‚Äúbigger‚Äù not and not necessarily better or smarter, using more or less a one-size-fits-all approach when a more tailored approach is necessary. In essence, we‚Äôre using 20th century technology, when 21st century technology can find a way out of these conundrums. Here‚Äôs where I (mostly) agree with Esserman &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. We need to change how we screen for common cancers using the latest advances in biochemistry, molecular biology, and technology to differentiate which lesions are most likely to be cancer and which are not, which cancers are likely to progress to the point of threatening a patient‚Äôs life in their remaining lifespan and which ones are not. To this end we need the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop biological and genetic markers of risk for various cancers.&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs long been known that screening is more effective in populations where a disease is common. The more common the disease (to a point) the more likely screening is to save lives. Thus, if we could develop better tools to identify women most at risk for breast cancer, for example, we could start screening such women at a younger age and perhaps screen them more frequently. We already do this to some extent, but our current tools (family history to identify higher risk populations, a handful of genetic markers, and ethnicity) are crude measures at best. Equally important would be to find similar markers to identify women at lower risk, who might start screening at an older age and undergo screening less frequently. Most important of all, identifying high risk patients more effectively would open up the possibility of prevention to a far greater extent than is possible now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify biological markers to differentiate minimal risk cancers from cancers with significant risk.&lt;/strong&gt; Again, we have begun to do this to some extent. For example, tests such as the &lt;a href="http://www.oncotypedx.com"&gt;Oncotype DX&lt;/a&gt; multigene test are now clinically used to determine which women with early stage, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers would and would not benefit from chemotherapy. It‚Äôs relatively crude as a tool goes, but we will do better. Indeed, we are beginning to develop the tools that would allow us to go much further. It would not surprise me if, in a decade or so, we routinely do a battery of such tests on newly diagnosed tumors and then use the results to decide which ones can undergo ‚Äúwatchful waiting,‚Äù which ones need aggressive therapy, and which ones can undergo less aggressive therapy. Eventually, we will be using therapy targeted to the individual genetic alterations in an individuals tumor. Yes, I know I‚Äôve expressed skepticism over such ‚Äútargeted‚Äù therapy before, but that‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt believe the concept will work; it‚Äôs because the boosters of targeted therapy often seem not to realize just how difficult and complex it is and will be to identify targets and how hard it will be to turn the targeting of proteins and genetic alterations into therapies that result in decreased mortality from cancer. In other words, I believe that genetic and biomarker analysis will ultimately allow us to tailor therapy to an individual‚Äôs tumor; I just think that getting there will take a lot longer and be a lot messier than the current generation of biotech cheerleaders either understand or will let themselves admit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop better markers of response to therapy.&lt;/strong&gt; Right now our primary assessment of whether a therapy is working or not boils down to one of two things: survival rates (the ultimate endpoint) or whether a tumor shrinks or not in response to therapy. Both are very crude. The former is the ultimate measure, but it is not helpful in the case of an individual patient, who wants to know if her treatment worked or not before she dies. The latter is notoriously inaccurate, with tumor shrinkage only showing a weak correlation to overall survival. This is one area where tests similar to the ones being developed to determine the aggressiveness of a tumor could potentially help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop better imaging tools to assess risk.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the one area that Esserman et al neglected almost completely in their review. This is an area that I have only recently become very interested in for our research program. Technology is progressing to the point where it soon may well be possible to identify a lesion as cancerous or not with greater than 90% using a ‚Äúvirtual biopsy‚Äù and then further to determine its risk of causing the death of the patient, when combined with biochemical and genetic analyses. Such tools would allow us to choose patients who might be appropriate for ‚Äúwatchful waiting‚Äù with far less anxiety over whether we‚Äôre doing the right thing than there is now and, even better, potentially to identify tumors that are likely to regress spontaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this will be easy, and the process of getting from where we are now to this futuristic vision will be be full of fits and starts. At times it will be controversial. Advances in science-based medicine always are. Moreover, there will be significant barriers to its implementation, not the least of which is the relatively simplistic thinking that has come to predominate how we view cancer screening, not in the rarified air of the research institutions that actually study the pros and cons of screening, but ‚Äúin the field‚Äù at the level of individual practitioners trying to put these screening recommendations into practice. It is not the fault of these practitioners that these fine points are not more widely known. Rather, the reason derives from the conflict between the need for simple messages to tell patients and the difficulty of applying epidemiological science to individual patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we do in the meantime? One thing I am &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; going to say is to stop undergoing screening. Women should continue to undergo mammographic screening as recommended according to the standard of care. Whether men should continue to undergo routine prostate screening as previously recommended is now controversial, with less evidence to support it than mammography except in high risk populations. Until a consensus develops for changing the current regimen, it is the best we have, and, for all its shortcomings, mammography remains the best and most cost-effective tool we have to detect cancer. (The case for routine mass PSA screening, in contrast, now strikes me as considerably weaker.) Even in the worst case scenario that breast cancer screening results in the appearance of a benefit all due to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=116"&gt;lead time bias&lt;/a&gt; (which it isn‚Äôt; I present this as a worst case scenario), treatment of cancers caught at an earlier stage is still less invasive and less morbid. True, this has to be weighed against overtreatment of lesions that would never progress, but even so the benefit of using less invasive therapy is one that is routinely discounted by the new generation of what I am sometimes tempted to call ‚Äúscreening nihilists,‚Äù a group that seems to think that nearly all screening is worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is not that screening is worthless. For example, even mammography under the most pessimistic estimates routinely touted as evidence that it‚Äôs pointless to screen clearly does save lives. A relative reduction in risk is not meaningless or of insignificant worth, either, as some nihilists will suggest. Also, don‚Äôt forget that even small absolute percentages when applied to millions upon millions of people, can result in large numbers of lives saved. That being said, I also think that these recent trials suggest that we are not doing an adequate job of informing patients of the down side of screening, such as excessive biopsies, a down side many might well be willing to accept if they were informed of it and understood it. After all, as I‚Äôve mentioned before with regards to breast cancer, I‚Äôve seen polls where most women say they would agree to undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy to improve their odds of surviving breast cancer by 1%. To save more lives relative to the number of women overtreated and overdiagnosed, we need to learn how to screen smarter. Our current screening regimens are not good enough. Improving them will require science-based medicine, and, unfortunately, will be controversial. Watching the jolting, jarring journey to a new scientific consensus about something as important as screening for breast and prostate cancer is much watching the proverbial sausage being made. I also can‚Äôt help but point out the contrast to ‚Äúalternative‚Äù medicine, which rarely questions and almost never changes practice in the face of new data. It may well be that our hopes for screening for breast cancer and prostate cancer were too high, but in science-based medicine evidence eventually wins out. Screening practices will likely change in the face of new evidence, and that is a good thing. Certainly it‚Äôs better than the alternative, namely not changing and not improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have shown how an antiviral protein produced by the immune system, dubbed tetherin, tames HIV and other viruses by literally putting them on a leash, to prevent their escape from infected cells. The insights, reported in the October 30th issue of the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, a Cell Press publication, allowed the research team to design a completely artificial protein ‚Äî one that did not resemble native tetherin in its sequence at all ‚Äî that could nonetheless put a similar stop to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dumbbaby.net/a/i/087/01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://dumbbaby.net/a/i/087/01.jpg" alt="" width="163" height="306"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://www.spinner.com/2009/10/29/billy-corgan-speaks-out-against-h1n1-vaccine/"&gt;Billy Corgan is a vampire. . .sent to draaain!&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì After only a week since Star Trek‚Äôs Brent Spiner announced his growing interest in anti-vaccine quackery, now it seems the lead singer of the Smashing Pumpkins has been turned into an anti-vaxxer vampire too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI do not trust those who make the vaccines, or the apparatus behind it all to push it on us thru fear,‚Äù Corgan explained in his critique, which can be read &lt;a href="http://www.everythingfromheretothere.com/2009/10/27/health-and-a-well-being/"&gt;in its entirety here&lt;/a&gt;. According to him, the virus is not yet an emergency and he believes it‚Äôs ridiculous that ‚Äúour American President Obama‚Äù has declared it so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that‚Äôs not enough, Corgan, struggled with the notion that the government can require people to take the vaccine. He‚Äôs also of the opinion that the ‚Äúvirus was created by man‚Äù writing that he has ‚Äúread reports from people who say (as doctors) that there is evidence to suggest this.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Corgan stated, ‚ÄúIf the virus comes to take me Home, that is between me and the Lord.‚Äù But that‚Äôs not to say he expects fans to follow his logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI am not a doctor, and I am in no way suggesting that you should follow any medical advice from me,‚Äù he wrote early in the essay, adding, ‚ÄúI am willing to question anything: the existence of God, the existence of me or you or Robert Zimmerman [aka &lt;a href="http://www.spinner.com/tag/BobDylan/"&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt;].‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Billy, you‚Äôre clearly not a doctor. And quite frankly, I find it somewhat disingenuous to use your celebrity influence to take such a public anti-scientific stand on this issue and then tack on a little disclaimer at the end saying you‚Äôre not necessarily suggesting anyone follow your ‚Äúmedical advice,‚Äù of which is based on your ZERO medical training. Seriously, even in 1979, you‚Äôd have no excuse to be this bloody ignorant of scientific facts. This whole story is just giving me nothing but melancholy and infinite sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

The computer can read a person's thoughts, and display them on a screen as a video. Sounds far-fetched? Well, it is, and it's too early to tell what exactly these two have invented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a title="Times UK Reporst on " href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/living/article6898177.ece"&gt;the Times UK reports&lt;/a&gt;, the study has not been peer reviewed, so we can't be sure what they're doing, but it appears that using an fMRI, a machine that can read brain activity, and a computer with a custom algorithm, they can reproduce people's thoughts on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;If I understand it correctly, it works like this: when you think of a color or a shape, certain areas in the brain activate. The fMRI can read these activations, and through the algorithm, reproduce the conditions necessary for that to happen. A green square would produce a distinct pattern, the fMRI would pick it up, report it to the computer, who then decodes the pattern back into a green square. This all happens real time, so the image appears as a video.</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257143825515"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/11/01/what-the-anti-vaxers-alt-healthers-think-mainstream-medicine-is-like/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/17f89e85d6a4d17f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="anti-vaccine lunacy"/><category term="autism"/><category term="vaccines"/><title type="html">What the anti-vaxers &amp;amp; alt-healthers think mainstream medicine is like</title><published>2009-11-02T05:41:46Z</published><updated>2009-11-02T05:41:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/11/01/what-the-anti-vaxers-alt-healthers-think-mainstream-medicine-is-like/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/4nhye4YQDvA%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0%26hd%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

R. Kelly Hamilton, John Freshwater‚Äôs attorney, introduced into evidence an affidavit Keib had signed and walked Keib through it.  Keib is a graduate of &lt;a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/" rel="external "&gt;Cedarville University&lt;/a&gt;, a very conservative Christian school in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keib testified that he was in Freshwater‚Äôs classroom for a number of 30+ minute observations for evaluation and perhaps 60 to 100 times for a few minutes over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years Keib did a number of evaluations of Freshwater, and testified that he never saw any problematic behavior in Freshwater‚Äôs classroom.  Asked if he ever saw Freshwater teach creationism, Keib replied that there was ‚Äúnever any direct instruction pertaining to creationism that I heard.‚Äù  Interesting locution there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a series of questions Hamilton pushed the case that Freshwater was using suspect materials in order to teach analysis and objective consideration of multiple hypotheses per the Academic Content Standards, using those materials to see whether students could use the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keib testified that he never saw Freshwater try to push his faith or proselytize students.  He never heard Freshwater put down another person‚Äôs faith, though he voiced concerns about that to Keib privately.  He testified that he never saw Freshwater teaching intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keib testified that he himself had a Bible on his desk while at the middle school, and knew of a ‚Äúsignificant number‚Äù of teachers who also had Bibles on their desks.  He named half a dozen.  He said that Bibles mean one thing to one person and another thing to someone else.  They‚Äôre used in poetry classes, as a reflective tool, in English classes, and in history classes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He testified that he never saw Freshwater‚Äôs Bible open when students were around.  He testified that he could tell the book was a Bible because he was familiar with it.  Asked if in itself, sitting on a desk, the Bible denigrated or promoted a particular religion, Keib replied that ‚ÄúSome people might not be comfortable with it, but it‚Äôs not hurting anyone just sitting there.‚Äù  Asked if the Bible on a desk constituted a ‚Äúreligious display,‚Äù Keib replied, ‚ÄúJust sitting there, no.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if it was appropriate to tell one teacher she could keep a Bible on her desk (apparently referring to Lori Miller) while instructing another to remove his Bible, Keib replied that it was hard to justify the inconsistency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked what constitutes ‚Äúinsubordination,‚Äù Keib replied that it was a ‚Äúpunitive term,‚Äù and in when he uses it it is after ‚Äúnumerous verbal and written reprimands and warnings.‚Äù  Asked if Freshwater was ever insubordinate to Keib, he replied ‚ÄúNot willfully.‚Äù  Again, an interesting phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked what evidence demonstrates that a teacher is teaching to the academic standards, Keib mentioned his being in the room observing during evaluations, inspecting the teacher‚Äôs quizzes and handouts, and student performance on standardized tests like the Ohio Achievement Test.  Asked if a teacher can teach ‚Äúbeyond the standards,‚Äù Keib replied that it was sometimes desirable to do so, for example to connect classroom material with world events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keib testified that he does not consider Freshwater to be a ‚Äúreligious‚Äù man.  He said that his definition of ‚Äúreligious‚Äù does not correspond to that of the rest of the world, that the latter is ‚Äútoo general.‚Äù  We never did find out what Keib means by ‚Äúreligious.‚Äù  He said some words, but I flatly couldn‚Äôt connect them into some sort of coherent thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keib testified that he had had one conversation with Lynda Weston regarding Freshwater due to some complaints from high school science teachers.  She had concerns he might be teaching creationism.  Keib told her that he had heard it before, but he has been in Freshwater‚Äôs room countless times and never saw what she was alleging.  He asked her how he could reprimand Freshwater if there‚Äôs no evidence.  Keib talked to some students about it and was led to believe it wasn‚Äôt a Freshwater issue but was an issue of the town and its religious culture.  When Keib asked Weston for evidence she didn‚Äôt provide any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown the photos of Zachary Dennis‚Äô arm, Keib said that he would first want to look the student in the eye and talk with him about it.  He said that teachers, administrators, parents, and students are not always on the same page.  When a child tells a parent what happened, it‚Äôs not always the version that another might have.  In response to questions, Keib emphasized the necessity to talk directly to the child and parents in order to decide what appropriate steps to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keib Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under cross examination by David Millstone, attorney for the Board, Keib testified that the main concern that Kathy Kasler, the high school principal, had was that Freshwater was teaching material outside the academic standards.  Keib said that he analyzed lesson plans and observed Freshwater‚Äôs classes and never saw any evidence that it occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked by Millstone what the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù is, Keib replied that it was ‚Äúthe steps to prove if something is a fact or a belief.‚Äù  ‚ÄúForm a hypothesis and test the hypothesis against known laws (e.g., gravity)‚Äù (a pretty close quotation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone went through a calculation to show that Keib‚Äôs total time in Freshwater‚Äôs classroom amounted to less than 0.5% of Freshwater‚Äôs total class time during the period in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keib was unaware that two teachers, Cunningham and Adkins, had traced one of Freshwater‚Äôs handouts to allaboutgod.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keib recommended Freshwater for a Distinguished Teacher Award.  He could not remember who else he recommended for that award.  Recall that in earlier testimony we learned that there were no criteria for receiving the award beyond being nominated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keib Redirect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In redirect Hamilton established that Keib‚Äôs observations met the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no Recross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next witness was to have been Ted Kiger, a former student, but since he had been present in the hearing room while an earlier witness testified he was disqualified (the referee had ruled at the beginning that prospective witnesses were not to hear any testimony before they testified - witness sequestration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darcy Ann Miller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darcy Ann Miller is a resident of the district, a mother of two FCA members (6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grades) in 2007-2008, and spoke several times at FCA at the invitation of her son, a member of Freshwater‚Äôs 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science class.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller testified that before permission slips were required for FCA attendance (recall that FAC met during the school lunch period) there were 30-40 students per session (three sessions per lunch period).  After permission slips were required attendance fell off drastically, and she found it ‚Äúheart breaking.‚Äù   I myself found it interesting that when parents were given some control over the religious influences their children were exposed to in the context of the school, they opted out of the apparently mainly fundamentalist views espoused at FCA.  And it was also interesting that Miller apparently didn‚Äôt think that was a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller talked to both middle school Principal White and Superintendent Short about the permission slip policy, and they both invoked the issue of parental control over the religious training of their children, saying that without it students might wind up attending a Wiccan presentation.  (Wicca is a bogeyman for Mt. Vernon fundamentalists.  I think we might have all of two Wiccans in the county.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that she prayed at FCA meetings and was shocked that Freshwater didn‚Äôt join in.  She didn‚Äôt know faculty members could not be actively involved in FCA proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no cross examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Bender&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Bender is a local Salvation Army major, and spoke at FCA two or three times, invited by his daughter.  He testified that Freshwater did not participate, didn‚Äôt pray, didn‚Äôt lead a healing session, and that students always appeared to be in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination Millstone established that Bender was testifing pursuant to a &lt;a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/12367349/Subpoena-%28Civil-Case%29-Subpoena-%28Civil-Case%29---Ohio" rel="external "&gt;civil subpoena&lt;/a&gt; issued by Hamilton and not a subpoena issued by the Treasurer of the school district, the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô issuing authority for the administrative hearing.  I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this has some arcane implications, perhaps for downstream actions, but I‚Äôm not at all sure.  Is there a lawyer in the house?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no redirect or recross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kerri Mahan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerri Mahan &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/11/freshwater-day-1.html" rel=""&gt;testified earlier in the hearing&lt;/a&gt; when the Board was putting on its case in chief.  Hamilton elected not to cross examine at that time because he would call her now.  Recall that her most telling points then were that she saw the ‚ÄúWatchmaker‚Äù video during Freshwater‚Äôs science class, that he used the handouts hinting at ID that were identified in the investigator‚Äôs report, that Freshwater taught the ‚Äúhydrosphere‚Äù theory, and that humans and dinosaurs may have lived at the same time.  She testified later in this session that Freshwater ‚Äú‚Ä¶ often presented things that were ‚Äòoff the wall‚Äô to stimulate the kids to think about how they can test ideas.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahan testified that she originally sent the Watchmaker video to Freshwater.  She also sent it to Lori Miller and a couple of other teachers she thought would be interested.  She thought she may have originally got it from her husband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said that she cannot now remember whether she saw Freshwater show it in science class or saw his daughter Jordan show it at FCA.  However (and most missed this) she described herself as seeing the video while sitting in her normal place in the back of Freshwater‚Äôs classroom with a full complement of students in front of her when it was shown.  Now, FCA did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; meet in Freshwater‚Äôs room; it met either in the band room or a stage off the lunch room.  The only FCA meetings in Freshwater‚Äôs room were ‚Äòleadership‚Äô meetings at which there were on the order of only half a dozen students, not a full complement of students.  Further, Mahan testified that she had never attended a leadership meeting.  Obvious conclusion: She saw the video in Freshwater‚Äôs science class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahan testified that she did not see the Tesla coil used on students in the fashion that‚Äôs been described.  (Millstone came back to this in cross examination, below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahan testified that the OAT (now called OAA ; educational reform by acronym revision) emphasizes abstract thinking, and that Freshwater used numerous classroom demonstrations to stimulate abstract thinking.  In response to Hamilton‚Äôs question, she agreed that the four handouts could be tools to hep students learn the difference between concrete and abstract thinking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She talked about the ‚Äúspiritual nature‚Äù of children in 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade, and that children come with religious beliefs and some with creationist views.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked by Hamilton, she testified that the scientific method was at the heart of everything Freshwater did in classes.  She testified that he talked about theories, inferences, hypotheses, and laws.  He never used the words ‚Äúintelligent design‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúNever in front of the class.‚Äù  (Another of those interestingly phrased responses.)  Asked by Hamilton if Freshwater ever talked bad about evolution, she replied ‚ÄúNot in front of the kids.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about the difference between fact and belief, she testified that Freshwater taught that ‚ÄúThere are some things you can‚Äôt prove because you can‚Äôt go back and test it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahan testified that during her time in his classroom he used a lot of class demonstrations and experiments, but that following the December 7, 2007 incident he stopped doing so for the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that she has seen the Tesla coil used to ‚Äúlight up gases,‚Äù but not to make marks on students‚Äô arms.  She said she never heard Freshwater refer to ‚Äútemporary tattoo,‚Äù ‚Äúmake red marks‚Äù, or ‚Äúmake crosses.‚Äù  She testified that if she thought a student had been hurt she would have reported it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahan testified that Freshwater never referred to the ‚Äúmotivational statements‚Äù containing verses from Proverbs that were displayed in his room, nor did he refer to the 10 Commandments displayed on the door of his room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some personal comments regarding her distress after her earlier testimony and her hope that testifying today would give her closure the direct examination ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination David Millstone walked Mahan back through the topics he had covered when he interviewed her prior to her earlier testimony.  She agreed that she had said that Freshwater taught hydrosphere theory; that some tracks showed that humans and dinosaurs lived together; that Tyrannosaurus rex‚Äôs teeth showed that it could not have been a carnivore; that Mt. St. Helen‚Äôs could have produced coal rapidly; and that Freshwater had said that ‚Äúthere are things I would like to say but can‚Äôt unless you [students] bring it up.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some questions that tried to establish whether Mahan was in Freshwater‚Äôs classroom the day Zachary was allegedly burned, and it was not clear that she was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She re-affirmed that Freshwater never used to phrase ‚Äúintelligent design,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe kids would ask him.  He‚Äôd never say.‚Äù  She conceded that the last line of several worksheets had the question ‚ÄúWas an ID involved,‚Äù and that the key had the blank filled in with ‚ÄúID.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ended Mahan‚Äôs testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff Kuntz Testimony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final witness on Thursday was Jeff Kuntz, retired middle school principal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preliminaries, Kuntz testified that he was not interviewed by HR OnCall, the firm that did the independent investigation for the Board, and that Millstone had interviewed him in November 2008, after the hearing had begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good deal of Kuntz‚Äôs testimony was taken up with walking through 13 evaluations of Freshwater that Kuntz (and in one case, a prior assistant principal) performed over the years.  In all cases but the last, in 2003, the evaluations were mostly boilerplate with some specific laudatory remarks.  The last referred to ‚ÄúContinue to adhere to Board guidelines regarding religion in the classroom.‚Äù  Asked by Hamilton, Kuntz testified that that remark was in the evaluation for two reasons.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Kuntz had a meeting with high school science teacher(s) and Kathy Kasler, high school principal, regarding problems teaching evolution in high school because of Freshwater‚Äôs teaching in middle school.  Kuntz then talked to Freshwater about it.  Subsequently Kuntz again met with Freshwater, high school science teachers Bonnie Schutte and Dick Cunningham, at which he tried to get the various parties to agree on what was appropriate.  Second, Kuntz received a complaint from a parent about a handout Freshwater used in class.  He spoke with Freshwater about it.  Because of those two incidents Kuntz inserted the language quoted above in Freshwater‚Äôs evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked by Hamilton if Schutte and Cunningham and Kasler produced any evidence to support their claims, Kuntz replied that he couldn‚Äôt remember specifically but that ‚Äúsomething in what &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;what&lt;/span&gt; they said had caught my attention.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuntz testified that in his experience Freshwater never failed to do what he was instructed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuntz testified that he never sw Freshwater participating in FCA on the occasions he walked through.  He testified that he knew Freshwater had a Bible in his classroom, and thought others did, too, but couldn‚Äôt remember an specifically.  He thought perhaps Tim Keib did.  He never saw Freshwater use the Bible in class or have it open when students were present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kuntz Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, Millstone established that the subpoena issued to Kuntz was a civil subpoena issued by Hamilton rather than by the Treasurer if the Board of Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuntz testified that he may have seen the Tesla coil used in a class perhaps once in his time at the middle school, by a Mr. Farmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuntz testified that he was surprised to learn that Freshwater claimed to have not received any direction regarding his role in FCA.  Kuntz said that on at least two occasions he gave Freshwater specific guidelines covering faculty members‚Äô role with respect to FCA, and went on to recite half a dozen of them.  He said he had reviewed the guidelines with Freshwater at least twice, and had also done so at least once with Lori Miller, another middle school FCA monitor.  He said he made enough copies so Freshwater could distribute them to the other FCA faculty monitors, and that he regarded Freshwater as the ‚Äòlead‚Äô FCA monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ended the cross examination.  In redirect Kuntz testified that he couldn‚Äôt recall receiving complaints about Freshwater following the 2002-2003 school year except the interactions with Kasler and the parent who complained in 2004-5 or 2005-6.  He was vague about the dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ended Thursday‚Äôs testimony.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware of the anti-vaccine movement because I have been a loyal reader of Orac&amp;#39;s blog for sometime. In fact, when I first considered moving to ScienceBlogs, he was the first person I wrote to.¬†  Part of me wants to feel some sympathy for the passionate anti-vaccine advocates because I can understand the fear that comes with being a parent.  I know the panic that comes with being faced with a decision you fear could permanently and irreversibly harm your child.  I know that bad information is plentiful on the internet and that, with the right nurturing, the seed of doubt in a mother&amp;#39;s mind can grow quickly into the tree of crazy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/crazy%20tree.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="crazy tree.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2009/11/crazy%20tree-thumb-350x262-21619.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="262" width="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jimzim.us/pics/hawaii/d06.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: Two young mothers, about to be engulfed by the tree of crazy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
That said, I am a strong believer in the benefit of vaccination and Little Isis has received all of his vaccines in accordance with the &lt;a href="http://www.aap.org/healthtopics/Immunizations.cfm"&gt;American Academy of Pediatric's Immunization Schedule&lt;/a&gt;.  As a scientist I feel confident enough in the current body of literature demonstrating the safety of vaccination that I have chosen to contribute to the herd immunity, and our personal immunities, by vaccinating my family in accordance with the yearly recommendations. I don't follow the debate as closely as others because this particular battle on pseudoscience is being waged by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence"&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; than I.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it seems the debate has taken a turn that Orac believed would interest me when he wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;O Goddess,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;I thought you might be interested in the utter sexism and misogyny being exhibited by J. B. Handley, one of the leaders of the anti-vaccine movement through his role as founder of Generation Rescue, which now uses Jenny McCarthy as its spokesmoron:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_anti-vaccine_movement_strikes_back_u.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_anti-vaccine_movement_strikes_back_u.php&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a pattern for him:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/winning_friends_and_influencing_people_o_1.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/winning_friends_and_influencing_people_o_1.php&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;They guy is a frat boy who never grew up. In any case, if you know of appropriate feminist blogs where they might want to publicize this I'd be appreciative.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Orac&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a bit of back story (although you really should read Orac's blog for the full story. Actually, you should just read Orac's blog. After you read mine, of course.), a journalist named Amy Wallace recently published an article in Wired magazine entitled &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience"&gt;An Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us All&lt;/a&gt;. Colossal cockweaseldouchemonkey, genuine asshat, and founder of the ultimate denialist's association, J.B. Handley...well, here it is from Orac:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Well, as an i&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114249382"&gt;nterview 
on NPR with Wallace has shown&lt;/a&gt;, the shitstorm has arrived, and it is just as 
stinky as the term implies, complete with misogyny and sexism...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;I've been called 
stupid, greedy, a whore, a prostitute, and a "fking lib." I've been called the 
author of "heinous tripe."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;J.B. Handley, the founder of Generation Rescue, the anti-vaccine group that 
actress Jenny McCarthy helps promote, sent an essay title" "Paul Offit Rapes 
(intellectually) Amy Wallace and Wired Magazine." In it, he implied that Offit 
had slipped me a date rape drug. "The roofie cocktails at Paul Offit's house 
must be damn good," he wrote. Later, he sent a revised version that omitted rape 
and replaced it with the image of me drinking Offit's Kool-aid. That one was 
later posted at the anti-vaccine blog Age of Autism. You can read that blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/wired-magazine-and-amy-wallace-drink-paul-offits-kool-aid.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stay classy, J.B. That's exactly the behavior from you that we've come to 
know and despise, and this is the sort of behavior that we expect from the 
anti-vaccine movement:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;I've been told I'll think 
differently "if you live to grow up." I've been warned that "this article will 
haunt you for a long time." Just now, I got an email so sexually explicit that I 
can't paraphrase it here. Except to say it contained the c-word and a reference 
to dead fish.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I told Orac when I responded to him that I would certainly blog about this if I could add something productive to the discussion.¬† When I started writing this post all I could come up with as material was a picture of J.B. Handley fucking a horse because I assume that someone who would write such heinous things must be into fucking animals.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/the_boys_call_out_misogyny_amo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/the_boys_call_out_misogyny_amo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/GEwwxIP8iKE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257142342403"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3439">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aeca8d99c1a1da48</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Evaluation of Immunization Rates and Safety Among Children with Inborn Errors of Metabolism</title><published>2009-11-02T01:52:26Z</published><updated>2009-11-02T01:52:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/Zg7PpkiETIM/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257139632366"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b3ff9fa5665fd571</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Signed and Dated</title><published>2009-11-02T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-02T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/medical/swineflu/astrology.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Do influenza outbreaks of recent years correspond to Chinese astrological symbols?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257139565883"><id gr:original-id="http://amontenegro.blogspot.com/2009/11/quick-on-go-picks-of-week-from-rb.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9cb4d6113f0ee51b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Quick, ‚Äúon-the-go‚Äù, picks of the week from RB: Antifungal comes to the rescue and  Protein tricks in cell regulatory networks</title><published>2009-11-01T21:24:16Z</published><updated>2009-11-01T21:24:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/5qC3Cni12Zk/quick-on-go-picks-of-week-from-rb.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://amontenegro.blogspot.com/2009/11/quick-on-go-picks-of-week-from-rb.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Another week has gone by and some very interesting molbio blog posts have been aggregated to Researchblogging.org.

And each year, public health officials try to predict what the new strain will be and how it will affect the population in order to best combat it.

&lt;p&gt;A new study by an international team of researchers, led by assistant professor Andrew W. Park, who holds a joint appointment in the University of Georgia Odum School of Ecology and in the College of Veterinary Medicine, may make their task a little easier. The study breaks ground by working across scales and linking sub-molecular changes in the influenza virus to the likelihood of influenza outbreaks. The paper, published in the Oct. 30 edition of the journal Science, shows the relationship between the evolution of the virus and immunization rates needed to prevent an outbreak in the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Park explained that these findings can help inform efforts to prevent future outbreaks. "Public health officials will be able to assess the usefulness of a vaccine based upon its relationship to the current influenza strain and the population's immunity level," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/new_model_may_help_scientists.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/new_model_may_help_scientists.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/Rwwu7xYzi2I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257124797024"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/the_corporation_part_8.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6f0319c3af87a34d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="The Corporation"/><title type="html">The Corporation Part 8</title><published>2009-11-01T23:53:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-01T23:53:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/0mjeVBDs2cg/the_corporation_part_8.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/the_corporation_part_8.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/jUb13Pt7XQU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/the_corporation_part_8.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/0mjeVBDs2cg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257124695440"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/tweetlinks_11-01-09.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b268ae1fc0c4315</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Tweetlinks"/><title type="html">Tweetlinks, 11-01-09</title><published>2009-11-02T00:36:42Z</published><updated>2009-11-02T00:36:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/pYVy037slzQ/tweetlinks_11-01-09.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/tweetlinks_11-01-09.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Sheesh,&amp;quot; was the verdict of one incredulous online commenter to Reddit (a more considered critical reaction is here). Now, with a diplomat&amp;#39;s tact, David Matsumoto and colleagues have presented new findings showing that facial emotional expressions start out universal, but then become culturally differentiated. We&amp;#39;re all correct, everyone wins, big smiles all round, or maybe little ones, depending on where you were brought up.Matsumoto&amp;#39;s team studied thousands of photographs taken of j≈´d≈çka at the Athens Olympics in 2004 just after matches had ended. The researchers were particularly interested in whether, and how quickly, competitors&amp;#39; altered their initial facial emotional expressions after winning or losing.The key finding was that cultural differences emerged, with athletes from collectivist cultures, such as China, tending to mask their emotional expressions more than athletes from individualistic cultures like the UK. The research also showed that j≈´d≈çka from more wealthy, densely populated countries tended to be less concerned to mask their emotional expressions than competitors from rural, less populated countries.&amp;quot;These findings demonstrate that, across time, a given individual&amp;#39;s emotional expressions in a single context can be both universal and culture-specific,&amp;quot; the researchers said. Further analysis showed that cultural influences on emotional expressions tended to kick in within one to two seconds of the initial appearance of a facial emotional display. Matsumoto and his colleagues believe that the initial facial reaction is triggered automatically by subcortical brain structures, before more culturally specific modification is applied by the motor cortex. Dampening down an emotional expression appeared to take less time than completely masking an initial emotional display with another expression, consistent with the idea that masking requires more neurocognitive resources. &amp;quot;These findings open the door to future research and theory on the temporal dynamics of culturally moderated facial expressions,&amp;quot; the researchers said. _________________________________Matsumoto D, Willingham B, &amp;amp; Olide A (2009).

As you'd guess I'm very honored. They will show the movie &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt; by Bill Maher Sunday evening and then the panel will discuss it the next day at 1 PM. The participants include professors Hector Avalos, Dennis MacDonald, Carol Exum, Randall Reed and yours truly. I am to respond to the other four papers. &lt;a href="http://www.ideologicalcriticism.co.nr/"&gt;Here is the link&lt;/a&gt;. While we're there several of us including Hector Avalos, Jim Linville, and Ken Pulliam will be having a meeting &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/10/announcing-meeting-to-discuss-non.html"&gt;to discuss a non-religious group within the &lt;i&gt;Society of Biblical Literature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which should be interesting and exciting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most institutions of learning pay for these scholars to attend the SBL by covering their expenses. Since no institution will pay my way I'm conducting a fund drive to help my wife and I travel there so I can participate. I calculate that we'll need $1,000 to cover the costs of gas, food, and six nights stay in hotels (four while there and one both coming and going). It might be more, but $1,000 should be good enough. To answer your question in advance, yes, we will go regardless of whether or not we raise the needed money. But it is needed nonetheless, lest we go deeper in the hole than we already are financially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this Blog is helpful to you in some way then please consider helping out by donating $5-$20-$50-$100 or more. Any amount would help quite a bit. Just click on the link "Donate" in the sidebar to do so. For any gift of $100 I'll send the giver one copy of my book and it's companion, both of which are titled &lt;i&gt;Why I Became an Atheist&lt;/i&gt;, if requested as supplies last. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/10/if-you-want-to-donate.html"&gt;There are other ways to financially help&lt;/a&gt;, but this drive is about helping pay for us go to New Orleans. I've created a graphic below to let you know the progress and will update it once a day as money comes in. As of this posting we leave in 18 days. Can this money be raised? We'll see. Thank you so very much if you can help. If you can't then thanks for visiting and participating in the discussions at DC regardless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V452Ll6JHAE/SvxfP3Ak74I/AAAAAAAAAZA/64jRRo6e7l0/s1600-h/Fund-Drive-500.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V452Ll6JHAE/SvxfP3Ak74I/AAAAAAAAAZA/64jRRo6e7l0/s320/Fund-Drive-500.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-9104019457692718804?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Just such a paper has appeared in pre-publication form in Nature Geoscience today - namely Schultz et al. (2009).  This will undoubtedly represent the most surprising landslide paper of the year, and indeed for a few years in fact.  I suspect that this paper will generate a fair amount of media interest in the next few days as well.The subject of the paper is the Slumgullion landslide in SW. Colorado.  This slide is a classic landslide site - it is large and moves almost continually.  The slide is pretty obvious on Google Earth:All the more so when viewed obliquely:And there are a fair number of websites and online materials that describe it (see here and here for example).This latest study is based on an intense monitoring campaign undertaken on the landslide using extension transducers.  There is little doubt that the monitoring has been designed with great care by a team that is well-versed in such techniques.  The team have used this movement data to examine the variation in movement through time.  There is nothing terribly unusual about this approach except perhaps the level of precision with which the monitoring has been undertaken, but the results are very intriguing.  The data suggest that the slide moves almost every day.  This style of behaviour is quite unusual - most landslides are very episodic in terms of movement - but certainly not unique.   However, examination the movement patterns on a daily basis suggested that the slide moved in distinct eight hour periods, essentially at night.  During the day the landslide was to all intents and purposes stationary.  This periodic movement of the slide was found to be correlated with the variations in air pressure associated with atmospheric tides - i.e. it appears that the movement of the slide is controlled by air pressure!  Atmospheric tides are small variations in atmospheric pressure that result from solar heating of the air. The patterns of atmospheric tides are actually rather complex, but can be examined with a Fourier analysis.The team have compared the Fourier analysis of the movement pattern of the landslide with that of the atmospheric tides - there is little doubt that they are remarkably similar.  Thus the movement at least appears to be related to these atmospheric tidal cycles.  The authors suggest that these low atmospheric tide conditions induce upward movement of water and air below the shear surface of the landslide, changing the "frictional stress" of the slide, allowing movement to occur.  They have modelled the slide to explore this mechanism and present an analysis that, at least on first inspection, appears to be credible and to support their hypothesis.Now, it must be stressed at this point that Slumgullion is not a typical landslide.  In particular, the perennial slow landslide movement suggests that the factor of safety is essentially unity.  Measurements suggest that the pore pressure on the shear surface varies very little on the landslide, meaning that the slide is potentially highly sensitive to effects such as that reported in Schulz et al. (2009).  It is very unlikely that this effect is seen in anything other than a small proportion of slides that have exactly the right combination of stress state, thickness and material properties to allow this to occur, although I am willing to bet that a small number of other slides will be found to display this behaviour.  However, as the authors of the paper hint, the most interesting aspect may well be the implications for landslides in areas that encounter conditions with very low atmospheric pressures.  The key mechanism to deliver such conditions is the tropical cyclone, especially typhoons in East Asia and hurricanes in the Caribbean.  Here, atmospheric pressures can drop very low (Typhoon Tip had a measured sea level air pressure of 870 hPa in 1970), as well as bringing high intensity rainfall of course.  Thus, it may well be that the very high incidence of landslides under such conditions is not just the consequence of the rainfall but also the low atmospheric pressure.  That is a very interesting observation indeed.  Added to the recent observations that tropical cyclones can also trigger slow earthquakes, our understanding of the interactions between the atmosphere and the ground is developing quickly.So, all in all this is a fascinating study for which the authors should be congratulated.  It has added an intriguing new dimension to landslides, and will I suspect trigger a new wave of research projects.  I should add here that for most landslides this effect is almost certainly very small (no-one living near a landslide should start worrying about atmospheric pressures - it is still rainfall and earthquakes that are the main issue), but for certain slides under certain conditions this may be an important effect.ReferenceSchulz, W.H., Kean, J.W and Wang, G.

One thing that has been ticking over for a while is a book-club. Mostly because there‚Äôs a rather dangerous bookstore near the meet-up place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dangerous bookstores can be defined in several ways and I don‚Äôt think that they‚Äôre the same for every person. However, one distinguishing feature of a ‚Äòdangerous bookstore‚Äô is that you don‚Äôt leave without leaving money behind. This particular one near the meet-up place is memorable because of a black and red &lt;span&gt;garter&lt;/span&gt; belt. It cost me about $100 in books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in marketing can be daft. They think little gimmicks like putting a &lt;span&gt;garter&lt;/span&gt; belt on a romance novel will guarantee it‚Äôll be more appealing. The last time I saw a book display with a bunch of &lt;span&gt;garter&lt;/span&gt; belts around the mid-drift of a stack of blushing paperbacks (one of those pulp fiction sorts) was in February, around Valentine‚Äôs day. Most of those sorts of books are purchased sans leg-decoration - a little crumpled pile of them get left on the book bin shelf. People remove them to allow for better browsing, rather than carry around a nasty bit of frilly elastic that wouldn‚Äôt fit the average leg anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular &lt;span&gt;garter&lt;/span&gt; belt that I found in the bookstore didn‚Äôt seem to have a book to cover though. As I scanned the nearby shelves (‚Äô&lt;em&gt;New Release - Non-Fiction&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò) I couldn‚Äôt find a single book that had a matching frilly decoration. There wasn‚Äôt anything that appeared to require it (no new biography on Christine Keeler, nothing with Fabio on the fluro covers) and I wondered if perhaps the one book that came with it had been purchased, leaving this orphaned lingerie item behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I had about forty minutes to kill before the author of the book-signing arrived, I decided to see if perhaps the belt belonged to a book in another section and that it perhaps got mislaid somehow next to Hawking‚Äôs ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;God Created the Integers&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò or Dawkin‚Äôs ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly didn‚Äôt seem to be designed for those two books either, although from what I recall of Dawkin‚Äôs banter with Douglas Adams, I think perhaps he would have found a certain amount of charm in having a frilly around his mid-drift. Maybe his time-lord missus could wear it as a memento when he‚Äôs on tour? &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòRichard, there‚Äôs a bunch of books delivered for signing and a new batch of garters in ‚Äúiconoclast black‚Äù. Did you want some in ‚Äòre-evolutionary green‚Äô for the trade paperback edition?‚Äô &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn‚Äôt seem to suit the new hardcover Peter Cook memoirs or the ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Letters from a Portuguese Nun&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò (its cover was too‚Ä¶ austere‚Ä¶ although I was tempted to try) or even ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Seven Million Years - The Story of Human Evolution &lt;/span&gt;‚Äò by Douglas Palmer. Their loss, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I started checking out if it fitted with anything in the ‚ÄòTheatre‚Äô section and had no luck. Although I did find that Stoppard has ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Pirandello‚Äôs Henry IV&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò in print and I‚Äôve been meaning to see &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; ‚ÄòSix Characters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;in Search of an Author&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò, so perhaps this was a good time to read his interpretation. Apparently his &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;‚ÄòRock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll‚Äô &lt;/span&gt; was inspired in some part by the Czech-set classic ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò (or at least in the name of the main character Tomas) but I don‚Äôt think that it was designed with a stocking elastic decoration in mind. About then I discovered the ‚Äòcult book‚Äô section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where they keep Dunn‚Äôs ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Geek Love&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò and all the Palahniuk novels. I found ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Curse of Lono&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò by Hunter S. Thompson (illustrated by Ralph Steadman, naturally) and thought then that I found the most suitable new home for the garter. But ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;Curse&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶‚Äô was a big fat glossy hardcover and any &lt;span&gt;garter&lt;/span&gt; binding on that would only suit those who the thigh girth of an out-of-work actress posing as a incestuous-lesbian-ice-addicted-regular on a Jerry Springer show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nor did it suit Neal Stephenson‚Äôs joint novel with Frederick George in ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Cobweb&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò (I‚Äôd only read &lt;em&gt;‚Äò&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In&lt;/em&gt;terfa&lt;em&gt;ce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚Äò &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/3292/completehalo2001.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="302"&gt;&lt;span&gt;before) and although tucking it around the ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Daedalus Book of Finnish Fantasy&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò (a quick scan of the contents alerted me to words like ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;bogs&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò, &lt;em&gt;farmers&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò, ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;trousers&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò and ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;the train station Zubotica&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò so I don‚Äôt quite know quite if the standard of fantasy in Finland really needs additional frills with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; sort of excitement between its pages) was really really alluring, I eventually decided that the likes of the ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Call of Cthulhu‚Äô&lt;/span&gt; and ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Slaughterhouse 5&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò would be better off unmolested by black elastic and red satin. My sincere apologies to the estates of Lovecraft and &lt;/span&gt;Vonnegut.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
About now I was juggling a few books as I went around, but I still hadn‚Äôt got to the graphic novel section. In that section there a lady wearing a really snappy black corset. She was checking out the Dave Sims and I suggested that she look at the Grant Morrison‚Äôs or the early work of Alan Moore (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;‚ÄòD.R and Quinch&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò and ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;The Ballad of Halo Jones&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò). She suggested that perhaps the &lt;span&gt;garter&lt;/span&gt; could go quite nicely around the film-tie in of &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, in quasi-homage to Sally Jupiter (despite not being yellow and black) - but it was still too small a fit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realised that there were six books alone on Mozart. And that the Pet Shop Boys had a big illustrated volume on all of their album artwork in a shiny foil book, which revealed that they once wanted to do a musical based on Graham Greene‚Äôs ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Brighton Rock&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò. And that someone left a big coffee cup stain on a pile of Robert Jordans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realised &lt;span&gt;that I was never going to find a damned owner for this bloody &lt;span&gt;garter&lt;/span&gt; belt unless I stopped browsing and started looking in some overly-sensible sections of the bookstore that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; required some cheap titillating action to get a book sold. Which book really deserved to have a sprightly garter belt to get it some attention? I mean, the latest edition of ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Princess Bride&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò looks bloody awful. Like a five year old decided to scribble what they thought a pirate would look like if they were holding a cattle-prod. And no one was buying anything from the pile of ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;History‚Äôs Greatest Scandals - Shocking Stories of Powerful People&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò, much to author Ed Wright‚Äôs dismay, I‚Äôm certain. Boring cover that made it look like a daily planner. No one was looking at Shermer‚Äôs ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;The Mind of the Market&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò. Would it be wrong to write to Skeptic.com and suggest that you get a pair of frillies with every new edition of ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;Why People Believe Weird Things&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;‚ÄòButterflies of the World‚Äô&lt;/span&gt; had a great cover, but no one was going to notice it behind the puppy training books. How many people remember Abbott‚Äôs classic ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Flatland&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò? You could do your own inspired experiments in 3-D space with a &lt;span&gt;garter&lt;/span&gt;-belt if you pinged it about the bedroom. Not that I think A. Square would have really enjoyed a two-dimensional experience of a pole-dance. Even graphic-novel reading corset wearers would find it difficult to get some attention if they were reduced to a octagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was deciding between putting it on Patrick Suskind‚Äôs ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Perfume&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò or Lemony Snicket‚Äôs ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The End‚Äô &lt;/span&gt;(which is actually quite an amusing, esoteric in-joke but this blog-post has gone on far too long enough) when the author for the book-signing turned up and people started handing out tiny little bottles of champagne to celebrate that this was the first bookstore signing since last night‚Äôs ‚Äòofficial‚Äô launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point I had about six or seven books to buy and I just wrapped the &lt;span&gt;garter&lt;/span&gt;-belt around my copy of Apuleius‚Äô ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Eros and Psyche&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò (Penguin Epics released a bunch of little Classics readers, not unlike their Penguin 60s series back in ‚Äò95 where they sold itty-bitty books with itty-bitty prices featuring selected chapters or short stories) and so I got that and ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Epic of Gilgamesh&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò, ‚Äò&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Adventures of Alexander the Great&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò and Herodotus‚Äô &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; ‚ÄòXerxes Invades Greece&lt;/span&gt;‚Äò - and asked if they minded if I kept the garter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy shrugged and took my money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I have too many books and a &lt;span&gt;garter&lt;/span&gt; belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I‚Äôll use it as a hair decoration and wear it when I go to the Skeptics conference in Brisbane. So you‚Äôll be the only people who know that I‚Äôm actually wearing a frilly, tarty leg-circulation inhibitor in my curls when I‚Äôm running around interviewing people.&lt;/p&gt;

It is very long (one of the longest in the world) and spans an arm of the sea. It is old, and there are earthquakes in the region now and then.  So as you drive from one end to the other, it is impossible to marvel that the bridge was even built, and that it is still standing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/the_scoop_on_the_bay_bridge.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/the_scoop_on_the_bay_bridge.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/UiWGUnGmHJw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257114794257"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/11/another-weekend-another-faile/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ba745e36de841ba2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">another weekend, another faile‚Ä¶</title><published>2009-11-01T22:22:36Z</published><updated>2009-11-01T22:22:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/11/another-weekend-another-faile/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;another weekend, another failed attempt to get a haircut&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257112250109"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/11/i_got_a_prime_time_spot.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8691ce0389b589d6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NOIBN"/><title type="html">I Got A Prime Time Spot</title><published>2009-11-01T21:11:59Z</published><updated>2009-11-01T21:11:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/PFtZHKH1iKs/i_got_a_prime_time_spot.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/11/i_got_a_prime_time_spot.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I had to take a paper newspaper, then I would like &lt;em&gt;Dagens Nyheter's&lt;/em&gt; news section, &lt;em&gt;Svenska Dagbladet's&lt;/em&gt; arts &amp;amp; entertainment section, no sports section and no business section. SvD is a conservative rag and some of its political columnists are really distasteful, but DN never gets anywhere near SvD&amp;#39;s coverage of the historical humanities. DN&amp;#39;s arts section is mainly preoccupied with pretentious modern crap, installation artists and poets who will be forgotten three months from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was very pleased when the editor of SvD's arts essay page (through the good offices of √Ösa Larsson of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://tingotankar.blogspot.com/"&gt;Ting &amp;amp; Tankar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) asked me to write for him about a couple of new books. Getting onto that essay page (and hopefully staying there) has been a latent goal of mine for many years. And I was even more pleased when the piece I submitted was &lt;a href="http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/understrecket/artikel_3736545.svd"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt;: on a Sunday, when people actually had time to read the thing before they tossed the paper into the recycling bin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor was my sunny outlook diminished this evening when I received a letter from an editor at a major monthly mag who, on the strength of the SvD piece, offered me a reviewing gig on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Editor Ludvig Hertzberg &lt;a href="http://blogg.svd.se/understrecket?id=16403"&gt;comments on my piece&lt;/a&gt; on his blog.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/11/i_got_a_prime_time_spot.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/PFtZHKH1iKs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257110574341"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/todays_carnivals_445.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b5d795d4d5b9a42a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-11-01T21:07:05Z</published><updated>2009-11-01T21:07:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/hk2d9sAZ3Is/todays_carnivals_445.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/todays_carnivals_445.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berry Go Round&lt;/strong&gt; #21 is up on &lt;a href="http://beetlesinthebush.wordpress.com/2009/10/31/berry-go-round-21/" title=""&gt;Beetles In The Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Still, I managed to post &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/" title=""&gt;142 times&lt;/a&gt; last month...and not just Clock Quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/open_access_week.php" title=""&gt;Open Access Week&lt;/a&gt; was in October, and I particularly paid attention to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/open_access_day_in_serbia.php" title=""&gt;Open Access Week in Serbia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I announced &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/the_plos_one_blog_pick_of_the.php" title=""&gt;the PLoS ONE Blog Pick of the Month for September 2009 &lt;/a&gt;, the new &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/genomics_of_emerging_infectiou.php" title=""&gt;Genomics of Emerging Infectious Disease PLoS Collection&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_205.php" title=""&gt;New and Exciting in PLoS ONE - articles with embedded interactive 3D structures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got off the computer, out of the house and in the car and went to some science/technology local sites and events, which I blogged about in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/field_trip_water_sewage_and_fl.php" title=""&gt;Field Trip! Water, sewage and flowers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/new_jobs_in_north_carolina_at.php" title=""&gt;New jobs in North Carolina at CREE, producing LED lights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big job last month for us was managing the registration for ScienceOnline2010. Within three days of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/the_registration_for_the_scien.php" title=""&gt;opening for registration&lt;/a&gt; we had to close as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_we_are_ful.php" title=""&gt;we were full&lt;/a&gt;. Then I had to put together the final program &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_take_a_loo.php" title=""&gt;Schedule&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can hear more about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_on_duke_radi.php" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline2010 On Duke Radio&lt;/a&gt;. And I started introducing the participants &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_introducin.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_introducin_1.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_introducin_2.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_introducin_3.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_introducin_4.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing raises the excitement about ScienceOnline2010 as much as reading the interviews with participants of ScienceOnline09. In October, I added four more interviews - with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_14.php" title=""&gt;Arikia Millikan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_15.php" title=""&gt;Tatjana Jovanovic-Grove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_16.php" title=""&gt;Blake Stacey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_17.php" title=""&gt;Daniel Brown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being busy, instead of writing I posted a bunch of really cool videos - see &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/the_piano_stairway_video.php" title=""&gt;The Piano Stairway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/plastic_in_the_pacific_gyre_ca.php" title=""&gt;Plastic in the Pacific Gyre can be microscopic and never biodegrade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/why_does_plastic_accumulate_in.php" title=""&gt;Why does plastic accumulate in the North Pacific Gyre?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/its_so_easy_to_re-use_open_acc.php" title=""&gt;It's so easy to re-use Open Access stuff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/open_access_101_video.php" title=""&gt;Open Access 101 (video)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/teslapunk_antique_toilet_of_th.php" title=""&gt;Teslapunk Antique Toilet of the Future&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/500000_brazilian_free-tailed_b.php" title=""&gt;500,000 Brazilian free-tailed bats fly out of a cave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/video_of_anne_frank_surfaces_o.php" title=""&gt;Video of Anne Frank Surfaces on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the serial comma: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to the store to buy oatmeal, milk, and cookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the serial comma:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to the store to buy oatmeal, milk and cookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are arguments to be made for and against it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I bring this up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs an article by &lt;strong&gt;Jay Lindsay&lt;/strong&gt; of the Associated Press called ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091028/ap_on_re/us_rel_religion_today"&gt;Evangelists target spiritually cold New England&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù making the rounds.  There‚Äôs nothing overly special about the piece ‚Äî the headline summarizes it well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reader &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dwasifar.com"&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; brings it to my attention because of the comma issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a direct quotation from the piece.  The lack of a serial comma gives it an entirely different (and very entertaining) meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They say a reason for the region‚Äôs hollowed-out faith is a pervasive theology that departs from traditional Biblical interpretation on issues such as the divinity of Jesus, &lt;strong&gt;the exclusivity of Christianity as a path to salvation and homosexuality&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dwasifar.com/?p=833"&gt;Jon points out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I‚Äôm pretty sure there are other paths to homosexuality besides Christianity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice catch &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are coming to &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline2010&lt;/a&gt; and you have checked the amazing &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Program/" title=""&gt;Program&lt;/a&gt; there, you have noticed that there will be a set of hands-on workshops on Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you will be attending, you can sign up for workshops now - one 10am and one 11am worskhop. How do you sign up? By editing the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Workshops/" title=""&gt;Workshops&lt;/a&gt; page of the wiki - just add the number (up to 50 per session) and your name under the titles of workshops you want to participate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you choose which two workshops to attend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to start a blog and don't know how, sign up for &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Blogging_101/" title=""&gt;Blogging 101&lt;/a&gt; and an hour later you will have your own blog, ready to fill with content of your own, perhaps starting with your coverage of the conference over those three days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already write a blog, but want to make your blog better, prettier, more interesting, more functional and, importantly, less isolated, i.e., better connected to the rest of the Web, sign up for &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Blogging_102/" title=""&gt;Blogging 102&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If running a single, personal blog is not your thing (or you've already been doing it for years) and you are ready to step up and design your own site, something more complex and more flexible, with news, podcasts, videos, perhaps multiple blogs written by multiple users, then it may be time to start getting familiar with Drupal (yes, even the White House is now using Drupal for its sites). Get started in the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Drupal/" title=""&gt;Make your own social networking site with Drupal&lt;/a&gt; workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific articles get deposited into mysterious online places called Library Repositories. What are those? How do you use them?  How do you find information in them?  If you publish a paper, how do you deposit it there? This will all be answered in the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Repositories/" title=""&gt;Repositories for Fun and Profit&lt;/a&gt; session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sick of searching the Web for other people's images to use in your blog posts? Make your own. Learn how to use easy artistic and graphic tools in the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Tablet/" title=""&gt;Paint your blog images using a digital tablet&lt;/a&gt; session (watch that page - you may be asked to download software ahead of time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone can point a Flip camera and shoot, then upload the file on YouTube, right? Yes, but there are things to know and tricks to use to make your videos much better, thus more interesting, useful and educational. Learn the basics of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" title=""&gt;Storyboarding your science video and posting it online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter, FriendFeed, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, Stumbleupon....you have heard of all of these and other social networking sites. But you are not on them and don't know how to use them. Or you are on them, but not really sure how to use them. Perhaps all you give and get there is silly and useless stuff. How do you find science information and/or other scientists on these services, how do you use those services to exchange useful information, to collaborate, or promote your organization? Find out in the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Social_media_for_beginners/" title=""&gt;Social media for beginners&lt;/a&gt; workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps sound is your thing, rather than writing, images and video.

I missed most of Wednesday, but hope to have a summary from another spectator sometime soon.  This is a summary of the testimony I heard Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúCoach‚Äù David Daubenmire Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first witness Wednesday was ‚ÄúCoach‚Äù David Daubenmire.  Daubenmire once taught and coached in the MT. Vernon school system, and then left to teach and coach in London, Ohio, where he and the district were sued by the ACLU for praying with his football players.  That case was settled out of court just before going to trial, with the district paying costs.  Daubenmire left teaching in 2000 to found &lt;a href="http://www.ptsalt.com/about" rel="external "&gt;Pass the Salt Ministries&lt;/a&gt;.  He claims a Ph.D. in ‚Äúscriptural psychology‚Äù from some school ‚Äì possibly &lt;a href="http://faithcollege.org/" rel="external "&gt;Faith Bible College&lt;/a&gt; in Missouri.  He also claims to be an adjunct professor at Mt. Vernon Nazarene University, where he taught a couple of continuing education classes for teachers, one a two-day workshop on religion in the classroom that Freshwater attended in the early 2000s.  That class used a text called &lt;a href="http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=3979" rel="external "&gt;Finding Common Ground&lt;/a&gt;, which appears to be an eminently respectable guide to religion in public schools and First Amendment issues.  A copy was introduced as an exhibit in the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daubenmire was also the organizer of ‚ÄúMinutemen United‚Äù (whose web site now appears to be defunct; see the pages preserved in the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.minutemenunited.org" rel="external "&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;) through which he coordinated picketing at abortion clinics (he testified to that); allegedly photographed license plates of patrons of a nearby strip club and posted them on the web somewhere (I haven‚Äôt been able to find documentation of that; see note at the end of this post); and &lt;a href="http://www.streetprophets.com/story/2007/8/7/101539/9765" rel="external "&gt;disrupting services&lt;/a&gt; at a Baptist church that is accepting of the LGBT community.  According to Daubenmire‚Äôs testimony, Freshwater joined the Minutemen United Saturday morning picketing at a Columbus abortion clinic several times.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daubenmire had spoken several times at the middle school and high school Fellowship of Christian Athletes prior to the Freshwater affair.  He said his main message was ‚ÄúLiving out your faith boldly.‚Äù  In September 2007 he was invited (by a student) to speak again at the middle school FCA.  On his arrival Daubenmire was met by Freshwater who told him there was a problem and that he would not be allowed to speak.  Later that day Daubenmire met with Superintendent Steve Short, who Daubenmire says is a good Christian man, who told Daubenmire that he had received a complaint about Daubenmire speaking from a parent.  Daubenmire testified that ‚ÄúIf I had been a Muslim speaker Mr. Short would have allowed me to speak.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daubenmire testified that at that time he was ‚Äúspittin‚Äô hot‚Äù and warned Freshwater that ‚Äòthey‚Äô were out to get him, and that he had to push back.  He said Freshwater was reluctant to make waves, and that he‚Äôd wait and see what happened.  Daubenmire testified that he can ‚Äúsmell bigotry,‚Äù and that ‚Äúsomeone was definitely engaging in viewpoint discrimination.‚Äù  He testified that he told Freshwater ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about FCA, it‚Äôs about you.  If it were me I‚Äôd fight back now.‚Äù  He told Freshwater that if it were him, he‚Äôd bring suit.  He referred to Superintendent Steve Short as ‚ÄúThe man behind the curtain.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main burden of Daubenmire‚Äôs testimony was that he took responsibility for having organized the April 16, 2008, &lt;a href="http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/08/04/17/freshwater.php4" rel="external "&gt;public demonstration&lt;/a&gt; in Mt. Vernon to bring attention to the Freshwater situation.  According to Daubenmire, Freshwater called him the morning of April 16 to seek advice, since the school administration had instructed him to remove his Bible from his desk.  Daubenmire testified that he told Freshwater ‚ÄúWhat did I tell you in September, that it‚Äôs not about FCA ‚Ä¶ I can smell it ‚Ä¶ I see where this is going ‚Ä¶ I told you so.‚Äù  He testified that he told Freshwater, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to stand by and watch this happen. ‚Ä¶ you have to take the first strike ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to start working on a statement.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daubenmire said he immediately sat down to write a press release, and called a press conference on the public square in Mt. Vernon that afternoon by emailing and faxing reporters.  He also called Jeff Cline, a Mt. Vernon resident, to alert him to the press conference.  Cline, who has lectured the Board of Education about the ‚Äúhomosexual agenda‚Äù on at least one occasion, apparently spread the word in Mt. Vernon to raise a crowd.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daubenmire said he called Freshwater that afternoon and told him that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre are going to take your job and you‚Äôre going to spend years trying to get your job back.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes before the press conference was due to start, Daubenmire testified that he met with Freshwater and his wife in a hardware store parking lot near the square and showed him the statement he, Daubenmire, had written explaining Freshwater‚Äôs position.  He testified that Freshwater said words to the effect that ‚ÄòIf that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, I should read the statement.‚Äô  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On their walk to the public square Daubenmire said they met John Fair, a former teacher and coach (and husband of a member of the Mt. Vernon board of education).  Daubenmire said that Fair told him, ‚ÄúThis is even deeper [possibly ‚Äúdirtier‚Äù] than you know.‚Äù  Fair later testified that he said no such thing but rather either Freshwater or Daubenmire [I‚Äôll know which sometime soon, I hope] told &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; that, and that he did not attend the rally but was merely walking past it on his way from the hardware store to his home and that as far as he could see it was all over when he was passing through the public square.  This account of Fair‚Äôs testimony is second-hand based on a conversation with a spectator the next day of the hearing.  Again, I hope to have a first-hand account from a spectator in the hearing.  (Note that the Mt. Vernon News has a different version of what Daubenmire claimed Fair said.  I‚Äôm confident of my quotation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater then read Daubenmire‚Äôs statement at the rally and immediately left.  Daubenmire stayed, talking with onlookers and reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daubenmire‚Äôs testimony also included numerous asides in which Daubenmire extolled his own role in the situation.  He said several times, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what I do.  I call press conferences to bring attention to things.‚Äù  Of his own effectiveness, he said, ‚ÄúI can tell a story about a dog that would make a cat cry.‚Äù  The basic point of his testimony was that he, Daubenmire, was the initiator and driver of the public hoorah on April 16, and that Freshwater was a passive participant, reading the statement that Daubenmire wrote and then departing.  Daubenmire testified that ‚ÄúI kind of threw him in the middle of the fight.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/10/29/daubenmire-testifies-at-freshwater-hearing" rel="external "&gt;Mount Vernon News quoted Daubenmire&lt;/a&gt; as saying &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe foundation of our country is Christian,‚Äù Daubenmire said. ‚ÄúIt is a religion, but atheism is a religion and secular humanism is a religion and they are taught in school.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  The Columbus Dispatch reported that Daubenmire said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOur culture is Christian. The foundation of our laws is Christian,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve become so afraid of religion in America that we won‚Äôt even acknowledge what‚Äôs happened. But it‚Äôs history.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard words to those effects but they didn‚Äôt make it into my notes as direct quotations.  I‚Äôll note that in a local call-in radio show in September 2007 Daubenmire also remarked about ‚Äúevolutionist religion.‚Äù  I know that because I was the caller about whom Daubenmire made the remark.  The man is about even with Ray Comfort, which is a real tough level to reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later Daubenmire was asked by Freshwater‚Äôs advisers, notably Pastor Don Matolyak, to withdraw from participation in the affair, that he was told that ‚Äúit would be best if he (Daubenmire) weren‚Äôt around.‚Äù  He showed some apparent resentment at that.  I recall a radio program around that time in which ‚ÄòCoach‚Äô was considerably irritated at having been pushed out of active participation in Freshwater‚Äôs resistance, though I can‚Äôt find it archived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to leave for a physician‚Äôs appointment in Columbus and missed the rest of Wednesday‚Äôs testimony.  After Daubenmire‚Äôs direct and cross examination were finished, John Fair testified briefly, denying that he said what was attributed to him by Daubenmire.  Then Tim Keib, who was assistant principal and for several months interim principal in the middle school during the relevant period was called and began his direct examination by R. Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater‚Äôs attorney.  The Mount Vernon News has a &lt;a href="http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/10/29/daubenmire-testifies-at-freshwater-hearing" rel="external "&gt;pretty detailed account&lt;/a&gt; of the remainder of Wednesday‚Äôs testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on Thursday and Friday as I get to them.

&lt;p&gt;Note added 11/2/09 re: Daubenmire and the strip club: As far as I can see now there‚Äôs no detectable connection between Daubenmire and the activities at the strip club.  There once existed a site called ‚Äúwww.stopthefox.com/‚Äù at which the license plate photos were apparently posted, but the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.stopthefox.com/" rel="external "&gt;internet archive&lt;/a&gt; has only the background skin of the site.  So I cannot support the rumor that Daubenmire was involved in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those interested (purely academically, of course!) &lt;a href="http://media.www.kenyoncollegian.com/media/storage/paper821/news/2006/11/09/Features/The-Foxhole.Go.For.The.Pie.Stay.For.The.Pole.Dancing-2450280.shtml" rel="external "&gt;here is a story&lt;/a&gt; in a college newspaper by a coed who visited the strip club.&lt;/p&gt;

The event was live on the intertubez and &lt;a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/2465927"&gt;and the recorded stream is on UStream&lt;/a&gt;. The whole thing is over an hour long, but well worth your time! A bunch of people (including Penn &amp;amp; Teller, David Copperfield, Michael Shermer, and me) were asked to send in secret words for Houdini to divine at the seance. This wasn‚Äôt a foolproof scientific experiment, but it‚Äôs fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the show below. Note: some NSFW language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They picked my word starting at about 39 minutes into the video. And what was my word? Well, at the risk of generating the ire of Houdini‚Äôs shade, it was &lt;em&gt;floccinaucinihilipilification&lt;/em&gt;, a word I remembered from when I was a kid and read the Guinness Book of World Records (it was in the list for, duh, longest words). It means &amp;quot;the act of estimating something as being worthless&amp;quot;. I didn‚Äôt realize they were using a Ouija board at the seance, though, so perhaps choosing a word that‚Äôs about 30 letters long may have been a little irritating. However, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to make sure they wouldn‚Äôt pick it by chance. Infinite monkeys, and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Denver Skeptics divined my word as &amp;quot;shor&amp;quot;. I have to count that as a definite hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I came across a quintuple-negative in one of these sentences‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Like their denial of God, atheists are also in adamant denial that their non-belief in God is a religious endeavor. Atheism in fact is a lot of ‚Äòdenial‚Äô because they not only deny that they deny that God exists, they deny that they believe that God does not exist. &lt;strong&gt;Many atheists also deny that they have any faith in their denial that God exists yet many of them will deny that statement is true because many of them also deny that they have faith in their thinking that God does not exist and also many deny that truth exists.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus in their saying that truth does not exist, they can deny that it is true that their non-belief in God requires of them any actual thought over their motto of, ‚ÄúAtheism is a religion like not collecting stamps is a hobby.‚Äù It seems as if atheists have something against both, collecting stamps and Christ Jesus.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that‚Äôs amusing, check out the &lt;a href="http://findingtruthtoday.typepad.com/finding-truth-today/2009/10/atheism---an-atheists-religious-denial-of-faith-in-their-beliefs.html"&gt;rest of the piece&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author thinks our debaptism ceremonies are some sort of ritual (rather than an entertaining, random way to spend an afternoon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also thinks the &lt;a href="http://outcampaign.org/"&gt;Scarlet A&lt;/a&gt; is our version of the Christian cross and we worship it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Another item of strong evidence pointing to atheism being a religion is the extravagant respect and admiration for and devotion to their symbol of the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù which they hold in great esteem which they call, ‚ÄúScarlet Letter.‚Äù This worship symbol they proudly and broadly display apparently as an idol. You will notice it in many places where atheists congregate as they display it proudly as though it was as significant as the cross that Christ Jesus was crucified upon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right‚Ä¶ &lt;/p&gt;

These eight patriots armed themselves with information and guts and planned to attack dogma and repressive politics at the Republican National Convention.  They were arrested, treated like animals, and pressed with trumped up charges, including an accusation of terrorism under a Minnesota state law that mirrors the oppressive Bush Anti-Patriot Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right to free speech, the right to assemble, the right to bear arms, and the right to due process are fundamental tenets of the American System of Democracy.  The Original American Patriots carried out civil disobedience that culminated in the design and ratification of the Constitution that guarantees these rights.  Please understand the connection.  The original American Patriots knew what they had to do, they did it, then they built a system that would allow future generations a means to do the same thing if necessary.  They made the American system one open to self-criticism and progressive change.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/i_am_the_angry_left_repost_fro.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/i_am_the_angry_left_repost_fro.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/Z775rcZhH80" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257097396575"><id gr:original-id="http://apgaylard.wordpress.com/?p=1104">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc22a4febb3c0168</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The emperor?s new gym</title><published>2009-11-01T16:18:03Z</published><updated>2009-11-01T16:18:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://apgaylard.wordpress.com/2009/11/01/the-emperors-new-gym/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">The day they made me do Brain Gym: Brain Buttons, Thinking Cap, Hook Ups and the Cross Crawl.

&lt;p&gt;SPOILER for the joke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meteorites&lt;/em&gt; are after they hit the ground. &lt;em&gt;Meteors&lt;/em&gt; are when they are still in the air and glowing, and the solid part is called a &lt;em&gt;meteoroid&lt;/em&gt;.

Normally, summer sees a return of flu cases to a low baseline, but not this year---this year we saw a bump in cases around April, with a consistent trickle of cases throughout the summer, and significant outbreaks at summer camps and military bases.  And now, from that "higher low point" we are seeing an early, rapid rise in flu cases.  Some of this is likely attributable to an increase in reporting---people are worried and going to the doctor for illnesses that they would normally ignore.  But that isn't likely to be the bulk of reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An "influenza-like illness" (ILI) is usually defined as a fever of 37.8 or above (100 degrees Farenheit), plus either sore throat or cough, without another explanation, such as strep throat.  Many ILIs are not influenza, but during the flu season, the sets of ILI and actual flu increasingly overlap; that is, more ILIs are due to actual flu when there is a lot of flu in the community, making this a useful marker of flu activity. We can't test everyone, so we have to make an educated guess, and the fact that ILI rates are soaring above anything we normally see, combined with samples from surveillance sites, confirms that we are seeing flu rates far above what would normally be expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/swine_flu_is_killing_a_differe.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/swine_flu_is_killing_a_differe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/YQ562y9lBQs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257088777960"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=3869">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3be85390c3ead955</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Culture"/><category term="science of kissing"/><category term="The Sunday Snog"/><title type="html">The Sunday Snog</title><published>2009-11-01T15:03:54Z</published><updated>2009-11-01T15:03:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/01/the-sunday-snog-16/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.movieposter.com/poster/MPW-17527/Kids_Kissing.html"&gt;&lt;img title="MPW-17527" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/10/MPW-17527.jpg" alt="MPW-17527" width="599" height="395"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257087808401"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1852">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/35e1549f1ec25559</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Awesomeness"/><category term="Phonetics and phonology"/><title type="html">Reverse English</title><published>2009-11-01T14:56:40Z</published><updated>2009-11-01T14:56:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1852" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just in case you haven't seen this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I associate this sort of thing, from long ago pre-internet days, with Ian Catford, who was able to do this for new phrases more or less on demand. My experience with his displays of this ability go back so far that the preferred way to demonstrate it was to play a reel-to-reel tape backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm not the only one with this memory of him: looking for a link to Ian on the web, I found &lt;a href="http://obits.mlive.com/obituaries/annarbor/obituary.aspx?n=john-c-catford-ian&amp;amp;pid=134991025"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Ian is also famous for his amazing ability to repeat speech backwards. When asked about this, he reported that he started studying phonetics at the age of 14, and his phonetic skills helped him to gain a position with the BBC as a radio actor, starting when he was 17 ‚Äì often speaking in multiple exotic dialects. Also, in a production of Alice Through the Looking Glass, he recorded ""Jabberwocky"" both forwards and in reverse. The BBC reversed his reverse performance and it came out quite intelligibly with an appropriate other-worldly quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the link is to Ian's obituary: he died on Oct. 6, a bit more than three weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

It's within his rights to do that, since the book is in the public domain now (as is, say, &lt;i&gt;the KJV Bible&lt;/i&gt;), but it's also a metaphor for the sleaziness of creationism. They have no original ideas, so all they can do is steal the work of real scientists; their ideas are contradicted by the evidence, so their only strategy is to delete the parts that make them uncomfortable, and put a false spin on what's left. Ray Comfort also has a lot of gall; he doesn't understand the concepts Darwin discussed, so he's got no foundation on which to base his editorial decisions. What next? Will he decide to put out a special creationist edition of &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/173/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Relativity: The Special and General Theory&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the math chopped out and his own clueless introduction that calls it all bunk?&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="http://www.myjournalcourier.com/news/article-24294-suspended-teacher.html"&gt;teacher was suspended for assigning a reading from one of those subversive, radical bloggers&lt;/a&gt;, and it wasn't me! It was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/10/the_gay_animal_kingdom.php"&gt;Jonah Lehrer&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article was about the &lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/the_gay_animal_kingdom/"&gt;prevalence of homosexuality among animals&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently the thought that homosexuality might occur naturally, rather than being a purely human sin, does not sit well with certain people. I thought the most objectionable part of the article was Roughgarden's blithe panadaptationism (&lt;span&gt;"Given the pervasive presence of homosexuality throughout the animal kingdom, same-sex partnering must be an adaptive trait that's been carefully preserved by natural selection."&lt;/span&gt; Bleh.)&lt;/p&gt;

Pleasantly shocked, but shocked nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I say that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that because traffic from October 2009 is more than twice the traffic from October 2008. Moreover, it's not an anomaly. Although there have been fluctuations in traffic over the last year, so far the trend has been steadily upward, so that I've more than doubled my traffic since this time last year. Not bad, not bad at all. Actually, it's more than that. It's friggin' unbelievable. If, when I started this thing nearly five years ago, someone had told me I'd eventually hit traffic levels as high as they are now, I'd have told him he's out of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why traffic has increased so much over the last year, I have no idea. I haven't really been doing anything different than I've been doing all along, at least radical. Changes in this blog have been slow and evolutionary (as is appropriate), not revolutionary over the years, and I'm under no delusion that somehow I've gotten twice as good at blogging as I was a year ago. I'd love to think that, but clearly that's not true. Still, whatever the cause, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you, my readers. Whatever the reason, somehow there are a lot of you out there who like what I lay down on a daily basis here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only hope I'm managing to persuade a few mavens of pseudoscience, such as anti-vaccinationists, to come back over to the light of reason and science. Again, I'm under no delusion that I'm likely to have influence very many on the "other side," but if I've only influenced a handful it will have been worth it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/a_brief_time_out_for_self-congratulation.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/rivpAlJVnLg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257082464069"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=17809">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4533aebe9ae4f4ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">How Far Would You Go To Maintain Ties with Religious Family Members?</title><published>2009-11-01T13:00:55Z</published><updated>2009-11-01T13:00:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/01/how-far-would-you-go-to-maintain-ties-with-religious-family-members/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tina&lt;/strong&gt;, an atheist, recently tried to friend her cousin on Facebook.  This sounds like an automatic ‚Äúaccept‚Äù to me, but it got complicated for her.  Her cousin said she would only accept the request on one condition: Tina must promise never to discuss religion or politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stems partly from the fact that &lt;a href="http://summersquirrel.blogspot.com/2009/08/facebook-exchange.html"&gt;when another relative was in the hospital and got better&lt;/a&gt;, her extended family praised God for his recovery (and for putting his care in the hands of good doctors and hospital staffers).  Tina suggested they give thanks solely to the medical folks who actually had something to do with his getting better.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They weren‚Äôt very happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now her cousin won‚Äôt friend her on Facebook.  It‚Äôs not the first time her relatives have distanced themselves from her because she questions religion.  And this bothers Tina because she does want to maintain ties to her extended family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://summersquirrel.blogspot.com/2009/10/facebook-experiment.html"&gt;trying a little experiment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
‚Ä¶ After much thought I decided to make another FB page and label myself a Republican and a Christian and use my maiden name instead of the name most of my friends know me by. This is really just an experiment to see what kind of reaction I get from the family and also to stay in touch with the people who normally wouldn‚Äôt give me the time of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that I would feel creepy about this but I‚Äôve managed to rationalize it in this way: I don‚Äôt have much to do with this people but still want to maintain some contact with them‚Ä¶
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs sad she would have to resort to this and it‚Äôs sad that it may be the only way her relatives will communicate with her.  It‚Äôs mighty Christian of them, don‚Äôt you think? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of you who have relatives who want little to do with you because of your atheism.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you done anything to strengthen your relationships with them?  How far have you gone to make that happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Trying to speak objectively, I think the meeting was pretty successful, at least from the biology end (as I said, I didn‚Äôt see the history/philosophy talks).  The talks were as I requested:  broad overviews ‚Äî not narrow research summaries ‚Äìthat were comprehensible to the biologically informed layperson.  And the speakers delivered the goods, with entertaining and engrossing presentations.  I know I learned a lot!  Thanks to all who came, and especially to Bob Richards, who, though listed as ‚Äúco-organizer‚Äù with me, really did the mastodon‚Äôs share of the work.  This conference was largely his vision and his accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various holidays that &lt;del&gt;plague&lt;/del&gt; enliven the year have all gone through a complicated process of being co-opted. Each successive culture that has conquered or prevailed over a previous culture has adapted local holidays to fit its own agenda, drawing the conquered populace into participating in the new culture. So local animist holidays were co-opted into Celtic forms, then Roman forms, then Roman Catholic forms, then Protestant forms, and in the United States, the latest co-opting has been into Capitalist forms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, we celebrated Celtic Harvest, Livestock Slaughter and Passing of the Dead Festival Co-opted to Roman Pagan Harvest, Livestock Slaughter and Passing of he Dead Festival Co-opted to Roman Catholic All Saints Vigil/Feast Co-opted to Capitalist Subconscious Psycho-Sexual Sado-Masochistic Eros-Thanatos Paravestite Fetish Fantasy Catharsis and Candy Consumption Night, otherwise known to the less informed as Halloween. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it‚Äôs such a thoroughly co-opted holiday, I‚Äôve been trying a little co-opting of my own, turning a tiny part of it into Turn Away From Superstitious Nonsense For a Brief Moment and Be Amazed at the Real Universe Night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs the only night of the year when thousands of kids and their parents are outside in the dark.  So each year, weather permitting, I set up one of my telescopes in front of my house and show them one of the wonders of the night sky. I dress up in a classic wizard costume because part of the co-opting process is to resemble the previous culture‚Äôs holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, Jupiter was very well placed high in the southern sky, and the full moon was far to the East. The weather was perfect. About 200 little kids dressed as princesses, ghouls and ghosts came by with their parents, as well as teens in their inexplicable costumes, all on their quest for candy. Several said, ‚ÄúHey it‚Äôs the telescope man!‚Äù  They remembered me from previous years. That feels good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife handed out the goodies while the kids and grownups took turns viewing Jupiter, a pale disk with tan stripes bracketed by two pairs of tiny moons on either side, all lined up straight. They all seemed to enjoy it, giving exclamations of astonishment.  Even the few teens who were feigning being jaded brightened up and got excited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told them a few interesting facts just to plant the seeds of the love of science.  The bit of information that was the biggest hit was that the planet is so far away it takes the light about 40 minutes to reach us, so we see it as it was and where it was 40 minutes ago.  A telescope is a time machine that looks into the past. The adults showed the same expression of awe as the youngsters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really love doing things like this. If there‚Äôs a secular version of a ‚Äúcalling‚Äù this is mine. There is so much wonder, mystery and beauty in the real universe, the real world all around us.  So much to inspire our best emotions, our best thoughts and our best actions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you all a very happy Reality Day.  That‚Äôs any and every day. &lt;/p&gt;

Time magazine, for one, carried a report - which got up the nose of a writer on the GetReligion blog. Here&amp;#39;s the offending paragraph:

    Nevertheless, both morality researchers and olfactory scientists agree that people do strongly associate physical cleanliness with purity of conscience. It is the notion at the heart of adages like ‚Äúcleanliness is next to godliness‚Äù and evidenced by the widespread use of cleansing ceremonies to wash away sins in various religions around the world. (Truth be told, that practice is merely an extrapolation of an evolutionary strategy to avoid disease.)...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I‚Äôve been thinking about the apparent permeation of anti-vaccination attitudes into mainstream culture, and how the scientific community and its supporters could better combat it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What if we were to create a group similar to the Union of Concerned Scientists, focused on vaccination?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think what we need is something akin to the NCSE's &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve"&gt;"Project Steve"
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
NCSE's "Project Steve" is a tongue-in-cheek parody of a long-standing creationist tradition of amassing lists of "scientists who doubt evolution" or "scientists who dissent from Darwinism."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Creationists draw up these lists to try to convince the public that evolution is somehow being rejected by scientists, that it is a "theory in crisis." Not everyone realizes that this claim is unfounded. NCSE has been asked numerous times to compile a list of thousands of scientists affirming the validity of the theory of evolution. Although we easily could have done so, we have resisted. We did not wish to mislead the public into thinking that scientific issues are decided by who has the longer list of scientists!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Project Steve pokes fun at this practice and, because "Steves" are only about 1% of scientists, it also makes the point that tens of thousands of scientists support evolution. And it honors the late Stephen Jay Gould, evolutionary biologist, NCSE supporter, and friend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We'd like to think that after Project Steve, we'll have seen the last of bogus "scientists doubting evolution" lists, but it's probably too much to ask. We hope that when such lists are proposed, reporters and other citizens will ask, "How many Steves are on your list!?"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I thought of doing a similar project to illustrate the depth of support among scientists -- those with a Ph.D or an M.D. or both -- for the proposition that vaccines are safe and an essential element of public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Paul to honor Paul Offit? Project Maurice to honor Maurice Hilleman? (neither first name has the popularity or flexibility of Steve). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hmmn. Need to find a person seminal to vaccine research &amp;amp; development who has a pretty common first name.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Wait, the internets...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.pokemyname.com/firstname_43_paul.htm"&gt;http://www.pokemyname.com/firstname_43_paul.htm
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
popularity of name PAUL is 16.57 people per thousand. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Names That Includes PAUL as a Whole:&lt;/span&gt; Names that are Paul - like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paula, Pauline, Paulette, Paulo, Paulina, Paulino, Paule, Paulus, &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Spaulding, Johnpaul,&lt;/span&gt; Paull, Paulita, Paulomi, Pauling, Paulos, Harpaul, Paulose, Jeanpaul, Jaspaul, Pauliina, Polly, Pol, Pawl, Pablo, Paolo, Pauly, Pauley, Pawley, Paulin, Pavlo, Paulo, Paulus, Powell, P√°l, Paul 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Can you suggest some homophones for Paul, or some names from non-Latin roots that mean &lt;a href="http://baby-names.familyeducation.com/name-meaning/pavel"&gt;"Little one"&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com/meaning_of_Paul.html"&gt;small; humble¬†&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next items of business:

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A site to host the petition and the signatories, as NCSE does for¬† Project Steve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A committee or group to draft a position statement for vaccines analogous to the Project Steve position statement.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Evolution is a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences, and the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that all living things share a common ancestry. Although there are legitimate debates about the patterns and processes of evolution, there is no serious scientific doubt that evolution occurred or that natural selection is a major mechanism in its occurrence. It is scientifically inappropriate and pedagogically irresponsible for creationist pseudoscience, including but not limited to "intelligent design," to be introduced into the science curricula of our nation's public schools.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In a more serious review on clinical lycanthropy in the British Journal of Psychiatry Coll, O&amp;#39;Sullivan, and Browne (1985; PDF) began by stating:Lycanthropy is the delusion in which an individual believes he has been transformed into an animal, traditionally a wolf. Descriptions of this syndrome are found in the earliest medical writings such as those of the Greek Paulus Aegineta in the seventh century A.D. (Adams, 1844). There is also a biblical description of the syndrome in the Book of Daniel. Nebuchadnezzar (605-562 B.C.), the king who rebuilt Babylon, succumbed to a lycanthropic state after suffering from an apparent depressive illness for seven years.Nebuchadnezzar, by William BlakeIn his 1621 magnum opus, The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton (aka Democritus Junior) explained it thusly (in Part 1):Lycanthropia, which Avicenna calls cucubuth, others lupinam insaniam, or wolf-madness, when men run howling about graves and fields in the night, and will not be persuaded but that they are wolves, or some such beasts. Aetius and Paulus call it a kind of melancholy; but I should rather refer it to madness, as most do. Some make a doubt of it whether there be any such disease. Donat ab Altomari saith, that he saw two of them in his time: Wierus tells a story of such a one at Padua 1541, that would not believe to the contrary, but that he was a wolf...  And Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel, as some interpreters hold, was only troubled with this kind of madness. This disease perhaps gave occasion to that bold assertion of Pliny, some men were turned into wolves in his time, and from wolves to men again: and to that fable of Pausanias, of a man that was ten years a wolf, and afterwards turned to his former shape: to Ovid&amp;#39;s tale of Lycaon, &amp;amp;c. Not surprisingly, the modern-day diagnosis given to individuals afflicted with this delusion is usually a psychotic disorder in the context of schizophrenia (Fahy, 1989), severe depression (Coll et al., 1985; Rao et al., 1999; Younis &amp;amp; Moselhy, 2009), or bipolar disorder (Verdoux &amp;amp; Bourgeois, 1993).Benicio del Toro stars in The Wolfman, to be released in Feb. 2010.However, imaginary transmogrification isn&amp;#39;t restricted to the lupine variety. A comprehensive review of the literature between 1966‚Äì2002 (Garlipp et al., 2004) identified 21 articles, primarily case studies:In the current medical literature man‚Äìanimal metamorphoses were described concerning the following animals: wolf/werewolf, dog, gerbil, rabbit, horse, tiger, cat, bird, unspecified animal species, frog and bee. In Asia, Africa and South America, metamorphoses in tiger, hyena, crocodile and shark were observed.The authors mention that the specifics can be influenced by cultural factors. But then they deliver the psychodynamic perspective promised in the review&amp;#39;s title (and a bit of condescension):The symptomatology can be seen as a continuity spectrum of developmental and culture dependent normal behaviour via transitional ‚Äì a fantasy of an artist ‚Äì and partial forms to the whole picture of lycanthropy described by Keck et al. (1988). The length of transformation is usually short, symptomatology has mostly disappeared in a week&amp;#39;s time. People who live in preindustrial societies and people living on isolated countrysides are predisposed. Other precipitating factors seem to be subconscious sexual conflicts.Finally, they end with precipitating psychopathology:Lycanthropic symptomatology can be seen in different mental diseases. Most of the patients suffer from an affective disorder or from schizophrenia. Furthermore, the man‚Äìanimal metamorphosis can be seen after the intake of psychotropic substances including cannabinoids as well as alcohol abuse. Rarely, lycanthropy is reported in personality disorders. Case reports can be found concerning organic psychosyndromes, dementia and epilepsy. We&amp;#39;ll end with an article from the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, on two unusual case reports (G√∂decke-Koch et al., 2001):Case Report 1A 34-year old woman suffering from schizophrenia came to the emergency department. At first, she was mutistic; later she seemed agitated and tense. Suddenly, she started moving like a frog, jumping around, making frog-like noises, and showing her tongue as though in tend ing to catch a fly. We found out that she had taken part in a workshop about fairy tales prior to becoming symptomatic. An organic cause was excluded, and no drug intake was found.Case report 2A 24-year-old woman suffering from schizophrenia...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I say this because he actually managed to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2366"&gt;sit through an entire video full&lt;/a&gt; of the most bizarre pseudoscience and mangling of physics and medicine that I‚Äôve seen in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that‚Äôs saying a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, behold, &lt;a href="http://www.visiontherapysolutions.com"&gt;Dr. Charlene Werner&lt;/a&gt;, an optometrist (apparently) and a homeopath. I warn you, however. If you have any understanding of physics or chemistry whatsoever or if you‚Äôve ever read (and liked) Stephen Hawking‚Äôs book &lt;em&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/em&gt; (or anything else he‚Äôs ever written), sit down now. Take a deep breath. Heck, crack open a bottle of wine and down at least half of it before you watch this video. I‚Äôm serious. You‚Äôll need it. You might need to lie down, too. In fact, you might need to lie down with a cool washcloth across your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/C0c5yClip4o%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly, the woo doth flow. Like a river. Like the energy from a supernova. From Bozeman, Montana, where, apparently they don‚Äôt have enough woo and have to import it from Texas. I haven‚Äôt seen such a massive pseudoscientific abuse of physics and chemistry in quite a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like how Werner starts out by asking the audience if they‚Äôve all had chemistry or physics classes. Truly, if anyone there said yes and didn‚Äôt immediately see her talk for the hilariously rank pseudoscience that it is, he should demand his money back from whatever school or schools he attended. Either that, or he should go back for remedial physics classes; obviously whatever he or shelearned didn‚Äôt stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, Werner then asks everyone if they know what H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is and who Einstein is. Now, I know why a homeopath would mention water. After all, homeopathic remedies are nothing &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; water. But what did poor Albert Einstein do to deserve this posthumous desecration of his monumental contribution to physics? (I know, I know, what did &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; physicist do to deserve such abuse of science and his good name by homeopaths?) Get a load of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know that when light is energy, right? OK. And he [Einstein] gave us the theory that energy equals mass times the speed of light. E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. OK. If we take that formula, and we think that there‚Äôs a lot of mass, right? OK. If you collapse all the mass down into the universe, so that there is no space between the mass, do you know how much mass there is in the entire universe? You think you‚Äôre a lot of mass, right?‚Ä¶ Well, the whole universal mass can be consolidated down into the size of a bowling ball. That‚Äôs all there is in the whole universe. So, how much mass are you? That‚Äôs right, an infinitessimal amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet you‚Äôre wondering where Werner is going with this. So was I. But I was afraid. Very afraid. Yes, I wasn‚Äôt sure whether she was right about being able to collapse the entire mass of the universe into the size of a bowling ball. My memory of my physics doesn‚Äôt tell me if it‚Äôs a bowling ball, a softball, or something the size of a house. I get the point. The vast majority of matter is the empty space between atoms and between electrons and nuclei. For purposes of this discussion it doesn‚Äôt really matter, anyway. What matters is the mind-numbing ignorance of what Werner says next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you take that formula, E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, you can almost cross out mass. So the formula ends up being ‚Äúenergy = the speeed of light.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrrrghhhh! Help, help, I‚Äôm being made more scientifically stupid just by looking at this video! Talk about a math FAIL. First off, if you remove the mass term, what are you left with? Zero! No mass, no energy! Even if you could legitimately just drop the mass term as an approximation, you wouldn‚Äôt be left with ‚Äúenergy = the speed of light.‚Äù What happened to the squared term? Moreover, Werner completely misunderstands the nature of the equation. c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the proportionality constant for how much energy is present within a given mass. It‚Äôs a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; number, meaning that a small amount of mass contains a lot of energy, if that mass can be completely converted to energy. The point of the equation is not that mass is unimportant, rather that mass is very important indeed! That‚Äôs why I have a new equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
I = m&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; * c&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where I = ignorance; m&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; = the mass of the air necessary to speak a Werner sentence about science; and c = the speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs right. Werner‚Äôs ignorance could power the universe. (Yes, I know that the units don‚Äôt quite work out. Either that, or the units of ignorance are in fact  energy squared. Just go with me on this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets better. Look at what Werner says next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs why the visual system is so important, because we have lots of photorecptors that receive light. But when Hahnemann died, the scientists didn‚Äôt fall in his camp. OK. And, um, the pieces of the puzzle didn‚Äôt fit well together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the pieces of homeopathy never fit together when Samuel Hahnemann was alive. It was woo then, it‚Äôs woo now. The only difference is the science-y gloss that its practitioners try to put on it with quantum mechanics and mangling of physics and chemistry. But wait, there‚Äôs more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So God in his infinite wisdom sent us another Einstein called Stephen Hawkings. Stephen Hawkings gave us the string theory. And what he discovered is that there are other ‚Äúenergetic particles‚Äù in the universe, and they‚Äôre shaped like little U-eys, and what they do is they work by vibration. So our body is so wonderfully designed. We have light receivers, and we have ears. Vibratory‚Äìthey pick up vibration. So if we added to that theory‚ÄìEinstein‚Äôs theory of relativity, E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but mass is crossed out‚Äìand strings, vibration. But that still doesn‚Äôt tell us the whole picture, because what is a cell, right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, now stop right there. How much technobabble can one woman fit into a single talk? How much mangling of physics can one woman accomplish? Truly, I fear to know the answer. It was at this point that I started to wonder whether I should back out now. Just say no. Stop watching. the mind-destroying horror was too great. I could feel my neurons crying out in pain. But, no. The things I do for SBM! So I looked at what Werner said next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cell has a cell wall, a cell membrane, cytoplasm. Is that mass? Not very much, really. So what are they? You can break down the cells into tiny pieces of energy called electrons, protons, neutrons, right? So the whole body has an infinitessimal amount of mass, but what is the remainder? Energy. So, I am energy; you are energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll have to excuse me if I can‚Äôt follow that logic. Maybe it‚Äôs because I understand biology and a bit of physics! Come on! She completely misunderstands Einstein‚Äôs equations. The concept that the body is a small amount of mass does not mean that it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; energy. True, there‚Äôs a whole lot of energy in the body‚Äôs mass, but, unfortunatey, to turn that mass into all the energy described by Einstein‚Äôs classic equation would not be pleasant for the person whose energy was being‚Äìshall we say?‚Äìreleased. That doesn‚Äôt stop Werner‚Äôs monumental misunderstanding of physics from leading her to try to use this line of ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù to argue that homeopathy is real and scientifically supported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now if you go to study physics, we do not know how to create energy. But we don‚Äôt know how to destroy it, either. That is not humanly possible. So what we do is we take energy and we transform it from one state to another. That‚Äôs all we do. So if that‚Äôs all we do guess what the definition of disease is. It‚Äôs not mass. We have transformed our energy state into something different. That‚Äôs what the definition of disease is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a physician, I can most definitely say that Werner‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúdisease‚Äù is related to the real definition of disease only by her own delusions. Actually, it‚Äôs not related to the real definition of disease at all. What we‚Äôre really seeing is a form of primitive vitalism, where there is some sort of ‚Äúlife energy‚Äù that, when its flows are disordered, blocked, or otherwise messed with magically, then you have disease, all gussied up with  science-y sounding mish-mash of physics-y sounding psuedoscience. Let‚Äôs put it this way. Werner keeps using that word (energy). I do not think it means what she thinks it means. In any case, never mind those nasty microbes. After all, they‚Äôre just ‚Äúmass,‚Äù and they‚Äôre far less mass than a human body or even a single mammalian cell. It‚Äôs the same with those proteins whose function becomes disordered; that DNA that has abnormalities; or those cellular functions that go awry. All mass. So, by Werner‚Äôs logic, they must not be able to cause disease, or so it would seem. Instead, she thinks she can use light, sound, and homeopathy to fix these energy ‚Äúimbalances.‚Äù But what is homeopathy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, Werner is too happy to tell us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, so what is homeopathy? If nothing is really mass or an infinitessimal amount of it, and everything is energy, that means everything has a vibration to it. So what if I could encase some sort of energy for later use? So if I wanted to make a bomb and I took all these chemicals and I encased it in a bomb, and tonight my neighber let his dog poop in my yard literally, and I‚Äôm mad at that dog and my neighbor. I‚Äôm going to take this bomb and I‚Äôm going to get back at him. And I threw that bomb at his house, would he be happy about it? Because what happens now when that energy is released? It destroys something. It changes it‚Ä¶It changes its energetic state. Well, that‚Äôs what we can do with homeopathy. We take substances. And we put ‚Äòem in solution and we succuss it just like a bomb, we threw the bomb, to release its energy into this liquid. And then we take these little white pellets. We sprinkle them with that solution, and guess what we have just made? An energetic substance  to be used when we choose to use it. So, how homeopathy works is, whatever your disease process is, it‚Äôs an energetic change. And if I can find the remedy that matches your state and give it to you when we so choose, what can we do with your energy system? Transform it to a previous better state. That‚Äôs how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Werner is right about one thing. Homeopathy is kind of like a response to a dog pooping on your lawn. Not only is it a major stinker, but one could use homeopathy to clean off the residue of dog crap from the lawn, if you use enough of it. It is, after all, water. In case anyone doesn‚Äôt know what succussion is, too, it‚Äôs what homeopaths do with their remedies between each step on the way of diluting them into nonexistence. Basically, it‚Äôs vigorous shaking. Hahnemann used to do it by smacking the vial containing his concoction against a Bible; modern day homeopaths have machines that do it. Whatever method they use, though, since Hahnemann‚Äôs time, the way homepaths prepare their remedies is that they dilute them 1:100, succuss them, dilute them 1:100 again, and so on and so forth for however many ‚ÄúC‚Äù the remedy is ultimately to be. If the remedy is a typical 30C remedy, that‚Äôs 30 dilutions of 1:100, or a total dilution of 10&lt;sup&gt;-60&lt;/sup&gt;, or roughly 36 to 37 orders of magnitude greater than Avagadro‚Äôs number, which guarantees that there almost certainly isn‚Äôt a single molecule left of the substance used for the homeopathy remedy. Of course, in general, it‚Äôs not a good idea to succuss bomb components. Bombmakers who do that tend to lose body parts or the physical integrity of their entire body. Now, &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;‚Äôs some vibration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had picked up my brain off the floor, its having oozed out of my ears as I watched this, and forced it back into my skull, I wondered just who Charlene Werner is. Apparently, in addition to homeopathy, she is a practitioner of a therapy that I‚Äôve never heard of, namely behavioral or developmental optometry. If you wnat a flavor of what developmental optometry is, I‚Äôll refer you to Dr. Werner‚Äôs own website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a holistic based optometric practice dedicated to the highest quliaty vision care for your entire family. We believe that 70% of how you physically function is through the vision system. Therefore, when the vision system is improved or enhanced it also increases overall physical wellness and performance. Don‚Äôt take our word for it ‚Ä¶ ask our patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;70% of how we physically function is due to our vision? Where did that number come from? Why not 100%? I do understand one thing that puzzled me before. Remember how at the very beginning she mentioned how our eyes can see light and vibration? Obviously, she was combining the woo that is homeopathy with her other favored treatment modalities, which‚Äìsurprise, surprise‚Äì&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19154276?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_SingleItemSupl.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=5&amp;amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;do not appear to be evidence-based&lt;/a&gt;, as Steve pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case Werner‚Äôs website emphasizes testimonials over science and is full of claims that ‚Äúbehavioral optometry‚Äù can treat &lt;a href="http://www.visiontherapystories.org/add_adhd_drug_free.html"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, dyslexia, and a wide variety of other conditions. Indeed, it can even &lt;a href="http://www.visiontherapystories.org/vision_autism.html"&gt;treat problems associated with autism&lt;/a&gt;! Now, I know that it could be very difficult to do a vision evaluation in an autistic child and that correcting poor vision is a good thing in any child, but the results reported on Dr. Werner‚Äôs website seem rather more glowing than seems plausible. Be that as it may, why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; treat autism with ‚Äúvisual therapy‚Äù? Dubious practitioners of all stripes have tried everything else. No doubt Werner combines homeopathy with visual therapy to produce a one-two punch of woo. All she needs is chelation therapy to complete the triad. In any case, if vision is 70% of our ‚Äúphysical functioning,‚Äù then what can‚Äôt it help? Of course, I do notice a disconnect between Werner‚Äôs claims that we are ‚Äúall energy‚Äù and ‚Äúinfinitesimal mass,‚Äù then why does she even care about the physical functioning of everything in our bodies? Just make one of those homeopathic energy bombs and fix whatever‚Äôs ailing the patient! We‚Äôre all energy, anyway, and disease is energy. Isn‚Äôt that what Werner just told us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really sad thing about the video above is that it‚Äôs not the worst of arguments that homeopaths make. (For that, you need Dana Ullman.) Rather, Werner‚Äôs arguments for homeopathy are pretty much standard fare, although they are not nearly as entertaining as those of, say, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_circle_is_co_1.php"&gt;Lionel Milgrom&lt;/a&gt;. What they do show is a perfect case of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/06/crank_magnetism_1.php"&gt;crank magnetism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just don‚Äôt let your dog poop on Werner‚Äôs lawn. You might find yourself at the receiving end of a homeopathic energetic bomb, and you know that the more she dilutes it the stronger it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

The video shown here is from 2007, but it's been making the rounds again. It shows a skateboarder attempting what I assume is a moderately difficult move, and failing a few times before finally suceeding. Uri Geller is on scene, and it's hard to tell if he's helping the lad or merely getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this clip, we've learned that Geller believes he has a magic Sharpie, the ability to lubricate wheels, and the power to remove negative influences from concrete. Apparently, these powers aren't working all that well, because it takes him several tries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the skater in the clip... especially his eyes. What are they saying? It looks to me like they're saying "Who is this clown, and how can I get rid of him?"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/images/McGregor_Museum_Kimberley.jpg" alt="An Image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The McGregor Museum is a complex building with several wings surrounding an inner court yard, a multi-layered roof, balconies everywhere, and numerous trees in the court yard close in to the building. So, a cat can spend the heat of the day in the shaded crown of a tree, and the cool of the evening up on the building's sun-warmed metal roof.  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
~~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/images/Ghostly_Stairway_In_McGregor_Mueum_Kimberly.jpg" alt="An Image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The interior of the McGregor museum houses numerious exhibits.  The old period rooms and hallways focus on the late 19th century, and other newer areas (not shown) have an excellent set of exhibits on archaeology, human evolution, and "San" rock art.  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
~~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/images/Defending_Kimberley_Diorama.jpg" alt="An Image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Defending Kimberly.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/images/Ghostly_Gatling_Gun_McGregor_Museum_Kimberly.jpg" alt="An Image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The Gatling Gun. (A Gatling gun is an old fashioned machine gun.)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A visitor to the museum checking for ghosts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Possible "San" burial ... which turned out to have no physical remains.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/images/Looking_4_burial_all_we_got_was_this_scorpion.jpg" alt="An Image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Although no artifacts of note or bones were found in the burial, there were plenty of these.  The scorpions were in a state of torpor, as it was winter.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Los Angeles Police Department wants to stop working with the organization that runs its Explorer program for youths because the group is linked to Boy Scouts of America, which bans gays from becoming members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization, Learning for Life, was spun off from Boy Scouts of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A department official told the Police Commission Tuesday that the Boy Scouts policy is ‚Äúinconsistent‚Äù with the city‚Äôs policy of non-discrimination. He suggested that the department manages the Explorer program itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning for Life officials say the organization does not discriminate and does not take funds from the Boy Scouts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ban atheists, too, even though that‚Äôs not mentioned in the piece above.  And that that last comment from Learning for Life officials skews the truth.  There may be no funding from the Boy Scouts directly, but there is definitely a connection with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert M. Saltzman&lt;/strong&gt; supports the LAPD decision and explains &lt;a href="http://www.laobserved.com/visiting/2009/10/robert_m_saltzman_is_a.php"&gt;why it‚Äôs the right thing to do&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, there is one significant problem with the Explorer Program. In Los Angeles, the Explorer Programs are administered by a city contractor that in turn subcontracts with the Boy Scouts to administer the programs. The problem is that the Boy Scouts openly proclaim their right to discriminate based on sexual orientation and religion. &lt;strong&gt;I know first-hand the significant value of the Explorers Programs to the LAPD and for the young men and women who participate. But no matter how valuable the programs, that value is no justification for them to be administered by an agency that does not comply with the city‚Äôs non-discrimination laws.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an easy issue for the Boy Scouts to fix.  Just revoke any policy that forbids gays and atheists from joining and leading the troops.  That means changing their &lt;a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/Media/mission.aspx"&gt;Oath and Law&lt;/a&gt;.  It should‚Äôve happened a long time ago, but it‚Äôs not to late to fix their misguided ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until they do, however (and I‚Äôm not holding my breath), they should be constantly referred to as a discriminatory group and government organizations should refuse to work with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual parents would be well-served not to let their children join such a group, either.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I took a few hours to go back in time and see up close and personal an era where death and the hereafter had an integrity and tradition that barely exists in¬†my celebrity drenched¬†neighborhood¬†of Hollywood. I left behind the moral nihilism of Los Angeles for a beautiful afternoon of walking through the fall leaves on a time-warped¬†cul-de-sac that has been relocated and restored from the crowded vistas of downtown and moved onto a few square blocks of peace and reverence. It was a grand Halloween muse that managed to steer far clear of the manipulative world of¬†Universal Studio¬†monsters and crass commercialization.¬†Entering the mansions¬†At Heritage Square¬†offered precious moments to¬†view a time when death was celebrated¬†with somber dignity with displays of¬†¬†velvet shrouds, sheaves of wheat, black bordered visiting cards and jewelry made¬†with human hair. The Victorian funeral was in full bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:260px"&gt;&lt;img title="250px-A_Stop_at_Willoughby" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/250px-A_Stop_at_Willoughby.jpg" alt="James Daly in &amp;quot;A Stop at Willoughby&amp;quot;" width="250" height="188"&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Daly in &amp;quot;A Stop at Willoughby&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was the Victorian era a¬†time of bizarre superstitions and strange religious beliefs? Absolutely. But I‚Äôm not sure I wouldn‚Äôt trade in my tired skateboard tee shirts for a black frock coat any day if I thought I could stay in the quiet comfort of that¬†era for more than one afternoon. Heritage Square‚Äôs¬†once a year &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúMourning Tour‚Äù &lt;/em&gt;gives the weary¬†Angeleno a chance to peel back the smog and industrial haze that usually permeates the city and enter into a world of penny-farthing high wheel bicycles and derby hats. I felt like; ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Gart Williams,¬† a man protected by a suit of armor all held together by one bolt‚Äù &lt;/em&gt;in the classic Twilight Zone episode, &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúA Stop at Willoughby.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; Rod Serling certainly understood a¬†‚Äù&amp;quot;peaceful, restful place, where a man can slow down to a walk and live his life full measure.‚Äù I needed that stop at Willoughby. It is at times like these that I think I was born in the totally wrong century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="C05CAVM8HHICAF30UM0CADO6E9HCAYXCYITCA28ZZ0JCA3DUCGWCAIB7ILVCAINFIC6CA5H32TZCAB7R1VMCA7SL9JNCAQI8AARCATETG6NCAYBEJ2NCAC2GFEMCAILWZNLCA1CYT01CAI7K9Q1CA3H8RE3" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/C05CAVM8HHICAF30UM0CADO6E9HCAYXCYITCA28ZZ0JCA3DUCGWCAIB7ILVCAINFIC6CA5H32TZCAB7R1VMCA7SL9JNCAQI8AARCATETG6NCAYBEJ2NCAC2GFEMCAILWZNLCA1CYT01CAI7K9Q1CA3H8RE3.jpg" alt="C05CAVM8HHICAF30UM0CADO6E9HCAYXCYITCA28ZZ0JCA3DUCGWCAIB7ILVCAINFIC6CA5H32TZCAB7R1VMCA7SL9JNCAQI8AARCATETG6NCAYBEJ2NCAC2GFEMCAILWZNLCA1CYT01CAI7K9Q1CA3H8RE3" width="124" height="99"&gt;Such places stand a good chance of¬†feeling ¬†decidedly ‚Äúhaunted.‚Äù Especially¬†on Halloween evenings when¬†shadows¬†lengthen,¬†the light fades early¬†and the wind kicks up dust devils of fall leaves. After all, what is ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù anyway? Is it a feeling? Is it an emotion? Is it a vision? Maybe it is a combination of all these things that creates a mood of melencholy and longing for something distant inside of us that we can‚Äôt see, hear or touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heritage Square‚Äôs unique bygone cityscape¬†isn‚Äôt haunted by Sylvia Browne style spooks, con artist mediums¬†and faked-up ‚Äúreal‚Äù paranormal scenarios¬†like in the latest movie creepfest, &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúParanormal Activity.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; No way. Heritage Square¬†captures a need for past simplicity and nostalgia.¬†¬†The perspective on life you feel when you walk through the stone gate still¬†fits¬†our¬†time like a comfortable silk glove and top hat. Plus, the somber etiquette of a Victorian funeral reconstruction expresses a rare chance to see where the line between superstition and culrtural customs intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:464px"&gt;&lt;img title="3336007033_6f9d97603a" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/3336007033_6f9d97603a.jpg" alt="The Perry Mansion" width="454" height="500"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Perry Mansion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside Perry Mansion, the main living room was decked out for the funeral of Judge Stephen Hubble. The servents had their own special mourning room and their own rules to follow. In a home like the Perry‚Äôs that was usually far away from a hospital or mortuary, funerals were held right in the parlor. Portraits and anything that would be normally a happy sight in the home were draped in heavy velvet and brocade. This is my kind of joint. It was bad luck to take the coffin out of the house through the¬†front door, so a special indentation was built under Victorian staircases to allow¬†coffins to be turned on end and taken out the back door through the kitchen. Was this really bad luck or just a matter of bad taste? Imagine seeing your neighbor come sliding out his front door on a quiet evening. It just wasn‚Äôt done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, a¬†clock was stopped at the¬†dear departed‚Äôs¬†time of death and ensconced in the the living room as people came and went from where the corpse was lying in state. Periods of mourning were strictly adhered to with the most stringent¬†timetables. It was taken for granted that families were expected to stay within the confines of these matters of etiquette that had little or nothing to do with relgious backgrounds or national origin. Wearing black was mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;

Spiritualism was in its heyday and had not yet been scientifically challenged. Conversing with spirits or having a gypsy sit in for a session was a novelty and was considered part of the customary festivities.¬†Back before it became a serious buisness,¬†the occasional seance or sitting¬†provided ‚Äúlight entertainment‚Äù for the high society folks who had the time and money to spend on what was then ‚Äúall the rage.‚Äù The modern equivelent would be a DJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img title="846779579_e6fa37a2ef" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/846779579_e6fa37a2ef1-225x150.jpg" alt="The Hale House" width="225" height="150"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hale House&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this day inside the Hale House parlor,¬†Madame Ventroza¬†was¬†on hand to add that special touch of palm or tarot card readings. In the dark wood paneled and book-lined living room, she looked resplendent in her shawls and beads. The line to talk¬†with her was long and anxious. ¬†I felt immediately at home. Additionally, visitors were invited to learn about the art of jewelry making with hair; momento mori, as well as talk with two gentlemen in period costume demonstrating spirit photography to the curious. Down the block inside the Shaw House, the prevailing culture of Los Angeles was¬†on display with a Dia De Los Muertos , or Day of the Dead celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the street my favorite among The Painted Ladies; The Ford House, stood silent and locked up. Not as ostentatious or grand as the other homes,¬†it still evoked a strong sense of history. Peering through the dusty window panes showed just how haunted a place like this can be. Long pieces of peeling Victorian wallpapar and a crumbling staircase paid solemn testimony to¬†an era¬†when homes were much smaller than today‚Äôs sprawling tract homes, but had so much more character even when in¬†shambles.¬†It remains un-restored and looked ominously like Norman Bates‚Äô mother could come rushing up from the basement at any moment. In fact, the real model for the Universal ‚ÄúPsycho House‚Äù in Hitchcock‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúPsycho‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; (1960) once stood here in Heritage Square after it was rescued from its previous roost on Bunker Hill in downtown Los Angeles. To add more mystery to that story, it burned down soon after it was moved to Heritage Square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:170px"&gt;&lt;img title="P4240393_-_Shaw" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/P4240393_-_Shaw.jpg" alt="The Shaw House" width="160" height="119"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shaw House&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1850‚Äôs may have been a simpler time, but there was no shortage of woo for the rich and well-to-do. It‚Äôs the same today, except that mediums have to wait their own period of mourning before they descend on the bereaved. I wouldn‚Äôt call it mourning though. More like waiting just enough time to wait for the obituary to hit the papers or the corpse to cool down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no respect for our dead these days. Once¬†we die, unless¬†we pre-planned a funeral far in advance to spare our children all the grief and hassle, we are likely to find ourselves cremated as the quickest and cheapest way to dispose of the body- and the bothersome distraction on¬†everyone‚Äôs valuable time. Spending too much time or cash fretting over a loved one these days could take away from a tennis lesson or gym time. I‚Äôm not saying this is always the case and don‚Äôt mean to sound too cynical here. We still go to wakes and funeral parties to honor our dead. But it‚Äôs not like back in the 1850‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:104px"&gt;&lt;img title="YJBCARXGJTVCAN96BU4CAAEHY6SCAR88Z13CA2XALL9CAENHVCWCA99IN7KCAI45M3TCAPGGNGKCA6968F2CAAQ2XH3CALY3OH6CAP936URCA7I9MVSCAHOXCRJCA635HBICAKQATYBCAXFZF21CAHAB18N" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/YJBCARXGJTVCAN96BU4CAAEHY6SCAR88Z13CA2XALL9CAENHVCWCA99IN7KCAI45M3TCAPGGNGKCA6968F2CAAQ2XH3CALY3OH6CAP936URCA7I9MVSCAHOXCRJCA635HBICAKQATYBCAXFZF21CAHAB18N.jpg" alt="Jacko&amp;#39;s Last Ride" width="94" height="94"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacko&amp;#39;s Last Ride&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are exceptions. We have only to look at Michael Jackson‚Äôs lavish funeral to see that when there is big money involved, money gets spent ‚Äì and made. Paris Hilton weeped, Macauley, Liz Taylor, Chris Tucker and Corey Feldman ‚Äì they all mourned in their own way. Gladys Knight performed the hymn ‚ÄúOur Father‚Äù (The Lord‚Äôs Prayer) and moved many to tears. Classy huh? Michael‚Äôs entombment ended months of speculation that the singer‚Äôs body would be buried at Neverland Ranch, in part to make the property a Graceland-style attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manners and the superstitions that grow out of¬†earlier¬†customs¬†may¬†change and become streamlined with time, but I miss the old school ways. The Victorians took the time to feel a depth of bereavement and grief that might seem timid by comparison to today‚Äôs extravaganzas and excess, but it got the job done with class and integrity. In light of today‚Äôs media crush of reporters and film crews kept¬†behind barricades, such customs may seem silly and quaint. I don‚Äôt feel that way. To my way of thinking, that‚Äôs the difference between a level of security and secrecy about the location of Jackson‚Äôs vault guaranteeing it will¬†be turned into a shrine or tourist stop and just sitting in the shade of a quiet picnic on the lawn.

These activities include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sex with demons&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Orgies between animals and humans&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Animal and human sacrifices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sacrificing babies to shed innocent blood&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Rape and molestation of adults, children and babies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Revel nights&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Conjuring of demons and casting of spells&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Release of "time-released" curses against the innocent and the ignorant."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the words of Christian Writer Kimberly Daniels, in a piece produced for the Christian Broadcasting Network (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_thought_it_was_just_razor_bl.php"&gt;hat tip: Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;).  She warns that most of the Holloween candy we would encounter trick-or-treating has been prayed over and cursed by Witches.  Most!  I would have thought only some, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clear evidence of the insanity of those Krazy Kristians.  I mean, really. I have yet to hear a Christian disavow this.  I have to assume they all believe it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, his outline: 1) development and differential entrenchment in evolution. 2) application of these principles to culture. 3) what new phenomena this theory can capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plunges into "thick, thin, and medium viscosity theories of culture". I have no idea what he's talking about: I hope he'll get into some specifics I can grapple with soon, because right now this is just a wall of words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any evolving system must meet Darwin's principles: variation, which is heritable, which has consequences on fitness. Wimsatt suggests two additional principles: structures generated over time have a developmental history, and they have parts which have larger or more pervasive effects than others on that production. Wimsatt says that life cycles emerge from these principles, and illustrates it with some strange models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give up. I have no idea where this talk is going. I keep waiting for an empirical foundation to be dragged in from offstage, but it's just not happening. He seems to be saying some interesting stuff (or stuff that &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be interesting), but it all seems to be built on air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think I could ever be a philosopher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/william_wimsattwhy_development.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/KDimNIkB718" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257026902397"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/hopi_hoekstrathe_causes_of_evo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/03575054326133be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Hopi Hoekstra‚ÄîThe Causes of Evolutionary Change: What Darwin Did and Didn&amp;#39;t Know</title><published>2009-10-31T21:14:45Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T21:14:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/akImc9WbB78/hopi_hoekstrathe_causes_of_evo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/hopi_hoekstrathe_causes_of_evo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Darwin didn't know the basic mechanisms of evolutionary change. Mechanism of inheritance was a black box. Darwin's last publication before his death was "on the dispersal of bivalves". Why are freshwater bivalves so homogeneous in morphology? Describes a beetle with a conch attached to its leg, which provided a mechanism of dispersal. Turns out the specimen was sent to Darwin by Crick's grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is variation generated and maintained in natural populations? What genes matter? What will finding the genes tell us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find genes underlying phenotypic diversity by comparison of highly divergent taxa (flies vs. mice, for instance), or the study of variation within species. Latter gives us the opportunity to use genetics, also allows us to know something about the environmental context that drives the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks for phenotypic differences in the wild that contribute to fitness, then works out the genetics and development to see how it works. Hoekstra looks at color, the genetics of mammalian pigmentation in &lt;i&gt;Peromyscus&lt;/i&gt;. These mice show lots of variation in color. The oldfield mouse of the American south lives in abandoned fields and on beaches. Beach sand is white, with low levels of vegetation, which means they are subject to high levels of predation.  They wanted to document the selective advantage of light pigmentation on the beach environment, so made model mice out of clay with different colors,. and measured predation on the models.  Color matters, and dark models were attacked preferentially on light sand, light models attacked in dark environments. 50% more likely to survive if your color matches your background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made crosses of dark and light genes and used QTL analysis to search for candidate genes. Found 3 genes correlated with the color patterns seen in &lt;i&gt;Peromyscus&lt;/i&gt;, Mc1r, Agouti, and Corin. Mc1r is a g-coupled receptor with many mutations scattered throughout the gene. One difference is found between light and dark mice: changing one amino acid reduces the activity of the gene product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mc1r is the receptor; agouti is a repressor of mc1r; and Corin is an upstream regulator of agouti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looked at populations in the wild. Do populations on the gulf coast have the same mutation as atlantic coast mice? No ‚Äî atlantic mice do not have the same mutation im mc1r, and no significant mutations were found in the atlantic mc1r.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going even further afield, mc1r was sequenced in mammoths, and the same mutation found in light mice was found in mammoths; were mammoths polymorphic in coat color?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do these genes tell us? 1) how many and and what are the effect sizes of genes that contribute to adaptive phenotypes? A few genes can have a large affect. 2) Do adaptive alleles tend to be dominant or recessive? Adaptive alleles are rarely completely recessive. 3) What is the relative role of epistasis versus additivity? Epistasis is very important. 4) Are the same genes responsible for convergent phenotypes? sometimes, but not the case within beach mice. 5)Are adaptive mutations in protein-coding or cis-regulatory regions? Both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/hopi_hoekstrathe_causes_of_evo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/akImc9WbB78" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257024873090"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/a_true_ghost_story_part_6_but.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb507e777ba5dcec</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">A True Ghost Story, Part 6: But first, since we're talking geology ...</title><published>2009-10-31T21:29:32Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T21:29:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/CCS4hm3M51s/a_true_ghost_story_part_6_but.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/a_true_ghost_story_part_6_but.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since we are talking about geology, I do not want to give up the opportunity to bring up one of the coolest stories of geology ever, given the present day discussion of science and religion.

I'm curious to see whether he annoys or enlightens. It could go either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's not going to talk about evo-devo! OK, I'm already annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criticizes the infamous New Scientist cover, "Darwin Was Wrong"; received email from Paul Nelson (boo) claiming the edifice of darwinism is crumbling; Rudy Raff has written that evolution requires development to remain relevant. Are today's evolutionists genuinely Darwinian or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans to pick on something that was self-consciously in Darwin's thinking. Darwin became an evolutionist in 1837 while analyzing the specimens he had collected on his voyage; he became a Darwinian in 1838 when he realized the mechanism of adaptive change, natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Whewell was a major influence. Whewell tried to define good science: identifying a true cause, which is a hypothesis that explains the evidence. Darwin doesn't see evolution at work, but the evidence is marshalled to point to the hypothesis. He's not doing the original research, but picking it up and putting it together in a new and powerful way. Fossils, biogeography, homology, embryology, etc. all were assembled to support his theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did Darwin trigger a paradigm shift? Huxley didn't appreciate natural selection at all. It took the rediscovery of Mendel, popgen, etc. to bring about a major appreciation of the theory.  Further revision with the synthetic theory that incorporated molecular biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positively reviewed Dawkins' latest book, and Dawkins is contemptuous of eyewitness testimony, but says the theory demands respect because of the volume of evidence, which is clearly in the spirit of Darwin and Whewell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EO Wilson's work on ants show the amazing specialization of castes in particular distributions. This is material Darwin never considered, but Wilson is using the tools of evolutionary biology to explain his hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-Cambrian was terra-incognito to Darwin; he had many ad hoc hypotheses to explain why we don't have specimens from that era. Modern explanations do a better job of fitting the pre-Cambrian into a Darwinian framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know much more about human evolution, extinction, geographical distributions (plate tectonics) than Darwin did, but these are still thoroughly explained by Darwin's ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hox genes show deep homology between flies and humans, also interpreted in a Darwinian context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draws an analogy with the Volkswagen, which was completely different between the 40s and modern day, with no parts that are identical, and yet it is obviously linked. We will still be celebrating Darwin 100 years from now because we will still be using his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, not bad, not too annoying. Needed more evo-devo. Philosophers sure do talk a lot; this talk was definitely not as information-dense as the biology sessions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/michael_ruseis_darwinism_past.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-vZT3u9WIA4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257021790393"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/neil_shubinmajor_transitions_i.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/42508b717a217cf2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Neil Shubin‚Äî‚ÄúMajor Transitions‚Äù in Evolution: Fossils, Genes, and Embryos</title><published>2009-10-31T19:18:01Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T19:18:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/DcIpAtrGLMo/neil_shubinmajor_transitions_i.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/neil_shubinmajor_transitions_i.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shubin had a tough act to follow, coming after Kingsley&amp;#39;s great talk. I&amp;#39;m sure it will be good, though ‚Äî last night I got a tour of his lab, saw the original Tiktaalik specimens and some new ones, and some of his work in progress (which I won&amp;#39;t tell you about until it&amp;#39;s published), so I&amp;#39;m confident I&amp;#39;m going to have a happy hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin pulled together diverse lines of evidence to document his ideas. The different lines all reinforce each other making the argument even stronger, and what we're seeing now is new syntheses, which is the theme of this talk: how do we use different lines of evidence to make a case that is more the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions is the origin of limbs, fins to legs. Fins and legs look very different, with fins having rays and many bones, while legs have few bones in a fixed pattern. Intermediate taxa show us the changes, with transitions with bony core of the limb pattern and fish-like rays. He uses geology and extant fossils to make predictions about where to find intermediates, and paleontology also informs his understanding of developmental processes that build the limb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Began his work in Pennsylvania, which was like the Amazon delta 360 million years ago. They followed the PA dept. of transportation around looking at road cuts that exposed the rocks of that age. They found many fossils, but one that changed his thinking was a fin of sauripterus, with fin rays and a core of tetrapod-like limbs. Definitely fishy, but contained precursors to the pattern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They searched in Ellesmere Island for Devonian age rocks and fossils that would reveal the history of the limb. The logistics were very difficult, since the area is inaccessible. First started working in 1999, in rocks that were from marine sources and didn't yield much. Moved east to freshwater sources. Found a layer of rock that was rich in bone, and found a snout of a flat-headed fish poking out. Eventually exposed about 20 specimens of this animal. Took months to fully expose the details of the specimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He showed off a cast of Tiktaalik ‚Äî physical objects are really good at capturing people&amp;#39;s imagination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a year and a half to prepare out the fins; the bones show articular surfaces, so you can actually see how the structure bent in life. What does this tell us about extant fins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tetrapod limb has 3 components: 1 bone, then 2 bones, then multiple bones in wrist and fingers. The limb forms in phases, with an early phase of hox expression that sets up the proximal bone, then phase II in which hox genes switch on in a patterned way to form digits. Are there elements of phase 2 in fish fins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looked in &lt;i&gt;Polyodon&lt;/i&gt;, and embryos do have a distal phase of hox expression, not identical to tetrapod pattern, but definitely a phase 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a limb and how did it develop? The AER sets up the proximo-distal axis, ZPA sets up anteriorposterior axis. Cutting off the AER at different stages produces progressive deletions of portions of the limb. ZPA is a source of Sonic Hedgehog and sets up a gradient of positional information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the common ancestor of all fish have these same two-axis signals? Chondrichthyans do, with patterns that can be manipulated in the same way as we do in chickens. The appendage patterning system is general to all vertebrate appendages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do fins differ from other outgrowths? Branchial arches have the same patterning, with an AER and ZPA.  Seems to be a universal way for vertebrates to set up the patterning of outgrowths. Gill, fin, and limb have similar toolkits of patterning genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patterning mechanisms may have originated in a general outgrowth and been coopted for limbs and gills.  Shubin proposes to do targeted collecting of Ordovician vertebrates, expecting to find novel non-limb outgrowths that may be precursors to the patterning mechanism. Paleontology guided by developmental biology!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/neil_shubinmajor_transitions_i.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/DcIpAtrGLMo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257019646080"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=17813">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2e2f8270f3d5ff5d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Asheville, NC Atheist Runs for City Council Seat; Opponents Use His Beliefs Against Him</title><published>2009-10-31T19:58:06Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T19:58:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/31/asheville-nc-atheist-runs-for-city-council-seat-opponents-use-his-beliefs-against-him/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There will come a point where so many atheist candidates are running for public office that we won‚Äôt be able to keep up with all of them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cecil Bothwell&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091029/NEWS01/910290314"&gt;running for a seat on the City Council&lt;/a&gt; in Asheville, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://cecilbothwell.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/candidatebizcard.jpg?w=225&amp;amp;h=300"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://cecilbothwell.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/candidatebizcard.jpg?w=225&amp;amp;h=300" title="Bothwell" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He‚Äôs described as a ‚Äúwriter, environmentalist, builder, war protestor, gadfly‚Äù‚Ä¶ and atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As a journalist, Bothwell often focused on former Buncombe County Sheriff Bobby Medford, and takes much credit for Medford‚Äôs prosecution as part of an illegal gambling ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writings on Medford led to death threats, Bothwell said, and the stuff of one book. In another book, ‚ÄúThe Prince of War,‚Äù he targets Graham, saying the world-famous evangelist from Montreat was using access to U.S. presidents to push a theocratic agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bothwell‚Äôs political opponents fired back with a mailed-out flier pointing to statements Bothwell made about his own atheism. Bothwell said they‚Äôre not wrong. His spiritual beliefs focus on ‚Äúthe golden rule‚Äù as opposed to a deity, he said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the mailer, he said it‚Äôs helped book sales. ‚ÄúMy campaign is offering either of the two books‚Ä¶for a donation of 25 bucks. We‚Äôre throwing the books at them.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What ‚Äúmailed-out flier‚Äù are they talking about?  Check it out ‚Äî it‚Äôs fantastic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Bothwell‚Äôs own writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
‚ÄúI suppose that I should also acknowledge that I will find myself labeled as Satan‚Äôs helper, instrument, vehicle and a whole lot more upon publication of this work.  So, for the record, I don‚Äôt believe in supernatural beings of any stripe‚Ä¶ It seems to me that belief in gods has caused a whole lot more problems than it has solved‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt believe in any of the religious stories of the origin of the universe and I don‚Äôt look to priests for my moral answers.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That attack mailer was paid for out by ‚ÄúCommon Sense in government, Cecil Cantrell, Treasurer.‚Äù  I‚Äôm not sure who that is, but the &lt;a href="http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091022/OPINION02/91021048&amp;amp;template=printart"&gt;mailer&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200991022037"&gt;backfiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it ends with this lovely quotation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need levelheaded common sense leaders on city council, not a radical extremist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why we should be supporting atheist candidates who have a strong, progressive agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know whether Bothwell is the best candidate or not in this race, but a look at &lt;a href="http://cecilbothwell.wordpress.com/why-vote-for-cecil/"&gt;his platform&lt;/a&gt; suggests he is a levelheaded, common sense sort of guy.  I wouldn‚Äôt vote for him &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; because of his atheism, but you have to admire any atheist who is willing to run for public office without shying away from that label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bothwell‚Äôs response about following the ‚ÄúGolden Rule‚Äù is precisely what we ought to be hearing from future atheist candidates ‚Äî not a denial of their atheism, but the idea that they can indeed be good without a god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not too late to &lt;a href="http://cecilbothwell.wordpress.com/your-issues/"&gt;donate to his campaign&lt;/a&gt;.  The election is only days away‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

Handley and asking her readers to also post their opinions on Handley&amp;#39;s anti-vaccine stance and his misogyny.¬†&lt;/a&gt; Scroll down to the bottom for the list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Paul Smalera at True/Slant links here.¬† See link below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: On November 5, Mr. Handley returned to the attack at the Age of Autism blog.¬† See link below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very long version follows: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I&amp;#39;ve found several more reactions, pro and con, and have added them without comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 19, Wired Magazine published &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience"&gt; An Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us All&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.amy-wallace.com/"&gt;Amy Wallace&lt;/a&gt;. Rational, pro-science bloggers were congratulatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccination groups did not like the article at all.¬† See for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, Mr. Handley sent an even-more odious copy of his October 21 essay to Ms. Wallace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;J.B. Handley, the founder of Generation Rescue, the anti-vaccine group that actress Jenny McCarthy helps promote, sent an essay titled, ‚ÄúPaul Offit Rapes (intellectually) Amy Wallace and Wired Magazine.‚Äù In it, he implied that Offit had slipped me a date rape drug. ‚ÄúThe roofie cocktails at Paul Offit‚Äôs house must be damn good,‚Äù he wrote. Later, he sent a revised version that omitted rape and replaced it with the image of me drinking Offit‚Äôs Kool-aid. That one was later posted at the anti-vaccine blog Age of Autism. &lt;em&gt;link &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/yl7ywec"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/yl7ywec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wired Magazine published some reader reactions to the piece&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/readers-respond-part3/"&gt;Part III&lt;/a&gt; (on responses from people with autism)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Amy Wallace doesn&amp;#39;t have a blog, but twitters at &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/msamywallace"&gt;@msamywallace.&lt;/a&gt; Australian blogger &lt;a href="http://bastardsheep.com/about/"&gt;BastardSheep&lt;/a&gt; has collated Ms. Wallace&amp;#39;s tweets:¬† &lt;a href="http://bastardsheep.com/2009/10/27/a-reaction-to-factual-stories-on-vaccination/"&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://bastardsheep.com/2009/10/28/a-reaction-to-factual-stories-on-vaccination-part-2/"&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://bastardsheep.com/2009/10/29/a-reaction-to-factual-stories-on-vaccination-part-3/"&gt;Part III &lt;/a&gt;| &lt;a href="http://bastardsheep.com/2009/10/30/a-reaction-to-factual-stories-on-vaccination-part-4-2/"&gt;Part IV&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://bastardsheep.com/2009/10/31/a-reaction-to-factual-stories-on-vaccination-part-5/"&gt;Part V &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 123rd Meeting of the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com"&gt;Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt; is fast approaching. This time around it will be here on Thursday, November 5. That means skeptical bloggers out there don't have much time to get their best recent work to Colin at &lt;a href="http://www.blue-genes.net"&gt;Blue Genes&lt;/a&gt; for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guidelines for what we're looking for when it comes to submissions to the Skeptics' Circle can be found &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I have threatened his life if he begins to try on my underpants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I started writing this, I asked him if there was something I could help him pick out and he said, "Well, I am just looking for a dress. But nothing too slutty. I am trying to be the bearded &lt;i&gt;lady&lt;/i&gt;. Not the bearded whore."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells me two things...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Mr. Isis has some opinions of my wardrobe he has clearly never shared with me before.&lt;br&gt;2) I still have some feminist educating to do under my own roof. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/halloween_addendum.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/X_juJV3--js" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257018457227"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/an_open_letter_22.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/845ccf3418673183</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Open Letter"/><title type="html">An Open Letter...</title><published>2009-10-31T18:58:57Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T18:58:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/vbT-5bsU6Ik/an_open_letter_22.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/an_open_letter_22.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;...to my laundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that every day when I leave home you all emerge from the hamper and get down. The product of your daytime boot-knocking is little baby dirty clothes that grow up into big dirty clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

We‚Äôd put on our costumes, over our long underwear, of course, and set out into the cold (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_Blizzard"&gt;and sometimes snow&lt;/a&gt;) with pillowcases in hand for our annual candy procurement mission.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our neighborhood had been built up gradually over time, and was bookended by two old farmhouses, both of which were considered ‚Äúscary houses‚Äù by us kids.  A single old man resided in the one at the point where our road intersected with the main highway, and despite his resemblance to Santa Claus and apparent friendliness, we all thought he was creepy.  There were rumors about razor blades in the caramel apples he handed out to trick-or-treaters, and his garage was purple with broken windows, so we mostly stayed away, or, when we felt daring, ringing the doorbell on Halloween with the express purpose of trying to get a glimpse inside.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the road, down the hill and near my mom‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs cow pasture, was an imposing brick house with a very long stairwell up from the road to the front door.  We didn‚Äôt know anything about the people that lived there, and they had a couple of dogs that would bark and charge at anyone who approached the house.  One year, I remember doing it on a dare.  I started up the steps, trying not to disturb the smaller of the two dogs, some sort of mid sized terrier, apparently asleep on the grass nearby.  The other dog was nowhere to be seen.  As I approached, the dog, looking almost dead there in the grass, it suddenly leapt up and began barking, alerting the other dog in its position on the other side of the house.  I turned and ran as fast as I could, both dogs chasing me down the stairs but stopping short once i reached the street.  In retrospect, it was probably silly, but I was utterly terrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me your creepy trick-or-treat stories.  Were there any scary houses in your neighborhood growing up? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I mention this because Blue-Genes.net is hosting the 123rd meeting of the Skeptics' Circle on &lt;strong&gt;November 5th&lt;/strong&gt; and papa Martin (who has &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/?q=node/151"&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/502"&gt;Circle&lt;/a&gt; twice in the last 18 months) has given me this platform to call for submissions. So give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, but failing a surplus of dirty Irishmen: give me your posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There a few guidelines for what posts fall within the scope of the Skeptics‚Äô Circle, which can be found &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; along with other information about the carnival, but they‚Äôre fairly common sense.  Any post where skepticism and logic are applied is welcome, as long as it‚Äôs not too political. We‚Äôre trying to create an atmosphere of reason here. Check out the latest installment at &lt;a href="http://www.youngausskeptics.com/2009/10/committee-meeting-for-october-the-122nd-skeptics-circle/"&gt;Young Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; for some idea of what we‚Äôre looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As regular readers will know, every Skeptics‚Äô Circle seems to have a clever theme. I will consult with the Blue-Genes team, but any suggestions will be more than welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send your posts, along with a brief description, to me at colin *at* blue-genes *dot* net, preferably before Tuesday 3rd November.&lt;/p&gt;

I am postdoctoral researcher working in Physics in an east-European country. I published several articles in high impact journals during my PhD thesis.  However, the first article I submitted from my new research was rejected by the editor of the journal. I am quite disappointed since I believe the research was good (in fact the best I ever did) and moreover, the reasons for the rejection were not convincing. I feel very depressed and even thinking quiting my research career. If anything I can do? Alexander, Kiev, Ukraine.   Research papers, together with conference presentations, are the major outputs in the research activities. After a lot of work, efforts and dedication a paper is typically submitted to a journal to be published. No research is actually completed until is not published and is accessible to the whole scientific community. In addition, careers, grants, reputation and promotions severely depends in the number and quality of the publications‚Ä¶ so if a paper is rejected, this is typically a bad thing! and everybody, as Alexander, can feel really miserable. Perhaps Alexander could be relieved to know that every scientist had some rejected paper in his career‚Ä¶ so, first of all, this is not the end, but actually something quite normal. You can be even more relieved to know that there are quite well-known and important discoverings that were initially rejected!So, concerning your question, my first advice and recommendation: please RELAX! This will not be the end of your career and this is a normal situation. I think I am in a good position to address Alexander‚Äôs question. First, I am a scientist with a long experience dealing with editors and reviewers with my own work. On the other hand, I serve as editor for two international journals, so I have to deal with other scientists and yes... in some occasions I have to reject their papers!You need to recognize honestly the importance of your research, if everything is correct, the degree of novelty, etc‚Ä¶ This is something you need to learn from your mentors and do not be shy to ask your colleagues. In many cases reviewers and editors are correct and perhaps you overestimated your own research. If this is the case ask for advice and recognize the situation. Plan more experiments, rewrite the paper or add a new model to complete the paper.In most high quality journals, you will receive at least to reviews and most likely you will be asked to revise the manuscript. It is also common in some journals to have a direct rejection based in the large number of manuscript they receive. This argument is quite subjective and difficult to change, so if this is the case of your rejected paper, perhaps the best option is simply to resubmit it to another journal.Other situation (probably what happened to you) is to have reviews criticizing the manuscript in a way you believe is biased and non correct. If a rejection is made based in these reviews, you should write the editor an appeal letter demonstrating point by point every detail you think was not correct. If you are right, the editor should reconsider the decision and eventually your paper perhaps is sent to different reviewers.It is true, however that in some cases the communication with journals may be quite frustrating for the authors. I can share with you a recent (and bad!!) experience I had. We prepared a manuscript in a topic I believe was quite novel and providing interesting results with potential applications. The paper was sent to a journal. We were asked to revise the manuscript in three occasions with very detailed description of every minor change and long arguments. We also reduced the length of the paper and several figures were modified. In the revision number four and after a year and a half‚Ä¶ I received a letter from the editor telling me that the paper was rejected because the priority was low for the journal! You can imagine my reaction‚Ä¶ I feel as bad as you now. If that was the case, why they asked to revise the paper three consecutive times‚Ä¶ This is in my opinion a bad editorial behavior. A rejection should be done if based in subjective criteria as soon as possible.Of course, it may happen that a paper is rejected after a revision if the authors are not able to answer the reviewer‚Äôs comments. One typical mistake from some authors is to perform very minor revisions ignoring some important comments from the reviewers. You always should take very seriously any revision (at the same level of decdication or evenmore than in the initial preparation of the paper). Prepare a letter where every change and every argument is clearly listed. You do not need to do any suggested changes, but you need to address every comment, in that case stating the reason you are not acting on a particular suggestion.What can be even most frustrating is when clearly non-scientific reason seems to be the reason for a rejection. Several years ago, in a study performed in one of my former students PhD thesis (Antonio Guirao), we measured for the first time the change with age of the aberrations of the cornea. We showed that corneal aberrations increase slighly with with age, quite differently as the whole eye and the lens (See picture where blue symbols are amount of corneal aberrations). At the time this was important result to understand the optics of the aging human eye and we presented the results first in a conference. Other group followed our idea very quickly and submitted a paper that was under review at the same time as our own paper. And guess, yes our paper was¬† rejected because the journal already had a similar paper on the topic. We had the idea first; we did the experiment first, but we also had problems to get this published. This happens sometime, and you can feel bad (especially students will feel very, very bad).In any case, our study was finally published in other excellent journal and is widely used and cited since them!http://lo.um.es/publications/PDFs_main/josa_cornea_age_oct00.pdfSo, you never should be too nervous or too anxious concerning papers. In particular, try to be calm when addressing reviewers and editors. Be firm, but not too aggressive. The research will be finally published, but if not I can tell you that every scientist have some pieces of research unpublished...¬†    ‚Ä¶ and an affordable, typical and good Murcian tavern.I received several comments on a previous post where I reported on a couple of good, but expensive, restaurants... My correspondents asked about more affordable and also good options. And here you have one. It is a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù tavern in the center of Murcia city. It is usually rather busy but the service is efficient and the tapas selection quite good and inexpensive. It was refurbished recently so the flavor is not as good as in the past, but if you are in Murcia you should visit! Many of the visitors of my lab were there sometime. The name of the place is ‚ÄúLos Toneles‚Äù and you can find it in near the hotel &amp;quot;Rincon de Pepe&amp;quot; (Calle Canovas del Castillo, 7, Murcia). Dan Green, now a retired professor from the University of Michigan (a great vision scientist and a good friend) use to be there nearly every day during his visits to my lab in mid 90‚Äôs. In the picture below you can see Dan with some of my former students (Ignacio Iglesias, Juanma Bueno, Fernando Vargas) and me at Los Toneles tavern around 1995.¬†A. Guirao, M. Redondo, P.

As a result of this scientific world has become deluged with data. This has greater implications the way science will be done in coming years. There is a general accord that science has turned more into a data management problem. Put the technical aspect of scientific data management aside, and ask can we depict useful and practically relevant conclusions from our past experiences in scientific data management, and what makes few data management strategies/efforts more popular than others? I am talking about appropriate philosophical foundations for scientific data and knowledge management. Although there is no universal agreement what is best way to manage heterogeneous scientific data which keeps evolving over the time, simplicity and abstraction have always appealed data pundits. Generally most of the scientific data management strategies have not conceived from the social perspective, they are always technology driven. You may call it by any name Big Data, Open Data, Linked Data or you can be in love with XML or RDF, but I am not impressed there will be any ultimate solution to this problem. So is there any social  perspective for scientific data management at all? Well I guess so. Masanori Arita has recently published an interesting review article about what can metabolomics learn from genomics and proteomics? What I really liked about this article is the Masanori's analogy of omics data management with Gladwell states. Many of us will be aware about the Malcolm Gladwell highly praised book The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, where based on sociological observation Gladwell describes the three rules of social epidemics: the law of the few, the stickiness factor, the power of context. Tipping points are nothing but the critical point at which the momentum for change becomes unstoppable or viral. From omics data management perspective lets just consider the first and foremost important, the law of the few which states that a small number of influential people called mavens (information specialists), salesmen (persuaders, charismatic), and connectors (truly extraordinary knack for connecting with people) play a crucial role in staging the tipping point. What Masanori really wanted to stage was the viral success for the metabolomics as a fundamental data-driven science like its counterparts, genomics and proteomics. But there is big massage for every other omics,  Masanori draw three simple conclusions,Mavens: large public databases with focus on information quantitySalesmen: data appeal by simple formats/standardsConnectors: wiki-based community/knowledge portalsFirst point is large public databases with early focus on information quantity. Data must be readily and freely accessible through large, stable public repositories such as Genebank, SwissProts. Information quantity is no longer an issue in genomics and proteomics community, although they are suffering from several other issues such as high proportion of unannotated data (Out of 4000 bacterial genome projects only a handful  are publicly well annotated) ,   high error rate (20 to 45% for high-throughput protein‚Äìprotein interaction data) and low information content. On a rather small note stability need long term funding and I guess most of large public repositories are quite comfortable with that.Second point is data appeal by simple formats/standards. Data format/standards played a important role in success and popularity of certain research areas. Masanori notes thatIn biology, the readability of raw data affects popularity. In fact, metabolism, the primary research topic in metabolomics, is notorious for its incomprehensibility and many researchers stayed away from metabolic networks containing lengthy structural and stoichiometric information. The KEGG database gained popularity for its oversimplified representation of metabolic networks: each metabolite is represented as a node without structure, and each reaction as a binary relationship without stoichiometry. Although its oversimplification resulted in considerable misunderstandings , the KEGG database boosted the graph-oriented analysis of metabolic pathways, and consequently, it awakened the interest of the research community in metabolism. Many popular databases containing gene expression or protein‚Äìprotein interaction data also use simple notations.Third point is use of wikis as major platform for hosting the biological information. As matter of fact major biology databases are in the process of transferring to wiki-based sites and use of wiki as sites is getting momenta. FurtherWe, as scientists, should pay more attention to the evolution of web information because wiki embodies the quintessence of all sciences: the acquisition of knowledge through open discussion.Openness is not only reason in favor of wiki over traditional databases. Situation is quite complicated for curated and annotated non-wiki databases where evolution of data remains intractable.  Whether there was any updated in data base, and if yes why it was updated and was it discussed in appropriated forum before update, these issues remains gray area for non-wiki type sites. For instance, take the example of BioModels database which expose the systems biology models as releases, in each release there are few new models but it also includes old models which may or may not be modified after the previous release. In current BioModels implementation there is no clear mechanism to track the changes related to  evolution of a given model. From a user perspective tracking of revisions and edits is really important. The other issue is whether or not curation projects have a backup mechanism in place. I am raising this issues because funding sources for biological databases are quite limited, which means sooner or later few or many projects will be out of fund (A recent example of this is the arabidopsis resource, TAIR). Rather than asking to funding agencies for sustainable model for biological databases funding, I would suggest that project manager should be asked to include the additional details in their project proposal such as how they will keep the data stream alive if funding run out at first place. I think there are several options to keep data stream alive for short lived  projects, just dump the whole database in sourceforge or any other repository. Best option is make Wikipedia your new home. In all fairness I am not against long term funding of the database projects, but this should be a goal oriented  merit based decision and even then very few will be succeed.Not everything is well with wiki option also, like absence of incentives  for participating  in crowd sourcing efforts. But there is better chance and hope.Reference:Arita, M. (2009). What can metabolomics learn from genomics and proteomics? Current Opinion in Biotechnology DOI: 10.1016/j.copbio.2009.09.011

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt mind that he‚Äôs reporting on that non-story, because there‚Äôs an appeal to that story from both sides of that fence ‚Äî the people who prefer sound science and rational thinking‚Ä¶ and the people who agree with Ray Comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When complaints started pouring in that the article about Comfort offered ‚Äúcoverage but no critical commentary,‚Äù &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/10/29/exclusive-ray-comfort-defends-his-creationist-edition-of-on-the-origin-of-species.html"&gt;Gilgoff decided to try something else&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He posted a piece by Comfort explaining why he wrote the prologue to this book.  Later, he posted &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/10/30/how-creationist-origin-distorts-darwin.html"&gt;a rebuttal from science advocate &lt;strong&gt;Eugenie Scott&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  They‚Äôll do another round of back-and-forth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here‚Äôs the first post from Comfort, explaining his new book, which he plans to distribute in the tens of thousands on college campuses. I‚Äôll post a rebuttal from NCSE Executive Director Eugenie Scott later today. Next week, I‚Äôll put up a follow-up post from each. And just a reminder: Neither God &amp;amp; Country nor &lt;em&gt;U.S. News&lt;/em&gt; necessarily endorses their views.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the wrong way to handle the situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the need for journalists to not be biased.   But to suggest that there are two sides to this story and that they deserve equal time is ridiculous.  Eugenie Scott knows her science.  Comfort doesn‚Äôt know his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don‚Äôt give equal time to someone who thinks Obama was born in Kenya and someone who actually knows what he‚Äôs talking about.  There‚Äôs no debate there.  You don‚Äôt give equal time to a Holocaust denier and someone who experienced it firsthand.  There‚Äôs no debate there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;perfectly fine&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;U.S. News&lt;/em&gt; and Gilgoff‚Äôs blog to take a position in this case!  Eugenie Scott is not some polar opposite of Ray Comfort.  She‚Äôs not some minority holding a fringe viewpoint.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She‚Äôs the voice of every educated, intelligent, pro-science person whose beliefs are based in reality ‚Äî she holds the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; position in this fake ‚Äúdebate‚Äù that is tenable. &lt;em&gt;Why can‚Äôt U.S. News take the side of reality&lt;/em&gt;?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can‚Äôt they simply say that they support her views and not his?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can‚Äôt they come out and say Comfort makes absolutely no sense and that his views have no foundation to rest upon?  (Isn‚Äôt that what an actual reporter would write?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do they have to pretend like there are two sides on this issue when there so clearly are not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the molecular basis of evolutionary change in nature? How many genetic changes are required to produce new traits? Which genes are used? What types of mutations? Few or many changes required?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dream experiment would be to cross a whale and a bat and figure out what their genetic differences are. That's impossible, so they searched for other organisms with a suite of differences that were crossable...and they picked the 3-spined stickleback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sticklebacks are migratory between salt and freshwater, and post-glaciation, they colonized many freshwater lakes and streams. The marine phenotype is ancestral, and freshwater species have many differences...but because these differences only evolved in the past 10-20,000 years, and they are crossable by artificial insemination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fish are small, easy to collect, and have segregating genetic traits. They have disadvantages: no sequences, no clone libraries, no genetic markers, no linkage maps, no transgenic mehtods when first worked out. Now they have dense genetic and physical maps, a complete genome sequence, whole genome transcriptome arrays, genome wide SNP studies, and high throughput transgenics. Zoom.

&lt;p&gt;Specific questions: hindlimb reduction occurs in many vertebrates. Marine sticklebacks have substantial pelvis, pelvic spines, and fins. Some of the freshwater populations have lost the hindfins in cases where predation is low, calcium is low, and there are many insect predators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing marine and freshwater with pelvic reductions identified single chromosomal region that explains 65% of the variance. They also have candidate genes: Gli3, Fgf10, Shh, Fgf8, Fgf4...most interested in ones expressed only in hindlimb: Pitx1, which maps directly to chromosome involved in reductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protein coding region of Pitx1 is identical, but there is a tissue-specific loss of expression in the developing pelvic region. This is a gene of large effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knocking out Pitx1 in mice yields reduced hindlimbs and death before birth. Regulatory changes are more focused and specific; cis-acting regulatory changes FTW!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still need info. What base pairs have changed? Single or multi-step mutations? Same or different events in different populations? Are there hotspots?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing fine mapping of the defect: there are some populations that are dimorphic, in which the mutation is not yet fixed. They've identified a 20kb interval upstream of Pitx1 that is correlated with the differences. This sequence has been tied to a reporter gene, and it does contain a pelvic enhancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can they reverse the change? Couple the 20kb sequence with a Pitx1 gene, put that in a pelvic-reduced fish, and presto, it restores a full and beautiful pelvis and pelvic spine. They &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; they have the right region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at different pelvic-reduced populations suggest that this pelvic control region is the target of many independent mutations. Is the Pitx1 gene predisposed to mutation? Sequence is full of repeats, might be comparable to a fragile site. This is a flexible region of DNA. Four of top ten flexibility scores in the whole stickleback genome are right in that 20kb region. The upstream coding region also exhibits other signatures of selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trait: armor plates. Marine forms are heavily armored, many freshwater species have reduced armor. Similar crosses have identified a region on one chromosome that accounts for much of the variation. Similar crosses done for skin color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pelvice, armor, and pigmentation mutations are all in regulatory genes. Mouse and human mutations in these same genes cause all sorts of severely deleterious effects (again, likely to be regulatory changes, not changes in the genes themselves). They are not knockout mutations in the fish, but only regulatory changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same genes are involved in independent mutations in stickleback populations -- how far might this similarity extend? The genes involved in stickleback pigmentation (kitlg) are also involved in human pigmentation variants. Variations in regulatory regions of kitlg account for 20% of the pigment variation in human populations, and these regions also show signs of selection. Currently injecting constructs with fish regulatory genes into mouse embryos and getting changes in pigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They've mapped many other traits to QTLs in the fish genome, but only 3 have been dug into deeply enough -- lots of work left to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, marine fish carry a haplotype for the variant alleles used in armor plating and pigmentation at low levels (0.5%-1.0%), and these are subject to selective sweeps in new freshwater populations that drive them to fixation. So we see the same alleles emerging with high frequency in different populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabulous stuff. I'm struggling to restrain myself from doing a Homer-like gurgle. Mmmm, sticklebacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/david_kingsleyfishing_for_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/eLTp9yjUGgI" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257012086336"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/david_jablonskipaleontology_an.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e072b1c83774a1e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">David Jablonski‚ÄîPaleontology and Evolutionary Biology: The Revitalized Parnership</title><published>2009-10-31T16:52:16Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T16:52:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/-cZngEpdqpY/david_jablonskipaleontology_an.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/david_jablonskipaleontology_an.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Darwin had problems with the fossil record that he explained as a result of imperfections. Modern paleo has corrected some of that with the discovery of many intermediates. Jablonski is going to talk about the fossil record as a laboratory for testing evolutionary hypotheses. Marine bivalves are model systems with both modern forms and good fossil preservation for developing analysis techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fossil record gives access to raw rates of development, unique events, and long intervals, spatial dynamics, and morphological transitions in form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extinction in the fossil record is a problem. Huge variation in extinction intensity over time; there is also differential extinction of mollusc clades. There is no contant rate of extinction over time and across phylogenies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared bivalve living clades with total clades over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tropics are a cradle of new taxa that trickle up into the higher latitutdes; lineages preferentially arise in the tropics. Tropical origins seen despite poor fossil record in tropics, and occurs in spite of increasing harshness of higher latitudes over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution of form: there is a pattern seen in fossils, (type 1) a rapid increase in morphological disparity early leading to taxonomic diversity, or (type 2) disparity and diversity rise together, or (type 3) morphological disparity is low, but diversity rises rapidly.

&lt;p&gt;Echinoderms fit type 1; Aporrhaidae follow type 2 model; Trilobites are type 3, where stable body plan is accompanied by huge species diversity.He catalogs many lineages and characterizes which type they fall into. I'm a bit lost as to what point he's trying to make here. OK, so there are different patterns of disparity and diversity in different lineages, but why is this interesting? I seem to be lacking some important background to follow this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a question: Ecological opportunity is a key factor in diversity. Is it enough to generate the type 1 pattern of diversification? Alas, I don't seem to get an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For understanding long term patterns of change, we need both evolution and paleontology. Extinction varies temporally and among clades. Clades are spatioally dynamic and geographic histories are often surprising, and there are multiple pathways to prolific diversification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk actually generated a fair number of questions, so I confess that I'm missing something here. It looks like I'm going to have to dig into a few Jablonski papers. Either that or I need more sleep/coffee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/david_jablonskipaleontology_an.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-cZngEpdqpY" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257009694560"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/524eeee2602c57ab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Preventing Swine Flu</title><published>2009-10-31T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/medical/swineflu/prevent.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">E-mailed list offers tips for avoiding contracting the swine flu.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257009215805"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-6718618638600123744">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0faa2a8c6f203ac4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Geeks and Nerds</title><published>2009-10-31T14:56:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T14:56:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/10/geeks-and-nerds.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">Inspiring?

Carnival Season is upon us, or rather: carnival season is upon &lt;a href="http://www.blue-genes.net"&gt;Blue-Genes.net&lt;/a&gt;. For the uninitiated: the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/"&gt;Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt; is an ancient (by intertube standards) rite where the cleverest clogs in the world get together fortnightly to share their thoughts on many issues that have become clouded by poor logic, bias, and silliness.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
I mention this because Blue-Genes.net is hosting the 123rd meeting of the Skeptics' Circle on &lt;strong&gt;November 5th&lt;/strong&gt; and papa Martin (who has &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/?q=node/151"&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/502"&gt;Circle&lt;/a&gt; twice in the last 18 months) has given me this platform to call for submissions. So give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, but failing a surplus of dirty Irishmen: give me your posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There a few guidelines for what posts fall within the scope of the Skeptics‚Äô Circle, which can be found &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; along with other information about the carnival, but they‚Äôre fairly common sense.  Any post where skepticism and logic are applied is welcome, as long as it‚Äôs not too political. We‚Äôre trying to create an atmosphere of reason here. Check out the latest installment at &lt;a href="http://www.youngausskeptics.com/2009/10/committee-meeting-for-october-the-122nd-skeptics-circle/"&gt;Young Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; for some idea of what we‚Äôre looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As regular readers will know, every Skeptics‚Äô Circle seems to have a clever theme. I will consult with the Blue-Genes team, but any suggestions will be more than welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

I was under the misimpression that zip-level data was only being collected for demographic research purposes (to determine where stores should be located, and advertising directed, on a mass scale) and thus said that no harm came from revealing the zip.  No longer.  Here's a summary of data practices at William Sonoma, according to a recent California case (Pineda v. Williams-Sonoma Stores Inc., Cal. Ct. App., 4th Dist., No. D054355).  Giving the zip code allows the store to "enhance" the information they already have about your (your name from the credit card) and determine your home address:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jessica Pineda visited a store in California owned by Williams-Sonoma Stores, Inc. (the Store) and selected an item to purchase. She then went to the cashier to pay for the item with her credit card. The cashier asked for her zip code, but did not tell her the consequences if she declined to provide the information. Believing that she was required to provide her zip code to complete the transaction, Pineda provided the information. The cashier recorded it into the electronic cash register and then completed the transaction. At the end of the transaction, the Store had Pineda's credit card number, name and zip code recorded in its databases.

&lt;p&gt;After acquiring this information, the Store used customized computer software to perform reverse searches from databases that contain millions of names, e-mail addresses, residential telephone numbers and residential addresses, and are indexed in a manner that resembles a reverse telephone book. The Store's software then matched Pineda's now-known name, zip code or other personal information with her previously unknown address, thereby giving the Store access to her name and address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when they ask for your zip code, say no, or to have fun, give them the zip code of the White House: 20500. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/10/dont_even_give_them_your_zip_c.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/2y5n3_grp90" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257007110018"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/g_31XRZBNoM/how_do_we_know_how_bad_the_swi.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/133527816825b0eb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">How do we know how bad the Swine Flu is so far?</title><published>2009-10-31T11:31:43Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T11:31:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/bGmBU-EAWLc/how_do_we_know_how_bad_the_swi.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/g_31XRZBNoM/how_do_we_know_how_bad_the_swi.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I spent about 45 minutes yesterday in the local HMO clinic.

I think I handled him well, but there are so many more things that might have been said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I wished I‚Äôd set aside purely scientific matters and remarked upon how &lt;em&gt;intolerant &lt;/em&gt;it is for some Christians to contend that their &lt;em&gt;particular &lt;/em&gt;scripture‚Äìto which not all of us subscribe‚Äìis a science manual. Basically, this means that if they‚Äôre right, those of us who aren‚Äôt Xians aren‚Äôt capable of scientific knowledge about the origins of the world and so on. That‚Äôs not just wrong, it‚Äôs offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I didn‚Äôt expect to encounter a full-on creationist on the show‚Äìbut it does get your juices flowing. About a year or so after &lt;em&gt;Republican War on Science&lt;/em&gt; came out in 2005, I was growing pretty tired of debating the anti-evolutionists, the anti-global warming folks, and so on, because intellectually, it just isn‚Äôt that stimulating. So I went off and tried to do some more interesting things‚Äìbut it is cool nevertheless to go back to the roots now and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm posting this from a Helsinki basement caf√© after a day's excursion by bus and boat in the countryside west of town. We mainly looked at cairns of various form, date and function, including a group of very fine large mountaintop ones of the typical Bronze Age variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/10/not_resting_place_of_the_first/DSCN9096lores.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="DSCN9096lores.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the day we saw a preserved little bit of an excavated cemetery to which had been added a memorial stone in the 1930s. On the plaque the site is dated to about AD 100 and proclaimed as burial place of the first Finns! The reasoning went like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have a gap in the archaeological record during the Last Millennium BC. And the linguists believe that the Finnish language arrived here from Estonia about AD 1. And the grave type here has its closest parallels in Estonia. So this must be the grave of early Finnish-speaking colonists who arrived in the country when it was empty about AD 1!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/10/not_resting_place_of_the_first/DSCN9099LORES.JPG" width="263" height="350" alt="DSCN9099LORES.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the decades since, we have learned that there is no gap in the Finnish settlement record in the Last Millennium, and the grave type has been shown to be native to the coasts all around the south-eastern Baltic Sea. And the linguists have changed their mind about the date of the arrival of the Finnish language. So all that remains of the ideas celebrated on that stone is that yes, we still date the grave goods to about AD 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I told my colleagues, this is not by far the silliest memorial stone erected on an archaeological site. A strong candidate is found at Vendel church in Uppland where rich boat-burials have been excavated. It reads,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VENDEL PERIOD&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3,000 attend Bill Pickett Rodeo Competition reminds spectators of the part&lt;/strong&gt;

By William Brand, STAFF WRITER
ROWELL RANCH -- Cowboy legend Bill Pickett would be proud, but really not surprised that more than 3,000 spectators -- predominantly African Americans -- turned out here Saturday afternoon for the 20th annual Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo.

When Pickett -- the cowboy who invented the rodeo sport of steer wrestling -- was born in 1870, one out of every three cowpokes riding the range and driving cows up the Chisholm Trail was black, said Jesse Guillory, the rodeo&amp;#39;s general manager.

But segregation and discrimination wiped the saga of America&amp;#39;s black cowboys from the history books, he said.

The rodeo this weekend -- it concludes today -- was a mix of a highly professional rodeo with top-notch cowboys and a Wild West show.

&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been coming for the last five years,** said Casandra Coleman, of San Francisco. **It&amp;#39;s nice to see black cowboys.**

It sometimes surprises Americans looking at historical photos from the era to see a huge mix of ethnicities, including many, many African Americans -- all wearing trademark angora chaps and tall Stetsons, historians point out.

Even Pickett, who toured the world and won many a championship buckle was often billed as &amp;quot;The Dusky Demon&amp;quot; with no mention of his ethnicity.

No longer.

The son of freed slaves, he was the first African-American cowboy inducted into the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City in ¬† 1971 and into the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs a year later.

The Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo began in Denver in 1983. The rodeo came to Rowell Ranch rodeo grounds near Dublin the next year.

Founder Lu Vason started the rodeo to destroy the perception that African Americans took no part in the development of the West.

Today -- the circuit features 300 cowboys and cowgirls -- who compete in Bill Pickett Invitationals around the country. There now are other predominantly black rodeos as well, including rodeos sponsored by the Southwest Cowboys of Color and the Real Cowboy Association.

World champion Fred Whitfield lends his name to the calf roping event, for example. And Saturday and today, Gary Richards, a champion bull rider who regularly appears on television as a competitor in the PBR -- the Professional Bull Riders -- was a judge in the bull-riding.

The truth is, black cowboys and cowgirls never went away, Guillory said. There are lots and lots of black cowboys in Oklahoma and Texas.

Nearby, bareback bronco rider Harold Miller unloaded his rigging bag, waiting for his event to come up. &amp;quot;I used to ride bulls, too,&amp;quot; said Miller, 48, of Liberty, S.C. But now it&amp;#39;s just bareback broncos; they&amp;#39;re easier, he said.

He tied for first in his event -- even though he was riding with cracked ribs. He has a crack at a share of more than $15,000 in ¬† cash prizes today.

Behind the chutes, barrel racer Carolyn Carter and her muscular quarter horse &amp;quot;Katt&amp;quot; waited for their event. &amp;quot;I got into this by accident,&amp;quot; Carter said. &amp;quot;I was 16 and my sister dragged me to an event. I had a horse that worked on auto-pilot and I won $900.&amp;quot;

Twenty-seven years later she still has her hat in the ring, she said. Racing time are fast and there&amp;#39;s real competition. Barrel racers from the Bill Pickett Rodeo haven&amp;#39;t made it to the PRCA, mostly because of money, she said. A good barrel horse in that league can cost $100,000 or more. But a good ride, turning tight around all the barrels and sprinting home -- it&amp;#39;s a feeling that&amp;#39;s hard to beat, Carter said. ¬†

The Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo concludes its Bay Area run this afternoon at 2:30. Tickets are $18 for adults, $12 for children

&lt;strong&gt;Cowboy from black rodeo circuit deserving of honor&lt;/strong&gt;

By Bob Ray Sanders Star-Telegram Staff Writer

Long before I had ever heard of Bill Pickett, the ranch hand credited with inventing the rodeo sport of &amp;quot;bulldogging,&amp;quot; there was another black cowboy who had become my hero.

He was a man who was born and grew up in Mosier Valley, Tarrant County&amp;#39;s oldest African-American community, and someone I&amp;#39;ve known all my life.

Walter Charles &amp;quot;Budah&amp;quot; Morse was the first man I ever saw jump off a running horse onto a steer and wrestle it down to the ground.

One of my most vivid childhood memories -- and I think it was a Fourth of July evening -- was seeing an angry steer lunging toward Morse&amp;#39;s abdomen, quickly jerking his horns upward and tearing off part of Morse&amp;#39;s brand-new western shirt.

Those were fascinating times.

You see, in those days the famed Fort Worth Stock Show permitted black people on the grounds only one day out of the run, and even then we were not allowed to attend the rodeo performances.

But so what?

There was always the &amp;quot;colored rodeo,&amp;quot; which played in small arenas in Fort Worth, Mansfield and a few other North Texas towns, often around the holidays of Juneteenth and July Fourth.

Those events had everything that the stock show rodeo had -- bareback bronc riding, bull riding, calf roping, barrel racing and, of course, clowns. Naturally, they also had what the stock show didn&amp;#39;t have, and wouldn&amp;#39;t have, for a long time to come: black cowboys. All the participants were African-American, including the women racing on horseback around the barrels and the kids who chased after a bandanna tied to a calf&amp;#39;s tail.

Morse, who has been a part of many other western events through the years, including being one of the drovers for the Fort Worth Herd, didn&amp;#39;t make a living on the limited black rodeo circuit. But he always worked around animals (horses in particular) as a trainer, groomer and veterinarian&amp;#39;s assistant.

He was one of the original members of the Tarrant County Black Rodeo Association, which was started by Wayman Alexander, the black Tarrant County extension agent and 4-H Club leader. In 1954, Morse won the bulldogging championship at a rodeo in Denton.

It is only fitting that on May 21 he will be inducted into the National Cowboys of Color Hall of Fame, where he will join the legendary Bill Pickett, inducted posthumously in the first class last year. Pickett died in 1932.

The induction ceremony will be at 7 p.m. at the National Cowboys of Color Museum and Hall of Fame, 3400 Mount Vernon Ave. in Fort Worth.

The brainchild of Jim and Gloria Austin, the museum and hall of fame was founded &amp;quot;to give recognition to outstanding pioneers who contributed to the settling of the early American Western Frontier as well as acknowledge individuals who continue to be trailblazers committed to the legacy of western culture.&amp;quot;

Fort Worth Councilman Jim Lane, a champion of American Indian and western culture as well as a staunch advocate for the Fort Worth Stockyards, will also be inducted into the hall of fame.

The two other honorees this year are: the first female inductee, &amp;quot;Stagecoach&amp;quot; Mary Fields, an ex-slave who, with her mule, Moses, delivered the mail in the Cascade County region of Central Montana; and the late film star Mantan Moreland, known mostly for his comedy roles but who was in two early films that featured black actors as heroic cowboys.

Although the induction ceremony is free, organizers ask that those planning to attend call (817) 922-9999.

However, I want to pose a completely different response to Mooney's argument: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, so?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's assume for a second that Mooney is completely right: The success and visibility of &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; has had a net negative contribution to the mission of &lt;i&gt;The Greatest Show in Earth&lt;/i&gt; to bring people over to the pro-evolution side.  However, getting people to come around on evolution is not the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; goal in the whole wide world... is it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason Rosenhouse &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/10/how_about_another_post_on_acco.php#more"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To this point I have been focused specifically on the evolution issue. Obviously, though, I think religion lies at the heart of a great many other societal ills. It is the primary factor in issues like bigotry towards homosexuals, repressive attitudes toward women, assaults on public education, and a political system in which people must profess the strength of their religious faith to have any hope of a future. Those are just a few examples.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, and in fact I have to criticize Jason just a little bit for failing to follow up on this point as much as he might.  I'm going to go out on a limb and argue that bigotry and repression of women and homosexuals are &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; important issues than evolution education.  Not that the latter isn't critically important, and I believe there is synergy between these various goals -- but if I were offered a choice between ending Creationism and ending bigotry, I wouldn't even have to think about that one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, as I said, let's say Mooney is right.  So what?  Is he saying that &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; was completely worthless in all respects, then?  That it has not had any positive effect on the public conversation about the false respect accorded to religion and religious prejudice?  Well, maybe &lt;i&gt;Mooney&lt;/i&gt; is saying that, but I think that's ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rosenhouse says something very similar, that the long-term goal is moving towards a more godless society, but he puts it firmly within the context of the Creationism problem, i.e. he argues that as the American and UK mainstream stop giving so much undue deference to religious belief, ideas like "Teach the controversy" will fade into crackpot obscurity, where they belong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think Rosenhouse is exactly right, that there is synergy here.  But I'm going to go one step further and say that the goal of tearing down religion's wall of protection is the more important aim &lt;i&gt;even if&lt;/i&gt; it had no effect, or even a negative effect, on the fight against creationism.  As atheists and other nontheists are further emboldened to speak out, it helps in so many other struggles as well:  In countering those who would &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1YodpFMLU4&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;use religiously-motivated scare-mongering to fight against marriage equality&lt;/a&gt;, in deflating the silly faux-liberal belief that &lt;a href="http://standpointmag.co.uk/node/2041/full"&gt;equates criticism of misogyny with ethnocentric intolerance&lt;/a&gt;, and in combating dangerous &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/18/martin.condoms/index.html"&gt;nigh-genocidal prohibitions issued by a certain "rat" of a pontiff&lt;/a&gt;.  All of these things are important -- at &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt; as important as whether evolution gets taught properly in schools, don't you think?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When making grand pronouncements on the wisdom of writing &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt;, one cannot take into account only the costs and benefits in regards to evolution education and future books on evolution -- one must look at &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the costs and benefits.  And I say, even if &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; did have some small deleterious effect on evolution education (an unproven allegation to begin with), it still would be a net positive, because it helped to bring atheism and frank religious criticism into the mainstream.  It seems to me that to argue otherwise is rather short-sighted and narrow-minded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-8176546668445512585?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1257003129131"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=17755">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa7bb64584c76888</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Babies"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">I Want Baby Ruths for Halloween</title><published>2009-10-31T15:00:35Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T15:00:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/31/i-want-baby-ruths-for-halloween/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Or is is Babies Ruth?)&lt;/p&gt;

Religious beliefs run very, very deep, and touch a part of us that is incredibly difficult to analyze rationally or with any sort of real self-skepticism. In general, a person‚Äôs religious belief is wrapped up in their own sense of self, so attacking that religion is akin to a personal attack on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, just sometimes, a belief can be goofy enough ‚Äî and damaging enough ‚Äî that maybe a little bit of mockery is deserved. Certainly Pat Robertson has done so much damage in his lifetime that he gets no pass at all from me. My thoughts on him are clear and public (for example, he is &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/01/03/its-pat/"&gt;&amp;quot;bigoted, small-minded zealot who will say anything to appeal to his base&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it comes as no surprise that his website CBN is a haven for nonsensery at all levels. But &lt;a href="http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/onlinediscipleship/halloween/halloween_danger_daniels.aspx"&gt;a new post there about Halloween&lt;/a&gt; has even me scratching my head. Kimberly Daniels wrote a piece there about Halloween that is about as far from reality as it can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halloween is a counterfeit holy day that is dedicated to celebrating the demonic trinity of : the Luciferian Spirit (the false father); the Antichrist Spirit (the false holy spirit); and the Spirit of Belial (the false son).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? I thought it was a time to have fun, let a little loose, eat candy, and just be silly. But I guess that‚Äôs just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ and about 300 million other Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we‚Äôve established she‚Äôs a goofball. Fine. But then she goes too far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During this period demons are assigned against those who participate in the rituals and festivities. These demons are automatically drawn to the fetishes that open doors for them to come into the lives of human beings. For example, most of the candy sold during this season has been dedicated and prayed over by witches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attacking Halloween is one thing, but attacking &lt;em&gt;the candy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, it must be fun to live in an evidence-free world where you can simply assert whatever you want without proof or references or anything! Here, let me try: &lt;em&gt;CBN is run by a TI 99-4a computer with buggy code that sometimes strings words together in patterns that almost make sense, if you squint and stand some distance away from them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, that was easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that it‚Äôs not only OK, but appropriate to shake your head and be somewhat dismissive of opinions stated as fact that aren‚Äôt within a glancing blow of reality. That anyone can take Robertson&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or his organization seriously is weird. The fact that they make money hand over fist is, well, not a crime since it‚Äôs legal, but a real shame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wonder if anyone has told Ms. Daniels about the pagan origins of Christmas celebrations? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as for me, I‚Äôll happily be giving out my accursed Kit Kats and demonic Baby Ruths to all the satan-worshipping entrail-reading pagan evildoers in the neighborhood. And probably snitching the occasional hellspawned Tootsie Roll, too.&lt;/p&gt;

But you don't need to be able to attend the workshop in order to learn about this fascinating topic, since the author has recently published a &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/63450x14214725jp/"&gt;version of the same material&lt;/a&gt;. The abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This paper proposes a distributed coordination algorithm for robotic sensor networks to detect boundaries that separate areas of abrupt change of spatial phenomena. We consider an aggregate objective function, termed wombliness, that measures the change of the spatial field along the closed polygonal curve defined by the location of the sensors in the environment. We encode the network task as the optimization of the wombliness and characterize the smoothness properties of the objective function. In general, the complexity of the spatial phenomena makes the gradient flow cause self-intersections in the polygonal curve described by the network. Therefore, we design a distributed coordination algorithm that allows for network splitting and merging while guaranteeing the monotonic evolution of wombliness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OED has &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wombling, -long&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;adv.&lt;/em&gt;, "with the belly on the ground or along a surface", &lt;em&gt;Obs. rare&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the OED has so far missed prof. Cort√©s' use, which is a &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=wombling&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;technical one&lt;/a&gt;, going back about 20 years. As explained in J.P. Bocquet-Appel and J.N. Bacro, "&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2413680.pdf"&gt;Generalized Wombling&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Systematic Biology&lt;/em&gt; 43(3): 442-448, 1994&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The magnitude of the spatial change observed simultaneously on a set of surfaces can be described by a method christened &amp;quot;wombling&amp;quot; by Barbujani et al. (1989) ‚Ä¶ after Womble (1951).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The references are to G.N. Barbujani et al., "&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2992403"&gt;Detecting regions of abrupt change in maps of biological variables&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Syst. Zool. &lt;/em&gt;38:376-389, December 1989, and William H. Womble, "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/114/2961/315"&gt;Differential systematics&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;114(2961):315-322, 1951.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell from internal evidence, Barbujani et al. were not aware of the partial coincidence between their coinage and its seven-century-old predecessor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Below, we extend Womble&amp;#39;s concept ‚Ä¶ Use of the systemic function need not be limited to gene frequencies, but seems applicable to the analysis of any continuous variable, including morphological measurements, frequencies of polygenic and environmentally influenced traits, and even environmental variables. We have adopted the term &amp;quot;wombling&amp;quot; for the procedures detailed below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can guess from their description, there is a linguistic connection here that goes beyond simple lexicography. Already in 1990, Barbujani and Sokal published "&lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/87/5/1816.full.pdf"&gt;Zones of sharp genetic change in Europe are also linguistic boundaries&lt;/a&gt;", PNAS 87:1816-1819, 1990:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A newly elaborated method, "Wombling," for detected regions of abrupt change in biological variables was applied to 63 human allele frequencies in Europe. Of the 33 gene-frequency boundaries discovered in this way, 31 are coincident with linguistic boundaries marking contiguous regions of different language families, languages, or dialects. The remaining two boundaries (through Iceland and Greece) separate descendants of different ethnic or geographical provenance but lack modern linguistic correlates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don't know any examples of papers that use wombling directly to analyze the geographical distribution of linguistic variables. Perhaps a reader can provide one. In Womble's original 1951 paper, he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The subtleties of human culture and the intricate relationships of its elements pose problems for which, as yet, there appears to be no adequate mathematics. However, the quantification of even the grosser variables would permit the development of a systemic function which should better define the spatial and temporal structuring of culture fields and their patterns of interaction than do any of the current culture area and culture sequence classifications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Dialects show analogies to subspecific phenomena. Like biologic varieties, they are involved in the uneasy dynamic equilibrium of their universes of interaction. In isolation they may "speciate" as distinct languages. This methodology would seem well suited to the ordering of the many variants of dialect geography. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It is not feasible at this time to foresee all possible applications of differential systematics. Essentially, it is a development in logic rather than a specialized technique. Consequently, it may be employed in the ordering of numerous realities exhibiting multiple variations through time and space. However, significant interpretation of differing systemic functions requires that individual attention be given to the processes involved in maintaining similarities and developing differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even the eruptive pseudopodia that are quite characteristic of this group (although present in some amoebozoans as well) seem to not have been examined on a molecular level - I cannot find a single paper describing the cytoskeletal dynamics behind this peculiar mode of motility, and my sources point out a severe shortage of attention in that area. But I'm still scraping things together, so eventually something will appear...Now for something completely different...since someone just sent me scouring piles of archaic metazoan 'mesozoan' literature to identify that damn bug (an orthonectid of some sort), I have a random metazoan of my own to show off a bit, from the latest pond microforay:Rotifer. (Mine =P 40x* DIC) Note the contractile vacuole-like structure (actually its bladder, but appears to function in a very similar way. Another case of ultimate convergence?).I can't quite key this one out, especially since this damn sucker is on its side. Probably the only reason I was able to capture a photo of it, since they tend to be quite hyperactive normally. This one appears to be immobilised by the cover glass. Perhaps it may be Aspelta or something from the Lepadellidae. Or might it be a Bdelloid? Perhaps a certain taxonomist could help out. Especially the one who made me browse orthonectids for the past few hours. ^^*40x here, and onwards, refers to objective rather than magnification. We don't actually care about mag, it's the other properties of the optical system that matter much more when dealing with professional instruments. (Such as numerical aperture and field of view, focal length, focal depth, which type of immersion medium its calibrated for, etc) Technically, I should be writing down the NA and such, but we're not that meticulous crazy around here. **Randomly found out there's a rotifer that lives inside colonies of Volvox, as a parasite...Much of my resentment towards metazoa simply comes from them being overstudied and overemphasised, to the neglect of other phyla. That said, they are still interesting and still poorly understood lifeforms, especially among the spineless things. While representing but a mere sliver of life's overall diversity -- contrary to what our senses tell us -- metazoa are nevertheless, like all life, fascinating and weird. Metazoan multicellularity, as mundane and ubiquitous as it may seem to our rather biased eyes, is about as weird and insane as kinetoplastid kDNA editing, or the convoluted ciliate nuclear genomes, or the breathtakingly massive, and seemingly pointlessly so, nuclear genomes of dinoflagellates and some amoebozoa. I'm quite disappointed at the absense of the 'perspective of strangeness', if you will, that seems to dominate many animal-oriented classes (especially those catering to pre-meds. Must. not. rant.)Interestingly, off all taxonomic and phylogenetic literature, I find metazoan papers to be the most difficult to follow* - we actually have common names to refer to quite a few animals metazoa. Furthermore, the obsession with ranked hierarchy is driving me insane - you DO NOT have to name every single possible grouping you can come up with, seriously! That makes searching for stuff an absolute disaster, as you have to look for the relevant subfamily, family, superfamily, suborder, order, superorder, hypersuperorder, subclass... etc. All named differently enough to not fit into one convenient Google (or PubMed, or WebofScience) search. And you have to find all of them. And they change. And your life becomes a living hell. Please stop, seriously! WHYYYYY!? Did TC-S write their taxonomies or something?! And they listened to ALL of it?! [/rant]Another fascinating facet of biodiversity that seems to be thoroughly ignored is the interface between kindoms: the breathtaking diversity and strangeness of the possible relationships between the many corners of life. Of course we get the 'animals eat plants' story**, occasionally hear of animal-earing plants. Then we hear of fungi and bacteria as decomposers. If you hang out on the botany side of the Great Divide, you also hear of algae as the aquatic producers and fungi as mycorrhyzal symbionts (plant-fungal relationships are a fascinating world of awesome, by the way). But that's pretty much all ecology you ever get (outside of ecology programs anyways. I hope!), and frankly, it's pretty boring.What about the vast 'multicultural' realm of the customs and ways of the parasites? What about the unexpected mutual endosymbioses, both of multicellular and unicellular things, on both multicellular and unicellular levels? What about multicellular predators, and parasites(!) of unicellular organisms? Or unicellular predators(!) of multicellular organisms? For a case of the latter, let's turn back to our rotifers. By the way, if you're desperate for a tree, or sexy SEMs of rotifer morphological features, this paper could come in handy(free access).*Well, that and any prokaryotic literature. Bacteria are...complicated. Unlike Eukaryotes. ^_^**A while ago while writing a biochem exam, I came across a question starting off with plant lipid synthesis. I got excited (OMG they're mentioning PLANTS!!!). Then I read on: "...which is then consumed by a herbivore." and wanted to throw something at whoever wrote that question. That pretty much sums up the biochemists' and zoologists' view of plants.Quick aside: the border between parasite and predator is quite fuzzy and arbitrary, especially once you venture outside familiar grounds. Generally, people tend to call something a parasite when it feeds of something bigger than itself, and a predator when it feeds off something smaller.Rotifers, like anything else out there, have no choice but to participate in the great web of things eating things. As is the case for many small pond organisms, their predators are plentiful. In fact, there's some rather embarassing ones. Including a relative of this slow thing:(Mine again. Having my own photo stock would save me so much sea...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Since the first planet was found orbiting a star other than the Sun, many more have been discovered using increasingly sensitive instruments and sophisticated techniques. Because they are so faint compared to their parent stars, most planets are discovered through indirect methods. One of the most successful has been the  which uses the principle of the Doppler effect to detect the tiny changes in velocity of a star caused by an orbiting planet.This is the technique used by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher, or , instrument, mounted on the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-m telescope at La Silla in Chile which repeatedly measures the radial velocities of stars that might host planetary systems. On the 19th of October, members of the HARPS team presented their latest results: the discovery of , bringing the total number of known exoplanets to more than 400. The radial velocity technique is most sensitive to large planets orbiting close to their parent star, but due to its high precision HARPS is capable of detecting smaller planets known as super-Earths. The new batch of exoplanets range in size from just five times the mass of the Earth to up to 10 times the mass of Jupiter.HARPS has been largely responsible for the detection of 24 of the 28 known planets with masses below 20 times that of Earth and has now discovered more than 75 of the 400 , making it the most productive current planet finder. However, HARPS will soon have competition in the form of , a NASA satellite launched in March with the aim of detecting Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, the region around a star where water can exist as a liquid.; Rather than measuring the wobble of stars, Kepler will monitor their brightness looking for the tiny dips in intensity caused by planetary transits....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forces of darkness keep trying to suck me back into the debate, but I‚Äôve said about everything I have to say on this topic.¬† I will summarize my views one last time and move on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. I see faith and science as epistemically incompatible, though of course some religious people can accept evolution and some scientists can be religious.¬† This cognitive dissonance does not, however, show anything more than that people can simultaneously hold in their heads two philosophically incompatible approaches to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. I think the National Center for Science Education and other scientific organizations should make &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; statements about the compatibility of science and religion.¬† When they insist on this compatibility, they are engaging in theology.¬† And if they must say something about compatibility, let them recognize that a large fraction of scientists see science and faith as &lt;em&gt;incompatible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.¬† I applaud religious people like Kenneth Miller when they fight against creationism, and I join them as an ally in that battle.¬† But I reserve the right to criticize them when they try to maintain that both faith and science are valid ways of understanding the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.¬† I see no conclusive evidence that vocal atheism is forcing Americans to choose between science and religion, pushing them back into the creationist corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.¬† I think that, in the long run, the best way to rid our country of creationism ‚Äî and, more important, of irrational views on many issues like stem cell research, condoms as preventors of HIV, and the like ‚Äî is to diminish the hold of religion on America.¬† I want Americans to become more rational, and I think that working for atheism is a good way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.¬† People like Dawkins and myself have two goals: diminishing the influence of faith, and helping people accept and see the wonders of evolution.¬† There is no evidence (see #5) that these goals are inimical. But even if they were, that doesn‚Äôt mean that atheists should shut up.¬† If, for example 5% of ‚Äúwaverers‚Äù were forced back to creationism by people like Dawkins (thus yielding ‚Äúanecdotes‚Äù that can be trumpeted on the internet), that doesn‚Äôt mean that atheism has a deleterious rather than a salutary effect on accepting evolution. Similarly, if a godless country eliminates creationism entirely, that doesn‚Äôt mean that the interim retreat of religious ‚Äúwaverers‚Äù to creationism is a bad result.¬† A godless America will be an America without creationism.&lt;/p&gt;

describes it&lt;/a&gt; (read this web page for a lot more information, particularly if you have a Siamese or Himalayan):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siamese cats carry a gene known as the Himalayan gene. This gene is seen in other species, such as the rabbit and the mouse. It is a mutation at the C locus and it causes partial albinism. This gene is recessive to the full colour &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; gene.¬† This means you need two doses of it (homozygous) for the Siamese colour to show up. If you mate a Siamese to a Siamese, you will get Siamese offspring. If you mate a Siamese to a black cat, you will get black offspring which will carry one dose of the Siamese (&lt;em&gt;cs&lt;/em&gt;) gene at the C locus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burmese also shares the same type of gene, which is known as &lt;em&gt;cb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;cs &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; cb genes a&lt;/em&gt;re co-dominant and hence if you mate a Siamese&lt;em&gt; (cs) &lt;/em&gt;to a Burmese&lt;em&gt; (cb) &lt;/em&gt;you will get a Tonkinese &lt;em&gt;(cs/cb), &lt;/em&gt;which has ‚Äúmink‚Äù colouring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gene is heat sensitive, the cooler the area, the darker the colour. Which explains why a Siamese has dark extremities such as the face, tail and legs. The body being the warmest part of the cat remains lighter in colour. You will notice your Siamese get darker in the winter months, especially if your Siamese is an indoor/outdoor cat.¬† Siamese cats are white at birth, this is due to being in the constant warmth of the mothers womb. This colouring varies from Siamese to Siamese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of my friend the British geneticist Steve Jones, here are three pictures of Siamese cats that experienced different temperatures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Siamese:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/siamese1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Siamese" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/siamese1.jpg?w=259&amp;amp;h=300" alt="Siamese" width="259" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Next, Siamese living in a cold environment.¬† Note the heavy dark pigmentation appears more widely over the body:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/darksiamese.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="darksiamese" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/darksiamese.jpg?w=223&amp;amp;h=300" alt="darksiamese" width="223" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;This is a Siamese living in a hotter climate.¬† It‚Äôs almost white, and note the tabby-like pattern that now appears on the tail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/whitesiamese.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="whitesiamese" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/whitesiamese.jpg?w=295&amp;amp;h=300" alt="whitesiamese" width="295" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Finally, someone has shaved his initial into the side of this cat, which then re-grew the fur under cold conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/esiamese1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Esiamese" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/esiamese1.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="Esiamese" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"[M]ost of the candy sold during this season has been dedicated and prayed over by witches,"&lt;/span&gt; Daniels wrote. &lt;span&gt;"I do not buy candy during the Halloween season.

&lt;p&gt;But according to one of the many contrarian nuggets in Jim O'Donnell's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruin-Roman-Empire-New-History/dp/0060787414/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ruin of the Roman Empire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this is the wrong way to look at it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Alexander the Great, a right-minded man even if he did drink too much (according to the common view), sought to conquer all of Persia and succeeded, but he died too soon, and his conquests were lost. Few people spend much time imagining a middle-aged and successful Alexander, a man lucky enough to live as long as Augustus did, let's say. If we knew that man, we would know him not as a Greek or Macedonian, but as a Persian emperor. That is what he set out to become, and that is how he appeared in much of the territory he crossed. At his death, his armies were turning rapidly Persian in composition and form, and they would have become much more so with the passage of only a little time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the language of the (Eastern) Roman Empire was Greek for a millennium or so, perhaps if Alexander had lived, there might have been a "Greek" empire whose language was Persian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;His conquest would have proved what only the Ottomans ever demonstrated‚Äìthat linking the Aegean basin with Asia Minor and Mesopotamia was possible and, if achieved, could have been a source of great power for the one who accomplished the bravura deed. For Alexander to be Macedonian, from the farthest reaches of territory within Persian ken, was no disqualification: conquering rulers in many societies come from the margins, at least as often as from the center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Alexander's Persian empire collapsed after his death and fell into pieces. The Seleucid kings who prevailed in the Asian provinces of Alexander's empire, notional partners to the successor kings who took the name Ptolemy in Egypt and the similar Antigonids in the Aegean basin, proved unable to maintain even the traditional Persian pretensions and range, from Syria to Afghanistan, and were for centuries a limited and dwindling force on the world stage. The Seleucids prevailed for scarcely a century before beginning to give way to the Parthians, based in the Iranian uplands, who went on to dominate central Asia until the third century CE. Landlocked, turned in on itself, never seriously expansive in the west, this Parthia was a great success story in its own right, but the central fact of its existence was its geographic focus, far from the Mediterranean. And that is why the Roman empire could exist. It had no serious Persia to deal with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256986574018"><id gr:original-id="http://www.rigel.org.uk/blog/000262.shtml">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/778707e3a5c4fe63</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">In the news this month... a record-breaking distant cluster</title><published>2009-10-31T05:31:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T05:31:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/v-UUlgjmILg/000262.shtml" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.rigel.org.uk/blog/000262.shtml"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Look deep enough with a sensitive telescope and a seemingly empty patch of sky is full of galaxies. Look closely and you'll see that they are often gathered together in clusters. These massive collections of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe, but it is uncertain how long ago these clusters formed. Now, using a variety of instruments, a team led by Stefano Andreon of the  in Milan, Italy, has  the most distant galaxy cluster ever found.The cluster, known as JKCS041, is located in the constellation of Cetus and lies about 10.2 billion light years away, beating the previous record holder by almost one billion light years. It is so far away that the light now arriving at Earth was produced by the cluster when the universe was only about a quarter of its current age.The astronomers first discovered the galaxy in infra-red observations made with the UK Infra Red Telescope, , in 2006. The optical light from galaxies this far away is shifted into the infra-red part of the spectrum due to the expansion of the universe, so old galaxies like these are often detected by infra-red telescopes. Further observations with both optical and infra-red telescopes confirmed the distance to the object, but could not rule out the possibility that, rather than being a genuine gravitationally bound cluster, the object could just be a chance alignment of galaxies along our line of sight. To test this, the team examined X-ray observations from the  space telescope.Nearby galaxy clusters have extended X-ray emission, caused by hot gas in the space between the galaxies. This gas, known as the hot , is only observed in genuine gravitationally bound clusters of galaxies and so is a good test of whether a group of galaxies just lie along the same line of sight by chance, or are physically associated. When the astronomers examined the Chandra observations of JKCS041, they found a significant amount of extended X-ray emission within the cluster coming from hot gas of the intra-cluster medium, showing that it is a physically connected group of galaxies.This is an important discovery because this is close to the distance limit expected for a galaxy cluster based on how long it should take for them to assemble following the big bang, and studying its characteristics can reveal more about how the universe evolved....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The space between stars is not empty, but filled with a very tenuous gas known as the interstellar medium. As the Sun moves through this gas it emits a fast moving plasma know as the solar wind. These charged particles spread out spherically creating the , a cavity in the interstellar medium swept out by the solar wind.Launched in October 2008, the Interstellar Boundary Explorer, IBEX, was designed to investigate the nature of the interactions between this solar wind and the interstellar medium at the edge of the solar system where the wind hits the ISM and slows down in a  at what is known as the interstellar boundary. This boundary region emits no light so it cannot be detected by conventional telescopes. Models predicted that the shape of the heliosphere resembled a comet, a sphere that was swept back by the Sun's movement through the ISM, but what IBEX found was something different.IBEX was designed to detect particles known as . These start off as ionised atoms in the boundary region where they can pick up electrons and become neutral. Ionsed atoms have electrical charge and are affected by the charged plasma of the solar wind and the magnetic fields that are carried with it. Once they become neutral they are no longer affected by these magnetic fields and travel along straight trajectories. The detectors on IBEX were designed to pick up these energetic neutral atoms coming from the boundary region and over six months of observations, they mapped the whole sky.What the results show is an unexpectedly bright ribbon of emission running almost 360 degrees around the sky, a feature that was not predicted by models of the heliosphere. This ribbon is thought to be where charged particles are becoming bunched at the boundary. The reason for this is not certain, although David McComas, IBEX's principle investigator, suggests that it could be caused by the magnetic fields of the Milky Way's own galactic wind interacting with the heliosphere.The , published in the journal Science during October, put the observations of the Voyager spacecraft in context. The two Voyager probes were launched in 1977 and are currently traveling through the interstellar boundary region where the energetic neutral atoms originate. While the results from IBEX match what the Voyager probes are encountering, the bright strip discovered by IBEX runs right between the positions of the two spacecraft. Eric Christian, IBEX deputy mission scientist at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Centre likens this effect to having two weather stations which miss a big storm passing directly between them. The ribbon has also been detected in data from the Cassini spacecraft, although at different energies to the particles detected by IBEX. While it seems clear that the true shape of the heliosphere is somewhere between a comet and a perfect sphere, much more modeling is needed....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

There were lots of other things going on at my other online locale, and this topic is such old hat for so many that I really wasn‚Äôt sure if it was worth bothering with. My reluctance may also be, sadly, because I‚Äôve become a bit jaded at the nastiness that anti-vaccine groups such as &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., ‚ÄúJenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey‚Äôs Autism Organization‚Äù‚Äìat least these days) and its erstwile founder J.B. Handley routinely lay down when someone points out that the emperor has no clothes, that vaccines do not cause autism. I‚Äôm referring, of course, to Amy Wallace, who wrote &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_anti-vaccine_war_on_science_an_epide.php"&gt;what is the best example&lt;/a&gt; of an article in the mainstream media about the anti-vaccine movement that ‚Äúgets it.‚Äù The article was called &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience"&gt;An Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us All&lt;/a&gt; and appeared in WIRED Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a thing of beauty. There was no false ‚Äúbalance‚Äù that puts cranks pushing dangerous pseudoscience on the same plane as real scientists like Paul Offit. There was even a section &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience_misinformants"&gt;calling out purveyors of vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. Several luminaries of the the anti-vaccine movement were there, including ones discussed frequently on this blog, like Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. But that wasn‚Äôt all! There was even a section on &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience_argument"&gt;how to debunk anti-vaccine canards&lt;/a&gt;. What more could an advocate of science-based medicine ask for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read Wallace‚Äôs article, I knew she was going to be in for a rough time. The anti-vaccine movement doesn‚Äôt take kindly to criticism. Indeed, I even warned the publicist who had e-mailed a bunch of bloggers, including me, about the article that I hoped she was ready for a ‚Äúshitstorm‚Äù (the exact word I used). After all, I‚Äôve been the &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/05/david-gorski-md.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/dr-david-gorski-and-his-merry-band-of-idiots-dont-like-full-page-ads.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;J.B. Handley‚Äôs wrath&lt;/a&gt; on more than one occasion. He‚Äôs particularly fond of trying to poison my Google reputation when I annoy him sufficiently, and one time either he or someone inspired by one of his attacks on me actually e-mailed my cancer center director a link to his screed. In fact, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if J.B. posts another similar smear after this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the publicist said she and Wallace were ready. Well, as an i&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114249382"&gt;nterview on NPR with Wallace has shown&lt;/a&gt;, the ‚Äúshitstorm‚Äù has arrived, and it is just as disgusting and vile as the term implies, complete with misogyny and sexism. Fellow SBM blogger David Kroll &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/dr-david-gorski-and-his-merry-band-of-idiots-dont-like-full-page-ads.html"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; how effective Wallace‚Äôs article was, and now a list of attacks on Wallace has been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/10/wired_posts_amy_wallace_loveha.php"&gt;compiled&lt;/a&gt; from Wallace‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/msamywallace"&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been called stupid, greedy, a whore, a prostitute, and a ‚Äúfking lib.‚Äù I‚Äôve been called the author of ‚Äúheinous tripe.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.B. Handley, the founder of Generation Rescue, the anti-vaccine group that actress Jenny McCarthy helps promote, sent an essay title‚Äù ‚ÄúPaul Offit Rapes (intellectually) Amy Wallace and Wired Magazine.‚Äù In it, he implied that Offit had slipped me a date rape drug. ‚ÄúThe roofie cocktails at Paul Offit‚Äôs house must be damn good,‚Äù he wrote. Later, he sent a revised version that omitted rape and replaced it with the image of me drinking Offit‚Äôs Kool-aid. That one was later posted at the anti-vaccine blog Age of Autism. You can read that blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/wired-magazine-and-amy-wallace-drink-paul-offits-kool-aid.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay classy, J.B. Stay classy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs exactly the behavior from Mr. Handley that we‚Äôve come to know and despise. Indeed, J.B. recently &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=465"&gt;smeared our very own Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;. This is the sort of behavior that we expect from the anti-vaccine movement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôll think differently ‚Äúif you live to grow up.‚Äù I‚Äôve been warned that ‚Äúthis article will haunt you for a long time.‚Äù Just now, I got an email so sexually explicit that I can‚Äôt paraphrase it here. Except to say it contained the c-word and a reference to dead fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve already discussed how Paul Offit has suffered from &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=220"&gt;attempted intimidation and death threats from the anti-vaccine movement&lt;/a&gt;. In this, the anti-vaccine is very much like the Animal Liberation Front or other animal rights groups, wielding intimidation to keep scientists from speaking out. Their level of understanding science is about at the same level, as well. But it‚Äôs not just Paul Offit. I‚Äôm currently reading Michael Specter‚Äôs new book &lt;em&gt;Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives&lt;/em&gt;. (Why is it that books like this always require such a long and unwieldy subtitle? Heck, even Suzanne Somers‚Äô book is called &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2244"&gt;Knockout: Interviews with Doctors Who Are Curing Cancer‚ÄìAnd How to Prevent Getting It in the First Place&lt;/a&gt;. Word to publishers: Stop it! But I digress.) In &lt;em&gt;Denialism&lt;/em&gt;, Specter includes a solid chapter about the anti-vaccine movement,&lt;em&gt; Vaccines and the Great Denial&lt;/em&gt;, and in that chapter he describes how Marie McCormick, who led the Institute of Medicine panel that produced a seminal report in 2004 scientifically exonerating vaccines as a cause of autism suffered from similar harassment. She now has a guard posted near her office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs the M.O. of the anti-vaccine movement. Unable to win on science, they try to win through intimidation and smears. As a result, scientists are reluctant to go into autism research, because they quite understandably don‚Äôt want the hassle of dealing with the attacks. Ditto vaccine science. After all, all one has to do is to look at the examples of Paul Offit and Marie McCormick to understand why public health officials shy away from getting involved and especially from speaking out in defense of science and against fear mongering. The same is also true of journalists. Indeed, the reaction of the anti-vaccine movement to Wallace‚Äôs piece makes me wonder if part of the reason for so much of the false balance and the apparent reluctance of journalists to call out Jenny McCarthy and put her on the spot in an interview has anything to do with the fear. It‚Äôs a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have to admit that I was quite amused by J.B.‚Äôs attack on Wallace in the anti-vaccine crank blog Age of Autism, though. It was full of whining and bits that show such a complete lack of self-awareness on J.B.‚Äôs part that it was &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/wired-magazine-and-amy-wallace-drink-paul-offits-kool-aid.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;truly hilarious to behold&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a sampling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúMs. Wallace appears to have gone exclusively to Google University to research her feeble attempt at describing a very complex topic.‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt; I just about spit out my coffee all over my lovely MacBook Pro when I read this. Given that the ‚Äúspokesperson‚Äù for Generation Rescue, Jenny McCarthy, is perhaps the best known user and abuser of the University of Google, a use and abuse that have led her to make gut-bustingly funny manglings of science like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/jenny_mccarthy_shows_off_her_knowledge_o.php"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, J.B.‚Äôs statement took my irony meter and fried that sucker into a puddle of molten metal and rubber, and even that was quivering in fear of another assault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúI grow so weary of pointing out the same logical fallacies, misstatements, and outright factual errors that many journalists make when covering this debate, it‚Äôs going to be a struggle for my stamina to analyze her tripe in detail.‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt; This is one of the rare areas where I‚Äôm in agreement with J.B., just not in the way he thinks. In fact, I think I‚Äôve used that very sentence, or a variation thereof, when beginning more than one post about some nonsense published on J.B.‚Äôs anti-vaccine blog Age of Autism, because I do get tired of pointing out the same logical fallacies, misstatements, and outright factual errors that each and every blogger at AoA‚Äìnay, every anti-vaccine zealot I‚Äôve ever encountered!‚Äìroutinely parrots. J.B. is no exception; in fact, he spews more than usual, for instance his monumentally not-even-wrong project ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt;.‚Äù But I keep doing it, because, well, it‚Äôs become my duty. In fact, I‚Äôm going to have to exercise some of that patience and stamina right here because J.B once again serves up a huge heapin‚Äô helpin‚Äô of logical fallacies, misstatements, and outright factual errors. As usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúThe main targets of our movement are the CDC, AAP, and vaccine makers. Offit is an annoying sideshow, nothing more. He‚Äôs annoying because of articles like yours. He didn‚Äôt cause my son‚Äôs autism, and he has nothing to do with my son‚Äôs recovery.‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt; For Dr. Offit‚Äôs supposedly being someone that J.B. doesn‚Äôt consider very important, who is an ‚Äúannoying sideshow,‚Äù J.B.‚Äôs blog and organization sure do expend a lot of verbiage attacking him. In fact, a quick &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;as_q=&amp;amp;as_epq=Paul+Offit&amp;amp;as_oq=&amp;amp;as_eq=&amp;amp;num=50&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_filetype=&amp;amp;ft=i&amp;amp;as_sitesearch=ageofautism.com&amp;amp;as_qdr=all&amp;amp;as_rights=&amp;amp;as_occt=any&amp;amp;cr=&amp;amp;as_nlo=&amp;amp;as_nhi=&amp;amp;safe=active"&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; for ‚ÄúPaul Offit‚Äù in the domain ageofautism.com pulled up over 1,000 hits. Just this week, J.B. launched a hilariously off-base attack entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/dr-paul-offit-the-autism-expert-doesnt-see-patients-with-autism.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, The Autism Expert. Doesn‚Äôt See Patients with Autism?&lt;/a&gt; So hilariously self-unaware was J.B. in that post that earlier this week I seriously thought of doing a parody of it substituting Andrew Wakefield for Paul Offit. After all, Wakefield doesn‚Äôt see children with autism either. He‚Äôs been a ‚Äúresearcher‚Äù (and a truly &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/the_autism_omnibus_the_difference_betwee.php"&gt;incompetent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield-deer.htm"&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/solved/solved.htm"&gt;likely fraudulent one&lt;/a&gt; at that) ever since he finished his training. These days, Wakefield lends his anti-vaccine cred to &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thoughtful House&lt;/a&gt;, where he can‚Äôt see patients because of that pesky problem of having decided to flee the consequences of his large part in the promotion of the myth that the MMR vaccine causes autism, resulting in a plunge in vaccination rates and the resurgence of measles in the U.K. over the last decade, and not having a medical license. Sadly, other things got in my way. Or maybe not so sadly. I‚Äôm better at humor and sarcasm than parody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúOffit actually has proven to be quite helpful ‚Äì he‚Äôs the poster boy for the other side, which means his faults become the other side‚Äôs faults.‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt; Project much, J.B.? Actually, it‚Äôs J.B. and his ilk who try to make Offit the poster boy for all the imagined and exaggerated faults fo the ‚Äúother side.‚Äù Besides, every conspiracy movement needs a villain. For 9/11 Truther‚Äôs it‚Äôs the U.S. government (and sometimes the Mossad). For creationists, it‚Äôs Richard Dawkins. For the anti-vaccine movement, it‚Äôs Paul Offit, for much the same reason that Richard Dawkins is made into the villain by creationists and fundamentalists. They both dare to speak out against popular pseudoscience and don‚Äôt back down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his post, it‚Äôs also hard not to point out that J.B. does inadvertently demonstrate why any reasonable person should consider him anti-vaccine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are you boring readers with misguided psychobabble? You could have used this time to read some of the science on our side of the fence which is also peer-reviewed! Clean water, toilets, and refrigerators eradicated disease, or at least 98% of it, I‚Äôll give vaccines credit for the final 2% ‚Äî and a whole lotta‚Äô autism, allergies, and other demylenating illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Just wow. I‚Äôd really like to see what ‚Äúpeer-reviewed‚Äù evidence from ‚Äúhis side‚Äù that J.B. has that shows that it was not vaccines but rather clean water, toilets, and refrigerators that eradicated ‚Äú98%‚Äù of infectious disease or that vaccines cause a ‚Äúwhole lotta autism allergies, and other demyelinating diseases.‚Äù Here‚Äôs hint one for J.B.: Peer-reviewed doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs necessarily &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; research. It‚Äôs a minimum standard, and the ‚Äúresearch‚Äù that J.B. cites has, without an exception that I‚Äôve ever seen, been &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;uniformly awful&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;Monkey business&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1989"&gt;anyone&lt;/a&gt;?) As I pointed out with the most recent assault on science by the anti-vaccine movement, namely the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1989"&gt;execrable monkey study&lt;/a&gt; being touted as evidence that thimerosal in the hepatitis B vaccine causes ‚Äúneurological damage‚Äù (an anti-vaccine code word in its ‚Äúresearch‚Äù for ‚Äúautism‚Äù), peer reviewers are routinely mislead by various studies by anti-vaccine cranks because they don‚Äôt know the subtext for these studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs another thing that J.B.‚Äôs comment makes me wonder about. He gets very indignant when he is called anti-vaccine. He inevitably whines that he is not ‚Äúanti-vaccine‚Äù but ‚Äúpro-safe vaccine‚Äù or some variant thereof. I have to wonder, though. If J.B. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; thinks that vaccines are only responsible for a mere 2% of the elimination of infectious disease‚ÄìI mean, really, really &lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; it right down to the depths of his soul‚Äìwhy doesn‚Äôt he just come right out and admit that he‚Äôs anti-vaccine? After all, if he believes that vaccines cause an ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù of autism, demyelinating diseases, and allergies, all for the benefit of a mere 2% when it comes to infectious diseases, then why not just say he is against vaccines because they don‚Äôt do any good and do a lot of harm? That‚Äôs what he just said, and I have no reason to believe he‚Äôs lying. Let‚Äôs put it this way. If I believed as J.B. apparently does, if I believed that vaccines were responsible for at most 2% of the elimination of infectious diseases and at the same time caused an ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù of autism, demyelinating diseases, and other severe consequences, you can bet that I‚Äôd come out and say I was against vaccination. It would be a reasonable stance based on unreasonable beliefs about the dangers of vaccines. But I don‚Äôt believe anything of the sort. The scientific evidence simply doesn‚Äôt support J.B.‚Äôs assertions. I also suspect that, deep down J.B. doesn‚Äôt entirely believe these things either. If he truly does believe that vaccines do so little good and cause so much harm, his self-delusion would have to exceed even his obnoxiousness. Maybe it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, the evidence that vaccines played a major role in the elimination of diseases is incontrovertible. Smallpox was not eliminated by better sanitation and refrigeration. It was eliminated by a vaccine. The incidence of measles didn‚Äôt plunge dramatically primarily because of better sanitation or refrigeration; it plunged because of the introduction of an effective vaccine. (Unfortunately, this progress is being endangered by the misinformation being spread by the likes of J.B. Handley and the pseudoscience of quacks like Andrew Wakefield.) The incidence of invasive &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt; type B (Hib) disease didn‚Äôt plunge in the early 1990s because of better sanitation or refrigeration. Sanitation and refrigeration were just fine in the late 1980s. The incidence of severe Hib plunged because of a vaccine‚Äìindeed, to the point where younger pediatricians have never even seen a case of HiB. This is a good thing, although I‚Äôm not so sure J.B. would agree. Either that, or he‚Äôd try to claim that it wasn‚Äôt the vaccine, which is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.B. also can‚Äôt stand strong, principled disagreement with him. Like all people, he doesn‚Äôt like to be told he is wrong. The difference is that he reacts to criticism by attacking the person doing the criticism, not by refuting him with evidence. That‚Äôs because he can‚Äôt use evidence; his position is unsupportable by science. J.B. also has a huge amount of what appears to me to be a mixture of envy and contempt for the scientists who tell him he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about. Indeed, this is what he‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/04/dr-steven-novella-why-is-this-so-hard-to-understand.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not intellectually intimidated by any of these jokers. Their degrees mean zippo to me, because I knew plenty of knuckleheads in college who went on to be doctors, and they‚Äôre still knuckleheads (I also knew plenty of great, smart guys who went on to be doctors and they‚Äôre still great, smart guys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose a different path and went into the business world. In the business world, having a degree from a great college or business school gets you your first job, and not much else. There are plenty of Harvard Business School grads who have bankrupted companies and gone to jail, and plenty of high school drop-outs who are multi-millionaires. Brains and street-smarts win, not degrees, arrogance, or entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, as I said before, to J.B., it‚Äôs all about ‚Äúelitism.‚Äù He honestly seems to believe that the reason the scientific community doesn‚Äôt accept his wild beliefs that vaccines cause autism is because of elitism and groupthink, not because the scientific evidence doesn‚Äôt support that belief. Unlike the case for scientists, it never occurs to him that maybe‚Äìjust maybe‚Äìhe might be wrong. It never occurs to him that the reason he is viewed with such disdain among scientists is because, well, he &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; wrong. But not just wrong, spectacularly, dangerously, and arrogantly wrong about the science. Truly, he is full of the arrogance of ignorance, and thinks that his success in the business world (or, as he puts it, his ‚Äúbrains and street smarts‚Äù) means that he can figure vaccines out. He can‚Äôt. Brains and street smarts count for little in science without a background understanding of science and acceptance of the scientific method, neither of which J.B. has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing Amy Wallace gets completely right is described in her &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114249382"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with NPR :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wallace calls part of the discourse that has followed her article ‚Äúa bullying tactic.‚Äù She points to JB Handley, founder of Generation Rescue ‚Äî which contends that too many vaccines are given too soon and blames autism on vaccines ‚Äî for many attacks against her in the blogosphere. She says such tactics dissuade many scientists from taking a stand in the debate. It is important to speak out against those tactics, she says, adding that she has been commenting regularly about the issue on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed it is important to stand up to bullies, and Wallace has done just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, I have to wonder if the anti-vaccine movement is becoming its own worst enemy. As the science keeps marching in that shows no connection between vaccines and autism and lends no support to the concept that vaccines are ineffective and dangerous promoted by the anti-vaccine movement, groups like Generation Rescue are becoming more shrill and even more quacktastic than ever. In doing so, they further marginalize themselves. Quite correctly, their behavior leads reasonable and scientific people to dismiss them more and more. Unfortunately, when that happens, all that leaves is abuse and bullying as tactics to intimidate those who speak out against them.&lt;/p&gt;

The date was October 30, 1938. But soon after 8pm, panic broke out. The reason was that radio newscasters were reporting that the Martians had landed in Grovers Mill. . .and they were out for blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcast could be heard across the U.S. but it was those closest to ground zero of the Martian invasion who reacted the most as they could immediately identify the locales mentioned in the reports. Then they decided to fight back against the unwelcome visitors. This was their town and they weren‚Äôt going to let the Martians take it from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it turned out that there were no Martians. There never were. And those heard on the radio were not even real newscasters. They were radio play actors reading a script written by Howard Koch, loosely based on H.G. Wells‚Äô classic book, &lt;cite&gt;The War of the Worlds. &lt;/cite&gt;The project was produced by a then twenty-three-year-old Orson Welles. And the whole thing was broadcast from the New York City studio of the Columbia Broadcasting System‚Äôs Mercury Theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably the greatest hoax in U.S., &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_martian_panic_sixty_years_later_what_have_we_learned/"&gt;Robert E. Bartholomew suggests this notorious historical event offers us a powerful lesson&lt;/a&gt; about memory, eye-witness testimony, self-deception, and mass delusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his famous study of the Martian panic, Princeton University psychologist Hadley Cantril discusses the extreme variability of eyewitness descriptions of the ‚Äúinvasion.‚Äù These examples have been usually overlooked in subsequent popular and scholarly discussions of the panic. One person became convinced that they could smell the poison gas and feel the heat rays as described on the radio, while another became emotionally distraught and felt a choking sensation from the imaginary ‚Äúgas‚Äù (Cantril 1947, 94-95). During the broadcast several residents reported observations to police ‚Äúof Martians on their giant machines poised on the Jersey Palisades‚Äù (Markush 1973, 379). After checking various descriptions of the panic, Bulgatz (1992, 129) reported that a Boston woman said she could actually see the fire as described on the radio; other persons told of hearing machine gun fire or the ‚Äúswish‚Äù sound of the Martians. A man even climbed atop a Manhattan building with binoculars and described seeing ‚Äúthe flames of battle.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event also reminds us that the human mind does not function like a video camera capturing each piece of data that comes into its field of vision. People interpret information as it is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a skeptic who remains unconvinced of the supernatural, the paranormal, or the invisible strings of grand conspirators, I‚Äôm no stranger to the appeal to anecdotal evidence. I‚Äôve frequently heard fantastical tales from those who swear to have truly encountered the unbelievable. And my demands for physical evidence are often met with the rolling eyes of true believers who think I‚Äôve set the bar for evidence too high so as to be out of reach. They‚Äôll insist that no amount of evidence would convince me and that I‚Äôd still deny these phenomena even if an angel/ghost/extraterrestrial/Reptilian/agent of the New World Order showed up at my door. And to this, I respond that this is an unfair assessment considering I‚Äôve been offered no evidence even remotely as compelling as that which they‚Äôve invented in their hypothetical scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The religious ask me to account for all the reported miracles and angel sightings, etc. from trustworthy witnesses. The paranormalists ask me to account for all the reported ghost and UFO sightings from trustworthy witnesses such as air force pilots or police officers as well as all the alleged ‚Äúpsychic‚Äù claims that the ‚Äúpsychic‚Äù ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt possibly have known.‚Äù The UFO crowd The ‚Äúalternative‚Äù ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù proponents ask me to account for all the reported cases of a person appearing to get well after seeing faith healers, psychic surgeons, acupuncturists, homeopaths, herbal supplement dealers, etc. And the grand conspiracy theorists ask me to account for all the little details from ‚Äúthe official story‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt seem to ‚Äúadd up‚Äù like why did that one newscaster report the wrong gun after the Kennedy assassination, or why can I see the letter C on the moon rock, or why did the guy yell ‚ÄúPull it!‚Äù before WTC 7 collapsed, or why did one 9/11 eyewitness from the ground report that he distinctly saw X number of engines on the plane that struck the Towers when video footage clearly shows that there were Y number of engines on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of these types of claims have been thoroughly and definitively debunked, the truth is that often I don‚Äôt have all the answers and that sometimes it‚Äôs impossible to arrive at a more plausible and rational alternative explanation without having either been there or more famous cases, having at least done extensive research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing that I don‚Äôt find compelling‚Äìand the Grovers Mill case illustrates why‚Äìis the argument that there were just too many witnesses for X to have not really happened or have been a mere misinterpretation. Maybe there was a real historical Jesus and there really were five hundred witnesses who thought they saw miracles. Unfalsifiable. Maybe Joseph Smith really did have twelve witnesses who sincerely believed they‚Äôd seen divine revelation. Meaningless. Maybe that Pilot Kenneth Arnold did really see craft that he couldn‚Äôt identify in 1947 and believed were from out of this world. Scientifically worthless. Maybe the townspeople of Roswell, New Mexico and Major Jesse Marcel really did believe they saw a crash flying saucer or saucers. Tell that to the town of Grovers Mills. Maybe Betty and Barney Hill truly believed they were abducted by space aliens. So what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human perception and memory reconstruction are deeply flawed and easily susceptible to suggestion (Ex. &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4852659n"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4852677n"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/two-mass-delusions-in-new-england/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Here‚Äôs another account of a witness of the great Grovers Mills Martian invasion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These memories are not statically locked away in the brain forever, but our memories of events are reconstructed over time (Loftus and Ketcham, 1991). Cantril (1947) cited the case of Miss Jane Dean, a devoutly religious woman, who, when recalling the broadcast, said the most realistic portion was ‚Äúthe sheet of flame that swept over the entire country. That is just the way I pictured the end‚Äù (181). In reality, there was no mention of a sheet of flame anywhere in the broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ufology_2009_a_six-decade_perspective"&gt;the history of UFO sightings&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning there were sightings, and those sightings began with private pilot Kenneth Arnold on June 24, 1947. As soon as news stories appeared reporting Arnold‚Äôs claim that he saw nine airborne objects that flew ‚Äúlike a saucer if you skip it across the water,‚Äù others began reporting seeing the ‚Äúsaucers‚Äù too (a curious development, since Arnold did not say that the objects looked like saucers‚Äîthey looked like boomerangs, he said‚Äîbut skipped like saucers, a subtlety lost in the public‚Äôs imagination). Soon sightings of ‚Äúsaucers‚Äù were pouring in from all around the country and from around the world. Sightings occurred in waves, which appeared to be fueled by media reports. A wave would typically start in one location, but as soon as news reports began to carry the story of the localized excitement, sightings activity would pick up nationally. Great waves of UFO sightings occurred in 1947, 1949, 1952, 1957, 1965‚Äî67, and 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in 1973, there was a significant drop-off in the number of reported UFO sightings. Then after the release of Stephen Spielberg‚Äôs Close Encounters of the Third Kind, all of a sudden, the UFOs returned in droves. What are the odds? And it turns out that a pattern emerges. It seems the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8205424.stm"&gt;UFOs seem to always resurface every time Hollywood has renewed interest in aliens&lt;/a&gt;. I guess the movies on their planet are all directed by Joel Schumacher, so they have to traverse the whole universe to see anything good. And there was a time when aliens were always described as being little green men. Then after the Hill case, all of a sudden, the little green men stopped visiting and sent their friends the big-eyed Grays instead. What we‚Äôre seeing here, as with religions, is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt; evolution. It seems like we‚Äôre seeing exactly what we‚Äôd expect to see if all these weird paranormal events were nothing but a self-perpetuating mass delusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People create &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/falsememory.html"&gt;false memories&lt;/a&gt;. This is the horrible reality of eyewitness testimony. Sometimes honest, well-meaning people simply get it wrong. They see or experience something strange or unexplained and their brain fills in details based on their own prejudices or expectations. This is how the real power of suggestion works. If your primed to think weird lights in the sky is a flying saucer, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll perceive it to be. And if you‚Äôre primed to think aliens are gray with big eyes, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with anecdotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/NPqerbz8KDc%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0%26hd%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test your skills as an eyewitness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch &lt;a href="http://viscog.beckman.illinois.edu/flashmovie/15.php"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; and see if you can count how many times the players in the white shirt pass the ball around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not read on until you‚Äôve done this. This is more tricky than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, did you see the gorilla?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs another test of your eyewitness skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/voAntzB7EwE%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0%26hd%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A long-time friend of the JREF who, for the purposes of this article shall remain nameless, recently went to Paris to visit the famous P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, eternal resting place of luminaries such as Jim Morisson, Chopin, and Oscar Wilde. During this visit, our friend visited the grave of¬† &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Hahnemann"&gt;Samuel Hahnemann&lt;/a&gt;, the father of homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grave, though elaborate and well-kept, was missing a certain something. It seemed... lonely somehow, and our friend thought she could fix that right up. I can't help but imagine Wilde chortling in his coffin. Could it be that they landed in search of water, and nothing else?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256965085186"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/check_out_palmd_getting_his_sw.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19010c3c3eaed177</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Check Out PalMD Getting His Swine Flu Shot...</title><published>2009-10-31T05:00:27Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T05:00:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/JX2tMK6WqXk/check_out_palmd_getting_his_sw.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/check_out_palmd_getting_his_sw.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;...cause the look on his face is hilarious.

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Isis has taken a much needed break from science today and has spent much of the afternoon engrossed in the first season of Lost.  I'm not gonna lie.  As soon as I am done here, I am going right back to episode 14.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, my mailbox is full of wonderful things you've sent me.  I'd like to share some of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first comes from &lt;a href="http://motherofallscientists.blogspot.com/"&gt;the Mother of All Scientists&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a whole lot of hotness in that link, including a pair of teal pumps I may need to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next from reader KD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Isis --&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm a loyal reader of your blog (although not generally a commenter ....). I'm a physicist, and have always felt some pressure not to dress too femininely in order to be taken seriously in a world of men. (Although theorists, amusingly, have more femininity-freedom:&lt;br&gt;nobody expects them to need to take a wrench to their experiment at a moment's notice.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been wonderful over the past few years to see rising graduate students presenting at conferences become more inclined to wear makeup and dressy shoes, even if I don't have any particular desire to follow their lead. I'm just not willing to compromise comfort and a degree of effortlessness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which brings me to the expensive-comfy-funky category of shoes. An example would be these boots:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zappos.com/naot-footwear-oyster-sherwood-forrest"&gt;http://www.zappos.com/naot-footwear-oyster-sherwood-forrest&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;but summery counterparts exist as well:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://shoemania.com/Womens-Twins-20863001-Camper/M/B001D1RJ36.htm"&gt;http://shoemania.com/Womens-Twins-20863001-Camper/M/B001D1RJ36.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What sayeth the oracle of shoes?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your muffin,&lt;br&gt;KD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, KD, I sayeth yay to the second pair.¬† The first pair...I will let you know after another glass of wine.¬† I&amp;#39;m trying with the first pair.¬† Do they come with a heel?¬† Maybe with a pair of boot cut jeans.¬† I do like the swirly things and they would make me think of one of my favorite ocean bloggers - Miriam at &lt;a href="http://theoystersgarter.com/"&gt;The Oyster's Garter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This from reader Leslie:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Goddess, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winter is approaching, which for my location, means piles of snow and slush.¬† However, I cannot seem to talk myself out of &lt;a href="http://www.bluefly.com/Nanette-Lepore-black-leather-Flirty-Flower-topstitched-wedges/cat20022/212968800/detail.fly"&gt;these.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is despite the fact that they look like they would be incredibly uncomfortable to walk in and would be rather impractical in the snow...or the lab for that matter.¬† Since the last pair of Nanette Lepore&amp;#39;s you featured on your blog (those delicious red flower pumps a week or two ago) rapidly disappeared from endless.com (curses! I have the perfect occasion to wear them to this weekend too!) , I am hoping that by sharing these with you, they will somehow disappear from bluefly.com, and I will be unable to obsess over them any longer.¬† They might be a bit chunky for your taste, as I have not seen too many wedges in your posts, but I kinda like the contrast of the heavy heel with the more girly top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A devoted follower, &lt;br&gt;Leslie&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Leslie, if you are reading this, go buy those shoes this minute.¬† Do not walk, do not pass Go, do not collect $200.¬† Get those shoes.¬† If all else fails, you can carry them in your bag and change into them when you get inside.¬† Who wants to wear their snow boots all day when there are such lovely shoes available?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last, but certainly not least, these come from a humble worshiper that I met through the deliciously delightful Ed Brayton from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches"&gt;Dispatches from the Culture Wars&lt;/a&gt;.¬† This particularly lovely little muffin writes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dearest Isis:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Having slogged my way through your &amp;quot;have a rant&amp;quot; blog post, I very nearly tossed myself off, well, the couch.¬† In order to sustain myself through another day of mind-numbing financial reports and grant research, I offer you these two delightfully... um... &lt;a href="http://www.stylebubble.co.uk/style_bubble/2009/10/pay-half-trimmings.html"&gt;"festive" shoes:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Smooches,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your Servant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to show you two of the pictures from the link because they made my entire life happy:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/feather%20boa1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="feather boa1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2009/10/feather%20boa1-thumb-350x262-21550.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="262" width="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/feather%20boa2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="feather boa2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2009/10/feather%20boa2-thumb-350x262-21552.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="262" width="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2 A&amp;amp;B: Not only has this person attached a feather boa to her black heels, but she looks like she is standing at a lab bench.¬† How much of a bad ass do you have to be to wear feathered shoes to the lab?¬† The answer?¬† A giant, giant bad ass.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all the delightful offerings, my lovely little muffins.¬† I have a few more Ask Dr. Isis letters to try to get to this weekend, some internet shenanigans to jump into, and a sciencey post or two to get to.¬† In the meantime, let&amp;#39;s not lose site of the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I totally *heart* you folks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/the_stuff_you_send_me.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/rBReKUavhP0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256964955571"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/why_you_should_attend_the_univ.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/90ba845b2b6ad558</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Local"/><title type="html">Why you should attend the University of Minnesota</title><published>2009-10-31T04:49:48Z</published><updated>2009-10-31T04:49:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/xZjrQSEUjLc/why_you_should_attend_the_univ.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/why_you_should_attend_the_univ.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Because we're &lt;a href="http://www.academic.umn.edu/provost/undergrad/2009kakalios.html"&gt;all geeks and nerds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These are questions of order in choice ‚Äî and depending on who you‚Äôre asking, you‚Äôll likely get a different answer about which spot in the picking order is more advantageous.  The issue is whether we can rely on a psychological standard for determining which slot in the order is typically favored by a chooser.

That‚Äôs the good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.¬†¬† The Extension budget &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.connectmidmichigan.com/news/story.aspx?id=370123"&gt;still be cut 44%&lt;/a&gt;, which is a LOT.¬† Part of the problem is that Extension funding is incredibly complex. Between County, State, and Federal inputs, it‚Äôs hard to say what the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; final reductions will be. The&lt;a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/10/30/local-msu-extension-saved-from-closing/"&gt; Ann Arbor Chronicle &lt;/a&gt;has some good coverage of how this plays out at the County office level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is there will be big cuts. In everything.&lt;br&gt;
In fact, most of the big holes in the Michigan budget are &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hn-tCduBOzV_OFVdOMRES18XRH1QD9BLK7401"&gt;backfilled for 6 months by stimulus money&lt;/a&gt;.¬† Which means that nothing is actually resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All State Universities and public education systems will also be cut‚Äìand the pain slightly deferred for now with Stimulus money. From the &lt;a href="http://www.detnews.com/article/20091030/SCHOOLS/910300451/1361/Michigan-State-proposes-shutting-2-departments--cutting-40-programs"&gt;Detroit News&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúMichigan State University has proposed eliminating 40 academic programs and shutting two departments in effort to save the university money‚Ä¶..The recommendations called for eliminating two doctoral programs, two education specialist programs, 13 master‚Äôs programs, four graduate specializations, 16 undergraduate majors and three undergraduate specializations.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the loss of the Canadian Studies major‚Ä¶yeah. BFD.&lt;br&gt;
And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad thing (in the abstract) to have some departmental/program consolidation at the bigger schools.&lt;br&gt;
But disbanding the entire MSU geology department? Didn‚Äôt see that one coming.¬† And when you know the people involved, it‚Äôs a lot harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy that there will be time for people to at least try and plan for the big hit that‚Äôs going to come in 2010 when the stimulus money goes away.¬† And folks are doing their best to put this on a positive spin, and to see good stuff to come from consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

The full PDF text is available from the journal for those of you who like to dig further: The articles published in the journal Cell Transplantation - The Regenerative Medicine Journal over the last two years reveal the recent and future cutting-edge research in the fields of regenerative and transplantation medicine. 437 articles were published from 2007 to 2008, a 17% increase compared to the 373 articles in 2006-2007. - Neuroscience was still the most common section in both the number of articles and the percentage of all manuscripts published. - The increasing interest and rapid advance in bioengineering technology is highlighted by tissue engineering and bioartificial organs being ranked second again. - For a similar reason, the methods and new technologies section increased significantly compared to the last period. Articles focusing on the transplantation of stem cell lineages encompassed almost 20% of all articles published. - By contrast, the non-stem cell transplantation group which is made up primarily of islet cells, followed by biomaterials and fetal neural tissue, etc. comprised less than 15%. - Transplantation of cells pre-treated with medicine or......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

They‚Äôve introduced a new roadmap (there‚Äôs great overview of it with timelines on &lt;a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2009/10/29/mark-your-calendars-planning-for-facebooks-platform-changes-over-the-next-3-6-months/"&gt;Inside Facebook&lt;/a&gt;). Overall I‚Äôm unsure exactly what the new plans they‚Äôve laid out will mean for Facebook customers and developers. I think much of it is good (as does &lt;a href="http://www.insidesocialgames.com/2009/10/30/some-ways-that-facebooks-platform-changes-will-affect-social-gaming/"&gt;Eric Eldon&lt;/a&gt; at Inside Social Games), some of it possibly bad, and the majority depends on details that have not yet been decided and/or announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as Facebook user experience goes, it‚Äôs mostly a big win. They‚Äôre cleaning up the home feed so you‚Äôll no longer be bombarded with friends‚Äô quiz results. That‚Äôs good for everyone who wasn‚Äôt making a quiz app, and even those people had to know it wasn‚Äôt going to last. Facebook is too smart to let third parties degrade their user experience just to turn a quick buck for long. It lasted a few months, which shocked me. I figured they‚Äôd stamp it out sooner than they did, but I think it hit them by surprise (and won‚Äôt again) and they‚Äôve initiated changes that will allow them to do so in the future. It‚Äôs unfortunate too because the feed, used properly by apps, could be great for developers, Facebook users, and Facebook itself, but as with anything so easily abused a race to the bottom occurred and ruined it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virality is the big issue for developers, and I‚Äôm not clear how this is going to be affected overall. Most apps other than quizzes don‚Äôt rely so much on the news stream as they do invites and notifications, so what happens there is going to have a much larger impact on highly engaging, highly viral apps like the ones we try to produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notifications are going to pretty much disappear. User-to-user notifications are mostly gone, being moved to inbox messages that have to be approved by the sender, so there‚Äôs going to be a drastic reduction in those. I can live with that, since it‚Äôs something we game developers didn‚Äôt rely on overly much. Developers will push users to send Facebook messages where possible, but the fact that you‚Äôll have to type each recipient‚Äôs name in by hand will make it much less frequent than invites now, which are easily sent to many friends with just a few clicks using Facebook‚Äôs invite selector widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App-to-user notifications, on the other hand, were a key driver of engagement. People on Facebook frequently install your app (along with 20 others) and then totally forget about its existence. In all of our games we use the app-to-user notification to alert customers that their special daily mission is now available, or something to that effect, and it has a huge impact. If we disable them for awhile, then turn them back on, it will often lead to a 50% traffic boost in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, though, these probably have substantially less effect as people disable them or learn to simply ignore them, so again I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre too key. And if their disappearance makes Facebook itself a little less spammy for everyone, it might be a long run win for all of us as well. The more people enjoy Facebook, the more they‚Äôll use it, and the more they use it the more they‚Äôll use apps built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question, in my mind, is what is going to happen to invites. Facebook says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to consolidate invitations into a special section which will either be located in the &lt;a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Roadmap_Inbox"&gt;Inbox&lt;/a&gt;, and/or in the &lt;a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Roadmap_Dashboards"&gt;Application and Games Dashboards&lt;/a&gt;.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation is key here. What I fear is that they add them to a special section of the Inbox, and don‚Äôt count invites toward the messages total. In that case someone with pending invites, but no other messages, won‚Äôt know they have unresolved actions waiting for them. Their screenshot indicates this will be the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://themaroon.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/image.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://themaroon.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/image_thumb.png?w=409&amp;amp;h=300" width="409" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the user has 490 messages (really?) plus 9 updates and 2 invites, yet up top the count by Inbox shows only 490, indicating it excludes invites and updates. That‚Äôs really bad. On the other hand, the screenshot (which I‚Äôve cropped slightly) actually indicates 4 invites, not 2, so it is possible that this is just a mockup rather than a screenshot of a functional implementation. Let‚Äôs hope that‚Äôs the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if invites are put in the Games dashboard, as it appears they are considering, and therefore are visible from the user‚Äôs home page by default, we may have an overall uptick in acceptance rates which could make up for lost virality on other channels. So I‚Äôm crossing my fingers on this one. It‚Äôs going to come down to details that apparently haven‚Äôt been decided on yet, and the implementation is going to be very key to virality on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also appears as if invite texts may no longer be customizable. This will have the massive effect of getting rid of gifts sent via the invite message. That‚Äôs been a tremendous driver of both engagement and new users for a lot of games, and moving those to messages, where sending one-to-many becomes much more difficult, will have a massive impact. Developers will push these as hard as possible, and they‚Äôll increase the load of messages in your inbox possibly to the extent that they‚Äôll start annoying everyone, but the difficulty in sending them will ensure they don‚Äôt make up for losses on the other big channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also make app naming and icon selection more important as they will be the only thing differentiating your invite from the rest in someone‚Äôs inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the engagement side, the news seems mostly positive. Notifications been replaced by new dashboards that are enabled by default on the homepage and allow you to show users how many updates they have in your game. This is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://themaroon.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/image1.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://themaroon.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/image_thumb1.png?w=437&amp;amp;h=451" width="437" height="451"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there‚Äôs one thing people cannot stand, it‚Äôs seeing that they have new action items they have not yet resolved. It‚Äôs why the progress bars on LinkedIn make people who know they‚Äôre probably never even going to use that site again seek recommendations from friends. It‚Äôs why I think that inbox invites with notifications in the top bar are great, but without them are near-worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if someone bookmarks your app (which they‚Äôve even given us a new button to add to our nag screens to help them do) you‚Äôll be able to bring them back to it better than ever before. That‚Äôs a pretty good thing for developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Facebook is now giving developers the ability to email users directly. I‚Äôm not sure how this is going to shake out. Getting customers to give you permission to email them is not trivial. Sending emails to large numbers of people without ending up exclusively in spam folders is not easy either. On the other hand, having direct communication, not limited and/or filtered by Facebook opens new doors. It will take some time for developers to figure out how to best take advantage of this, but we‚Äôll get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So overall on the engagement front the changes may be a big win. On virality the verdict‚Äôs out, but it may be a small win, or it may be a loss.¬† Potentially a huge one. I suppose we‚Äôll know in a month or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of developers think Facebook is out to kill virality in order to sell us users via advertising. Right now a lot of game makers buy traffic from Facebook‚Äôs self-serve ads. My company supplements our user growth with this, though the lion‚Äôs share still comes in organically. Increasing engagement (and therefore Revenue Per User) would enable developers to place higher bids on customers, resulting in higher CPMs on their ad platform, which are otherwise abysmally-low. Decreasing virality would make ad purchases a necessity to get traffic on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that‚Äôs their goal, it‚Äôs a short-sighted one. It will be a huge deterrent to build on the platform and force developers back to simply building on the web. It will also lead to long-term stagnation. The story of the platform has so far been something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Guy in basement invents the next big app. At first it was pokes/gifts. Then RPGs. Then quizzes, and most recently farm games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Big companies (lately mostly Zynga) copy them, improve, throw millions of dollars worth of marketing/cross promotional muscle at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the guys in basements and who is Zynga going to clone? Once they‚Äôve outbid all of us little guys, who do pretty much all of the innovating, for the traffic then what are they going to spend their ad dollars promoting? The little guys will lose because they won‚Äôt be able to afford the ad¬† buys it takes to get traction. Customers will lose because platform innovation will slow drastically. Zynga will lose because they‚Äôll run out of innovative new ideas to copy. And Facebook will lose because in the end they‚Äôll end up with less ad sales, and less profit from the payment platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it will result in significantly less overall traction on a platform that could probably monetize far better for Facebook through payment processing than ad sales. If Facebook made their payment platform public today, even at a relatively steep fee like 5% of sales I‚Äôd integrate it immediately. It would take a much larger platform for that to be a better business model than ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end I‚Äôm all for Facebook trying to improve their own user experience, and I think in a lot of ways they‚Äôll improve the platform by doing so. I just hope they manage to do it in such a way as to keep virality reasonable, spam low, and independent developers competitive. And if they just want to cash in on the big ad budgets of Zynga, EA, etc., that‚Äôs their prerogative. It‚Äôs their house, so I‚Äôll pack up my toys and go somewhere else. There‚Äôs always that internet thing. &lt;/p&gt;

A proposition that is true has a certain kind of correspondence with the world about which it is making a claim.  A proposition that is false does not have this correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tree is a model for the history of life at the macroevolutionary level. Darwin fully embraced the idea.Trees now being built with DNA sequence data, using improved phylogenetic algorithms and increased computational power. We now have many well-supported phylogenies backed up by multiple lines of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are issues with correlating gene trees with species trees ‚Äî there can be discordance because of coalescence, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some controversy about how much lateral gene transfer confounds the tree model of evolution. Are there parts where the tree model breaks down completely? Some microbiologists argue that archaeobacteria and prokaryote phylogeny can't be fit into a tree; the sensationalist New Scientist cover was shown. Ward thinks it is an exaggeration. Lateral gene transfer occurs, but Wu and Eisen analyzed 31 conserved protein coding genes in archaea and bacteria and a well-resolved phylogeny still emerges. This argues that lateral gene transfer was not so rampant that it obscures the central tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ward showed a diagram from the Creation "Museum", illustrating their belief in an "orchard of life". They need to do a pseudo-phylogenetic analysis to show the "kinds" of life; much of their language has been taken from phylogenetic systematics. He calls it a cargo cult science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do the new molecular phylogenies tell us about evolution. Convergence is widespread; morphology can mislead us about evolutionary history. We're seeing well-supported clades emerging, such as the afrotheria, scattered within old morphological trees. We're also seeing a stronger biogeographic pattern in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have tools for reconstructing ancestral states: we're using molecular/genetic data to infer and reconstruct an ancestral form. We can use this to reconstruct ancestral protein sequences, which can then be synthesized and their biological properties measured. Ward described the work of the Thornton lab on reconstructing glucocorticoid receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phylogenies also provide new insight into concepts of higher, more inclusive taxa. Specific example is the persistence of the dinosaur clade beyond the K/T boundary in the form of birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-pc taxon names: just as the fish taxon excludes tetrapods, inscts seem to be modified crustaceans, butterflies are modified moths, ants are modified wasps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/philip_wardwhat_do_phylogenies.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Gj0F8NmUxVE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256940993599"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/eric_landergenomics_and_darwin.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9db2cc3deacd626d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Eric Lander‚ÄîGenomics and Darwin in the 21st Century</title><published>2009-10-30T21:12:57Z</published><updated>2009-10-30T21:12:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/bwhepPx066w/eric_landergenomics_and_darwin.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/eric_landergenomics_and_darwin.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lander began by saying he wasn&amp;#39;t an evolutionist ‚Äî an interestingly narrow definition of the term. He&amp;#39;s a fan of the research, but considers himself a biomedical geneticist, as if that was something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having entire genomes of many species available for quantitative analysis is going to lead to a qualitative change in the science we can do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gave a pocket summary of the human genome project. Mouse genome followed, then rat and dog, and now have sequence (to varying degrees of completeness) of 44 species, out of 4600 mammals. Within &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt;, there's the hapmap project and the 1000 genomes project, so at least in us we're going for depth and breadth of coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequencing technology is rapidly accelerating. Exponential growth in the number of nucleotides sequenced per year. Exponentially on a log scale! We're developing a tremendous amount of data acquisition capability. We'll be able to address mechanisms of physiology and evolution, and learning about the particulars of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lander focuses on genome-wide studies. Evolutionary conservation is a guide to extracting information from the genome. Showed synteny diagrams of mouse and human, and discussed analyses that allow you to identify highly conserved pieces, bits that might have significant function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of genes is low, 20,500. Early higher numbers he admitted were inflated a bit by prior expectations; when they had a good estimate of 30,000, they decided to waffle and call it 30-40,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If genes are counted by homology, how do we know there aren't many more genes that don't have homology. If that were case, the number of genes in humans would still be close to the estimated numbers in chimp and macacque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also well-conserved non-coding regions in DNA. 5% of the genome is under selection: coding 1.2%, non-coding 3.8%. Found 200 gene poor regions that contain key developmental genes, and many of the conserved non-coding regions are associated with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long intergenic non-coding DNA: pretty much all of the genome is transcribed, but the vast majority of this is simply noise. There about a dozen regions known where transcription of non-coding DNA seem to be conserved evolutionarily, and have some function: they be transcriptional repressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanism of evolutionary innovation in coding genes: examples of whole genome duplication, divergence and loss, all of which can be demonstrated by comparison with an outgroup. Outgroup comparisons can demonstrate whole genome duplications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms of innovation in non-coding regions: about 84% of conserved DNA is shared between marsupials and placentals, suggesting that about 16% of changes are novel. About 15% of placental specific CNEs are derived from transposons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 29 mammalian genomes compared, they have 4 substitutions per site, a detection limit of about 10 bp, and 2.8 million features detected. We have a lot of detail that can be extracted from the data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can find evidence of positive selection. Using chicken as an outgroup, we can identify genes that have undergone major changes in humans but not chimps. Comparision across 29 mammals shows even more. What we're finding is that these evolutionarily significant genes are enriched for developmental genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis within the human species shows that we are a young population that expanded rapidly from a small initial population of 10,000 individuals. Can now screen for associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and disease. We can now screen for 2 million polymorphisms in a single pass on a chip. Have now identified 500 loci associated with common traits. Most have very modest effects and only contribute to a small part of the heritability of the trait. Where is all the missing heritability? Missing loci, missing alleles, and non-additive effects of loci.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive selection in human history: can use hapmap data to find 300 regions with outlier distributions that suggest they have been the target of selection. Combining statistical tests narrows the specificity of identification to a size roughly equal to a single gene making it possible to identify specific genes with an interesting selective history (work in press by Pardis Sabeti). There are themes: many of these genes are involved in resisting infectious disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genomics is experiencing an explosion of data that represents a huge opportunity for future discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/eric_landergenomics_and_darwin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/bwhepPx066w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256940993599"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/jerry_coynespeciation_problems.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a625caf87a0400dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Jerry Coyne‚ÄîSpeciation: Problems and Prospects</title><published>2009-10-30T20:10:46Z</published><updated>2009-10-30T20:10:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/BSUyiMAmTac/jerry_coynespeciation_problems.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/jerry_coynespeciation_problems.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Jerry mentioned to me that he noticed my earlier blog posts on the meeting, and thought I wasn't being critical enough. So I think that means I'm supposed to let my inner beast out for this one. (Nah, actually, it's because I'm in note-taking transcription mode while listening to these talks. I have to digest them for a bit before I can do any synthesis.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the biogeography of speciation? Can one species split into two while splitting into two? Allopatric speciation: no gene exchange; Parapatric: limited exchange; Sympatric: free gene exchange. Allopatric is sort of the dogma of evolutionary biology. Everybody assumes gene flow and biogeography are the same thing, but they really aren't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody contests whether allopatric speciation happens, the question is simply how often it happens. Species concept Coyne uses: groups of interbreeding populations that show substantial reproductive isolation from other forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is there a controversy about biogeography? Darwin's concept was largely sympatric. The existence of species in the same area implies that they arose in the same area (clearly not necessarily true). The environment is regarded as important. There haven't been enough opportunities for allopatric speciation -- not that many barriers in the history of the world. Speciation is relatively difficulty with gene flow. Biologists opinions about geography have been conditioned by their own histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we estimate the frequencies of these different kinds of speciation? We have so many indubitable examples of allopatric speciation. Conditions are present everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parapatric speciation: conditions are fairly easy, but data from nature is sparse and hard to get. Need evidence of clinal differentiation or evidence that allopatry never happened (which would be very hard to do). One example given: cave salamanders, two species, that abut a surface species, enabling a path for gene flow. Can't entirely rule out the possibility of an allopatric speciation event in their history, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easier to find evidence for the most controversial pattern, sympatric speciation. Theoretically supportable, and there are also experiments that demonstrate in the lab (with unlikely requirements, such as the complete lethality of intermediates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criteria for verifying sympatric speciation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete or substantial sympatry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True sister taxa not based on hybridization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substantial reproductive isolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History of taxa must make allopatry unlikely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polyploidy. Up to 70% of angiosperm species have a polyploidization event somewhere in their ancestry. May still require allopatry to keep hybrids from being diluted out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Homoploid hybrid speciation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Parasitic indigobirds imprint on the song of the father, so laying eggs in different host yields individuals that only breed with individuals with similar stepparents.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Palms on Lord Howe Island: very small island, so necessarily sympatric. Reproductive isolation by flowering time depending on soil type offers an alternative explanation, though: it reduces gene flow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coyne doesn't regard this as true sympatric speciation because there was some kind of trickery that set up a reproductive barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about cases that satisfy the case of gene flow while speciation occurs? Under these stringent criteria, Coyne thinks 5 cases satisfy. The best cases are cichlids in crater lakes in Cameroon and Nicaragua. &lt;i&gt;Littorina&lt;/i&gt;, banded molluscs that live in different tidal zones. &lt;i&gt;Rhagoletis&lt;/i&gt;, the apple maggot fly, may not be the best case; they eclose at different times depending on the fruit on which they are laid, which represents a reproductive barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no doubt that allopatric and peripatrica speciation occur
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Parapatric speciation may occur, but evidence is hard to come by
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Sympatric speciation is theoretically feasible, but‚Ä¶
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
The few studies that suggest sympatic speciation occurs suggest that it only occurs rarely&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Stuart McGill, PhD. Human Kinetics, 2007. 312 pages.¬†

Dr. Stuart McGill and his immense research based out of the University of Waterloo, Ontario can be summarized in this 2nd edition of Low Back Disorders.¬† Although, the back is often seen as complex by many health professions alike, Dr. McGill‚Äôs book helps to put things into a perspective which is easy to understand. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1- ‚ÄúScientific Foundation‚Äù, part 2- ‚ÄúInjury Prevention‚Äù and part 3- ‚ÄúLow Back Rehabilitation‚Äù.¬†

Although deemed to be the driest aspect of the book, the ‚ÄúScientific Foundation‚Äù section helps set forth groundwork in understanding the low back. Here, the reader can grasp the concept of whom, how, and why people develop back problems so frequently. With his thorough evidence-based knowledge, McGill sets the record straight on the myths and realities of low back disorders. However, despite the validity in these concepts, much of section 1 can be eliminated for the common clinician who doesn‚Äôt want to be overwhelmed in the details of research and lab instrumentation.

The ‚ÄúInjury Prevention‚Äù section provides light at the end of the tunnel when assessing common risk for low back injuries in chapters 8 and 9. Here clinicians are provided with knowledge that can be recommended to almost every patient. Although ergonomics is not the cause in every patients back problem, McGill helps evaluate multiple scenarios to minimize forces and injury to the spine.¬†...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Autism is a hard disorder to nail down genetically- single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or even multiple locus genetic effects are not able to account for the large genetic component to the disorder. In recent times, Copy number variations (CNVs) has come to the forefront of Autism research , suggesting that microdeletions, duplications etc [...]Rating: 0.0/10 (0 votes cast)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚Äì&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving and Independence Day are real secular holidays; everyone can participate.¬† I celebrate Christmas as the celebration of the spirit of giving and I celebrate Chanukah as an excuse to eat my Dad‚Äôs latkes, but I can understand why other atheists don‚Äôt want to celebrate days so closely associated with religious themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halloween is an interesting case though ‚Äì it seems to be the other way around.¬† Many religious people seem to take issue with this holiday, while I don‚Äôt hear complaints from atheists.¬† Americans United for Separation of Church and State &lt;a href="http://www.au.org/media/press-releases/archives/2009/10/pat-robertsons-christian.html"&gt;put out a press release&lt;/a&gt; calling attention to a particular article at &lt;strong&gt;Pat Robertson‚Äôs&lt;/strong&gt; Christian Broadcasting Network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put aside your fears of swine flu. TV preacher Pat Robertson‚Äôs Web site has just issued a bulletin warning Americans of the real threat we face this season: Demons may be lurking in our Halloween candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/onlinediscipleship/halloween/halloween_danger_daniels.aspx"&gt;a column&lt;/a&gt; on the Christian Broadcasting Network‚Äôs Web site, writer Kimberly Daniels asserts that ‚Äúdemons‚Äù sneak into bags of Halloween candy at grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú[M]ost of the candy sold during this season has been dedicated and prayed over by witches,‚Äù Daniels wrote. ‚ÄúI do not buy candy during the Halloween season. Curses are sent through the tricks and treats of the innocent whether they get it by going door to door or by purchasing it from the local grocery store. The demons cannot tell the difference.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, urged Robertson and Daniels to lighten up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of the devil being in the details, but to think he‚Äôs lurking inside a Snickers bar is a little too much,‚Äù Lynn quipped. ‚ÄúPat Robertson has always peddled some scary stuff, but this is over the top.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice there‚Äôs a link in their press release.¬† If you click on it, you‚Äôll notice that the page no longer exists.¬† I did a cursory search, but couldn‚Äôt find an explanation.¬† However, I did find Google‚Äôs cached version of the page and saved it so that I could show you more juicy bits.¬† You‚Äôre welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may ask, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt God have more power than the devil?‚Äù Yes, but He has given that power to us. If we do not walk in it, we will become the devil‚Äôs prey. Witchcraft works through dirty hearts and wrong spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period demons are assigned against those who participate in the rituals and festivities. These demons are automatically drawn to the fetishes that open doors for them to come into the lives of human beings. For example, most of the candy sold during this season has been dedicated and prayed over by witches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lukewarm and ignorant think of these customs as ‚Äújust harmless fun,‚Äù the vortexes of hell are releasing new assignments against souls. Witches take pride in laughing at the ignorance of natural men (those who ignore the spirit realm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre interested in hearing more, Barry Lynn is reportedly going to be on¬† ‚ÄúCountdown with Keith Olbermann‚Äù tonight on MSNBC to talk about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a serious note, Halloween can be harmless fun ‚Äì I‚Äôve certainly enjoyed it as such.¬† As a child, it was an excuse to be a knight or ring wraith and get candy.¬† As I got older, it was an excuse to drink with my friends.¬† But it can be more.¬† Christmas can make us reflect on the capacity for generosity ‚Äì and greed ‚Äì in human nature.¬† Halloween can make us reflect on other aspects of human nature: our penchant for mischief, our fear in the face of the unknown, and our fascination with the forbidden.¬† And yes, our love of candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've gotten into a few arguments on race and racism in my time, some on this blog.  Racist thinking is all around us.  Why just a few hours ago, a neighbor complained that his car had been robbed by the black kids that pass down our street now and then.  How did he know it was the black kids?  Because the people who robbed his car like hip-hop.  How did he know that?  Because they didn't take his rock cds. Oh, did they take his hip hop cd's?  Well no, he doesn't have hip hop cds.  He's not black.  Why would he have hip hop cd's?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have all been terribly generous, but I have to ask one final favor.  A generous reader just gave $100 to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;a project to create an outdoor science classroom&lt;/a&gt; focusing on gardening.  It's a terrific project and that single donation has brought the project within $300 of being fully funded. If you, dear readers, could kick in even a few small donations (in the 1-5 dollar range) I think I could find a way to get this project funded before the end of the drive.  &lt;/p&gt;

Cohan shows us some nice diagrams of phenotypic and molecular clusters, and they show groups separated by gaps ‚Äî therefore, species. Unfortunately the species defined thereby are big and contain considerable diversity within them.  Darwin defined species as divergent forms between which one finds morphological gaps. Mayr: cohesive set of organisms whose divergence is constrained by genetic exchange. Speciation requires a breakdown of that exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mallet has developed a version of Darwin's species definition that includes molecular characters. Under Mayr, speciation is tough, under Mallet,  speciation is easy. The two models differ in the frequency of cladogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do bacterial species maintain cohesion? Periodic selection purges divergent populations. Diversity within ecotypes is maintained by selective purges, but ecotypes that found new populations in new environments will not face the same selective effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why doesn't the free(er) exchange of genetic material between bacterial species lead to a convergence or fusion of species? One reason is the rarity of genetic exchange. If two ecotypes have a suite of niche-specifying genes, low frequency of interchange will not be sufficient to prevent divergence.This does not prevent free exchange of niche-transcending genes, genes that are useful in different environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of details from Cohan&amp;#39;s work followed, and I confess to being a bit lost in places. He&amp;#39;s looking at different soil bacteria that are found in different ecotypes‚Äîfor instance, having different characteristic fatty acid content depending on whether they are found on a north-facing or south-facing slope. He argues that speciation is easy because genetic exchange doesn&amp;#39;t prevent speciation. They&amp;#39;re working on finding and confirming ecotypes with whole genome sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is cohesion with local populations in one niche, but there is also niche-specifying divergence that is in defiance of cohesion. In animals and plants, niche-transcending genes are only shared between close relatives; in bacteria, they can be shared by the most distant relatives. This sharing doesn't interfere with divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

The internet went into ‚Äòmoral indignation‚Äô mode, and the guy was burned at the steak, [sic, sick, and excuse the puns], for his honesty and blood lust. I was curious about the outrage, because it seems to me that killing a baboon (and bear in mind this wasn‚Äôt the endangered sort, and is considered a pest) for blood lust isn‚Äôt any less noble than killing a wild deer for the pleasure of an incredible (and entirely¬†unnecessary) Michelin-starred loin of venison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the West at least, we don‚Äôt need to eat meat, we have many options for protein including tofu.

Meat is indeed sustenance, but optional for most of us, and personally I eat meat purely for the pleasure ‚Äì indeed I am a fan of foie gras, veal, and many other ‚Äòdelicacies‚Äô considered to be cruel. So I‚Äôm not going to condemn AA Gill for admitting he just wanted to kill something, when I‚Äôm perfectly happy for someone else to kill something because I just wanted to taste its delicious flesh. If AA Gill had eaten the baboon afterwards, it would have been less of an issue, it seems, although of course the real issue is that he was daft/brave/desperate/weird enough to publish the story in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what came out of my debates on Twitter about this was a very interesting side-debate about what animals its ‚ÄòOK‚Äô to eat ‚Äì culturally, many of us have emotional ties to certain animals (e.g. those we‚Äôve domesticated, those we consider intelligent or ‚Äòlike humans‚Äô, those which are endangered), but the lines are personal,¬†arbitrary, and blurry. For example, I used to refuse to eat shark because ‚Äúsharks are cool‚Äù. No other justification, I just liked sharks a lot and wanted to leave them alone. I make no pretence of rationality, I made an emotional decision, which is perfectly fine. I would eat dog, but not someone‚Äôs abducted pet cause that‚Äôs not very nice, but I wouldn‚Äôt eat insects because they are spindly and creepy. I suspect most people wouldn‚Äôt eat kitten casserole, but may well eat rabbit casserole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I‚Äôm asking is this: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What‚Äôs your edible animal line? Which animals are you OK with eating, which not, and why do you make the distinction?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;img title="hybridcats" src="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/wp-content/uploads/hybridcats.jpg" alt="hybridcats" width="500" height="112"&gt;Maybe this sounds silly to you.¬† Me too.¬† It also sounded silly to Hart and Grosberg (2009), who thoroughly debunk the hypothesis using data that were already easily available.¬† You can read a play by play of the refutation over at Jerry Coyne‚Äôs blog¬† &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/controversal-paper-on-origins-of-caterpillars-debunked/"&gt;Why Evolution Is True&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=controversial-caterpillar-evolution-2009-10-29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;So, if it‚Äôs already been discussed on a popular blog, why bring it up again?¬† Because this one relates directly to my area of research, and the subject of many a post here on Genomicron ‚Äî genome size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;One of the ‚Äúpredictions‚Äù given in Williamson‚Äôs paper is that species of insects with complete metamorphosis (holometabolous development) will exhibit evidence of a merger of insect and onychophoran genomes, and thus have larger DNA amounts.¬† It so happens that a) this is bass-ackwards, and b) it is easy to find this out by checking my &lt;a href="http://www.genomesize.com/"&gt;Animal Genome Size Database&lt;/a&gt; (which is what Hart and Grosberg did) or my paper in &lt;em&gt;Genetica&lt;/em&gt; from 2002 or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Gregory-Evolutionary-Biology-University/dp/0123014638/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1256927011&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; from 2005 or pretty much any decent paper on insect genome sizes in the last several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="metamorph" src="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/wp-content/uploads/metamorph.jpg" alt="metamorph" width="500" height="357"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Gregory (2005).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often have to summarize reasons why people should care about genome size, as when preparing grant applications.¬† I never thought that I could add to this list, ‚Äúrefuting nutty hypotheses about the origins of caterpillars‚Äù.¬† I won‚Äôt, though, even if many of the data used in the comparison were generated by me or my students (including pretty much all the Lepidoptera estimates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, on a more positive note, this flap did draw attention to velvet worms, which are pretty cool:&lt;br&gt;

As soon as Travis and I read this study, we knew we had to do a follow-up study of our own to see if this finding was simply spurious or if there was actually something to large breasts that indicated health risk ‚Äì beyond that explained by obesity per se.

The project that Travis and I began over a year ago has culminated in both a hot-off-the-press publication in the journal Obesity, as well as my presentation at this year‚Äôs Obesity Society meeting in Washington D.C.

In the study, we used body composition data acquired through MRI on about 100 premenopausal women to directly quantify breast size. By using MRI data we significantly improved the methodology used by the authors of the original study on breast size and diabetes risk, who relied on over 20 year recall of cup size as their key measure....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Two of the omitted chapters, Chapters 11 and 12, showcase biogeography, some of Darwin‚Äôs strongest evidence for evolution. Which is a better explanation for the distribution of plants and animals around the planet: common ancestry or special creation? Which better explains why island species are more similar to species on the mainland closest to them, rather than to more distant species that share a similar environment? The answer clearly is common ancestry. Today, scientists continue to develop the science of biogeography, confirming, refining, and extending Darwin‚Äôs conclusions.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Walked in as he was talking about tree vs. ladder thinking (people have a hard time conceptualizing trees) and history as a chronicle ‚Äî barebones description of events ‚Äî or a narrative ‚Äî events linked by causal explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a century for biologists to use systematics to make testable hypotheses about evolution. Darwin himself talked at length about all kinds of evidence for evolution, but strangely neglected fossils and dinosaurs altogether. Sereno blames this on rivalry with Richard Owen, who was the big dinosaur man of the day. One fossil Darwin was pleased with was Archaeopteryx, and Huxley in particular made the link between Archy and birds. Sereno brought in fossil of &lt;i&gt;Confuciusornis&lt;/i&gt; ‚Äî very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have begun to separate out the chronology from the narrative; chronology is a limiting factor in our hypotheses. We are interested in the trajectory of change over time, and Sereno confesses to baldly exploiting that to get a publication in nature of &lt;i&gt;Raptorex&lt;/i&gt;, but he carefully omitted any causal discussion in the paper, trusting readers to infer a narrative from the story, because that's what we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deplores the thinness of work in the philosophy of phylogeny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History: Darwin crystallized many of the pieces of an existing chronology into an evolutionary narrative. The next big breakthrough was Hennig (1950) who atomized morphological transformations and branching patterns, defining specific terms to describe phenomena important for understanding trees.  Quantitative cladistics (1969) put it on a solid empirical foundation. Character states were coded as mathematical variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem: everyone has a different matrix for the analysis of characters for each phylogeny examined. The matrix is a black box. We are searching for a methodology that will link everything together. A modern comparative cladistics would open up the black box for universal analysis. Need to figure out what the characters are, and need to be able to do comparative analysis. There is no global understanding of what a character or character state are. There is currently a movement to develop a universal character ontology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He makes a strong case that we have a serious problem with different investigators studying the same phylogenies, but using different characters and even scoring them differently. We need to standardize to enable full comparisons of multiple data sets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/paul_sereno_dinosaurs_phylogen.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Hc_Z5fF478Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256928377429"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=6458">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6994197f1228edfd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alt-Med"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="antivax"/><category term="Billy Corgan"/><category term="Brent Spiner"/><category term="cancer"/><category term="mumps"/><category term="Suzanne Somers"/><title type="html">Mumps the word</title><published>2009-10-30T18:00:54Z</published><updated>2009-10-30T18:00:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/1tGSppfmnXk/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/30/mumps-the-word/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey, antivaxxers! I just wanted to send you guys a quick note of thanks for all the work you do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, that whole thing about &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2009/10/22/2009-10-22_oldfashioned_mumps_make_comback_.html"&gt;getting mumps to resurge due to lower vaccinations rates in the UK&lt;/a&gt;? That‚Äôs very cool. We all missed mumps so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the way you guys  &lt;a href="http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/parenting/why-i-feel-duped-by-the-anti-vaccine-movement-528740/"&gt;dupe parents&lt;/a&gt; is simply brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôve been pretty effective getting the word out, especially the way you market yourselves as just trying to be questioning, just trying to get all the facts out. It works! You‚Äôve been able to trick &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/data_weeps_does_brent_spiner_have_anti-v.php"&gt;inquisitive, rational people&lt;/a&gt; into thinking maybe you‚Äôre onto something, when of course we all know you‚Äôre using outdated ideas, twisted facts, and sometimes out-and-out lies (which, of course, &lt;a href="http://www.everythingfromheretothere.com/2009/10/27/health-and-a-well-being/" rel="nofollow"&gt;appeals to people prone to conspiracy thinking anyway&lt;/a&gt;). I mean, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1152"&gt;taking something that almost certainly has nothing to do with vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; but making that a meme spreading across the media? Great stuff! And the way &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_anti-vaccine_movement_strikes_back_u.php"&gt;you viciously attack people who disagree with you&lt;/a&gt;? Fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you should really sit back and take a look at Suzanne Somers. Now there‚Äôs someone who takes &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/suzanne_somers_has_just_carpet_bombed_th.php"&gt;incoherent nonsense&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thehumancondition/archive/2009/10/23/breaking-health-author-suzanne-somers-mostly-wrong-about-science-medicine.aspx"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and is able to &lt;a href="http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/10/29/john-moore-suzanne-somers-bimbo-md.aspx#ixzz0VLS7loST"&gt;market and spin it&lt;/a&gt; into quite an industry for herself. And who can blame her? She gets on Oprah, CNN, radio shows‚Ä¶ and the only cost is a maybe a few thousand people dying of cancer because they tried her provably wrong &amp;quot;cures&amp;quot; instead of seeking real medical help. But hey! We all have to die someday! I mean, let‚Äôs have some perspective here. After all, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/07/19/wealth-of-science-2/"&gt;what has science ever done for us&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hat tip to  Gerick Lee and many others for these tips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny that you should post this. As a born-again atheist, I do not have any kind of ‚Äúreligious belief‚Äù. Even when I DID believe in God, (long long ago) I scarcely had any kind of ‚Äúreligion‚Äù. I‚Äôm very laid-back about most things, and there is very little that I‚Äôm passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except Hallowe‚Äôen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could be said to have any kind of ‚Äúbelief‚Äù about anything, it would be a belief in Hallowe‚Äôen. I believe in the sanctity of Hallowe‚Äôen, and in the subtle power of this autumnal celebration. Oh no, I don‚Äôt believe in any of the Pagan Gods of Samhain, nor do I believe that Hallowe‚Äôen is the day that the ‚Äúveil between worlds is thinnest‚Äù or any other crap like that. I don‚Äôt think of it as the day before ‚ÄúAll Saint‚Äôs Day‚Äù or the eve of Dia de los Muertas. I feel that Hallowe‚Äôen celebrates something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that Hallowe‚Äôen should be a FEAST OF FEAR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallowe‚Äôen is the day that we explore our inner demons. It‚Äôs the day that we all try to get in touch with our own personal monsters. A time of year that we celebrate blood, and gore, and death, and terror, in all its wonderful visceral glory. Hallowe‚Äôen should be a celebration of these dark stirrings, and it should SCARE us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I am unfavorably in favor of a dark and terrifying Hallowe‚Äôen. When I see people walking around dressed as cartoon characters, or in ‚Äúclever‚Äù costumes, (‚ÄùHey look at us everybody! I‚Äôm a plug and she‚Äôs a wall socket! Get it!? Wink wink nudge!! AmIRight?‚Äù) it just turns my stomach. Even the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù costumes, such as ‚ÄúFootball player‚Äù, or ‚ÄúPrincess‚Äù, or ‚ÄúNinja‚Äù, just aren‚Äôt right to me. A proper Hallowe‚Äôen costume should be terrifying enough to make young children wet themselves and sleep with the lights on. If you haven‚Äôt cost parents thousands of dollars in therapy bills just by walking down the street, you‚Äôve failed at Hallowe‚Äôen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long wanted to create a front-yard Hallowe‚Äôen display so horrifying that I‚Äôd have to actually give away CASH, just to reward anyone brave enough to make the perilous journey from the street to my front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my wifey won‚Äôt let me put up such a display, and she‚Äôs the only one that *I* am afraid of. &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As his nominator mentions, this is the winning bit: ‚ÄúA proper Hallowe‚Äôen costume should be terrifying enough to make young children wet themselves and sleep with the lights on. If you haven‚Äôt cost parents thousands of dollars in therapy bills just by walking down the street, you‚Äôve failed at Hallowe‚Äôen.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

She's a PhD student with &lt;a href="http://sund.ku.dk/profilen/nielslynnerup/"&gt;Niels Lynnerup&lt;/a&gt; at the Dept of Forensic Medicine at Copenhagen. Remember the crumbling &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/02/early_neolithic_amber_hoard_ct.php"&gt;Neolithic amber bead hoard&lt;/a&gt; that the Danes ran through a CT scanner instead of excavating and stabilising the thing? Now Lise is putting &lt;i&gt;entire Bronze Age urn burials&lt;/i&gt; through that scanner. She knows where every piece of bone and bronze is in those urns before she even cuts open the plaster they've been encased in since being lifted out of the ground. She has perfect 3D digital models of urns that fall apart when you remove the plaster. And she has demonstrated that a lot of the bone fragmentation, that has commonly been assumed to be due to dedicated crushing and grinding by the mourners, is actually simply due to the brittleness of burnt bones whose organic component has leached away over the millennia. Big bones are sitting in the urns, each fragment in place, and fall apart when you try to lift them. As Lise put it, "The one who does the ritual crushing is me, when I empty the urns".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can a PhD student in archaeology afford to use this sort of hi-tech equipment? Turns out, the technology is developing so fast that the hospitals frequently swap their CT scanners for newer models. The used one at the Dept of Forensic Medicine makes one slice every three millimeters. Not good enough anymore for brain surgery. But perfectly useful for archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve allegedly been on holiday this week. It was enforced: not only is it half term and the Pawns require a bit of childcare, I also found myself with rather a lot of annual leave that I have to use up, or lose, before the end of the year. Just before we go beta, too. Of course, I haven‚Äôt actually been able to treat it as a holiday, what with certain things too boring to go into here, so I think I‚Äôll have to have another holiday real soon now. I have one day in the office next week and then I‚Äôm off to Charleston to speak at a conference, and back as soon as I get off the podium so I don‚Äôt miss too much of the Younger Pawn‚Äôs birthday celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Karen gets peer-reviewed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite various things that I really could have done without, alluded to above, I was able to take the Pawns into the &lt;a href="http://nhm.ac.uk"&gt;Natural History Museum&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, there to meet with the incomparable &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/karenjames/profile"&gt;Dr James&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://thebeagleproject.blogspot.com/"&gt;Beagle Project&lt;/a&gt; fame. Karen took us backstage, to gasps of awe and astonishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;In a pickle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie enjoyed the Tank Room, and loved the Cocoon, so we went back again today. As it‚Äôs half term, and it was totally packed out on Tuesday, we planned to get there just after opening time today. This tactic paid off, and we were able to walk straight into the Cocoon without tickets. (They have this really neat system where you get a card with a bar code and when you get home, you can enter a unique code and access more information about the things you were interested in while you were there, thanks to the awesome power of the internets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/4058042561/" title="Cocoon 2 by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2634/4058042561_ea8516f011.jpg" height="500" alt="Cocoon 2" width="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One big egg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that is not immediately apparent about the &lt;span&gt;NHM&lt;/span&gt;, and something that sets it aside from a lot of other collections of things in London and around the world, is that it is a &lt;em&gt;research museum&lt;/em&gt;. Karen told us that there are ~350 scientists working at the &lt;span&gt;NHM&lt;/span&gt;, in five departments. With over 70 million specimens, they should be kept busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/4058787388/" title="Red by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2760/4058787388_6a10eeae0b.jpg" height="433" alt="Red" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;There‚Äôs another 69,999,999 to see&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely, for the first time since leaving the lab, I got a slight pang about bench science. It must have been the videos of scientists talking about phylogenetics and the pictures of Gilsons. I stood back and watched other people, and was amazed by the number of mothers, in particular (don‚Äôt ask me where the dads were) telling their charges about the science being done there. It gave me quite a thrill to hear ordinary people, in a public place, use words  like ‚Äò&lt;span&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;‚Äô in cold blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet‚Ä¶ in the main part of the Museum, the displays are incredibly old-fashioned. Plastic models in the Human Biology section, strangely Victorian exhibits in the Arthropod room. I guess there‚Äôs only so much you can do with stuff that doesn‚Äôt move, but the Darwin Centre at least is a step along the evolutionary ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

Darwin credited selection. What are the details of this process? Speciation is a booming topic in the science literature, with 25,000 titles last year. Need to define a species to begin. Uses Mayr's biological species concept, which focuses on the importance of reproductive isolating factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin on speciation: recommends Stauffer's compilation of Darwin's notes as much more thorough and specific than the &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt;. Darwin explained speciation as a consequence of selection, divergence, and extinction. Mayr thought Darwin considered geographic isolation to be unimportant; the big book does infer that "some degree of geographical isolation would be indispensible". Darwin had much more sophisticated views of speciation than Mayr ascribed to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are reproductive barriers in nature? Case study of monkeyflowers (&lt;i&gt;Mimulus&lt;/i&gt;) that show very different morphologies and different pollinators (bees vs. hummingbirds). Ecogeographic barriers, premating isolation, postmating prefertilization barriers, hybrid unfitness. In &lt;i&gt;Mimulus&lt;/i&gt;, species separated by elevation with a very narrow band of sympatry. Reciprocal translocation showed that the two species are highly adapted to their native ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premating isolation imposed by bees/hummingbirds that very rarely feed on different flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postmating isolation: artificially pollinated with cross-species gametes. One species can produce hybrids, but the other does so only at low frequency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid fitness: F1 hybrids are not as viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cited Coyne's work on how these factors work sequentially. Each step in isolation has different degree of contribution, but ecogeographic isolation is the most important component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What traits contribute to reproductive isolation? They made hybrid F1s, crossed them to produce F2 hybrids that vary widely in morphology. Transplanted them to Yosemite, where they kept records of what pollinators visited which hybrids. Key factors were nectar production (hummingbirds favor lots of nectar); bees shunned hybrids rich in carotenoids ‚Äî reds were invisible to bees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now looking at QTLs (quantitative trait loci) that affect reproductive isolation, and those genes that affect carotenoid production seem to be important. Isolated strains that only carried trans-specific carotenoid genes. This single gene has dramatic differences in visitations by bees vs. hummingbirds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single gene substitution seems to be responsible for the reproductive isolation. It takes a long period of time for post-zygotic barriers to evolve, and the most important barriers are in the habitat. Comparative studies of other species were cited to show that ecogeo barriers are the main agents of speciation.&lt;/p&gt;

The core process is speciation, a splitting of a lineage into two divergent lines that at the end, cannot interbreed. What do we know about speciation in Darwin's finches?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They evolved from a common ancestor in 2-3 million years into 14 different species, filling different ecological niches in the Galapagos, largely free of human interference. Showed us photos of four different species with very different beaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed predictions of population density from things like available biomass, and worked out relationship of expected density to beak size. It seems to have worked, with good correlations between where the environment provides the best opportunities and the kinds of species that are actually present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different birds in different environments have different characters, presumably generated by adaptive processes. They frequently observe matches between species present and available food supplies. This is a historical interpretation: what is needed is direct observation of morphological changes in response to changes in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much genetic variation is extant in a population? They assessed this in bird populations on Daphne Major, measuring heritability of beak size (value = 0.74, about the same as heritability of height in human populations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much genetic difference is present between species? Two genes show consistent graded pattern that correlate with beak shape: BMP4 and calmodulin. Inserting finch BMP4 genes in chickens produces chickens with larger beaks. Most of the variation is thought to be not in structure of genes, but in their regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describe size-dependent mortality in birds during drought ‚Äî large birds survived better.  Used r=h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s to predict what the average beak size in subsequent generation, tested it, and found a very good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later rainy year led to a second evolutionary shift, back to favoring smaller birds. They now have a body of data describing almost 30 years of evolutionary responses to 5 drought years. Mean trait values are changing over these years. The birds are not the same morphologically now as they were at the start of their study. Have seen an identical drought condition in 2005 to drought in 1983, but in this recent drought, saw a different reaction. Now, there is a substantial population of &lt;i&gt;magnirostris&lt;/i&gt; on the island, so the response to drought is  &lt;i&gt;decline&lt;/i&gt; in beak size: they are seeing character displacement to increase differences between two species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosemary Grant took the lectern to talk about courtship. Finches can recognize conspecifics by both morphology and song. THere are individual differences, but also larger species differences. Song is learned early by young birds, mainly from the father, and once learned, it is retained for life. Song is learned in a Lorenzian fashion by imprinting, forming a pre-mating species barrier. Sometimes, males will take over a nest of another species and fail to toss out all the chicks, so you sometimes (1%) get individuals that learn a foster-father's song, of a different species...so you get hybrids later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrids were not seen to survive any of the drought years. Hybrids had intermediate sized beaks that did not thrive when only large, tough seeds were present, but could do well in wet years with abundant small seeds. In those cases, hybrids survived as well as parental types, so their death is not a result of genetic incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hybrids trickle cross-species genes into the foster parents' species. Will this lead to fusion of the two species? Maybe not, because drought reinforces differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, some hybrids with &lt;i&gt;magnirostris&lt;/i&gt; seen ‚Äî they don&amp;#39;t breed back into the population. They can&amp;#39;t compete with the purebred &lt;i&gt;magnirostris&lt;/i&gt;, and the purebreds also beat up the hybrids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/peter_rosemary_grantnatural_se.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/MUm5llzd0oM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256919945898"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/i_need_your_help_picking_out_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f9680081d4238a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism"/><title type="html">I need your help picking out a tee-shirt.</title><published>2009-10-30T16:00:09Z</published><updated>2009-10-30T16:00:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/1UIQY7nn5nY/i_need_your_help_picking_out_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/i_need_your_help_picking_out_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I would very much like your help in picking out a tee-shirt to wear around town.

&lt;p&gt;Halloween, believe it or not, is an &lt;i&gt;astronomical&lt;/i&gt; holiday!  The two solstices and two equinoxes are obvious astronomical holidays, since they correspond to the days of greatest, least, and equal daylight/night everywhere in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/happy_halloween_from_the_unive/equinox1.gif" width="500" title="Equinox-solstice-equinox-solstice..." alt="equinox1.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But halfway in-between each solstice and equinox lie the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-quarter_day"&gt;cross-quarter days&lt;/a&gt;.  Just as we still mark the winter solstice (almost) with Christmas and the vernal equinox (almost) with Easter, we mark the cross-quarter days (almost) with minor holidays, including Groundhog Day, May Day, and Halloween, which comes from the old Celtic &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain"&gt;Samhain&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;While it's undeniable that rearing herds of animals for meat is bad for the environment, is vegetarianism the answer - or even an answer? This is not an entirely scientific response to Lord Stern but there are a few points more serious responses have missed that have occurred to my flu-addled brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/cownchicken_cartoons.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to provide vegetarians with dairy products, cattle must be bred. But only females are needed for milk. The males will not be sent off to live out their lives happily in green pastures; apart from a few kept for breeding, they will be slaughtered. The same goes for male chicks in egg production.  The bodies will have to be disposed of, either as landfill or by burning, both of which have health and ecology implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from environmental issues, this also removes any moral high ground from vegetarians. What's more, in Veggie World, anyone who eats meat but not dairy would be forced into veganism. That's not just lactose intolerant Westerners but a large proportion of the population of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veganism may be the only true moral position regarding the exploitation of animals. But it has its problems as vegans don't eat honey. The bees that produce honey also pollinate crops as well as wild flowers and other flora essential to a healthy eco-system. Wild bees are not enough. So if we all became vegan, the planet would be headed for disaster unless we all kept bees as pets (not such a bad idea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would Veggie World be like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pigs would disappear. Children would grow up learning about them as semi-mythical beasts from the past, along with dodos. Or possibly they could see them in zoos. People who overeat could no longer be meaningfully compared with pigs.  The film Babe might be mistaken for a historically accurate tale of pig farming.   Sheep and goats would go too, apart from a few breeds used for cheese. Breeding sheep for wool would probably end as wool is a non-essential fabric. All the religious iconography and symbolism about lambs would become obscure. The Lamb of God and the Good Shepherd would become empty images. None of this is necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans aren't the only ones who eat meat. What would cats and dogs eat? If humans have to stop eating meat, feeding it to pets could hardly be justified.  Apart from guide dogs and police dogs, man's best carnivore friend would become a thing of the past. Farmers wouldn't need dogs any more as there would be no sheep to herd. One Man and His Dog would never be seen on TV again. Nor would Crufts. Again, not necessarily a bad thing if it meant that Ben Fogle was on TV less. There would be no dog poo in the world either. The Andrex puppy would be no more. The Internet would no longer be flooded with pets in cute poses or dressed up in clothes.  A whole section of the greetings card industry would be threatened; no more pictures of fluffy puppies and kittens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macdonalds would either go out of business or switch to making meat-flavoured veggie burgers. We'd all be eating a lot more beans to get our protein. Methane produced by farm animals farting is one of the contributors to global warming but six billion people farting constantly is not going to do the ozone layer any favours. Incidentally, rice paddies also give off methane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do eat more meat than is good for the planet and many of us eat more than is healthy for us but as far as vegetarianism being the solution - Stern really hasn't thought this through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETA: I now appear to have swine flu. The irony is not lost on me.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite patients indicating that they don&amp;#39;t perceive Abilify to work as an antidepressant, the FDA approved it, likely leading to tens of thousands of Americans being able to enjoy a taste of akathisia while getting all the psychological benefits of a placebo.  Good work, FDA.  The shift of antipsychotics into antidepressants has been documented in many places and is, ironically, very depressing (1, 2, 3, 4).The FDA&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;anything goes&amp;quot; attitude regarding antidepressants apparently extends to mediocre medical devices. In 2007, a paper in Biological Psychiatry presented results from a large trial comparing TMS to sham TMS. The article concluded that the treatment was a fantastic option for depression. Well, close to that anyway. That actually wrote that &amp;quot;Transcranial magnetic stimulation was effective in treating major depression with minimal side effects reported. It offers clinicians a novel alternative for the treatment of this disorder.&amp;quot;Before all of us poor depressed souls get in line for some sweet magnetic stimulation, maybe we should, like, look at the evidence. On the primary measure of outcome, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the results weren&amp;#39;t quite statistically significant. So the sponsor tried to convince the FDA Neurological Devices Panel that the secondary measures showed super-impressive results. The problem: They didn&amp;#39;t. The FDA review panel thought a few things (as can be seen in its entirety here):The Panel‚Äôs consensus was that the efficacy was not established; some stated that the device‚Äôs effectiveness was ‚Äúsmall,‚Äù ‚Äúborderline,‚Äù ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù and ‚Äúof questionable clinical significance.‚Äù The Study 01 endpoint with a p value of 0.057 per se was not considered a fatal flaw in the study analysis. The Panel did not believe that clinical significance was demonstrated with these results.In general, the panel believed that the analyses of the secondary effectiveness endpoints did not contribute significant information to help establish the effectiveness of the device.The Panel agreed that unblinding was greater in the active group, and considering the magnitude of the effect size, it may have influenced the study results. (35.8% of people receiving TMS reported pain at the application site compared to only 3.8% in the sham TMS group. This is a quick way to make a study unblind, as people experiencing pain could logically surmise that they were receiving TMS).The Panel stated that there were too many non-random dropouts to reliably interpret these results. The Panel‚Äôs consensus was that the Week 6 data was of limited value and did not provide supportive data for establishing effectiveness. (After week 4, patients who did not show adequate improvement were given the option to quit the double-blind study; over half of patients departed the study after week 4).One more doozy. A quote follows from a letter to the editor in Biological Psychiatry in which TMS is taken to task.The authors note that some patient outcome measures were collected in the trial but omitted from the article. Of the 15 secondary end points the authors included in the paper, 11 were statistically significant. Of 11 secondary end points not included, 2 were statistically significant. Thus, the published end points were three times more likely to be statistically significant than the unpublished ones.TMS was denied FDA-approval in January, 2007. But in October 2008, the FDA had a change of heart, approving the device.  I&amp;#39;m not quite sure what changed the mind of the FDA. The following disclaimer on the device&amp;#39;s website is a bit funny:NeuroStar TMS Therapy has not been studied in patients who have not received prior     antidepressant treatment. Its effectiveness has also not been established in patients     who have failed to receive benefit from two or more prior antidepressant medications     at minimal effective dose and duration in the current episode.     So it&amp;#39;s only demonstrated (weak) efficacy in people who have failed one (not zero, not more than one) antidepressant trial. Impressive, eh?  To summarize, the sponsor and its affiliated academics wrote a paper in a major psychiatry journal in which positive outcomes were three times as likely to be reported as negative outcomes.  The efficacy data were unimpressive according to an FDA panel -- and these panels are not known for being particularly choosy about efficacy data. It seemed that TMS was dead in the water, only to be resurrected in the form of a surprising FDA approval. And if being resurrected from the grave doesn&amp;#39;t make for a great Halloween post, then what does?Offending Study:O‚ÄôReardon, J., Solvason, H., Janicak, P., Sampson, S., Isenberg, K., Nahas, Z., McDonald, W., Avery, D., Fitzgerald, P., &amp;amp; Loo, C.

Dear Richard,    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend recently asked me to come to church with her.  She‚Äôs from Korea, and she doesn‚Äôt speak first-rate English, so she doesn‚Äôt  know how to phrase things sometimes.  She‚Äôs a very open person and she‚Äôs not interested in converting me or anything like that.  She knows I‚Äôm an atheist, but she asked if I could come with her to church as just another place to go.  I tried explaining to her how asking me to come to church is a very offensive question because it doesn‚Äôt respect my beliefs.  Is there a better way I could explain to her why it is offensive to ask me to come to a church to attend a preaching session?    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Brad, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt like it‚Äú doesn‚Äôt seem like too complex an idea. That can be communicated even with pantomime, like the face you‚Äôd make when biting into food that should have been thrown out a long time ago. Your girlfriend sounds like a nice person and she‚Äôs probably not dense, so I wondered if there was some other issue going on here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to see if your girlfriend being a Korean might have relevance to this, I consulted a good friend of mine, who is a member of an elite group of experts known as the Ask Richard International Research Team.  She was born in Korea and has experienced being a member of more than one Korean Christian church in the U.S.  She offered these insights that might help you understand what your girlfriend may be going through. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;dir&gt;‚ÄúOf course, I could be wrong about this particular woman, and we should be careful not to make generalizations about nationalities too broadly.   But I‚Äôve never met a Korean who attends church regularly and asks someone else to go to church, but has no intention of trying to convert them.  Although there are many Koreans in the U.S. whose spouses and partners are not as religious, the church-going Koreans are always, ALWAYS praying about them.‚Äù&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThey do religion very well.  It‚Äôs mixed up with the old Confucian teachings and the Christian thought, which means they are extremely affected by the pressure of duty and indebtedness.  There are many Koreans who are Buddhists or even atheists, but even the atheist Koreans have the cultural Confucian upbringing.  The mindset is very patriarchal and respectful of the elders and the ancestors.  When you add Christianity on top of that and the belief that Jesus gave his life for yours, the sense of obligation to spread the word is very powerful. I attended a Korean church a while back, and they used to pressure the churchgoers to bring others there. ‚ÄòJust get them here, and we‚Äôll do the rest.‚Äô was the idea.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend continued‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;dir&gt;‚ÄúIt is possible that she may just want him to share in her life for another reason.  If it is a specifically Korean church, rather than one with a general population, it could be as simple as wanting to introduce him to the food, since eating Korean meals after church is very common.  Some people come to church just for the food, but if his girlfriend attends any church regularly, as in being a member of the church,  I think chances are that she‚Äôs hoping that she can somehow change his mind about Christ.‚Äù&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIf he does end up visiting her church, he would have to make himself very clear to her that he has no intention of changing his beliefs, although that will probably fall upon deaf ears. Whether Korean or American, so many Christians think, ‚ÄòIf only you had the chance to hear the gospel message in the right way‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúKorean church people don‚Äôt push Americans too hard, just the other Koreans. They wouldn‚Äôt pressure him as much as his girlfriend to keep him coming.  If he shows up once, that pressure on her will get worse.  In fact, it may already be happening.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúSince her English is not first rate, it‚Äôs likely that she goes to a Korean language church.  They may have an English translation, but it‚Äôs not likely to be a good translation.  It will sound like Greek to him.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Brad, if my friend‚Äôs experiences are relevant, this &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; indicate that this is not about a language barrier making it hard to explain yourself to your girlfriend. It could be that she understands you well enough, but she intends to get you there one way or another. To her, it may be much more than ‚Äújust another place to go.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of any underlying issue, it‚Äôs time to get the message across. Rather than further trying to explain why this is not your cup of tea, or why her persistently asking you is offensive, a simple, gentle and repeated ‚ÄúNo, thank you, I‚Äôm not going‚Äù will probably cut through any barrier, whether it‚Äôs about language, culture or intention. ‚ÄúNo thank you, I‚Äôm not going‚Äù repeated without anger or impatience, said warmly with no variation in the words. Tell her that you have no objection to her going all she wants, but ‚ÄúNo thank you, I‚Äôm not going.‚Äù Forget explanations about why.  That just keeps the subject open for discussion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do some research and suggest some specific things that you and she can share and enjoy about her background, such as Korean restaurants, cultural expositions and art exhibitions.  She may be very pleased that you put forth the effort to explore her unique culture with her.  But if you go within a thousand feet of that church, be prepared for whatever insistence, cajoling, wheedling, enticement and urging you‚Äôve already experienced, to amplify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;

This may get choppy! What it will lack in editing will be compensated for by more timely and regular updates. I hope. At least I'll be able to dump something to the site every 40-60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He summarizes the idea that there is a wealth of genetic diversity in populations to allow for effective selection. Lack of mutations should not limit a straightforward selection response. This raises a paradox, however: organisms have phylogenetic niche conservatism. Many species are evolutionarily unadventurous. He works on clades of herbivorous insect species that are sticking to the same plant groups since the Miocene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be many niches in nature that are unfilled: example: fish-catching bats have only one species. Where are the nocturnal aerial fish-feeders in other environments? Species don't just liberally fill every possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futuyma introduces Gould/Eldredge's concept of stasis. We need to acknowledge the existence of constraints that are limiting factors on evolutionary possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genetic constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, a &amp;quot;character&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t exist ‚Äî there aren&amp;#39;t genes or developmental pathways that specify it. For example, thoracic bristle number in flies may not be defined by simple genetic programs. Haldane said humans will not evolve into angels because we lack the required genetic diversity in wings or moral character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little or no genetic variance in a character or combination of characters. Looked at &lt;i&gt;Ophraella&lt;/i&gt; beetles, asking whether genetic predispositions might limit which species of plants they can feed on. Screened for genetic variation; in about half the cases they found no evidence of genetic variation that would allow for expansion into distantly related plant species. Discussed Bradshaw's work on genostasis in evolution, which found little genetic variance in heavy metal tolerance in grasses, dessication resistance in rainforest flies, locomotor and life history traits in &lt;i&gt;Hyla&lt;/i&gt;. Adaptation observed in some fly species may have been facilitated by hybridization, which introduces the needed variation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Species evolve along lines of genetic least resistance, where variation is present in the population. Other directions may not be easily followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful genetic change may require correlated change in multiple other traits, so genetic diversity may hinder evolutionary change by making the optimal combinations rare in the population. Demanding simultaneous changes in larval and adult characters, for instance, might limit rates of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major issue: how much evolutionary novelty is due to new mutations vs. recombination of standing variation in a population?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What accounts for stasis? Most adaptive novelties are associated with shifts to new niches. Because of recombination, new constellations of characters are likely to be ephemeral and not appear in the fossil record -- we don't see them because of issues in population structure.  Adaptive gene combinations will be diluted by interbreeding with individuals that lack the combination, so novelties are unlikely to spread very far (unless it's also associated with reproductive isolation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the glacial periods, most species did not adapt to new environments -- they used habitat tracking to follow favorable environments.  Recombination with more abundant ancestral genotypes leads to collaps of population structures that might favor new forms. Subpopulations lose their character when merged with larger populations, so reproductive isolation is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting prediction: ought to be more stasis in times of environmental fluctuation, and more expansion of novelties in subpopulations in times of environmental stability.. Adaptation to rapid environmental change may fail, especially if multiple character changes are required, and extinction is not unllkely. Climate change may simply doom many species. Adaptation to other invasive species is also going to be slow. And many adaptations may be unlikely and evolve only rarely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, biologists like the idea of convergence -- that similar populations might arise in similar environments  (I'm thinking of Simon Conway Morris here), but communities are dependent on contingency in evolutionary history, and a deterministic, equilibrial view of ecological "communities" can no longer be supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeing a major shift in the discipline to the importance of constraint and evolvability, and the origin of variation. History is important. and there's increasing integration of disciplines to cover micro- and macro-evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

This was a data-rich talk, and my ability to transcribe it was over-whelmed by all the stuff Hauser was tossing out. Unfortunately, I think the talk also suffered from excess and a lack of a good overview of the material. But it was thought-provoking anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the themes was how people resolve moral dilemmas. He began with a real world example, the story of an overweight woman in South Africa who insisted on joining a tour exploring a cave, and got stuck in the exit tunnel, trapping 22 people behind her. Do you sacrifice one to save many? One of the trapped people was a diabetic who needed to get out‚Äîshould they have blown up the woman so the others could escape? This was presented as a kind of philosophical trolley problem, and the audience was asked what was best to do‚Ä¶but I don&amp;#39;t think it works, because unlike those philosophical dilemmas, in the real world we pursue different strategies, and it&amp;#39;s rarely a black and white situation where one has to choose between precisely two possibilities ‚Äî as in this case, which was resolved by greasing her up with paraffin and pulling her out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hauser gave an overview of the philosophical explanations for making moral decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hume: morality intuitive, unconscious, emotional&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kant: rational, conscious, justified principles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theist: divine inspiration, explicit within scripture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rawls: intuitive, unconscious, grammar of action: not emotional, built on principles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's going to side with Rawls. The key difference between a Rawlsian morality and the others is that a moral decision is made unconsciously, and THEN emotional and rational justifications are made for it. This is testable if you have a way to remove the emotional component of decision; a Rawlsian moral agent will still make the same moral judgments. Studies of brain damaged patients with loss of emotional affect support the idea so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He analogized this to linguistics, in which we make abstract, content-free computations to determine, for instance, whether a particular sentence is grammatical. This computation is obligatory and impenetrable; we can't explain the process of making the decision as we're doing it, although we can construct rules after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, he summarized three principles that seem to be general rules in moral judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harm intended as the means to a goal is worse than harm seen as a side-effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harm caused by action is morally worse than harm caused by omission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harm caused by contact is morally worse than equivalent harm caused by non-contact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t judge morality purely on the basis of reasonable outcomes, but also on intent. He suggested that judging only on the basis of whether an outcome is bad or good is a primitive and simplistic strategy, that as people mature they add nuance by considering intentionality ‚Äî someone who poisons a person accidentally is less morally culpable than someone who does it intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;One example he gave that I found a bit dubious is the use of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to shut down regions of brain, in particular the right temporal/parietal junction (which seems to be a locus of intent judgment). In subjects that have that region zapped (a temporary effect!) all that matters is outcome. These studies bother me a bit; I don't know if I really trust the methodology of TMS, since it may be affecting much more in complex and undefined ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does knowledge ofthe law affect moral judgments? Holland no longer makes a legal distinction betwwen active and passive euthanasia, and many Dutch people are able to articulate a belief that passive euthanasia is less human than active euthanasia. Do the Dutch no longer percieve the action/omission distinction in Hauser&amp;#39;s 3 rules? In a dilemma test, they still make the same distinctions on active and passive stories as others do ‚Äî actively killing someone to save others is morally worse than simply allowing someone to die by inaction to have the same effect ‚Äî which again suggests that the underlying mechanisms of making moral decisions are unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these same dilemma tests, they've correlated outcomes with demographic data. The effects of religion, sex, etc. are negligible on how people make moral decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He makes an important distinction: These are effects on judgment, not behavior. How does behavior connect with judgment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hauser describe Mischel's longitudinal studies of kids given a simple test: they were given a cookie, and told they'd get more if they could hold off on eating it for some unspecified length of time. Kids varied; some had to have that cookie right away, others held off for longer periods of time. The interesting thing about this experiment is that the investigator looked at these same kids as adults 40 years later, and found that restraint in a 3 year old was correlated with greater marital stability, for instance, later in life. The idea is that these kinds of personal/moral capacities are fixed fairly early in people and don't seem to be affected much by experience or education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some interesting ideas here, and I would have liked to have seen more depth of discussion of individual points. The end of the talk, in particular, was a flurry of data and completely different experiments that weren't tied in well with the thesis of the talk, and there weren't opportunities for questions in these evening talks, so it was a bit difficult to sort everything out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behold (and salute):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/uploads/challenger_4x.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/lro_apollo17flag.jpg" alt="lro_apollo17flag" title="lro_apollo17flag" width="610" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click to boldly embiggen.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, lookit that! It‚Äôs fuzzy and small and hard to be sure it‚Äôs the flag in the picture, but there it is. It does match &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17psrf6-98comb.jpg"&gt;maps made of the Apollo 17 landing site&lt;/a&gt;, so it‚Äôs definitely the flagpole we‚Äôre seeing there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this picture &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17psrf4-53.jpg"&gt;to that taken by the 16mm movie camera on the Ascent Module&lt;/a&gt; right after Apollo 17 lifted off the Moon; you can see many of the same features. I spent a minute looking for the rover in the LRO picture, then remembered that the astronauts moved it well off to one side, about 100 meters, before they left the Moon so that the video camera on board could record their ascent (it was remotely controlled from Earth by an operator named Ed Fendell, &lt;del&gt;who had tried to film the launch of Apollo 15‚Äôs and 16‚Äôs Ascent Module but missed&lt;/del&gt;; with Apollos 15 and 16 technical issues prevented the ascent from being filmed, but with 17 he made it, and that‚Äôs the movie you always see in documentaries). However, you can see it in this larger overview from LRO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/uploads/ap17_1st50km_4release.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/lro_apollo17_overview.jpg" alt="lro_apollo17_overview" title="lro_apollo17_overview" width="610" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Again, click to make a giant leap.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredible. The LRO page on this has more details, including comparisons of the images from LRO to ones taken &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; from Apollo 17. Remember too that these LRO images have a resolution of 50 cm (18 inches) per pixel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Wowee wow wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the flag, there‚Äôs a curious thing about it. The flag itself was nylon, and that tends to get brittle when exposed to ultraviolet light ‚Äî which is relentless and plentiful on the airless Moon (the thermal pounding it‚Äôs taken between day and night can‚Äôt help either). I‚Äôve often wondered what we‚Äôll find when we go back to the Apollo landing sites; I half-expect to see red, white, and blue powder off to one side of the flagpole, and no actual flag left on the pole. This picture, as frakkin‚Äô amazing as it is, is still just barely too low resolution to be able to say for sure, I think. The shadow is only a pixel or so in size and so it‚Äôs hard to say what‚Äôs what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;em&gt;Holy Haleakala&lt;/em&gt;. Apollo 17‚Äôs flag. I wonder what Gene Cernan and Jack Schmidt thought when they saw this picture. And I wonder when we‚Äôll go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new book &lt;em&gt;Superfreakonomics&lt;/em&gt;, economist Steven Levitt and journalist Stephen Dubner make lots of provocative claims about global warming. For example, they say that solar panels would absorb so much heat they‚Äôd be useless for bringing the planet‚Äôs temperature down by cutting down carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/raymond-t-pierrehumbert/"&gt;Raymond Pierrehumbert&lt;/a&gt;, who, like Levitt, is a professor at the¬† University of Chicago, shows why that‚Äôs wrong‚Äìnot with calculus or some other fancy-schmancy mathematics, but with &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/10/an-open-letter-to-steve-levitt/"&gt;some embarrassingly simple arithmetic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Bartholomew is a social scientist who specializes in mass delusions. He describes them &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/two-mass-delusions-in-new-england/"&gt;here, in an article he wrote for the NESS&lt;/a&gt;, but also in a longer article here for the &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_martian_panic_sixty_years_later_what_have_we_learned/"&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/a&gt; and in his several books. About mass delusions he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collective delusion is the term most commonly used by social scientists to describe the relatively spontaneous spread of false beliefs that do not occur in an organized, institutionalized or ritualistic fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we live in a connected virtual community, and YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and blogs, in addition to traditional media, are the medium through which community panic and delusions spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time there are two slow panics spreading through the community ‚Äì fear of the H1N1 ‚Äúswine‚Äù flu pandemic, and fear of the vaccine to prevent H1N1 flu. Regarding the pandemic itself¬† ‚Äì this is a real threat, it is just not known at this time how severe it will turn out to be. So far it is looking like another seasonal flu in severity, but with some different features, such as a greater tendency to severely affect otherwise healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panic over the vaccine, however, is entirely manufactured, primarily by dedicated conspiracy theorists and anti-vaccinationists, and then aided by irresponsible media. There have been two stories in particular about alleged severe reactions following vaccines recently, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=999"&gt;one dealing with the HPV&lt;/a&gt; vaccine and the recent cased of what is being called dystonia following the seasonal flu vaccine. The young girl who died within hours of getting the HPV vaccine was found to have a heart defect, and her death had nothing to do with the vaccine, so that story was rather short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case making the rounds, however, appears to have some legs. It is getting international news attention, and I am being flooded with e-mail requests to analyze the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Desiree Jennings, who is a 28 year old cheerleader who was apparently healthy until August when she received the seasonal flu vaccine. Ten days later she developed a severe respiratory illness, probably the flu, requiring hospitalization. She then developed¬† an apparent neurological reaction in which she has difficulty speaking and walking, with involuntary muscle contractions and contortions. Her symptoms (including speech) are relieved, however, by walking backwards or by running. She also seems to have attacks of muscle contortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NykxDsddZno&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;News reports &lt;/a&gt;are presenting her story as a rare vaccine reaction. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGT0r-udstQ"&gt;Take a look at the video of her movements &lt;/a&gt;on this news report also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case, of course, has been immediately picked up by the anti-vaccine crowd. Generation Rescue, Jenny McCarthy‚Äôs anti-vaccine organization, &lt;a href="http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/health/dpgo_101509_celebs_reach_out_to_desiree_jennings_flu_shot_reaction_4065808"&gt;wasted no time in exploiting this poor girl&lt;/a&gt; for their own agenda. She is now the latest poster child in the war against vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media is largely covered in fail over their reporting of this case. They failed to ask basic journalistic questions ‚Äì was the illness Jennings suffered from due to the vaccine,¬† was it confirmed as the flu, and was it the strain from the vaccine, was the incubation period compatible with a vaccine-induced flu, did she get the live-virus version of the vaccine, does she really have dystonia, has that diagnosis been verified, are their other possibilities, and what is the plausibility that it was caused by the vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these basic questions are addressed in the news reports ‚Äì instead we are given an emotional report of a ‚Äúone in a million‚Äù (a figure apparently pulled out of someone‚Äôs butt) vaccine reaction. Her episodes are called ‚Äúseizures‚Äù when they are almost certainly not seizures. Her condition has also been called permanent and irreversible ‚Äì without any justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally I try to refrain from making medical diagnoses in public cases ‚Äì but Jennings has now inserted herself in to the anti-vaccine movement, and is using her own case to ‚Äúwarn about the dangers of vaccines.‚Äù To mitigate the damage to public health brought about by misinformation in this case, I think it is necessary to provide some expert opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movements and symptoms that Ms. Jennings displays on the public videos I have seen (linked to above) are not compatible with the diagnosis of dystonia, or any other movement disorder. Dystonia is one type of involuntary contraction of muscles. It can be reduced or exacerbated by certain movements or positions, and there are ‚Äútask specific‚Äù dystonia, such as writer‚Äôs cramp, that come out only with certain activity. Jennings does not display the type of movements that are consistent with dystonia. Her speech and movement are, however, very suggestive of a psychogenic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also seems to be the consensus opinion of experts who have viewed this case. The &lt;a href="http://www.dystonia-foundation.org/pages/dystonia___flu_vaccine/569.php"&gt;Dystonia Medical Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; had this to say about the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the concern of individuals with dystonia as to whether or not to get a flu shot because of this reported case, we have sought the opinion of dystonia experts on this case. Based on the footage that has been shared with the public, it is their unanimous consensus that this case does not appear to be dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one news report that I saw that actually consulted an expert for their opinion was &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP0QYLMUZb4&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. Leigh Vinocur, and emergency room physician, was interviewed and relayed the opinion that the neurologists she consulted were of the opinion that Jennings‚Äô symptoms were consistent with a psychogenic disorder. In other words ‚Äì her symptoms are not neurological, they are psychological. This does not mean she has any insight or voluntary control over her symptoms ‚Äì they are involuntary and ‚Äúreal‚Äù ‚Äì just not neurological in origin. Symptoms such as this are not uncommon reactions to emotional stress in some individuals. Given the evidence presented, I think this is a reasonable opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vinocur also points out that there are no reported cases of true dystonia resulting from the flu vaccine ‚Äì this is not a known or established vaccine reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDdh7LkKQLQ&amp;amp;annotation_id=annotation_805656&amp;amp;feature=iv"&gt;Here is another interview on Fox &lt;/a&gt;with a movement disorder specialist, Dr. Stephen Grill, who concurs that (based upon the video, and not personal examination) Ms. Jennings does not have true dystonia but psychogenic dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore highly unlikely that whatever Jennings is suffering from now had anything to do with the flu vaccine she received in August. Unfortunately, this is not stopping irresponsible news coverage or exploitation by anti-vaccinationists. Further, Jennings is now in the hands of the Generation Rescue anti-vaccine quacks. I predict that they will be able to ‚Äúcure‚Äù her, because psychogenic disorders can and do spontaneously resolve. They will then claim victory for their quackery in curing a (non-existent) vaccine injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the public harm, Ms. Jennings herself is likely to be harmed by the media attention her case is garnering. She likely could benefit from proper medical attention of her condition. But now she is publicly invested in her disorder, and is likely to accept care from those with their own anti-vaccine agenda. It is difficult enough dealing with psychogenic disorders without international public attention and controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical community is always careful to point out that there are very rare reactions to vaccines. No one is claiming that they are 100% safe ‚Äì no medical intervention is. But severe reactions are very rare. Meanwhile, about 36,000 people die each year in the US alone from the seasonal flu. That figure is likely to be higher this year, as seasonal strains are combined with the H1N1 strain to form a particularly bad flu season. We are fortunate that there are vaccines both for the seasonal flu and the H1N1 flu, which is particularly well targeted because we know the strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other measures for minimizing spread of the flu are, as always, also important ‚Äì wash your hands, stay home if you are ill, and avoid contact with those with respiratory symptoms. But the vaccines are likely to significantly reduce the spread and severity of the flu. And yet, fear-mongering and misinformation, such as with the Jennings case, are scaring people away from the vaccines, without good cause.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256906098385"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/are_we_having_a_good_time.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c8432d6db6aa18be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Are we having a good time?</title><published>2009-10-30T13:07:35Z</published><updated>2009-10-30T13:07:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/ymLUMRwAgWE/are_we_having_a_good_time.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/are_we_having_a_good_time.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/10/are_we_having_a_good_time/myers_shubin.jpeg" width="400" height="300" alt="myers_shubin.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Specifically, it's something that my blog bud Abel Pharmboy has been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/10/when_critics_disagree_with_me.php"&gt;hitting hard&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/10/wired_posts_amy_wallace_loveha.php"&gt;the last couple of days&lt;/a&gt;. It may also, sadly, because I've become a bit jaded at the nastiness that anti-vaccine groups such as &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., "Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey's Autism Organization"--at least days) and its erstwile founder J.B. Handley can lay down. I'm referring, of course, to Amy Wallace, who wrote &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_anti-vaccine_war_on_science_an_epide.php"&gt;what to me is the best example&lt;/a&gt; of an article in the mainstream media about the anti-vaccine movement that "gets it." The article was called &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience"&gt;An Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us All&lt;/a&gt; and appeared in WIRED Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a thing of beauty. There was no false "balance" that puts cranks pushing dangerous pseudoscience on the same plane as real scientists like Paul Offit. There was even a section &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience_misinformants"&gt;calling out purveyors of vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. Several luminaries of the the anti-vaccine movement were there, including ones discussed frequently on this blog, like Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Don Imus. But that wasn't all! There was even a section on &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience_argument"&gt;how to debunk anti-vaccine canards&lt;/a&gt;. What more could an advocate of science-based medicine ask for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first read Wallace's article, I knew she was going to be in for a rough time. The anti-vaccine movement doesn't take kindly to criticism. Indeed, I even warned the publicist who had e-mailed a bunch of bloggers, including me, about the article that I hoped she was ready for a "shitstorm" (the exact word I used). After all, I've been the target of J.B. Handley's wrath on more than one occasion. He's particularly fond of trying to poison my Google reputation when I annoy him sufficiently, and one time either he or someone inspired by one of his attacks on me actually e-mailed my cancer center director a link to his screed. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if J.B. posts another similar smear after this post. Maybe I'll post this under my own name under my other blog. J.B. only seems to complain about my all-out frontal assaults on the anti-vaccine movement when they come from behind the Orac 'nym. Never mind that I've posted the same stuff, sometimes the almost exactly the same text, word for word, under my own name elsewhere. Indeed, when I do that, inevitably the attacks will land fast and furious on Orac and leave the Real Me alone. I guess that once outing is gone as a threat all that leaves is whining about my use of a pseudonym and how supposedly nasty I am--to which I retort that I consider endangering children to be far nastier than the worst sarcasm I've ever laid down here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, the publicist said she and Wallace were ready. Well, as an i&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114249382"&gt;nterview on NPR with Wallace has shown&lt;/a&gt;, the shitstorm has arrived, and it is just as stinky as the term implies, complete with misogyny and sexism. Abel &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/10/wired_posts_amy_wallace_loveha.php"&gt;compiled a more coherent description&lt;/a&gt; from Wallace's &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/msamywallace"&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_anti-vaccine_movement_strikes_back_u.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_anti-vaccine_movement_strikes_back_u.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/SIiNecFvaaY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256905301365"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/deep_sea_news/~3/4kegcSQF-PY/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/16aff4a53144a259</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">New Species Friday 10/30/09 ‚Äì Ophryotrocha fabriae</title><published>2009-10-30T06:13:13Z</published><updated>2009-10-30T06:13:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/PFEOY1hODok/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/deep_sea_news/~3/4kegcSQF-PY/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Say hello to my little fried‚Ä¶ In fact, this guy is so small you might have missed if you didn‚Äôt use the right sieve mesh size!

Their third album (released last year) is &lt;em&gt;Oh My God, Charlie Darwin&lt;/em&gt;, and the video for first track, &lt;em&gt;Charlie Darwin&lt;/em&gt;, just debuted. It‚Äôs not a heavy, sciencey song like, say, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/07/here-comes-science/"&gt;the recent TMBG album&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2009/06/30/the-low-anthem-the-ad-interview/"&gt;apparently Darwin was some inspiration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, we all read &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúEast of Eden‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; before the recording session. We had the books great word ‚Äútimshel‚Äù taped above the control booth. It from ancient Hebrew meaning ‚Äúthough mayest.‚Äù We also had a copy of &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThe Origin of Species‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; close at hand always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the embedded video for Charlie Darwin, and after the jump you‚Äôll find the lyrics and the band‚Äôs interpretation on whether the song is depressingly nihilistic or strangely uplifting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the sails I feel the winds a‚Äôstirring&lt;br&gt;
Toward the bright horizon set the way&lt;br&gt;
Cast your wreckless dreams upon our Mayflower&lt;br&gt;
Haven from the world and her decay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who could heed the words of Charlie Darwin&lt;br&gt;
Fighting for a system built to fail&lt;br&gt;
Spooning water from their broken vessels&lt;br&gt;
As far as I can see there is no land&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my god, the water‚Äôs all around us&lt;br&gt;
Oh my god, it‚Äôs all around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who could heed the words of Charlie Darwin&lt;br&gt;
The lords of war just profit from decay&lt;br&gt;
And trade their children‚Äôs promise for the jingle&lt;br&gt;
The way we trade our hard earned time for pay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my god, the water‚Äôs cold and shapeless&lt;br&gt;
Oh my god, it‚Äôs all around&lt;br&gt;
Oh my god, life is cold and formless&lt;br&gt;
Oh my god, it‚Äôs all around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2009/07/tlobf-interview-the-low-anthem/"&gt;TLOBF&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs talk about your music, like the lyrics to Charlie Darwin.&lt;br&gt;
Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me it sounds‚Ä¶ well quite horribly depressing, lyrically, really. Was that the intention?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ben&lt;/strong&gt;: Well I guess it depends on your perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it was a quite a literal interpretation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ben&lt;/strong&gt;: There‚Äôs just not a lot of‚Ä¶ anchors out there you know, you‚Äôre brought up and you‚Äôre taught certain very specific things or probably most people are and when you‚Äôre given some of education you‚Äôre taught to relate to your community in a certain way‚Ä¶ Essentially our knowledge is ideas that continue to get passed down, the strong survive, it kinda makes it impossible to believe in a framework like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think if you fully accept that scientific and logical outlook on the world then everything else just becomes theory and essentially meaningless?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ben&lt;/strong&gt;: Well it‚Äôs like our morality is a product of the same survival of the fittest of ideas and passed down and whatever institution propagate whatever ideas, the strong survive. Like the Church of England has some brilliant missionary wing and the ethic is to spread their religion into different parts of the empire that they are expanding into, that‚Äôs a lot like a natural reproductive instinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think that the urge to spread your ideas is many ways probably a part of that instinct to make copies of yourself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ben&lt;/strong&gt;: So its uh, I mean that‚Äôs all well and good but I think it puts in perspective things like relationships that you were taught to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So would you say that there‚Äôs this tide, like the with lyrics about ‚Äòthe formless waters‚Äô that are fighting to come in, that they represent this almost irresistible retreat to nihilism?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ben&lt;/strong&gt;: I think that what‚Äôs most beautiful is people‚Äôs efforts to hold onto something despite that nihilism, you know we live in the face of that every day and decide to do things. Maybe it‚Äôs a beautiful and pervasive failure at all moments but it‚Äôs so beautiful to see humans struggling against that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it‚Äôs an interesting perspective, from someone who is apparently not religious and who finds man‚Äôs tiny place in the universe futile yet uplifting. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256904481029"><id gr:original-id="714 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ead0f88dbb9dfa54</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Change" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/environment/climate-change"/><category term="Economics" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/economics"/><category term="global warming" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/430"/><category term="vegetarianism" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/948"/><category term="Feature" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/976"/><category term="Subfeature" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/977"/><category term="Environment" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/environment"/><title type="html">Meat is Murder - tasty, tasty murder</title><published>2009-10-30T12:11:11Z</published><updated>2009-10-30T12:11:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/714" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://www.layscience.net/files/cownchicken_cartoons.gif" type="image/gif" length="19934"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; Climate chief, Lord Stern of Brentford, has said that we should give up meat to save the planet from global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's undeniable that rearing herds of animals for meat is bad for the environment, is vegetarianism the answer - or even an answer? This is not an entirely scientific response to Lord Stern but there are a few points more serious responses have missed that have occurred to my flu-addled brain.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/cownchicken_cartoons.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to provide vegetarians with dairy products, cattle must be bred. But only females are needed for milk. The males will not be sent off to live out their lives happily in green pastures; apart from a few kept for breeding, they will be slaughtered. The same goes for male chicks in egg production.  The bodies will have to be disposed of, either as landfill or by burning, both of which have health and ecology implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from environmental issues, this also removes any moral high ground from vegetarians. What's more, in Veggie World, anyone who eats meat but not dairy would be forced into veganism. That's not just lactose intolerant Westerners but a large proportion of the population of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veganism may be the only true moral position regarding the exploitation of animals. But it has its problems as vegans don't eat honey. The bees that produce honey also pollinate crops as well as wild flowers and other flora essential to a healthy eco-system. Wild bees are not enough. So if we all became vegan, the planet would be headed for disaster unless we all kept bees as pets (not such a bad idea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would Veggie World be like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pigs would disappear. Children would grow up learning about them as semi-mythical beasts from the past, along with dodos. Or possibly they could see them in zoos. People who overeat could no longer be meaningfully compared with pigs.  The film Babe might be mistaken for a historically accurate tale of pig farming.   Sheep and goats would go too, apart from a few breeds used for cheese. Breeding sheep for wool would probably end as wool is a non-essential fabric. All the religious iconography and symbolism about lambs would become obscure. The Lamb of God and the Good Shepherd would become empty images. None of this is necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans aren't the only ones who eat meat. What would cats and dogs eat? If humans have to stop eating meat, feeding it to pets could hardly be justified.  Apart from guide dogs and police dogs, man's best carnivore friend would become a thing of the past. Farmers wouldn't need dogs any more as there would be no sheep to herd. One Man and His Dog would never be seen on TV again. Nor would Crufts. Again, not necessarily a bad thing if it meant that Ben Fogle was on TV less. There would be no dog poo in the world either. The Andrex puppy would be no more. The Internet would no longer be flooded with pets in cute poses or dressed up in clothes.  A whole section of the greetings card industry would be threatened; no more pictures of fluffy puppies and kittens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macdonalds would either go out of business or switch to making meat-flavoured veggie burgers. We'd all be eating a lot more beans to get our protein. Methane produced by farm animals farting is one of the contributors to global warming but six billion people farting constantly is not going to do the ozone layer any favours. Incidentally, rice paddies also give off methane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do eat more meat than is good for the planet and many of us eat more than is healthy for us but as far as vegetarianism being the solution - Stern really hasn't thought this through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETA: I now appear to have swine flu. The irony is not lost on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NS_Facebook.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NS_Facebook.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LLL.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LLL.png" alt="" width="150" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Also on Wednesday, I saw the wonderful Shakespeare's Globe¬† &lt;a href="http://www.shakespeares-globe.org/theatre/annualtheatreseason/loveslabourslost/"&gt;production&lt;/a&gt; of Love's Labour's Lost.¬† Paul Ready was especially hilarious as Don Adriano de Armado, to single out one great performance among many.¬† Christopher Godwin's portrayal of Holofernes the pedant was another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten the passage where Holofernes complains about Armado&amp;#39;s pronunciations. The complaint is not about Armado&amp;#39;s Spanish accent, but about his unetymological pronunciations ‚Äî omitting the &amp;#39;b&amp;#39; in &lt;em&gt;doubt&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;debt&lt;/em&gt;, and the 'l' in &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;calf; &lt;/em&gt;leaving out the reflex of 'gh' in &lt;em&gt;neighbor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;neigh; &lt;/em&gt;inserting (or removing?) [h] in &lt;em&gt;abominable&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;He draweth out the thred of his verbositie, finer then the staple of his argument. I abhor such phanaticall phantasims, such insociable and poynt deuise companions, such rackers of ortagriphie, as to speake dout fine, when he should say doubt; det, when he shold pronounce debt; d e b t, not det: he clepeth a Calf, Caufe: halfe, haufe: neighbour vocatur nebour; neigh abreuiated ne: this is abhominable, which he would call abhominable: it insinuateth me of infamie: ne inteligis domine , to make franticke, lunaticke?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text fails to make it clear whether the alleged flaw is adding or lacking an [h] in &lt;em&gt;abominable,&lt;/em&gt; since both Holofernes&amp;#39; own pronunciation and his presentation of Armado&amp;#39;s pronunciation are spelled &amp;quot;abhominable&amp;quot; in the text ‚Äî the version above is from the 1623 First Folio, but the 1598 Quarto is the same in that respect. The issue, according to the OED, is a sort of Renaissance eggcorn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Forms with medial -h- in post-classical Latin, Middle French, and English arose by a folk etymology &amp;lt; classical Latin &lt;em&gt;ab homine&lt;/em&gt; away from man, inhuman, a derivation which has also influenced the semantic development of the word in English and French. Forms with &lt;em&gt;-h-&lt;/em&gt; were common in English until the 17th cent., when they began to be criticized by orthographers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that it would be funnier to have Holofernes' correction in this case be an &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004264.html"&gt;incorrection&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî but now I can&amp;#39;t remember for sure how Godwin performed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this passage is the earliest example of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?cat=62"&gt;linguistic peeving&lt;/a&gt; that I can think of. Can anyone give me an example before 1598?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dimly recall that there might be something of the sort¬† in Plautus, but I think it involves making fun of a rustic accent, rather than complaining about forms that reflect an on-going change in the language.¬† I can't find the passage, anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[As the many helpful examples in the comments make clear, this is far from the earliest example of linguistic peeving. But so far, it does seem to be the earliest example in which (as is so often the case) all or nearly all of the corrections are incorrect.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For some interesting discussion of spellings (and characters, events, and themes) in Love's Labour Lost, see &lt;a href="http://www.ericsams.org/rs2_16b.htm"&gt;this essay&lt;/a&gt; by Eric Sams.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update ‚Äî the version of the passage above, which I got by cut-and-paste from (I think) &lt;a href="http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Annex/Texts/LLL/F1/work/"&gt;this version&lt;/a&gt; of the 1623 First Folio, has &lt;em&gt;abhominable&lt;/em&gt; in both places, as indicated in &lt;a href="http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/facsimile/book/SLNSW_F1/154/?size=large&amp;amp;view_mode=normal&amp;amp;content_type="&gt;this fascimile&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;

But the &lt;a href="http://prodigi.bl.uk/treasures/shakespeare/search.asp"&gt;1598 Quarto&lt;/a&gt; clearly has &lt;em&gt;abhominable ‚Ä¶ abbominable&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January Hemant hosted Christian apologist &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.leestrobel.com/"&gt;Lee Strobel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on this website. When Strobel was asked to provide some challenging questions to the audience here, the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/01/29/lee-strobel-answers-your-questions-part-3/"&gt;first question he provided&lt;/a&gt; was this one from fellow Christian apologist &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.garyhabermas.com/"&gt;Dr. Gary Habermas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Utilizing each of the historical facts conceded by virtually all contemporary scholars, please produce a comprehensive natural explanation of Jesus‚Äô resurrection that makes better sense than the event itself. These historical facts are: (1) Jesus was killed by crucifixion; (2) Jesus‚Äô disciples believed that he rose and appeared to them; (3) The conversion of the church persecutor Saul, who became the Apostle Paul; (4) the conversion of the skeptic James, Jesus‚Äô half-brother; (5) The empty tomb of Jesus. These ‚Äúminimal facts‚Äù are strongly evidenced and are regarded as historical by the vast majority of scholars, including skeptics, who have written about the resurrection in French, German, and English since 1975. While the fifth fact doesn‚Äôt have quite the same virtual universal consensus, it nevertheless is conceded by 75 percent of the scholars and is well supported by the historical data if assessed without preconceptions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the same basic challenge from resurrection defender &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ntwrightpage.com/"&gt;Dr. N.T. Wright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: ‚ÄúThe [discovered] empty tomb and the ‚Äòmeetings‚Äô with Jesus, when combined, present us with not only a &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt; condition for the rise of early Christian belief, but also, it seems, a &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; one. Nothing else historians have been able to come up with has the power to explain the phenomena before us‚Äù (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800626796?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0800626796"&gt;The Resurrection of the Son of God&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 2003, pg. 706). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion these are fair questions from the traditional side of scholarship, and as a layman studying Christian origins, I found the responses from non-traditional scholarship not completely satisfying, or at least not very well or completely explained. The lack of a satisfactory response does not by default mean that Jesus resurrected from the dead, but it does spark the imagination. What really happened 2,000 years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began my own inquiry into this question several years ago.  I took as my starting point the beliefs and traditions expressed in &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:3-7&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;1 Corinthians 15:3-7&lt;/a&gt;, widely recognized amongst scholars on both sides of the aisle to contain the earliest known Christian beliefs and traditions: Jesus died for our sins, was raised on the third day, and appeared to many people.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In considering the possible causes of these beliefs and traditions, notice that Dr. Wright does not appeal to the historical reliability of the gospels. He is saying that even &lt;em&gt;apart&lt;/em&gt; from the gospel accounts of a discovered empty tomb and ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù with Jesus, nothing else historians have been able to come up with has the power to explain early Christian belief. Strobel and Habermas are not as open to suggestions outside the confines of the gospels, but as Habermas admits, the discovered empty tomb tradition is the weakest of his five ‚Äúfacts.‚Äù Given this, I start my investigation by accepting the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; that the gospels could be mostly legend, including the discovered empty tomb tradition. For those who reject such a starting point, hear me out and I will show how this topic comes back full circle and impacts on the question of gospel reliability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the discovered empty tomb tradition is a legend, not only is Jesus‚Äô resurrection effectively ruled out, but so are several non-traditional explanations for the rise of early Christian belief, like the stolen body theory, the moved body theory, and the theory that Jesus only appeared to be dead and then resuscitated. With these ruled out, there is only one explanation that jumps out at me as a plausible cause of the two-pronged belief that Jesus died for our sins and was raised, half of the &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:3-7&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;1 Cor 15:3-7&lt;/a&gt; formula. That cause is the human phenomenon of cognitive dissonance reduction. Basically, this is the human tendency to rationalize a discontinuity between reality and one‚Äôs current beliefs in such a way that current beliefs are modified or added too instead of being rejected. Sometimes this results in extremely radical rationalizations. We have solid examples of this from other religious movements in history, such as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerism"&gt;Millerite&lt;/a&gt; movement, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi"&gt;Sabbatai Zevi&lt;/a&gt; movement, and others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory has of course been presented before and the controversy surrounding it can be seen in Dr. Wright‚Äôs strong disagreement with it and Dr. Robert M. Price‚Äôs response to Wright‚Äôs critique. According to Wright, ‚ÄúThe flaws in this argument [that cognitive dissonance caused early Christian belief] are so enormous that it is puzzling to find serious scholars still referring to it in deferential terms‚Äù (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800626796?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0800626796"&gt;Resurrection of the Son of God&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, pg. 698; full critique pg. 697-701). Price &lt;a href="http://www.robertmprice.mindvendor.com/rev_ntwrong.htm"&gt;responds with&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
‚Ä¶there are many viable explanations [for the rise of the belief that Jesus resurrected], not least Festinger‚Äôs theory of cognitive dissonance reduction, whereby more than one disappointed sect has turned defeat into zeal by means of face-saving denial. Wright &lt;em&gt;suicidally&lt;/em&gt; mentions this theory, only to dismiss it‚Ä¶with no serious attempt at refutation [emphasis added].
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with Price; Wright does not adequately rebut this idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the cognitive dissonance solution very plausible myself but feeling that it has not been communicated very well in discussions about Christian origins, I decided to publish a book about it.  For those interested in my book, it can be found &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982552807?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0982552807"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (or at &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Doubting-Jesus-Resurrection-Happened-Black/dp/0982552807/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1256872329&amp;amp;sr=1-1-spell"&gt;Amazon.uk&lt;/a&gt;), along with endorsements from several notable scholars.  Not only does my book apply the concept of cognitive dissonance to the belief that Jesus died for our sins and was raised, but it offers an explanation for the appearance traditions (no, not mass group hallucinations) and the belief that it was on the third day that Jesus was raised. It also takes a look at where Jesus was most likely buried considering the fact that he was a member of the lower classes. In summary, my book attempts to condense a lot of thought that has gone into this specific topic and adds what I think are a few missing links to produce a single comprehensive natural explanation for the rise of the beliefs and traditions in 1 Cor 15:3-7.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plausible non-traditional explanation for the rise of the beliefs and traditions in 1 Cor 15:3-7 comes full circle and impacts on the historical reliability of the gospels. Why? Because 1 Cor 15:3-7 is used by traditionalists as external evidence for the historical reliability of the gospels. But if there is another plausible explanation for the rise of these beliefs and traditions, there is nothing about 1 Cor 15:3-7 itself that supports the conclusion that the gospels are more likely historical rather than legendary expansions of these beliefs and traditions. In short, traditional scholarship should not be using 1 Cor 15:3-7 to support gospel reliability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd like to thank Hemant for giving me the opportunity to voice my opinion and introduce my book. I think other laypeople especially will find it readable and original in its approach to Christian origins, and I think it is the laypeople of the world who need to make sense of the arguments and claims that scholars make about their religious traditions. &lt;/p&gt;

Kai Spiegelhalder and colleagues were able to use the woman&amp;#39;s elevated heart rate to provide an objective marker for the course of her panic attack. The 59-year-old was unmedicated and had no prior history of panic attacks. She did have restless legs syndrome - a condition characterised by an comfortable urge to move the legs. Inspection of the woman&amp;#39;s brain activity during the panic episode showed that her heart-rate was positively correlated with activity in her left amygdala - the walnut-shaped brain structure known to be involved in emotional learning. There was also some association between panic and activity in the woman&amp;#39;s left insula. This brain region is involved in the detection and processing of bodily states. These observations are consistent with research conducted with panic disorder patients who have been provoked into having an attack with the use of drugs. &amp;quot;It appears likely that the insula may be involved early in the onset of panic, acting as an &amp;#39;internal alarm&amp;#39;,&amp;quot; the researchers said.Another observation was that as the woman&amp;#39;s heart rate increased, activity decreased in her left middle temporal gyrus - a bulge in the part of the cortex near the ear. Some previous studies have actually made the opposite observation with panic disorder patients. &amp;quot;...[D]ecreased temporal lobe activity is perhaps specific to healthy individuals experiencing their first attack,&amp;quot; the researchers said.Spiegelhalder&amp;#39;s team warned their results should be treated with caution, especially since they involved a single case study. However, they said their data &amp;quot;do suggest, to some extent, that the neural mechanisms involved in a spontaneous panic attack share some similarity with those proposed to play a role in patients with panic-related disorder.&amp;quot;   _________________________________Spiegelhalder, K., Hornyak, M., Kyle, S., Paul, D., Blechert, J., Seifritz, E., Hennig, J., Tebartz van Elst, L., Riemann, D., &amp;amp; Feige, B.

&lt;p&gt;In the first bit of &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/permission-granted.html"&gt;good news&lt;/a&gt;, on October 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Simon Singh was granted permission to appeal the High Court &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/05/bca-v-singh-official-ruling.html"&gt;ruling on meaning&lt;/a&gt; of the term ‚Äúbogus‚Äù within his original article. ¬†I‚Äôm sure most readers of this blog are familiar with Simon Singh‚Äôs legal battle with the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) regarding an article in The Guardian entitled ‚ÄúBeware the Spinal Trap.‚Äù¬† We‚Äôve covered it &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=485"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=576"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; over the last year and will continue to do so as the case progresses. The nuances of the British legal system (or any legal system for that matter) are beyond my ken, and are far better explained by Jack of Kent &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/permission-granted.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.¬† The take-home point is that gaining permission to appeal the ruling on meaning was virtually essential if Simon were to have any real chance of winning this lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the BCA should win its lawsuit for libel against Singh, it seems likely to be something of a pyrrhic victory.¬† After all, in the year since this story began, we‚Äôve been belatedly provided with the &lt;a href="http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/gfx/uploads/textbox/Singh/BCA%20Statement%20170609.pdf"&gt;BCA‚Äôs best evidence&lt;/a&gt; in support of chiropractic‚Äôs efficacy, and promptly treated to its subsequent &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=555"&gt;evisceration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve also been given insight into the standards held and practices recommended by the McTimoney Chiropractic Association (&lt;a href="http://www.mctimoney-chiropractic.org/"&gt;MCA&lt;/a&gt;), which by its own reckoning is the second largest chiropractic association in Europe.¬† In an apparent response to the attention brought by the BCA‚Äôs lawsuit, the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/jun/19/chiropractic-bca-mca-singh"&gt;MCA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://chiropracticlive.com/advertising-standards/the-mctimoney-chiropractic-association-would-seem-to-believe-that-chiropractic-is-ldquo-bogus-rdquo/"&gt;advised&lt;/a&gt; its members to take down their websites and remove all reference to treatment of ‚Äúwhiplash, colic, or other childhood problems‚Äù from their places of business to avoid a ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù targeting ‚Äúany claims for treatment that cannot be substantiated with chiropractic research.‚Äù If only the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum"&gt;Malleus Maleficarum&lt;/a&gt; had been written with such high standards of evidence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same email we were treated to their unique perspective on ethics and the right of patients to information with this gem of a quote (punctuation intact):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;we strongly suggest you do NOT discuss this with others, especially patients, Firstly it would not be ethical to burden patients with this‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this statement to be the most abhorrent in the entire MCA email.¬† This is advice from a major professional organization to withhold information from patients.¬† And not just an esoteric bit of chiropractic minutiae, but information that pertains to entire swaths of chiropractic practice.¬† Even worse, nowhere in the email does it advise MCA chiropractors to stop treating the stated conditions, just to obfuscate the fact that they do.¬† As I said, abhorrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in their attempt to silence one critic through litigation, the BCA has drawn attention to the paucity of evidence supporting many of its practices, shown that its chosen response to criticism is litigation and not scientific discourse, and prompted some alarmingly unethical advisory statements from their chiropractic colleagues. ¬†For a group supposedly striving to gain legitimacy within modern medicine, their current course of action seems to be ill conceived at best.¬† As the saying goes, ‚ÄúThose who live in glass houses shouldn‚Äôt throw stones.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon has rightfully received an outstanding amount of support during this event, one example of which was a &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/380/"&gt;mass reposting&lt;/a&gt; of ‚ÄúBeware the Spinal Trap‚Äù coordinated by &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/"&gt;Sense about Science&lt;/a&gt;.¬† Such advocacy is not without its risks, as both Simon Singh and now the Australian Skeptics can testify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/"&gt;Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; is a coalition of volunteer advocacy groups dedicated to the advancement of science and reason.¬† Among their many interests, they‚Äôve chosen to be outspoken advocates for evidence and science-based medicine, using &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/publications/"&gt;both traditional and ‚Äúnew media‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; to great effect. That they were among the many to support Singh by reposting his article in late July should have been no surprise; the trouble that simple reposting has caused them, however, was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently their re-posting of ‚ÄúBeware the Spinal Trap‚Äù raised the ire of an Australian chiropractor, Joseph Ierano.¬† Shortly after sending a lengthy letter to the Australian Skeptics objecting to the content of Singh‚Äôs article, he submitted a &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/HCCC-Ierano-Complaint.pdf"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; to the HCCC claiming that by posting Singh‚Äôs article, the Australian Skeptics were offering incorrect medical/health care advice and should be subject to the Australian Public Health Act of 1993.¬† Their subsequent exchanges can be found &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/skeptics-chiropractic-ierano-segev-response-20090906.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of course brings me to the second bit of &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/announcements/chiropractors-complaint-against-australian-skeptics-dismissed/"&gt;good news&lt;/a&gt;.¬† I am happy to report that on October 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; the Australian Skeptics received word that the HCCC of NSW dismissed the complaint filed against them by Joseph Ierano, citing that the Australian Skeptics were not health care providers and therefore did not fall under their jurisdiction.¬† Joseph Ierano, however, certainly is a health care provider and makes some rather interesting claims on &lt;a href="http://www.chiropracticierano.com.au/page5/page5.html"&gt;his own site&lt;/a&gt; that might not have the firmest of foundations.¬† I wonder if he really intended to bring himself to the HCCC‚Äôs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heartily congratulate both Simon Singh and the Australian Skeptics that their respective cases have taken turns in their favor, and in support of good science.¬† Though I‚Äôm sure the Australian Skeptics would have relished the opportunity to defend themselves and explore the accuracy of statements made by Singh and Ierano in open court (they‚Äôve said as much on their site), I rather prefer that it didn‚Äôt come to that.¬† Given that legal decisions can impact the public perception of the science but have no bearing on its validity, courtroom battles tend to be high-risk and low-gain for those of us promoting science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of global warming is so big that solving it will require creative thinking from many disciplines. Economists have much to contribute to this effort, particularly with regard to the question of how various means of putting a price on carbon emissions may alter human behavior.  Some of the lines of thinking in your first book, &lt;strong&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/strong&gt;, could well have had a bearing on this issue, if brought to bear on the carbon emissions problem.  I have very much enjoyed and benefited from the growing collaborations between Geosciences and the Economics department here at the University of Chicago, and had hoped someday to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance.  It is more in disappointment than anger that I am writing to you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am addressing this to you rather than your journalist-coauthor because one has become all too accustomed to tendentious screeds from media personalities (think Glenn Beck)  with a reckless disregard for the truth. However, if it has come to pass that we can‚Äôt expect the William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor (and Clark Medalist to boot) at a top-rated department of a respected university to think clearly and honestly with numbers, we are indeed in a sad way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now there have been many detailed dissections of everything that is wrong with the treatment of climate in &lt;strong&gt;Superfreakonomics&lt;/strong&gt; , but what has been lost amidst all that extensive discussion is how &lt;em&gt;really simple&lt;/em&gt; it would have been to get this stuff right.    The problem wasn‚Äôt necessarily that you talked to the wrong experts or talked to too few of them. The problem was that you failed to do the most elementary thinking needed to see if what they were saying (or what you thought they were saying) in fact made any sense. If  you were stupid, it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad to have messed up such elementary reasoning, but I don‚Äôt by any means think you are stupid. That makes the failure to do the thinking all the more disappointing. I will take Nathan Myhrvold‚Äôs claim about solar cells, which you quoted prominently in your book, as an example.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As quoted by you, Mr. Myhrvold claimed, in effect, that it was pointless to try to solve global warming by building solar cells, because they are black and absorb all the solar energy that hits them, but convert only some 12% to electricity while radiating the rest as heat, warming the planet. Now, maybe you were dazzled by Mr Myhrvold‚Äôs brilliance, but don‚Äôt we try to teach our students to think for themselves?  Let‚Äôs go through the arithmetic step by step and see how it comes out.  It‚Äôs not hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs do the thought experiment of building a solar array to generate the entire world‚Äôs present electricity consumption, and see what the extra absorption of sunlight by the array does to climate. First we need to find the electricity consumption. Just do a Google search on ‚ÄúWorld electricity consumption‚Äù and here you are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/GoogleElec1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/GoogleElec1.png" alt="GoogleElec" title="GoogleElec" width="598" height="173"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that‚Äôs the total electric energy consumed during the year, and you can turn that into the rate of energy consumption (measured in Watts, just like the world was one big light bulb) by dividing kilowatt hours by the number of hours in a year, and multiplying by 1000 to convert kilowatts into watts. The answer is two trillion Watts, in round numbers.  How much area of solar cells do you need to generate this?  On average, about 200 Watts falls on each square meter of Earth‚Äôs surface, but you might preferentially put your cells in sunnier, clearer places, so let‚Äôs call it 250 Watts per square meter. With a 15% efficiency, which is middling for present technology the area you need is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
2 trillion Watts/(.15 X 250. Watts per square meter)
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or 53,333 square kilometers. That‚Äôs a square 231 kilometers on a side, or about the size of a single cell of a typical general circulation model grid box.  If we put it on the globe, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/Globe.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/Globe-299x258.png" alt="Globe" title="Globe" width="299" height="258"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So already you should be beginning to suspect that this is a pretty trivial part of the Earth‚Äôs surface, and maybe unlikely to have much of an effect on the overall absorbed sunlight.  In fact, it‚Äôs only 0.01%  of the Earth‚Äôs surface.  The numbers I used to do this calculation can all be found in Wikipedia, or even in a good paperbound World Almanac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we should go further, and look at the actual amount of extra solar energy absorbed. As many reviewers of  &lt;strong&gt;Superfreakonomics&lt;/strong&gt;  have noted, solar cells aren‚Äôt actually black, but that‚Äôs not the main issue. For the sake of argument, let‚Äôs just assume they absorb all the sunlight that falls on them. In my business, we call that ‚Äúzero albedo‚Äù (i.e. zero reflectivity). As many commentators also noted, the albedo of real solar cells is no lower than materials like roofs that they are often placed on, so that solar cells don‚Äôt necessarily increase absorbed solar energy at all. Let‚Äôs ignore that, though. After all, you might want to put your solar cells in the desert, and you might try to cool the planet by painting your roof white.  The albedo of desert sand can also be found easily by doing a Google search on ‚ÄúAlbedo Sahara Desert,‚Äù for example. Here‚Äôs what you get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/GoogleSand1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/GoogleSand1-300x98.png" alt="GoogleSand" title="GoogleSand" width="300" height="98"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let‚Äôs say that sand has a 50% albedo.  That means that each square meter of black solar cell absorbs an extra 125 Watts that otherwise would have been reflected by the sand (i.e. 50% of the 250 Watts per square meter of sunlight).  Multiplying by the area of solar cell, we get 6.66 trillion Watts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That 6.66 trillion Watts is the ‚Äúwaste heat‚Äù that is a byproduct of generating electricity by using solar cells.  All means of generating electricity involve waste heat, and fossil fuels are not an exception.  A typical coal-fired power plant only is around 33% efficient, so you would need to release 6 trillion Watts of heat to burn the coal to make our 2 trillion Watts of electricity.  That makes the waste heat of solar cells vs. coal basically a wash, and we could stop right there, but let‚Äôs continue our exercise in thinking with numbers anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Wherever it comes from, waste heat is not usually taken into account in global climate calculations for the simple reason that it is utterly trivial in comparison to the heat trapped by the carbon dioxide that is released when you burn fossil fuels to supply energy. For example, that 6 trillion Watts of waste heat from coal burning would amount to only 0.012 Watts per square meter of the Earth‚Äôs surface.  Without even thinking very hard, you can realize that this is a tiny number compared to the heat-trapping effect of CO2. As a general point of reference, the extra heat trapped by CO2 at the point where you‚Äôve burned enough coal to double the atmospheric CO2 concentration is about 4 Watts per square meter of the Earth‚Äôs surface ‚Äî over 300 times the effect of the waste heat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‚Äú4 Watts per square meter‚Äù statistic gives us an easy point of reference because it is  available from any number of easily accessible sources, such as the IPCC Technical Summary or David Archer‚Äôs basic textbook that came out of our ‚ÄúGlobal Warming for Poets‚Äù  core course.   Another simple way to grasp the insignificance of the waste heat effect is to turn it into a temperature change using the standard climate sensitivity of 1 degree C of warming for each 2 Watts per square meter of heat added to the energy budget of the planet (this sensitivity factor also being readily available from sources like the ones I just pointed out). That gives us a warming of 0.006 degrees C for the waste heat from coal burning, and much less for the incremental heat from switching to solar cells.  It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of thinking to realize that this is a trivial number compared to the magnitude of warming expected from a doubling of CO2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just a little more calculation,  it‚Äôs possible to do a more precise and informative comparison. For coal-fired generation,each kilowatt-hour produced results in emissions of about a quarter kilogram of carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.  For our 16.83 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity produced each year, we then would emit 4.2 trillion kilograms of carbon, i.e. 4.2 gigatonnes &lt;em&gt;each year&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike energy, carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere, and builds up year after year.  It is only slowly removed by absorption into the ocean, over hundreds to thousands of years. After a hundred years, 420 gigatonnes will have been emitted, and if half that remains in the atmosphere (remember, rough estimates suffice to make the point here) the atmospheric stock of CO2 carbon will increase by 210 gigatonnes, or 30% of the pre-industrial atmospheric stock of about 700 gigatonnes of carbon.  To get the heat trapped by CO2 from that amount of increase, we need to reach all the way back into middle-school math and use the awesome tool of logarithms; the number is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;(4 Watts per square meter) X log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1.3)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or 1.5 Watts per square meter.  In other words, by the time a hundred years have passed, the heat trapped each year from the CO2 emitted by using coal instead of solar energy to produce electricity is  &lt;em&gt;125 times&lt;/em&gt; the effect of the fossil fuel waste heat. And remember that the &lt;em&gt;incremental&lt;/em&gt; waste heat from switching to solar cells is even smaller than the fossil fuel waste heat.  What‚Äôs more, because each passing year sees more CO2 accumulate in the atmosphere, the heat trapping by CO2 &lt;em&gt;continues to go up&lt;/em&gt;, while the  effect of the waste heat from the fossil fuels or solar cells needed to produce a given amount of electricity stays fixed.  Another way of putting it is that the climate effect from the waste heat produced by any kind of power plant is a one-off thing that you incur when you build the plant, whereas the warming effect of the CO2 produced by fossil fuel plants continues to accumulate year after year. The warming effect of the CO2 is a legacy that will continue for many centuries after the coal has run out and the ruins of the power plant are moldering away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you don‚Äôt actually have to wait a hundred years to see the benefit of switching to solar cells. The same arithmetic shows that even at the end of the very first year of operation, the CO2 emissions prevented by the solar array would have trapped 0.017 Watts per square meter if released into the atmosphere. So, at the end of the first year you already come out ahead &lt;em&gt;even if you neglect the waste heat that would have been emitted by burning fossil fuels instead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the bottom line here is that  the heat-trapping effect of CO2 is the 800-pound gorilla in climate change. In comparison, waste heat is a trivial contribution to global warming whether the waste heat comes from solar cells or from fossil fuels. Moreover, the &lt;em&gt;incremental&lt;/em&gt; waste heat from switching from coal to solar is an even more trivial number, even if you allow for some improvement in the efficiency of coal-fired power plants and ignore any possible improvements in the efficiency of solar cells.  So:  trivial,trivial trivial.  Simple, isn‚Äôt it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the issue of whether waste heat is an important factor in global warming is one of the questions most commonly asked by students who are first learning about energy budgets and climate change. So, there are no shortage of places where you can learn about this sort of thing.  For example, a simple Google search on the words ‚ÄúGlobal Warming Waste Heat‚Äù turns up several pages of accurate references explaining the issue in elementary terms for beginners. Including this article from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/WasteHeatWiki.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/WasteHeatWiki-300x261.png" alt="WasteHeatWiki" title="WasteHeatWiki" width="300" height="261"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more substantive (though in the end almost equally trivial) issue is the carbon emitted in the course of manufacturing solar cells, but that is not the matter at hand here. The point here is that &lt;em&gt;really simple arithmetic&lt;/em&gt;, which you could not be bothered to do, would have been enough to tell you that the claim that the blackness of solar cells makes solar energy pointless is complete and utter nonsense.  I don‚Äôt think you would have accepted such laziness and sloppiness in a term paper from one of your students, so why do you accept it from yourself?  What does the failure to do such basic thinking with numbers say about the extent to which anything you write can be trusted?  How do you think it reflects on the profession of economics when a member of that profession ‚Äî somebody who that profession seems to esteem highly ‚Äî publicly and noisily shows that he cannot be bothered to do simple arithmetic and elementary background reading?  Not even for a subject of such paramount importance as global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it‚Äôs not as if the ‚Äúblack solar cell‚Äù gaffe was the only bit of  academic malpractice in your book: among other things, the presentation of aerosol geoengineering as a harmless and cheap quick fix for global warming ignored a great deal of accessible and readily available material on the severe risks involved, as &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/10/why-levitt-and-dubner-like-geo-engineering-and-why-they-are-wrong/"&gt;Gavin noted&lt;/a&gt; in his recent post.  The fault here is not that you dared to advocate geoengineering as a solution.  There is a broad spectrum of opinion among scientists about the amount of aerosol geoengineering research that is justified, but very few scientists think of it as anything but a desperate last-ditch attempt, or at best a strategy to be used in extreme moderation as part of a basket of strategies dominated by emissions reductions. You owed it to your readers to present a fair picture of the consequences of geoengineering, but chose not to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May I suggest that if you should happen to need some friendly help  next time you take on the topic of climate change, or would like to have a chat about why aerosol geoengineering might not be a cure-all, or just need a critical but informed opponent to bounce ideas off of,   you don‚Äôt have to go very far. For example‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But given the way &lt;strong&gt;Superfreakonomics&lt;/strong&gt; mangled Ken Caldeira‚Äôs rather nuanced views on geoengineering, let‚Äôs keep it off the record, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no organized opposition to evolution until the 1920s, when it was marshalled by William Jennings Bryan, who was most concerned about the ethical implications of evolution. He made the point that the popular movie about the Scopes trial, &lt;i&gt;Inherit the Wind&lt;/i&gt;, was historically inaccurate. One of the most memorable moments in the movie was when Darrow pinned Bryan down on the date of the creation to 4004 BC‚Ä¶but Bryan had no such preconception. The primary strain of creationism at that time had absolutely no problem with the age of the Earth, and Bryan plainly stated in interviews and speeches that he was a proponent of the day-age theory, in which the &amp;quot;days&amp;quot; of creation week were not required to be 24-hour modern days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These early creationists had no bone to pick with geology at all, and were unperturbed at the thought that the world was hundreds of millions of years old. The two dominant explanations were the day-age theory, which stretched out the time-span of creation week to cover the whole of geological time, and gap theory, which argued that between the creation of the world mentioned at the beginning of Genesis, and the account of the 6 creation days, there was a long undocumented period of time in which geological history occurred. The latter model was also popular because it was presented in the Scofield Reference Bible, which specifically placed the geological column in a 'gap' in the account, and stated that the 6 days referred to the creation of Eden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dissenters from this position were a tiny minority, the Seventh Day Adventists, who were regarded as weird by the majority of fundamentalists. The Seventh Day Adventists credited a source of divine information other than the Bible, the prophecies and visions of their founder, Ellen White, who was the source of the idea that Genesis had to be describing a literal six 24-hour day creation occurring 6000 years ago. Her disciple, George MacReady Price, came up with the idea of wedging all of geology into the Noachian Flood. These were not popular ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mainstreaming of literalist creationism occurred in the 1960s, when John Whitcomb and Henry Morris wrote &lt;i&gt;The Genesis Flood&lt;/i&gt;. It's basically the same nonsense he Seventh Day Adventists were peddling, but Whitcomb and Morris were &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; SDAs, making it possible for conservative Christians, who regarded Seventh Day Adventism as a freaky cult, to coalesce in the formation of the Creation Research Society. These people had no ambition to convert the research community, but instead wanted to wean bible-believers away from what they considered the compromises of day-age and gap theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of this shift was that it opened up hard-core creationists to a kind of hyper-evolution: they had to explain how a small ark of fixed size could contain all the animals in the world, so they had to postulate a small number of created "kinds" that diversified into new species after the flood, at a pace evolutionary biologists consider absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980s, these new, literal creationists got ambitious and started trying to push into classrooms by legislation, efforts that got stymied by major court decisions in Arkansas and Louisiana, which ruled that mandatory teaching of creationism was unconstitutional. One consequence of the Arkansas decision was that, when the creationists had been anticipating victory, they had begun assembling a creationist textbook. When they lost instead, they had to rewrite to remove the word "creationism" and replace it with "intelligent design".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers talked a bit about Intelligent Design, and argued that it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; different from the previous version of creationism‚Ä¶but not in a good way, or in a milder way. The brainchild of Philip Johnson, Intelligent Design was far more radical than the previous iterations ‚Äî Johnson opposed methodological materialism, and specifically wants to incorporate god into science. While arguing that ID is something new, though, he also made it clear that it is not because ID is a secular theory ‚Äî it&amp;#39;s an extraordinarily &lt;i&gt;religious&lt;/i&gt; idea, backed by religious proponents, and funded by theocratic extremists like Howard Ahmanson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ended by giving us the discouraging news that 65.5% of Americans believe in creationism, and that the movement is expanding beyond US borders to the Islamic and Jewish world, too. Bummer, man. He could have at least offered some hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/ron_numbersanti-evolution_in_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-vWchrTe53A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256878832625"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/richard_lewontingenetic_determ.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d64982e84df9faba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Richard Lewontin‚ÄîGenetic Determination and Adaptation: Two Bad Metaphors</title><published>2009-10-30T05:10:59Z</published><updated>2009-10-30T05:10:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/XrQhvd9maJk/richard_lewontingenetic_determ.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/richard_lewontingenetic_determ.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a fine evening here in Chicago, with all these superstars of evolutionary biology in attendance. It was also an information-dense evening ‚Äî I tried to keep up on my little laptop, but I know I missed a lot. Fortunately, I&amp;#39;m not alone: &lt;a href="http://sciencelife.uchospitals.edu/2009/10/29/darwinchicago-09-thursday-night/"&gt;Rob Mitchum and Jeremy Manier were also covering the event&lt;/a&gt;, and have a play-by-play available. I'll just dump what I've got here tonight. I do have wi-fi passwords so I can get things up a little more promptly tomorrow and Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Lewontin opened up with a few deprecatory comments about the religiosity of our surroundings (the talks were given in a chapel) and our purpose, the reverence given to Saint Darwin. He was there to talk about the importance and danger of metaphors, and addressed two of them. The New Testament metaphor of genes make organisms, and the Old Testament metaphor that organisms adapt to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not true that genes make organisms. Organisms are consequence of interactions between inside and outside, genes and molecules, and the phenotype is not predictable from the genotype. He discussed the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/clausen_keck_hiesey.php"&gt;classic example of norms of reaction in &lt;i&gt;Achillea&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showing growth of clones in different environments. Cloned plants taken from cuttings ‚Äî so they&amp;#39;re genetically identical ‚Äî and grown in different environments show different patterns of growth, and, for instance, don&amp;#39;t show a simple relationship between morphology and the elevation at which they&amp;#39;re grown. Another example is bristle number in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; which show similar unpredictable pattern of response to temperature. Another thing to think about: look at the fingerprints on your left and right index fingers. They're not identical, but they have the same genes and formed in the same environment at the same time. Living organisms are the outcome of developmental and physiological processes influenced four factors: genes, non-genic molecules in the embryo, environment,  and random variation.
Biologists have known this for years but have fallen prey to the metaphor of genetic determinism. (He also mentioned another bad metaphor as an aside: the cell as a  machine.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other bad bad metaphor is the idea that organisms adapt to ecological niches. Organisms do not fit into preexisting niches. You can&amp;#39;t look at &amp;quot;niches&amp;quot; in the environment‚Ä¶there are an infinity of them. The organism determines the niche. A better idea is the concept of niche construction, in which niches change as organisms evolve. Organisms take whats available and integrate it with their biology, and the life activities of organisms determine what is relevant. When did living in water become the niche of the ancestral seal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisms seek out appropriate environments, the idea of microclimate. Put mesic (adapted to environments with a moderate amount of moisture) and xeric (dry or desert) flies in evironments with different zones of humidity, one surprising result is that the xeric flies move most quickly and determinedly to moist areas, more so than mesic flies. It&amp;#39;s not that dry-adapted flies can handle dryness better‚Ä¶it&amp;#39;s that they&amp;#39;re better at finding damp microenvironments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewontin gave several other examples of organisms that respond in sophisticated ways to confound simple interpretations of adaptation: that we all produce shells of altered microenvironments around us by our metabolic activity; that trees can count the number of days of a certain temperature to trigger flowering; that &lt;i&gt;Daphnia&lt;/i&gt; measure the rate of environmental change to determine whether to reproduce sexually or asexually; that organisms modulate the statistical properties of their environment by storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suggested that we need to set aside the bad metaphor of adaptation for a less bad metaphor of construction. Unfortunately, this creates a difficult situation for scientists interested in selection, because, for instance, frequency dependent selection means that the addition of new genotypes to the gene pool (which happens constantly) causes fitness to change in unpredictable ways. It's a game of rock-paper-scissors with a lot more than just three possibilities. He closed by saying that addressing this kind of problem should be the goal of the next generation of evolutionary biologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brisbane Zombie Walk organisers could face a police bill for future events, after up to 5,000 zombies lurched through the CBD on Sunday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zombie Santas, strippers, soldiers and nurses surged through the city on Sunday, forcing police to block off streets and direct traffic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Tuesday evening co-organiser Anthony Radaza posted on the Brisbane Zombie Walk Facebook page: We just received the official report from Queensland Police and they tallied over 5,000 participants. Hurray for Brisbane and Zombie lovers.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt; ‚Ä¶The official police statement says police will continue to work with organisers to plan and manage future zombie walks. ‚ÄúHaving due regard to potential crowd sizes and their impact upon public safety and amenity, police will negotiate with organisers as to the provision of policing resources considered necessary to support the event.

Sirtuins and companies like Sirtris are (unfairly or not) yesterday's news already - the big deals are done, and now it's down to the very unromantic grind of pushing an incrementally better drug for an age-related disease through the horror show that is FDA approval. Beyond sirtuins lie investigations of autophagy, of fat metabolism, and of course the heat shock proteins (HSPs), amongst other items. Looking ahead, I think there's a fair case to be made for the next Sirtris to be a company in the business of manipulating heat shock proteins, aiming to extend life and add healthy years - at least at the outset. Heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones, and their activities in the body are boosted by exercise and calorie restriction, two line items known to extend healthy life in laboratory animals and produce impressive health benefits in humans. Put simply: Molecular chaperones detect proteins that are misfolded, and have the ability to refold those proteins into the appropriate, non-toxic shape. Additionally, if the protein is so badly misfolded that it cannot be repaired, the molecular......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists ‚Äî and their institutions ‚Äî should resist the ever-present temptation to hype their results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[skipping to the money quote...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶the temptation for scientists and their institutions to spin their research to the media, or to go publicity-mongering, is always there. And ‚Äî as illustrated by the excessive public-relations campaign surrounding Ida, a fossil presented as a missing link in human evolution ‚Äî too many in the media will buy into the initial hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such behaviour is corrosive to the process of scholarly scientific communication. Research institutions must not allow it to become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I do suspect, however, that this is something deeply rooted in our culture; and maybe even in our DNA.  In fact, it probably springs from the very impulse that spawned Halloween in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People like fear.  We pretend not to, and we all express this in slightly different ways (I‚Äôm the kind of idiot that enjoys deadly storms), but we seem to have an odd fascination with the things that scare us.  Halloween, regardless of its mangled and now indistinct set of roots, has always been, on one level or another, about celebrating fear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halloween serves the secondary purpose of reminding children of the dangers ‚Äúout there‚Äù in order to keep them in line; the implication being that wandering off or not listening to one‚Äôs parents will result in something ‚Äúgetting them‚Äù.  In our culture, where most kids don‚Äôt believe in witches, ghosts, vampires, and evil spirits; at least not in such a way that they actually fear them, our Halloween mythology has evolved to include a new monster:  the child molester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new Bogeyman serves the dual purpose of giving parents something to worry about, which they appear to thrive on, and allowing them to scare their kids (whether or not this is their intention) with something real, even if the dangers are exaggerated and misunderstood.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I agree with Radford that energy and resources would be better spent on actual threats, and am as annoyed as anyone with all the fear mongering, I find it interesting to look at the aspects of human nature that contribute to this perennial phenomenon.  I hate to be cynical, but I‚Äôm not sure how much it can change.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256856796015"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/10/11th_nordic_bronze_age_symposi.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3a843feded98e929</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">11th Nordic Bronze Age Symposium, Day 1</title><published>2009-10-29T21:31:03Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T21:31:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/oiIzMU7bnQc/11th_nordic_bronze_age_symposi.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/10/11th_nordic_bronze_age_symposi.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Helsinki isn't far from Stockholm. It took me a bit more than four hours from home to my hotel here, and I could have shaved more than an hour off of that if I had taken the bullet train to the airport and a cab to the hotel instead of going by bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm at the &lt;a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/arkeologia/bronzeagesymposium2009/index.html"&gt;11th Nordic Bronze Age symposium&lt;/a&gt;, which for the first time includes a bunch of Baltic colleagues as wall. Everybody's very friendly and the atmosphere is informal. It's a pretty sizeable conference as these things go in my discipline: about 60 registered participants, of which I have made the acquaintance of at least half by now. For reasons unclear to me, I was made the afternoon's discussant, which was fun and flattering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm here to learn what Bronze Age scholars in my part of the world are doing right now, because I'm planning to become one of them. So far I've been able to understand everything reasonably well, though I lack basic skills of the trade for the period in question. Menace me with a Bronze Age sword, and I will generally not be able to place it in the right Montelian phase to save my life. (Unless you lend me the sword so I can look it up in the literature. It's safe, I'm a pacifist. Come on now, just hand it over.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the main themes touched upon in today's presentations:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building a new model of how Bronze Age society in Southern Scandinavia was organised.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Bronze Age research in Estonia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past and present interpretations of the Early Metal Age and Bronze Age in Finland.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does the Hajdusamson-Apa sword type occur both in Scandinavia and in Carpathia?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to find a northern border of the Nordic Bronze Age culture along the coast of Norway?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bronze Age in the Stockholm archipelago (Mattias &amp;amp; Roger reporting on their &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/10/burnt_mound_near_the_sea.php"&gt;on-going Orn√∂ dig&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent rock art surveys in S√∂dermanland province.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to radiocarbon date bronze?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bronze socketed axe found with a piece of the shaft inside, this has been dated, sadly the typological date didn't match the radiocarbon.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ethnic and social background of various find types in the Finnish Bronze Age.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Late Bronze Age seal-hunting centre in Ostrobotnia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They are labeled, unambiguously, A and B. A-class sources are breeders that produce animals for use in research.  B-class sources, also called "Random source," provide animals, usually adults, that are not bred, but just acquired somehow (more or less randomly?) and kept for a while, and sold to research facilities.  Random source dogs and cats are not bred by these dealers.  (These are USDA regulatory categories.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report produced by the National Academy of Sciences (National Research Council. &lt;em&gt;Scientific and Humane Issues in the Use of Random Source Dogs and Cats in Research&lt;/em&gt;, National Academies Press, 2009), there are not enough random-source dogs and cats to go around when it comes to medical research.  In addition, some of the dealers of these cats and dogs were found to be wanting in the degree to which they follow the law in properly treating the animals.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/dogs_and_cats_in_medical_resea.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/dogs_and_cats_in_medical_resea.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/noTQz2zAi-Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256854923523"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4456">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/648cefd190e33dde</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Education and Legal" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Ohio" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="freshwater" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Freshwater"/><category term="mtvernon" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Mt.

Does it look more angry or fearful? It may be rather difficult to tell: About fifty percent of adults say faces like this are angry and fifty percent say it's fearful. However, for children, the story is different. Researchers have found that small children aren't as good as adults at recognizing emotions in faces. Young children would see this picture as more fearful than angry. However, most research has suggested that kids are just about as good as adults by the time they're five years old.

But neuroscientists have consistently found that the portions of the brain responsible for processing key emotions, particularly anger and fear, continue to develop all the way through adolescence. If our brains are still changing, shouldn't we see some impact in the way kids and teens perceive emotions?

A team led by Laura Thomas felt that earlier studies of children's perception of emotion were flawed because the tests were too easy. Instead of viewing subtle emotional variations like the photo above, kids saw dramatic, obvious facial expressions -- even schematic diagrams of emotions. Could it be that what's developing as kids mature into teenagers and adults is their ability to detect subtle emotional variations?

Thomas's team showed 102 children, teens, and adults pictures of 10 different actors which had been previously rated as expressing anger, fear, or a neutral emotion. But instead of showing the most obvious emotional expressions, they used morphing software to show the viewers gradations of the emotions, like this:

The paper claimed that of the modern antidepressants, escitalopram (Lexapro) and sertraline (Zoloft) offer the best combination of effectiveness and mild side effects, and that sertraline has the advantage of being much cheaper.The Cipriani paper was a meta-analysis of trials comparing one drug against another. With a total of over 25,000 patients, it boasted an impressively large dataset, but I advised caution. Their method of crunching the numbers (indirect comparisons) was complex, and rested on a lot of assumptions.I wasn't the only skeptic. Cipriani et al has attracted plenty of comments in the medical literature, and they make for some fascinating reading. Indeed, they amount to crash-course in the controversies surrounding antidepressants today - a whole debate in microcosm. So here's the microcosm, in a nutshell:*In The Lancet, the original paper was accompanied by glowing praise by one Sagar Parikh: Free of any potential funding bias... Now, the clinician can identify the four best treatments... A new gold standard of reliable information has been compiled for patients to review.But critical comments swiftly appeared in the Lancet's letters pages. While not accusing Cipriani and colleagues themselves of bias or conflicts-of-interest, Tom Jefferson noted that way back in 2003, David Healy drew attention to:documents that a communications agency acting on behalf of the makers of sertraline were forced to make available by a US court. Among them was a register of completed sertraline studies awaiting to be assigned to authors. This practice (rent-a-key-opinion-leader) is of unknown prevalence but it undermines any attempt at reviewing the evidence in a meaningful way.This is what's known as medical ghostwriting, and it is indeed a scandal. However, by itself, ghostwriting doesn't distort evidence as such. It's what's published - or not published - that counts. Almost all antidepressant trials are run and funded by drug companies. All too often, they just don't publish data showing their products in an unfavourable light. The fearsome John Ioannidis - known for writing papers with titles like Why most published research findings are false - pulled no punches in reminding readers of this, in his letter:Among placebo controlled antidepressant trials registered with the US FDA, most negative results are unpublished or published as positive. Take sertraline, which Cipriani and colleagues recommend as the best ... of five FDA-registered trials, the only positive trial was published, one negative trial was published as positive, and three negative trials were unpublished. Head-to-head comparisons can suffer worse bias, since regulatory registration is uncommon. Meta-analysis of published plus industry-furnished data could spuriously suggest that the best drugs are those with the most shamelessly biased data ...Ioannidis also noted that Cipriani did not include placebo-controlled trials in their analysis. He helpfully provided a table showing that if you do include these trials, the ranking of antidepressants is very different:Of course, Ioannidis was not saying that the drug-vs-placebo data is better than the drug-vs-drug trials. After all, he had just declared it to be biased. But neither is it necessarily worse, and there's no good reason not to consider it.Cipriani et al's response to their critics was a little light on detail. In response to concerns of industrial publication bias, they said that:we contacted the original authors and pharmaceutical companies to obtain further data or to confirm reported figures.But of course the pharmaceutical companies were under no obligation to play ball. They could just have chosen not to reveal embarrassing data. Rather more reassuring is the fact that the original paper did look for correlations between the drug company running each trial, and the results of the trial; they didn't find any. Rather cheekily, Cipriani et al then went on to suggest that they were the ones who were sticking it to Big Pharma:The standard thinking has become that most antidepressants are of similar average efficacy and tolerability ... In some ways, this is a comfortable position for industry and its hired academic opinion leaders‚Äîit sets a low threshold for the introduction of new agents which can initially be marketed on the basis of small differences in specific adverse effects rather than on clear advantages in terms of overall average efficacy and acceptability.They certainly have a point here. If aspiring antidepressants had to be proven better than existing ones in order to be sold, instead of just as good, there would probably have been no new antidepressants since Prozac in 1990. (And Prozac is only "better" than the drugs available in 1960 in that it's safer and has fewer side effects; it's no more effective.) But this is not really relevant to whether the Cipriani analysis is valid. And in The Lancet letters, the authors did not address some of the criticisms, such as Ioannidis's point about including placebo-controlled trials, at all. They do point out that their raw data is available online for anyone to play around with.The debate continued in the pages of Evidence Based Mental Health. In 2008, Gerald Gartlehner and Bradley Gaynes conducted a rather similar meta-analysis, but they reached very different conclusions. They declared that all post-1990 antidepressants are equally effective (or ineffective).In their comments on the Cipriani paper, Gartlehner and Gaynes say that they were just more cautious in interpreting the results of a complex and problematic statistical process:Ranking sertraline and escitalopram higher than other drugs conveys a precisionand existence of clinically important differences that is not reflected in the body of evidence. ...for sertraline and escitalopram the range of probabilities actually extends from the first to the eighth rank for both efficacy and acceptability... the validity of results of indirect comparisons depends on various assumptions, some of which are unverifiable ... We simply took underlying uncertainties into greater consideration and interpreted findings more cautiously than Cipriani and colleagues.They also accuse Cipriani et al of various technical shortcomings - and in a meta-analysis, such 'technicalities' can often greatly the skew the results:they included studies with very different populations such as frail elderly, patients with accompanying anxiety and inpatients as well as outpatients ... the effect measure of choice was odds ratios rather than relative risks. Odds ratios have mathematical advantages that statisticians value. Practitioners, however, frequently overestimate their clinical importance...Cipriani et al respond to some of these technical criti...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The whole idea seemed ludicrous for many reasons (I called it &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/worst-paper-of-the-year/"&gt;‚Äúthe worst paper of the year&lt;/a&gt;‚Äú), but of course ultimately Williamson‚Äôs view needed a formal appraisal in the scientific literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/10/22/0910229106"&gt;a new paper in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Michael W. Hart and Richard K. Grosberg give this appraisal and conclude that, on the basis of data that already exist, Williamson‚Äôs idea is full of it.  Among their criticisms are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Contrary to Williamson‚Äôs prediction, the genomes of Lepidoptera are generally &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt; than those of other orders of insects that lack the larval stage, and are certainly not the large size you‚Äôd expect if modern butterflies resulted from hybridization between a purely flying ancestor and a wormy onycophoran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Similarly, contrary to Williamson‚Äôs predictions, the genomes of onycophorans are not smaller than those of Lepidoptera or of other ‚Äúholometabolous‚Äù insects that undergo a striking transformation between larval and adult stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  Contrary to Williamson‚Äôs prediction, DNA sequencing shows NO close relationship between any lepidopteran genes and any genes in onycophorans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is other evidence as well, but the above is sufficient to completely refute Williamson‚Äôs claims.  I stand by my characterization of his paper as the worst of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;em&gt;Scientific American‚Äôs&lt;/em&gt; report on the Hart and Grosberg paper &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=controversial-caterpillar-evolution-2009-10-29"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that takes care of that.  The remaining issue is how did this execrable piece of work get published in the first place? The communicating editor was Lynn Margulis, who is a huge booster of evolutionary processes that involve hybridization, undoubtedly because of her pathbreaking work showing that mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells used to be bacteria.  She even wrote a book suggesting that hybridization may be the key to understanding the origin of species.  (She‚Äôs wrong except for allopolyploidy in plants.)  Handling this paper, Margulis appeared to violate  journal policy by asking reviewer after reviewer to look at it until she got the positive reviews needed to assure publication.  But, as &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=controversial-caterpillar-evolution-2009-10-29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, when Williamson‚Äôs paper was published, Margulis told &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; that she needed ‚Äú6 or 7‚Ä≥ peer reviews to secure the ‚Äú2 or 3‚Ä≥ positive responses needed to present the work for publication. That statement set off &lt;a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/10/01/pnas"&gt;a cascade&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/10/pnas_will_publish_controversia.html"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56035/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;‚Äôs two-tiered submission process&lt;/a&gt; and, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091009/full/news.2009.985.html"&gt;according to &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091009/full/news.2009.985.html"&gt;Nature News&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; led the journal‚Äôs editor in chief to write to Margulis demanding ‚Äúa satisfactory explanation for [her] apparent selective communication of reviews.‚Äù Her reply, obtained by &lt;em&gt;Nature News,&lt;/em&gt; explained that three researchers had declined for scheduling reasons or lack of expertise, and two were omitted from the official &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; submission because they lacked formal credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um. . . ‚Äúlacked formal credentials‚Äù??  Why, then, were these reviewers asked in the first place?  Shame on &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; for publishing Williamson‚Äôs paper; it was a complete waste of journal space and required several scientists who are busy with other things to sit down and refute it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn‚Äôt the journal have scientifically-literate people (beyond the editor of each paper) who monitor their submissions for quality?&lt;/p&gt;

Why? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week Dublin-based clairvoyant Joe Coleman predicted Our Lady would appear at the old parish church ‚Äì scene of the 1879 apparition ‚Äì at 3pm. Quite a number of those present were members of the Travelling community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people want to believe in something then that is their right, but &lt;a href="http://www.evaldon.com/christian/uph8.htm"&gt;doesn‚Äôt the Bible say a lot of things about divination and looking to the sky for signs&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, still, fine. But what we had here was several thousand people &lt;em&gt;staring at the Sun&lt;/em&gt;. That‚Äôs a bad idea: it can cause temporary blindness, and permanent damage to the retina (though I know of no cases of both permanent and total blindness). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course it can cause you to see things. The retina floods with light and gets saturated, making you see afterimages with illusions of color, movement, and other weird things. And this is just what the pilgrims to Knock reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Tunney, from Islandeady, Castlebar, said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 53 years old and I never seen the sun go like that before. I witnessed the sun go all different colours, yellow, red and green. Then it completely darkened and began shimmering. Sometimes the sun emitted a clean, bright light, then it would darken again.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Tunney‚Äôs wife, Nina, said: ‚ÄúThe sun was spinning in the sky. I experienced a feeling of total happiness. It is a feeling I would love to experience again. It was amazing. I felt marvellous.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yvonne Rabbitte, from Dunmore, Co Galway, showed other pilgrims a photograph she had taken on her digital camera which showed vivid rays radiating downwards from the sun at the time the image was taken&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two anecdotes sure sound to me a lot like illusions that happen when staring at a very bright object. And that last story is telling; that kind of thing will always happen when you take pictures of the Sun! I have lots of pictures with rays coming from the Sun that I have taken on days when a clairvoyant has &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; predicted the apparition of a religious icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have said here many times, people have the right to believe in what they want. However, I think they should at least try to educate themselves on the way the Universe works so they don‚Äôt leap to the wrong conclusions (as Richard Feymann once said, science is a way of not fooling ourselves)‚Äì and certainly the journalists out there have an &lt;strong&gt;obligation&lt;/strong&gt; to do a little research when reporting on such events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a case where I think people came to the wrong conclusion. I don‚Äôt know if the clairvoyant really believes what he says or if, like so many others, he‚Äôs got a somewhat different agenda. But either way the result is a self-fulfilling prophecy: people went outside hoping to see visions, and that‚Äôs just what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip o‚Äô the sunglasses to Padraig Cleary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

2)  Get married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was just &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/07/congrats-becca-and-sid/"&gt;Rebecca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; who got married at James Randi‚Äôs convention, but behind the scenes, &lt;strong&gt;Kate&lt;/strong&gt; was also working her magic.  &lt;/p&gt;

‚Ä¶ Remember how I went to TAM7 awhile back? Well, I roomed with this guy, right? I know some of you were suspicious at the time that something might have been going on behind your backs, but look. At the time we were just friends. I swear. Nothing more. Yeah, but then, you see ‚Ä¶ then we hooked up a little after that and now we‚Äôre married. Hey, no, listen. Listen! There‚Äôs good news and you won‚Äôt very well hear it while you‚Äôre yammering on about fidelity and trust issues, will you? Okay, fine. I‚Äôll let you vent, then. I‚Äôm sure this is a very difficult time for you‚Ä¶

&lt;p&gt;That is *so* unfair.  I‚Äôve been to 3294823 conferences.  Never once have I come back with a spouse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never again.  Next time, I‚Äôm bringing home a haremfull of spouses and a quiverfull of babies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôve been warned.&lt;br&gt;

Apparently C. sphinx females are pretty flexible -- they lick their mate&amp;#39;s penis during copulation, which evidently induces him to stay in longer (see the graph below, with drawing). The authors offer a handful of non-mutually-exclusive hypotheses for the adaptive benefit of the behavior, ranging from lubrication to increased fertilization efficiency. The full text is available for free at PLoS ONE, if you&amp;#39;re up for some hot-and-heavy behavioral observations.

After much argument the anti-linkage people more or less conceded that there were some good reasons to link ID to a somewhat generic definition of creationism (relying on special creation), but still protested loudly about how inappropriate it was to make the linkage, because most people (allegedly) would assume that creationism = young-earth creationism, and linking ID to young-earth creationism was oh-so-wildly unfair.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it‚Äôs now a week later, and, what do you know, but right there on the &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/the-scientific-impossibility-of-evolution/" rel="external "&gt;latest blogpost on William Dembski‚Äôs Uncommon Descent&lt;/a&gt; is a big fat advertisement for a straight-up young-earth creationist conference.  &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/" rel="external "&gt;And who is endorsing the conference?&lt;/a&gt;  Dean Kenyon, Discovery Institute fellow, coauthor of &lt;em&gt;Of Pandas and People&lt;/em&gt;, and one of the most-cited inspirational figures in the whole ID movement, who is mentioned dozens of times in Stephen Meyer‚Äôs new book &lt;em&gt;Signature in the Cell&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/Archives/2009-press-scientific_conference_evolution.htm" rel="external "&gt;Here he is, endorsing young-earth garbage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to US biophysicist Dr. Dean Kenyon, ‚ÄúBiological macroevolution collapses without the twin pillars of the  geological time-scale and the fossil record as currently interpreted. Few scientists would contest this statement. This is why the upcoming conference concentrates on geology and paleontology. Recent research in these two disciplines adds powerful support to the already formidable case against teaching Darwinian macroevolution as if it were proven fact.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶proving that, yep, he‚Äôs still YEC, as has been his consistent position since at least 1980, even though this was widely doubted over on the Thinking Christian blog, and even though Stephen Meyer and all other ID advocates systematically obscure this fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who is the one confusing ID and YEC?  Not me.  They do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

When someone commenting on our discussion said that her office had gotten sick but she hadn't, I said that it was likely either luck or the effects of herd immunity.  My colleague then said this to me in an exchange after saying that she, &lt;i&gt;"didn't buy that herd immunity had been proven"&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;...if herd immunity is so effective, then how is it that so many viruses are seeing a revival when so many others have been immunized against it? Wouldn't the theory for herd immunity say that since so many are vaccinated that the people who haven't been would become immune by exposure to those who have been?&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is a real problem when debating.  People on the science side just assume that basic ideas like herd immunity are understood when they're not.  To clarify, here is a good analogy I came up with to explain it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's say you're a female basketball player.  You drive the lane and go up for a jump-shot, but are bumped by another player.  Your bra strap breaks.  What do you do?  The coach calls a time out and you go to the bench with the rest of the team.  You explain the situation to the coach, but you can't exactly whip off your shirt right there on the sidelines, exposing yourself to the glares of the creepy sports-fans in the bleachers, so what, then?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your teammates to the rescue!  The other women make a tight circle around you and, in the centre, you are free to take your jersey off to safety pin the strap or just put on a new bra.  No worries about exposing yourself to the crowd's stares, you're protected by the other members of the team who are shielding you.  They're not worried because they're wearing jerseys and the weirdos can't see anything bawdy on them, so life's good.  When the danger of exposure passes, the circle disperses and the previously vulnerable player is safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, so replace "creepy stares" with virus, and "jersey" with "vaccine" and you should get it.  I realize that the analogy falls apart slightly because if you have a severe allergy and cannot get vaccinated, you never get a "jersey", but that's a minor point when explaining the concept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right then, off you go.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

Do not view if you don't want your day ruined. You need not view it to understand the accompanying article.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posted below is a video of a "witch" burning in the Kisii district of western Kenya, in a village called Nyamatoro. It is a two-minute excerpt from a 45-minute piece of footage, apparently shot by a Kenyan freelance journalist named Johnny. If you like, you may visit Johnny's webpage &lt;a href="http://www.inewsit.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, though it won't provide any fresh insight into the horrors captured by his camera. In his brief discussion of the video, Johnny's language is studiedly neutral. This is understandable. As you shall see, Johnny has temperamental neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;On his website, Johnny writes mostly about his wish to receive journalistic commissions from news agencies abroad. That, too, is understandable. Any man who witnesses five acquaintances beaten and burned to death by sixty or so of his other acquaintances has every right to a little wanderlust, at the very least.</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Brandon K.

As a sophomore, the path from my house to campus took me past the Presbyterian Seminary that stood near the university. Every morning, as¬†I went¬†by, I could smell¬†whatever they were cooking in the seminary dining hall, and being a poor college kid with limited cooking skills, I wondered how I could get in on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, one day, I smelled¬†chicken frying, and I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. So I walked to their admissions office and asked if I could¬†get a meal plan there. And they said, ‚ÄúYes‚Äù!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for a little over a year, I ate breakfast and¬†dinner everyday with the seminary students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I became friendly with most of them, despite the fact that I didn‚Äôt share their views on religion, but I didn‚Äôt really hang out with them beyond the dinner table.¬†Well,¬†on Halloween, a couple of the guys came up to me at dinner, and said I had to come to their Halloween party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this was Austin on Halloween! Did I want to spend it with a bunch of Presbyterian seminary students? No. I didn‚Äôt really want to, but to be polite, I agreed to stop by and make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oh their god!! I‚Äôm glad I did! The party was off the hook!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a jack o‚Äô lantern,¬†at the entrance, they had a fire burning inside a real longhorn‚Äôs skull that sat atop¬†a man‚Äôs body¬†that was holding a bloody butcher knife in each hand. Inside, the girls were scantily dressed, and they had ice chests full of booze and kegs worth of beer. The music rocked, and they played these drinking games where articles of clothing came off and all sorts of other fun stuff took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a complete surprise to me. But I suppose the fact that these people were about to turn their lives over to the lord motivated them, and¬†it was one of the funnest Halloween parties I‚Äôve ever attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you ever been similarly surprised? Who have you encountered that‚Äôs¬†gone against your expectations? What, in your view, makes the best party?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the larger scheme of things the dispute is practically meaningless, at best a very distant second to the actual climate issues on the table.

To that end, the best news I've heard recently is that Congress will next week hold its first-ever hearing on geoengineering solutions to global warming. I'm grateful to Ken Caldeira for alerting us to this hearing; he will be among the climate scientists to testify.</summary><author><name>By Stephen J.

I've added a few links of my own for those of you who might not be familiar with the issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APS has announced its support for the National Academy of Sciences report &lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12641"&gt;Scientific and Humane Issues in the Use of Random Source Dogs and Cats in Research.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
The NAS report acknowledged the importance of random source dogs and cats in certain NIH funded research but noted problems with recurrent Animal Welfare Act violations by certain &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_animal_sources"&gt;Class B dealers&lt;/a&gt; who supply many of these animals for biomedical research. Consequently, the NAS report recommended that NIH-funded researchers no longer purchase animals from these dealers. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
The report expressed some concern about whether there are adequate alternatives to Class B dealers. In its conclusions and recommendations section, it stated: "However, the Committee found that it is not necessary to obtain random source dogs and cats for NIH research from Class B dealers, provided that alternative sources of animals with similar characteristics can continue to be assured" (Scientific and Humane Issues, page 6). It then went on to recommend that NIH explore and support alternative supply mechanisms to ensure the continued availability of dogs and cats with random source characteristics. (Scientific and Humane Issues, page 90).&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
In endorsing this report, the APS notes the need for action to ensure that new suppliers are identified to replace Class B dealers so that there will be no disruption not only to NIH-funded research, but also to other medical and veterinary research and training activities that rely upon random source dogs and cats. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
The APS Position Statement on Random Source Dogs and Cats in Medical Research can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org/pa/resources/policyStmnts/paPolicyStmnts_dogscats.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The APS announcement can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org/press/releases/09/44.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice work, APS!&lt;br&gt;

Brown&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://evilpossum.weebly.com/olmsted.html"&gt;This is a PUBLIC DOMAIN document&lt;/a&gt; (dated 10/17/09).¬† It may be copied, forwarded, cited, circulated or posted elsewhere.¬† The author requests only that it not be altered from its current form. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Dan Olmsted‚Äôs ‚Äúbig break‚Äù for coverage of the vaccine-caused autism coverage was a series of stories about two claims: that the Amish do not vaccinate, and that they do not have autism. He wrote at least six articles on this subject between March and October 2005.¬† To this day, he continues to defend his work.¬† Yet,¬† his critics have long since demonstrated 3 facts: The Amish vaccinate; they do have children with autism, and Olmsted would have known these facts if he had actually conducted a serious investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;A major argument by Olmsted is an interview wth Dr. Frank C. Noonan, said (apparently in his own words) to have treated ‚Äúthousands and thousands‚Äù of the Amish population of Lancaster county.¬† This provided a major recurring sound bite: ‚Äú`You‚Äôll find all the other stuff, but we don‚Äôt find the autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;We‚Äôre right in the heart of Amish country and seeing none, and that‚Äôs just the way it is.‚Äô‚Äù¬† However,¬† by Olmsted‚Äôs admission, Noonan is openly a practitioner of ‚Äúalternative medicine‚Äù, which makes him potentially biased.¬† Nor is he the only source with this problem. Dick Warner, a salesman Olmsted was mocked for quoting in the June 2 article ‚ÄúA Glimpse of the Amish‚Äù, sold¬† ‚Äúnatural health‚Äù products as well as water filters. Dr. Lawrence Leichtman, reportedly instrumental in guiding Olmsted to six Amish children with autism, was featured in the April 2005 issue of Alternative Medicine. Heng Wang, another prominently cited source, may also have ‚Äúalternative health‚Äù ties:¬† The site of his DDC clinic lists nutrition and special diets as among its services, without going into details.¬† (The site reports that the clinic was founded on the initiative of mothers who, for unspecified reasons were unsatisfied with services at Holmes Morton‚Äôs Clinic for Special Children.)¬† This preponderance of ‚Äúalternative health‚Äù sources raises questions not only about the objectivity of the article, but also the extent of Olmstead‚Äôs personal research.¬† This is a good point to note a comment by Kevin A. Strauss to Autism NewsBeat: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he spent much time in Lancaster County.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;But, complaining about bias will not help address Olmsted‚Äôs claims.¬† With regards to Noonan‚Äôs quote, I am convinced that it is in one way or another, spurious. For one thing, the listed location of his practice is a single suite, an improbably small space for treating ‚Äúthousands‚Äù Amish or otherwise.¬† For another, Noonan‚Äôs practice is not particularly accessible to the Amish.¬† Ephrata has a well-documented Mennonite community, but I can find no reference to a directly adjacent Amish population, unless one counts the Peaceful Valley Amish Furniture store. By all indications, the Amish population is concentrated south and east, closer to Strasburg and Lancaster itself (both filming locations for Witness).¬†¬† Thus, it is very unlikely that Noonan ever had more than occasional contact with the Amish in a professional capacity, except possibly with a small subset of the Amish who are either relatively geographically isolated from the rest, or who prefer his practice over larger facilities closer at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;In any event, Olmsted‚Äôs claims quickly collapsed in the eyes of science and his peers.¬† Olmsted himself admitted that the Amish have some autistics and that at least some vaccinate.¬† Even his strikingly qualified claims were disproved virtually as soon as others investigated.¬† In March 2006, Drs. Kevin Strauss, Holmes Morton¬† and others documented 9 autistic Amish children, which¬† could raise the autism rate of the Lancaster Amish community Olmsted supposedly investigated to almost¬† 1/5,000 all by themselves.¬†¬† In December 2006, a study found that 84% of Amish parents reported vaccinating their children. As criticism spread to Olmstead‚Äôs journalist peers, his honesty was directly challenged. In 2007, the &lt;em&gt;Columbia Journalism Review &lt;/em&gt;concluded¬† ‚Äúthat Olmsted has made up his mind on the question and is reporting the facts that support his conclusions.‚Äù¬† In the unkindest cut of all, UPI has apparently deleted Olmsted‚Äôs articles from its website, as specific links for Olmsted‚Äôs articles only lead to the UPI front page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Throughout this fiasco, Olmsted‚Äôs responses have amounted to revisions and rationalizations at best, and at worst complete denial.¬† When he first reported finding some autistic Amish (April 18), he tried to blame it on vaccinations among a minority of the Amish.¬† When he acknowledged autism in a number of unvaccinated children, he blamed ‚Äúelevated levels of mercury‚Äù. And when on-line critics began systematic demolition, he responded with ad hominem attacks on critics, including a reference to Kathleen Seidel as ‚Äútoxic‚Äù. At last report, he was if anything even more defensively strident. On April 4, 2009, he made an AoA post in which he continued to defend his core claims. He repeated his belief in ‚Äúthe virtual absence of autism among the Amish‚Äù, based on an undoubted underestimate of the autism rate as 1/10,000 , and said that only ‚Äúhalf‚Äù of Amish are vaccinated. He blamed is failure to consult the Clinic for Special Children on the clinic staff, claiming they ‚Äúrefused to speak with me over a period of many months‚Äù¬† Then he said this: ‚Äú(T)hat doctor said, oh yes, they do see Amish kids with autism ‚Äî but then went on to say those were ONLY kids with other identifiable genetic disorders‚Ä¶ He specifically said they DO NOT¬† see `idiopathic autism,‚Äô a basically nonsense phrase that he used to mean autism without any other accompanying disorders. In other words, they don‚Äôt see the kind of autism now running at a rate of 1 in 100 or so in the rest of the country. ‚Äú&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;With this remarkable bit of ‚Äúnewspeak‚Äù, Olmsted does exactly what Prometheus¬† speculated happened in the original articles: ‚ÄúMr. Olmsted found autistic children, but didn‚Äôt count them ‚Äì either because he either didn‚Äôt feel that they had real autism or because it conflicted with his forgone conclusion.‚Äù His specific argument is obviously worthless:¬† Defining ‚Äúreal‚Äù autism by the absence of ‚Äúaccompanying disorders‚Äù is absolutely indefensible, especially for the Amish, who are all at an elevated risk of genetic defects. Furthermore, if autism were redefined in this matter, many if not most of the diagnoses behind the 1/100 figure would have to be thrown out. In a culminating irony, Olmsted himself openly refers to ‚Äúidiopathic autism‚Äù as a ‚Äúnonsense phrase‚Äù.¬† So, why is he using this to define who is or is not autistic. By all appearances, it is because he would rather endorse ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù than retract his long-since indefensible conclusion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;In short, Olmstead‚Äôs ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù of autism has been fraudulent from the start.¬† At best (and I think most likely), he uncritically interviewed a handful of prejudiced informants, and misrepresented it in the national media as his own, comprehensive investigation of Lancaster County.¬† At worst, he conducted research more than sufficient to show that autism occurred among the Amish at a high rate and independent of vaccination, but knowingly misrepresented, omitted or refused to pursue the relevant facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His reaction was, ‚ÄúDo you realize your name is now associated with &lt;em&gt;atheism&lt;/em&gt;?!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family knows about this website and my activism, but they don‚Äôt read it and we rarely talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt imagine trying to keep everything I do a secret from them, though, because it takes up so much of my life outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeremy&lt;/strong&gt; runs a blog called &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com"&gt;Le Caf√© Witteveen&lt;/a&gt; and has kept his atheism relatively under wraps from his family.  Some of them know about his lack of religious beliefs, but they certainly don‚Äôt talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that‚Äôs probably going to change.  Jeremy just found out that &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com/2009/10/28/the-yeshua-fog-conundrum/"&gt;family members have been lurking on his site&lt;/a&gt; for months now, reading it without his knowledge, aware of his beliefs without him ever having come out to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe that‚Äôs a good thing.  He‚Äôs out now.  He can be completely open and honest when talking about faith without needing to hide it from anyone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
‚Ä¶ So the conundrum is how to keep this a place of expressing, without self editing, how I view the world and keep the idea in tact that I ‚Äúlove the sinner and hate the sin‚Äù per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loathe ‚Äúhate sin love sinner‚Äù It‚Äôs a ruthless lie in church vernacular. The main sins this statement addresses are sexual sins, namely homosexuality. You never hear someone say, ‚ÄúHate the lies love the liar‚Äù or ‚Äúhate the work done on sabbath but love the worker‚Äù. It‚Äôs hands-down the most insincere level of dishonest judgement that a person of any background can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I make this statement pertain to me. Do I say, ‚ÄúI love the religious person but hate the religion they follow‚Äù? Because that‚Äôs intolerant and haughty (but it‚Äôs a certainly true feeling, eek).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there really no way to pursue the topics I might like to pursue without making people feel ehrm ‚Ä¶ poopy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll find a way to do it respectfully.  You can criticize their beliefs even without directly criticizing them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com/2009/10/26/the-whole-goddamn-shebang/"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; about his &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com/2009/10/28/the-yeshua-fog-conundrum/"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; will encourage other hidden or anonymous bloggers to come out to their loved ones.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the full segment, they talk about Brian‚Äôs book &lt;em&gt;Why E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which was excellent. I‚Äôll try to write a review of it as soon as I can. In the meantime, I do have to praise Colbert for his insight; as Brian points out he was correct in his ideas! I was cheering along with the segment. It still cracks me up that the smartest and most insightful commentary on TV is not from any of the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; news stations, but from satirical shows like &lt;em&gt;Colbert&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt;. They have better science coverage than CNN, MSNBC and anyone else combined.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256838808220"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/295c22fa556efb21</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">John Moore Sizes Up Somers</title><published>2009-10-29T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/754-john-moore-sizes-up-somers.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="border:3px ridge #000000;margin:3px;float:right" alt="suzanne-somers" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/swift/suzanne-somers.jpg" height="133" width="150"&gt;Suzanne Somers has been making a lot of noise lately about how conventional cancer treatment is a sham propped up by greedy practitioners, and the real cures are being hushed because there's no profit in them.&lt;/p&gt;

Then you should feast your eyes on this exquisite picture of the cluster of stars known as the Jewel Box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/screen/heic0913a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/hst_jewelbox.jpg" alt="hst_jewelbox" title="hst_jewelbox" width="610" height="301"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click to encaret].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gee, I can‚Äôt imagine why‚Äôd they name it the Jewel Box! In fact, this is a large cluster of stars located in the southern constellation of Crux, also called the Southern Cross. It‚Äôs bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye, in fact (though when I was in the Galapagos last year, Crux didn‚Äôt get high enough off the horizon to see the cluster very well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image, &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0913.html"&gt;taken by the Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, shows the multicolored stars dwelling in the cluster. But not for long, I‚Äôll add. Those bluish stars are O and B-type supergiants, massive stars that scream through their nuclear fuel thousands of times faster than the Sun, meaning their lives are far shorter. The red beacon there at the upper right is a red supergiant, a star right on the edge of disaster (literally, since the word means &amp;quot;bad or ill star&amp;quot;). It won‚Äôt be long, maybe a few million more years, when all the bright stars in the Jewel Box will go supernova, detonating in titanic explosions each of which, from the Earth, will outshine Venus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/screen/heic0913b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/vlt_jewelbox.jpg" alt="vlt_jewelbox" title="vlt_jewelbox" width="250" height="251"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The image is one of three from three different telescopes, taken to examine the core of the cluster (with Hubble) as well as the outer regions. &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0913b.html"&gt;The picture on the left&lt;/a&gt; is from the Very Large Telescope in Chile, and shows a larger area around the cluster (the bright red star is the same as in the Hubble picture). Incredibly, due to the huge telescope‚Äôs light-gathering abilities, this picture is actually only a 5.2 second exposure! It‚Äôs composed of three images: one in blue (2.6 seconds), one in yellow (1.3 s) and one in red (1.3 s). When you use a telescope with a mirror &lt;em&gt;8 frakkin‚Äô meters across&lt;/em&gt;, bright stars don‚Äôt take long to show up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers aren‚Äôt sure if the Sun was born in a cluster like the Jewel Box, or if it was formed in a smaller cloud by itself; both types of birth occur in the galaxy. I know it‚Äôs not scientific, but a part of me rather hopes that once upon a time, a few billion years ago, the Sun did in fact see its first light inside such a cluster. Imagine the sky, festooned with stars so bright they outshine the Moon, easily luminous enough to read by, and each glowing blue, red, yellow‚Ä¶ that would have been a fantastic sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people think that science takes away the romance and wonder of the Universe, but I don‚Äôt think &lt;em&gt;not knowing&lt;/em&gt; is romantic, especially when &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; gives us such lovely vistas to explore.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256837107985"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_17.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9672a97257517459</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SO'09"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline'09 - interview with Daniel Brown</title><published>2009-10-29T16:24:26Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T16:24:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/CbDtJiEFrTc/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_17.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_17.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;The series of interviews&lt;/a&gt; with some of the participants of the 2008 Science Blogging Conference was quite popular, so I decided to do the same thing again this year, posting interviews with some of the people who attended &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline'09&lt;/a&gt; back in January. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Daniel Brown from the &lt;a href="http://biochemicalsoul.com" title=""&gt;Biochemical Soul&lt;/a&gt; blog to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Me_lab_small.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Me_lab_small.jpg" width="362" height="336" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My name is Daniel Brown, and I am a biologoholic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up as a rat-tail-sporting, barefoot redneck running around the pine forests of Northeastern Texas (specifically in a tiny town called Hooks). My daily pre-teen life apart from school pretty much consisted of me looking for critters alone in the woods - often trekking great distances (for a little kid anyway) through forests and over farmlands, skirting diamondback rattlers, copperheads, and other rednecks. Times were different then, eh? One of my most vivid memories from my childhood was when I came upon a flooded area of "my woods" a week or two after a big storm. The entire forest floor was covered in a couple of inches of water, which was itself filled with gloopy, slimy bunches of frog eggs. Each gelatinous mass was about the size of a softball, and I distinctly remember just sitting their feeling the goo between my fingers as tiny tadpole tails swirled within each isolated egg. I was completely mesmerized. I'm almost certain that I was born a biologist - but that moment in the forest of frog embryos in particular pretty much sealed the deal for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew out of my redneckdom not long after, though I certainly retained my country boy attitude. Since those days in the Texas woods my biological interests have varied widely. I spent time in my undergrad training (at an amazing liberal arts college called "Hendrix College" in Arkansas) working in the field of ecology, radio-tracking timber rattlesnakes in the Ozark Mountains. In a slightly more sophisticated echo of my days playing with frog eggs, I moved to the University of North Carolina where I worked for many years trying to figure out how genes tell a growing frog embryo how to make a heart (my Ph.D. work). After getting my doctorate, I stayed in the field of developmental biology and spent a few years studying brain development in mice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now gone one step deeper into the realm of biology, moving into the field so cool it gets its own nickname: "evodevo." For the non-scientists out there, that's "evolutionary developmental biology." More on this below...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also a graphic artist (mostly digital these days) making both 2D still-lifes and 3D animations, and I'm an avid fossil collector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I was recently asked this exact same question by another blogger (&lt;a href="http://www.thereeftank.com/" title=""&gt;The Reef Tank&lt;/a&gt; - not posted yet), so some of my above answer is a bit of self-plagiarism. Sue me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not ever want to grow up. That is, I hope to remain the 8-year-old boy trapped in a man's body that I am until the day I die. That being said, in a fantastical world in which I have become that which I'd most like to be, I would become a full-time biologist/geologist/professor/fossilhunter/novelist/artist/animator/photographer/blogger/sculptor/whittler/musician/gamer. The cruel voice of Real Life has informed me, however, that I am not nearly talented enough to pull off this dream profession. Thus, my more realistic aspiration is to continue what I've been doing, which is to be a scientist/professor during the day and after I'm done with the day-time money-making,  pick a hobby in the evening, go at it full steam for 1 to 6 months until one of the others beckon more loudly, and then switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="asterina.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/asterina.jpg" width="303" height="403" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Two months ago, I began a new position as a post-doctoral researcher in the lab of &lt;a href="http://www.cmu.edu/bio/hinmanlab/lab/home.html" title=""&gt;Dr. Veronica Hinman&lt;/a&gt; in the Department of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University in &lt;strike&gt;the Arctic tundra&lt;/strike&gt; Pittsburgh. In my current work, I study not only how genes control an organism's development, but also how the genetic programs that control development (Gene Regulatory Networks) evolve at the molecular level (e.g. mutational changes in cis-regulatory elements). And not only do I get to work on such a fascinating subject, but I get to do so using those wacky, brainless creatures called "echinoderms" (e.g. starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am by far most interested in using the web, regardless of the specific medium, to disseminate and educate the general public on the awesomeness of nature and what we can learn about it through science. It sounds cheesy - but it's something we all know is sorely lacking in America today. It's sad when "the awesomeness of nature" seems like a laughable phrase. I find myself constantly dismayed by the lack of general fascination with the natural world among children and high school students. From my experience so far, my blogging has attracted a good number of students - but most of them arrive at my site because of some specific research they were doing. I definitely consider it a success if students end up coming to me to learn about specific topics. However, I (like most people/businesses on the web) would most like to discover ways to reach out and pull in people that would otherwise not seek out scientific knowledge. Which ties in with the next question...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that blogging (and following blogs) figures prominently in my own thinking about my work. But beyond that I have yet to find (or rather, create) specific ties to my actual research. This is mostly because I only recently began my new research and have yet to blog about it (in fact I've been on quite a blogging hiatus since the summer because of the sheer magnitude of new information and techniques to learn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I consider teaching and outreach to be an integral part of who I am and of my actual work. So in that sense, blogging has been the centerpiece of my attempts to reach out to the public and throw a little science at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Twitter a lot for a good while - both for discovery of interesting things and promotion of my own - but eventually I found the deluge of interesting information too overwhelming and time-consuming. More importantly for me, I found that my own tweets tended to be drowned out as well, with very few people discovering my posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've now found that I've had by far the most success in reaching the general public through Facebook. My posts would generally be read by a core group of my own friends (most of which are not scientists), some of which would then repost, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Real Life has pretty much removed my ability to utilize fully any of the social networks for good science fascination dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through most of graduate school performing actual science while completely oblivious to the existence of science blogs or the science blogging community. I'm not quite sure how that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day I somehow stumbled across (who do you think?) PZ at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" title=""&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly I was like, "Oh! This exists! I should do this!" Trust me - the exclamation marks were all there. I started blogging near-instantly. I had been putting together dumb little sites with my own rants and thoughts since about 1998, none of which was ever really seen by anyone. The discovery of science blogging really allowed me to find a central way to focus my thoughts and my intentions. By far my favorite blogs are &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" title=""&gt;the one you're reading&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://southernfriedscience.com/" title=""&gt;Southern Fried Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/" title=""&gt;Deep-Sea News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://theoystersgarter.com/" title=""&gt;The Oyster's Garter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cephalopodcast.com/" title=""&gt;Cephalopodcast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://coralnotesfromthefield.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Malaria, Bedbugs, Sea Lice, and Sunsets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.echinoblog.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;The Echinoblog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://observationsofanerd.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Observations of a Nerd&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://ohfortheloveofscience.com/" title=""&gt;Oh, For the Love of Science!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course perfectly leads into the next question, because...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...I've left a bit of the story out. You see, after I discovered science blogs and started blogging, it was only a few months later that I discovered this thing called ScienceOnline09 - and it was being held only 1 mile from my workplace (the NIEHS). It was there that I met the squid-hatted Andrew, crab-hatted Kevin, and merry-making Miriam (and of course Bora!) of four of the aforementioned blogs. Merely meeting all the science bloggers present made me realize "Wow - there's even more to this thing than I thought. My blog is crap. I gotta fix that. I need to become more of a part of this community." Reading their blogs over the coming months also aroused my interest in marine biology and at least set me on the path to my current research in echinoderm evodevo. Thus, the contingent nature of life, much like that of evolutionary history, means that my attendance at ScienceOnline09 had a direct causative influence on me sitting in this lab right now surrounded by tubes of starfish DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't read everyone else's interviews, but I can only assume that many have said the same thing - Miss Baker's biology class and how she used blogging and the internet inside and outside the classroom completely opened my eyes to the possibilities of the Web as a teaching tool. I have no doubt that I will be using some sort of blogging/network medium as a supplement to my future courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again soon.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the not-too-distant past elephants and their closest relatives occupied Africa, Europe, Asia, North America, Central America, and South America, but almost all of them had perished by about 10,000 years ago.* Of these recently-extinct forms the most iconic was the woolly mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius, which was covered in long coats of shaggy hair. They were cold-weather mammoths, inhabiting chillier regions than their North American cousin the Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi), and during the Pleistocene they ranged over much of the northern hemisphere.

*[There were some remnant populations here and there until about 4,000 years ago, but most species of recent fossil elephants were either gone or greatly reduced in number by this time. They disappeared along with many other large mammals such as giant ground sloths. The cause of this Pleistocene mass extinction is still being hotly debated.]

In a new paper published in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology scientists Diego Alvarez-Lao, Ralf-Dietrich Kahlke, Nuria Garcia, and Dick Mol have extended the range of the woolly mammoth through the description of a 30,000-40,000 year old site in southern Spain. This Pleistocene fossil site, just south of the city of Granada, represents the southernmost extent of the woolly mammoths' reach in Europe. The site itself is not new. It had been excavated during the 1980's, but unfortunately much of the recovered material was either lost or scattered through museum collections. New material has continued to come out of the site since that time, however, and this has allowed the scientists to confirm the existence of its woolly Pleistocene inhabitants.

The offending sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúHorton, you‚Äôre one of the few people New York seems to agree with,‚Äù Tennessee Williams, another regional Young Turk who dreamed of changing the shape of commercial theatre, said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John explains that he knows "there is a longstanding journalistic resistance to inverting subject and verb in attribution" and understands why some writers might be averse to the construction, but objects to a blanket prohibition against this inversion (known in the syntax trade as "quotative inversion"), especially when it leads to tin-eared sentences like one reporting the Tennessee Williams quotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that here at Language Log Plaza we've been alert to the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;'s anti-quotative inversion quirk from the earliest days of the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here's the history, with some digression to other blogging on the syntax of quotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Potts was in first, with a 9/22/03 posting "A ban on quotative inversion?" (&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000017.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and a follow-up the next day, "More on the quotative inversion conjecture" (&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000019.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Then on 10/6/03 Mark Liberman chimed in (&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000028.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) with a comparison of the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;'s awkward verb-last sentences to the verb-last sentences of German that Mark Twain complained about in his comic essay "The Awful German Language". And the next year (12/19/04, in "Diagram this",¬†&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001734.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) Geoff Pullum added a more complex example from the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;. So ended the Early Years of quotative inversion in these parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skip ahead to this year, and a 1/5/09 posting on my blog (&lt;a href="http://arnoldzwicky.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/x-y-said-and-vp/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) about a report from Neal Whitman (on ADS-L) about Bill Walsh's proscribing quotative fronting (without inversion) in combination with subject omission in a following conjunct, in things like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving,‚Äù Jones said, and walked out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neal Whitman joined in (on his blog, &lt;a href="http://literalminded.wordpress.com/2009/01/14/more-on-coordination-quotative-inversion-and-beverly-cleary/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) with the reason for his query to ADS-L. He had noted that in her children&amp;#39;s books, Beverly Cleary was a very heavy (indeed near-categorical) user of the non-repeated subject, as in (1). Neal found the usage unremarkable ‚Äî until he came across Walsh&amp;#39;s proscription, which he found puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A digression: in her 1990 &lt;em&gt;Muggie Maggie&lt;/em&gt; Cleary repeated the subject in these coordinations, but then seems to have reverted to her non-repetition ways in later books. The &lt;em&gt;Muggie Maggie&lt;/em&gt; episode was probably the work of an editor who had been exposed to the "rule" Walsh cites.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following up on this, I posted on my own blog (&lt;a href="http://arnoldzwicky.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/on-the-beverly-cleary-trail/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://arnoldzwicky.wordpress.com/2009/02/01/a-little-more-on-quotative-inversion/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) on quotation fronting and quotative inversion, with links to the 2003-04 postings on Language Log about "awkward sentences that would have been much improved by quotative inversion", despite the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;'s aversion to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings us up to John McIntyre.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256835574992"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=10193">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/569b72c6dce55a7c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Meta Stuff"/><category term="malaysia airlines"/><category term="sucks"/><title type="html">I‚Äôm Back!

&lt;p&gt;I have returned from my tour of Southeast Asia, during which time I had many adventures but still missed you all terribly. I‚Äôm glad to see the site is still running smoothly thanks to the talent and hard work of my fellow ‚Äòchicks. Thanks, ladies and Sam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll get back into the skeptical blogging soon enough, but first I wanted to get this one thing off my chest and onto the Internet: Malaysia Airlines is the worst piece of shit company I‚Äôve ever encountered. I‚Äôm not even exaggerating. They were not just unprofessional‚Äìthe Malaysia Airlines staff at the Kuala Lumpur airport customer service desk actually went out of their way to be as obnoxious, apathetic, and blisteringly stupid as possible. This has nothing to do with skepticism, so many of you may just want to skip this. The rest, read on and enjoy my pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (abbreviated) story is this: my friend and I were traveling from Phuket to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur with a three-hour layover. Once in Singapore, we had three and seven hours before our flights back to our respective homes in London and New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Malaysia Airlines‚Äô plane had some mechanical trouble, possibly because it‚Äôs a piece of shit they found in a junkyard somewhere, we got to Kuala Lumpur late‚Äì15 minutes before our connecting flight was scheduled to leave. Despite the fact that the employees repeatedly promised us that the plane would be held for us, we were rebuffed and laughed at by the security guards and gate agents once we ran the kilometer to get there while the plane was still at the gate. This began two hours of hellish torture during which the Malaysia Airlines customer service team stared at us blankly, lied to us repeatedly, and refused to either put us on another airline‚Äôs flight to Singapore (as they had no others that night)¬† or help us get any closer to home on their own planes. At one point I suggested that they just put me on a flight to London that they had leaving that night. They wandered off, stared into the middle distance for awhile, checked their cell phone messages, and eventually said no. ‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù I asked. They considered the question awhile, then said it was too late. I asked again and the answer changed: the ticket was ‚Äúthe wrong kind.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then suggested they change my Qatar Airways ticket to leave from that airport that night instead of from Singapore, which would still allow me to make my connection in Qatar. They talked on the phone awhile with Qatar, stared a bit, wandered away, came back, checked their cell phone messages, and finally said no. ‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù I asked. This confused them. More staring and wandering, before the answer came: ‚ÄúThe fees to change the ticket are too high.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù ‚ÄúOver 1,000 dollars.‚Äù ‚ÄúReally. So pay it.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs your fault I‚Äôm missing the flight.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo pay it.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I demanded that they call Qatar Airways and hand me the phone. The representative said, ‚ÄúYes there is a fee, but Malaysia Airways should pay it.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut they won‚Äôt.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre assholes.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow much is the fee, exactly?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is 1,350 ringgit.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúRinggit.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYes.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúRinggit, not US or Singapore dollars.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYes.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs $400.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYes.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end the pain, I paid the fee and ran to catch the flight, where I was pampered with delicious food and free alcoholic beverages and competent staff. Thank you, Qatar Airways. Fuck you, Malaysia Airways. As I tweeted soon after the incident, I hope everyone at the Malaysia Airways customer service desk in Kuala Lumpur gets rabies. That is all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The rest of the trip was lovely, thanks.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256834459794"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=20709">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5ba133389e772e63</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="SuperFreakonomics GW Controversy"/><title type="html">Steve Levitt on The Daily Show</title><published>2009-10-29T15:45:58Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T15:45:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/ctiiNktRDhY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/steve-levitt-on-the-daily-show/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">He wondered if he was in for a Jim Cramer-type beatdown.

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe hate crime shows how important it truly is to ‚Äòkeep religion out of government‚Äô ‚Äî to keep homophobic dogma and blasphemy laws off of our civil statutes.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a disgusting crime and it occurs just a week after &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/21/reactions-to-atheist-billboards/"&gt;another billboard was defaced&lt;/a&gt; in Idaho. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, if you don‚Äôt like the message, you can get your own billboard and put up a counter-message.  No one is stopping you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there‚Äôs no need to take down perfectly reasonable messages.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep religion out of politics?  People can be good without god?  Those are slogans even Christians ought to be agreeing with.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hemant Mehta</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://friendlyatheist.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://friendlyatheist.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Friendly Atheist</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256832849881"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/orlando_thomas_is_not_dead.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ffb9eb84da80ee68</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Orlando Thomas is NOT Dead</title><published>2009-10-29T15:59:40Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T15:59:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/WHCnPxSfitc/orlando_thomas_is_not_dead.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/orlando_thomas_is_not_dead.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night, during Teh Game, we were told that Viking Orlando Thomas had died, succumbing to his battle with Lou Gehrig's disease.

Or of writing as if. Those bats are having sex because they're horny, and the fellatio is somehow making their sex more satisfying. That might or might not enhance reproduction. But that is not on the little bats' minds when they're busy getting it on."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frog: "The bats aren't making direct computations of relative reproductive success -- they're 'feeling good', and very often 'feeling good' is made better by making someone else 'feel good' (not assuming that the bats can actually model their partners mind like that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans have sex for reproductive purposes -- I would bet we're the only ones who are that insane. Everyone else just does what they like to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is like saying that animal X eats to keep their metabolism going -- only a few crazy people do that. Everyone eats because they like eating."&lt;p&gt;And of course. Animals take great pleasure from sex because it is adaptive to feel that pleasure. None of them is smart enough to understand that babies follow. And that obviates the entire discussion of what sexual behaviour counts as "natural" in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only rule we need to follow is "consenting adults". (With the addition, of course, that if a person consents to having grievous bodily harm done to them, then this is a symptom of mental illness and places a responsibility of care, not exploitation, upon people around. But then someone who would feel inclined to exploit such a situation sexually is of course also nuts.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I'll mention a few of the people who are traveling from afar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fabiana Kubke&lt;/b&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/sms/staffct/staff_details.aspx?staffID=6D6B7562303033" title=""&gt;professor of anatomy&lt;/a&gt; at University of Auckland (yes, birds brains! I hope we find some time to talk shop while she is here). Yes, that is Aucklans in New Zealand! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr.Kubke blogs on &lt;a href="http://buildingblogsofscience.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Building Blogs of Science&lt;/a&gt; which is also cross-posted on &lt;a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/building-blogs-of-science/" title=""&gt;her SciBlogs blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conference, Fabiana will do a demo of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/" title=""&gt;The  Science Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/" title=""&gt;SciBlogs&lt;/a&gt; - the first science blogging network in New Zealand (if I understand correctly, they even call each other SciBlings!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also follow her &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Kubke" title=""&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jelka Crnobrnja-Isailovic&lt;/b&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jelka-crnobrnja-isailovic/4/b33/37b" title=""&gt;a professor of&lt;/a&gt; Biology in the Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics at University of Nis, Serbia and a professor in the Department of Evolutionary Biology at the Institute for Biological Research "Sinisa Stankovic" in Belgrade, Serbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Program/" title=""&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;, Dr.Crnobrnja-Isailovic will co-moderate the session "Open Access and Science Career Hurdles in the Developing world".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pawel Szczesny&lt;/b&gt; teaches at the University of Warsaw &amp;amp; Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS in Poland - a job that he got, among else, due who his online activity, after an experiment in freelance science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conference, he will co-moderate a session on "The Importance of Meatspace: Science Motels, science freelancing and science coworking" and tell us about his new project along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pawel can be found on his blog - &lt;a href="http://freelancingscience.com/" title=""&gt;Freelancing science&lt;/a&gt; and of course on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/freesci" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://mchabib.com/about/" title=""&gt;Michael Habib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; will travel from The Netherlands, he is not a stranger to this area, as he is a UNC graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael works at Elsevier, developing &lt;a href="http://info.scopus.com/" title=""&gt;SCOPUS&lt;/a&gt; and will participate in a session on "Online Reference Managers".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can, of course, also be found on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/habib" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enrico Balli&lt;/b&gt; is returning to the conference for the second time. He comes from Trieste, Italy where he works at &lt;a href="http://medialab.sissa.it/index_en.htm" title=""&gt;SISSA MediaLab&lt;/a&gt;, a project of the &lt;a href="http://www.sissa.it/main/?p=A1" title=""&gt;International School for Advanced Studies of Trieste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog? Sure - &lt;a href="http://www.oggiscienza.it/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And Twitter &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/eballi" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

This one is not a PLoS ONE Collection, but a PLoS-wide one, spanning six of the seven journals in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Collection &lt;a href="http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browseIssue.action?issueURI=infoAdoiF10.1371Fissue.pcol.c01.i01" title=""&gt;Genomics of Emerging Infectious Disease&lt;/a&gt;, was compiled by Jonathan A. Eisen (who you probably know from his &lt;a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;excellent blog&lt;/a&gt;), the Academic Editor-in-Chief at PLoS Biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan, together with PLoS Biology Senior Editor Catriona J. MacCallum, wrote the &lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000224" title=""&gt;introductory editorial&lt;/a&gt; explaining what the Collection is about and I particularly like the comparison to the world of birding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When an American robin (Turdus migratorius) showed up in London a few years ago, birders were rapidly all atwitter and many came flocking to town [22]. Why had this one bird created such a stir? For one main reason--it was out of place. This species is normally found in North America and only very rarely shows up on the other side of the "pond." Amazingly, this rapid, collective response is not that unusual in the world of birding. When a bird is out of place, people notice quickly.

&lt;p&gt;This story of the errant robin gets to the heart of the subject of this collection because being out of place in a metaphorical way is what defines an emerging infectious disease. Sometimes we have never seen anything quite like the organism or the disease before (e.g., SARS, Legionella). Or perhaps, as with many opportunistic pathogens, we have seen the organism before but it was not previously known to cause disease. In other cases, such as with as pandemic H1N1 2009 or E. coli O157:H7, we have seen the organism cause disease before but a new form is causing far more trouble. And of course organisms can be literally out of place, by showing up in a location not expected (e.g., consider the anthrax letters [2]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, despite the metaphorical similarities with the robin case, the response to emerging infectious disease is almost always much slower. Clearly, there are many reasons for these differences, which we believe are instructive to consider. At least four factors are required for birders' rapid responses to the arrival of a vagrant bird: (1) knowledge of the natural "fauna" in a particular place, (2) recognition that a specific bird may be out of place, (3) positive identification of the possibly out-of-place bird, and (4) examination of the "normal" place for relatives of the identified bird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are these requirements achieved? Mostly through the existence of high-quality field guides that allow one to place an organism such as a bird into the context of what is known about its relatives. This placement in turn is possible because of two key components of field guides. First, such guides contain information about the biological diversity of a group of organisms. This usually includes features such as a taxonomically organized list of species with details for each species on biogeography (distribution patterns across space and time, niche preferences, relative abundance), biological properties (e.g., behavior, size, shape, etc.), and genetic variation within the species (e.g., presence of subspecies). Second, a good field guide provides information on how to identify particular types (e.g., species) of those organisms. With such information, and with a network of interested observers, an out-of-place bird can be detected with relative ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In much the same way, a field guide to microbes would be valuable in the study of emerging infectious diseases. The articles in this collection describe what can be considered the beginnings of species-specific field guides for the microbial agents of emerging diseases. If we want to truly gain the benefits that can come from good field guides it will be necessary to expand current efforts to include more organisms, more systematic biogeographical sampling, and more epidemiological and clinical data. But the current efforts are a great start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/490" title=""&gt;the PLoS blog&lt;/a&gt;, Catriona J. MacCallum explains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The collection is a collaborative effort that combines financial support from Google.org with the editorial independence and rigor of PLoS and the expert opinion of leading researchers from several different disciplines. You can read more about Google.org's involvement in a blog post from Frank Rijsberman. In one of the articles (from PLoS Biology), Gupta et al. discuss Google.org's vision as a funding agency for how the international community might unite to best take advantage of the new technology for combating infectious disease. The challenges are large and each article ends with a section summarizing what these are and how they might be overcome.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also download and listen to &lt;a href="http://www.ploscollections.org/downloads/emerginginfectiousdisease.mp3" title=""&gt;the podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the Collection, in which Dr.Kirsten Sanford interviews Jonathan Eisen and two of the authors of Collection artices Siv Andersson, and Raj Gupta (both Dr.Eisen and Dr.Sanford will also attend ScienceOnline2010, for those of you interested in the event).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-10/plos-wgh102609.php" title=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; (also &lt;a href="http://www.sciencecodex.com/will_genomics_help_prevent_the_next_pandemic" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) also contains all the relevant links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Emerging infectious diseases are caused by a wide range of organisms, but they are perhaps best typified by zoonotic viral diseases, which cross from animal to human hosts and can have a devastating impact on human health. These zoonotic diseases include monkeypox, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), in addition to influenza A and the lentiviruses (HIV) that cause AIDS. As Albert Osterhaus and colleagues from the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, point out in their article in the collection, the apparent increased transmission of pathogens from animals to humans over recent decades can be attributed to the unintended consequences of globalization as well as environmental factors and changes in agricultural practices.

&lt;p&gt;Articles in the collection also shine a spotlight on specific pathogens, some familiar and widespread, such as the influenza A virus, some "reemerging," such as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex that causes tuberculosis, and some identified only relatively recently, such as the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which is associated with peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Others discuss the broader implications of genomics research in this area, such as what it means for researchers in developing countries or for our biosecurity. As Jacques Ravel and colleagues from the US University of Maryland School of Medicine note, genomics can and should be used proactively to build our preparedness for and responsiveness to biological threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href="http://blog.google.org/2009/10/will-genomics-help-prevent-next.html" title=""&gt;official Google blog&lt;/a&gt; Frank Rijsberman writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first outbreak of the new "swine flu" strain, now known as H1N1, earlier this year in Mexico caught the world by surprise. Public health officials around the world tried to stop the virus at the borders but were largely helpless. Shortly after, on the other side of the world from Mexico, I saw the health check posts in Cambodia at the airport and at a borderpost with Vietnam, right when the country found its first H1N1 cases which were flown in by US exchange students. The weapons used by the health officials to combat the spread of the virus were primarily paper survey forms and thermometers; the virus won, very quickly. Genomics is rapidly changing both the way diseases are diagnosed and the way medications and vaccines are developed - but will it give us the tools to prevent the next pandemic?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browseIssue.action?issueURI=infoAdoiF10.1371Fissue.pcol.c01.i01" title=""&gt;Genomics of Emerging Infectious Disease&lt;/a&gt; Collection today and read all the exciting articles in it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/genomics_of_emerging_infectiou.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/TLKyXDAFGi0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256828741341"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_take_a_loo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a030c4435d134a26</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SO'10"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline2010 - take a look at the Schedule</title><published>2009-10-29T13:51:37Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T13:51:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Ww8OIPNqy6g/scienceonline2010_-_take_a_loo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_take_a_loo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scienceonline2010logoMedium.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Program is now finalized - the schedule of rooms and times can be found &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Program/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. What an incredible line-up of moderators/presenters and intriguing topics!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you think that making the schedule was easy....it took a couple of hours of moving the index cards around until I got the Best Possible Schedule in place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="scio10indexcards.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10indexcards.jpg" width="336" height="448" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, a little blurry, I know - taken by iPhone. But yes, each Index card had the title of a session and names of moderators on it. And I used several different criteria to try to make the least conflicting schedule. I hope it works....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_take_a_loo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Ww8OIPNqy6g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256828189869"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=10185">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eac9ec711d35febe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Favorites"/><category term="Guest Bloggers"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Skepchick Presents: A Conversation with Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson (Part 6)</title><published>2009-10-29T14:00:16Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T14:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/skepchick-presents-a-conversation-with-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson-part-6/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following video is Parts¬†6 of my conversation with Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson.

&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a title="Journal of Medical Hypotheses" href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/623059/description#description"&gt; Journal of Medical Hypotheses&lt;/a&gt; has a lot to answer for, being the source of speculative media stories that make great headlines but lack scientific substance.  The clue is in the title ‚Äì these are just untested ideas, albeit backed up by logical deductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the generation of unhelpful ‚Äì and downright scare-mongering ‚Äì headlines (‚Äú&lt;a title="Daily Mail - Can dogs give you breast cancer?" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-490581/Can-dogs-breast-cancer-Bizarre-medical-theories-experts-claim-actually-true.html"&gt;ZOMG! Dogs give you cancer!!!&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù), JMH is a wellspring of amusement for the scientifically minded. So it's not surprising that Roger Dobson has cobbled together a selection of around a hundred of the oddest ideas to grace its pages, in the form of ‚Äú&lt;a title="Amazon - Death can be cured" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Death-Can-Be-Cured-Hypotheses/dp/1905736312/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1256403850&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Death Can Be Cured&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointingly, the book doesn't do justice to the material, and it feels like a wasted opportunity to explore some of the outer fringes of scientific thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a series of short pieces - each a page or two long  - briefly reviewing a JMH paper and grouped together under broad titles (for example, ‚ÄúSex, blondes and noises in the night‚Äù or ‚ÄúChins, beer bellies and earwax‚Äù). This structure is the major flaw in the book. Dobson has gone for quantity over quality, and the stories just feel like dry, uncritical reporting of the papers, lacking in depth and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, each vignette depersonalises the researchers, not mentioning them by name and providing little background. Who are these people? Are they established in the field, or are they on the fringes? Is it just one crazy guy in a garage? And too much is made of the word ‚Äúresearch‚Äù - many of the papers sound more concrete and evidence-based than they are.  Let us not forget that these are hypotheses, rather than the reported results of experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also too much repetition. For example, in the chapter entitled ‚ÄúIt's the sun (and moon) wot done it‚Äù, several of the stories mention sunspots, and explain what they are. And there's quite a lot of repetition in the sex and hormone-related bits. The book is obviously designed as toilet reading - something you can dip into at any point for a quick science hit, but I can't help thinking that it would have been more interesting to focus a bit more on fewer ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, making each chapter a longer exploration of a single subject (the proposed properties of sunspots, the design of the human body,  the brain, cancer, our animal friends...) with more background and scene-setting, pulling in related JMH papers, exploring the evidence to support them ‚Äì and the scientists proposing them - and discussing how they fit (or not) with established theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And given that JMH does occasionally hit the headlines with some of the more outre ideas, it would also have been nice to see a bit of discussion of any media coverage, and comment from other scientists and organisations. Working for a cancer charity, we're often asked to comment on papers, including those published in JMH. Widespread publicity of unproven scientific ideas isn't always helpful, and I worry that the headlines may confuse the public. After all, science is science, right? And if a scientist says it could be true, then it is, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great book about science, scientific thought and the development, acceptance or rejection of fringe theories lurking in the pages of JMH. Sadly, ‚ÄúDeath Can Be Cured‚Äù isn't it.  Although it's a diverting sciencey read on the loo, it just left me wanting much more.&lt;/p&gt;

It's one of those gas range/electric oven dealies, with a smaller second oven where the broiler drawer usually is (the main oven is used for broiling).  The control panel stopped working, but the gas burners would still light (not just spew gas, they would light without a match, which takes electricity) and the lower oven -- which is controlled by a dial rather than the digital control panel -- worked fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A little bit of googling told me it was most likely what I already suspected: The electronics in the control panel were shot.  It is supposedly not too difficult of a DIY job to replace it, but based on comparable parts I found online, it looked like the part itself would cost about $150.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I opened up the stove and googled for what I thought was the part number, but to no avail.  So we called GE.  They wanted to send somebody out, but of course it's $80 just to even have them &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; at it.  We got an 800 number from GE where we could most likely order the part, but it was already past 5:00 so we had to wait until the next day.  In abject discouragement, I put the panel back together, screwed it back in, plugged in the stove, and turned the breaker back on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But wait, rewind -- I am a computer engineer by education, and while I am more of a software engineer by trade, I still do a lot of low-level work, sometimes on custom hardware.  When I had the thing open, you better believe there's one thing I was certainly going to do: Check for loose or bent wires, look for obvious defects on the circuit board, and, most importantly, jiggle all of the connectors.  I can't tell you how many $10,000 systems I have seen rendered unusable because of nothing but a loose cable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lo and behold, when I turned everything back on, it works fine.

Sometimes, we point our most powerful telescopes at the sky, peering as deeply as we possibly can, hoping to shed some light on what the Universe was like oh-so-long ago, as close to the big bang as we can.  The Hubble Space Telescope can get us distant galaxies as they were just a few billion years after the big bang.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/setting_the_cosmic_distance_re/hudf.jpg" width="500" title="Some of the most distant galaxies ever discovered are in this image." alt="hudf.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hubble still has never seen one of the elusive, Holy Grails of astronomy: &lt;i&gt;a metal-free star&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, immediately after the big bang, the Universe was filled with protons and neutrons, which finally fuse together (when the Universe cools enough) to create hydrogen, helium, and lithium nuclei.  A few hundred thousand years later, the Universe cools enough to turn these nuclei into stable, neutral atoms.  But that's it: beyond those three elements, there's nothing heavier.  The Universe can't make them, not until the first stars form.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And someday, that's what we'd love to find: a &lt;i&gt;metal-free star&lt;/i&gt;.  These first stars, without any traces of heavier elements, are responsible for exploding and enriching (or polluting, depending on your perspective) the surrounding space with elements much heavier than lithium.  Well, we just determined that a Gamma-Ray Burst earlier this year shattered the distance record:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/setting_the_cosmic_distance_re/grb090423.jpg" width="500" title="Image credit: Gemini North Telescope" alt="grb090423.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a redshift of &lt;b&gt;eight&lt;/b&gt;, it's the most distant object ever discovered.  This was light emitted around 13 billion years ago, when the Universe was &lt;b&gt;less than one billion years old&lt;/b&gt;.  And yet, looking at the spectrum of this one, &lt;i&gt;it's still full of heavy elements!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/setting_the_cosmic_distance_re/supnovform.jpg" width="500" title="All stars work, roughly, like this." alt="supnovform.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you form stars, anywhere, you make many, many little, low-mass stars, like red dwarfs.  But you make a few very high-mass stars, called O-type or B-type stars.  These stars are &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt;.  Compared to a G-type star like our Sun, there's simply no contest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/setting_the_cosmic_distance_re/morgan-keenan_spectral_classification.png" width="500" title="O stars can be hundreds of times as massive as our Sun!" alt="morgan-keenan_spectral_classification.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Huge!&lt;/b&gt;  Well, there's a big problem with being huge.  What is it?  Let's ask Bladerunner:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The light that burns twice as bright burns for half as long - and you have burned so very, very brightly, Roy. Look at you: you're the Prodigal Son; you're quite a prize! &lt;i&gt;--Dr. Tyrell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bladerunner got the scaling wrong: the &lt;i&gt;star&lt;/i&gt; that burns with twice as much mass lives only &lt;b&gt;one-eighth as long&lt;/b&gt;!  So if a star like our Sun lives for 10 billion years, a star 10 times as massive lives for only 10 million years, and one 100 times as massive lives for just 10,000 years!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that's why this gamma-ray burst we've found, despite being only an estimated 630 million years into the birth of the Universe, is still chock-full of these heavier elements.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, instead of a redshift of eight, we'd have to get all the way out to a redshift of &lt;b&gt;around forty&lt;/b&gt; before we expect to start seeing a metal-free star.  And the continued observation of this Gamma-Ray Burst confirms that, despite occurring 95% of the Universe's lifetime ago, the Universe was very, very similar then to the way it is now.  The same stars, the same stuff, the same explosions as the ones we see now.  There's never been a more distant, more comforting observation than this, that tells us pretty much exactly what we expected.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/setting_the_cosmic_distance_re/337655main_GRB090423_Swift.jpg" width="500" height="500" title="The reddish blob in the middle is the Gamma-Ray Burst." alt="337655main_GRB090423_Swift.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamma-Ray Bursts come from stars that die in very certain ways, and this one, from 13 billion years ago, is just like the ones that happened recently -- and close -- to us.  By finding very few differences, one amazing piece of the picture comes into view: the Universe looked a lot like it does now &lt;i&gt;a very short time after the big bang&lt;/i&gt;.  That we can see things when the Universe was only 5% of its current age is like me looking back on my life and remembering everything that happened when I was 18 months old.  Only, &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; wasn't able to do all the things I can do now back then.  But the Universe can, and did, and now we've seen the first pieces of evidence for that!  So thank you to that massive star that died all those billions of years ago.  It's shown us that the Universe grows up very, very quickly! &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/setting_the_cosmic_distance_re.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256827243312"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.8056/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/61850071bf837612</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Obama Trumpets Energy Grants</title><published>2009-10-29T14:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T14:59:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.8056/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;ARCADIA, Fla. -- The Obama administration launched a clean-energy blitz Tuesday, with President Barack Obama sweeping into this Central Florida hamlet to unveil $3.4 billion in stimulus grants for advanced electricity-grid projects and Vice President Joe Biden traveling to his home state of Delaware to open an electric-automobile plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx</id><title type="html">Science In The News Daily</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256827243311"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.8055/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b3c7f55b0221176c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Celebrating 40 Years of the Net</title><published>2009-10-29T14:57:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T14:57:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.8055/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has often been said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

I'm more familiar with a different just-so story intended to explain the same alleged generalization: infants' phonetic abilities are initially limited, and this creates pressure to develop variants of words for caregivers (and other things infants are likely to want to name) that suit their preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know of any non-anecdotal studies of the generalization, much less of the relative strength of parental egoism and infant incapacity in explaining it; and I don't have time this morning to search.

&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a title="Journal of Medical Hypotheses" href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/623059/description#description"&gt; Journal of Medical Hypotheses&lt;/a&gt; has a lot to answer for, being the source of speculative media stories that make great headlines but lack scientific substance.  The clue is in the title ‚Äì these are just untested ideas, albeit backed up by logical deductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the generation of unhelpful ‚Äì and downright scare-mongering ‚Äì headlines (‚Äú&lt;a title="Daily Mail - Can dogs give you breast cancer?" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-490581/Can-dogs-breast-cancer-Bizarre-medical-theories-experts-claim-actually-true.html"&gt;ZOMG! Dogs give you cancer!!!&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù), JMH is a wellspring of amusement for the scientifically minded. So it's not surprising that Roger Dobson has cobbled together a selection of around a hundred of the oddest ideas to grace its pages, in the form of ‚Äú&lt;a title="Amazon - Death can be cured" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Death-Can-Be-Cured-Hypotheses/dp/1905736312/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1256403850&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Death Can Be Cured&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointingly, the book doesn't do justice to the material, and it feels like a wasted opportunity to explore some of the outer fringes of scientific thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a series of short pieces - each a page or two long  - briefly reviewing a JMH paper and grouped together under broad titles (for example, ‚ÄúSex, blondes and noises in the night‚Äù or ‚ÄúChins, beer bellies and earwax‚Äù). This structure is the major flaw in the book. Dobson has gone for quantity over quality, and the stories just feel like dry, uncritical reporting of the papers, lacking in depth and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, each vignette depersonalises the researchers, not mentioning them by name and providing little background. Who are these people? Are they established in the field, or are they on the fringes? Is it just one crazy guy in a garage? And too much is made of the word ‚Äúresearch‚Äù - many of the papers sound more concrete and evidence-based than they are.  Let us not forget that these are hypotheses, rather than the reported results of experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also too much repetition. For example, in the chapter entitled ‚ÄúIt's the sun (and moon) wot done it‚Äù, several of the stories mention sunspots, and explain what they are. And there's quite a lot of repetition in the sex and hormone-related bits. The book is obviously designed as toilet reading - something you can dip into at any point for a quick science hit, but I can't help thinking that it would have been more interesting to focus a bit more on fewer ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, making each chapter a longer exploration of a single subject (the proposed properties of sunspots, the design of the human body,  the brain, cancer, our animal friends...) with more background and scene-setting, pulling in related JMH papers, exploring the evidence to support them ‚Äì and the scientists proposing them - and discussing how they fit (or not) with established theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And given that JMH does occasionally hit the headlines with some of the more outre ideas, it would also have been nice to see a bit of discussion of any media coverage, and comment from other scientists and organisations. Working for a cancer charity, we're often asked to comment on papers, including those published in JMH. Widespread publicity of unproven scientific ideas isn't always helpful, and I worry that the headlines may confuse the public. After all, science is science, right? And if a scientist says it could be true, then it is, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great book about science, scientific thought and the development, acceptance or rejection of fringe theories lurking in the pages of JMH. Sadly, ‚ÄúDeath Can Be Cured‚Äù isn't it.  Although it's a diverting sciencey read on the loo, it just left me wanting much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have no desire to do this. I want to &lt;strong&gt;be&lt;/strong&gt; in space, but I don‚Äôt want to have to &lt;strong&gt;go&lt;/strong&gt; to space to get there.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Is there good without God? Can people be good without God? How can people be good, in the moral and ethical sense, without being grounded in some sort of belief in a being which is greater than they are? Where do concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, come from if not from religion? From where do you get your sense of good and evil, right and wrong?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few excerpts stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herb Silverman&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/herb_silverman/2009/10/god_an_addiction.html"&gt;points out the flaw in the question&lt;/a&gt; itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think it‚Äôs meaningless to ask whether people can be good without God. As an atheist, I believe we are all without any gods. The question is really about whether people can be good without a &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; in God. And by just about any measure, the answer has to be yes. The Scandinavian countries, for example, are the least religious and have low crime rates, as well as good social programs and a high quality of life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have to love Herb‚Äôs retort to a radio show‚Äôs caller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was once a guest on a talk-radio show when a caller said to me: ‚ÄúSince you don‚Äôt believe in God, I suppose you can go out and rape and murder and do anything else you think you can get away with.‚Äù My response was, ‚ÄúWith an attitude like that, I hope you continue to believe in God.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400096383?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1400096383"&gt;Susan Jacoby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; turns the &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/susan_jacoby/2009/10/advance_oct_26.html"&gt;question back around&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who thinks you can only be good &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; a god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why would I derive my values, for example, from a religious tradition that insists it is wrong for a menstruating woman to touch her husband? Or from another religious tradition that tells me it‚Äôs wrong to use contraception? These are nothing more than superstitions that defy both common sense and science. I believe it‚Äôs good for people to express sexual love and desire without producing a dozen babies in the course of a lifetime‚Äìpartly because that has been my experience and partly because the benefits of population control are obvious at a larger social level. Why should I listen to what old men sworn to celibacy have to say about this?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosopher &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591026040?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1591026040"&gt;Austin Dacey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; proposes a new questions &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2009/10/the_secularist_case_against_atheism_30.html"&gt;we ought to be asking&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Today we should ask, what is the proper context of the current conversation about atheism and religion? What is the larger cultural project within which it should be seen? As Charles Taylor has observed, ours is a secular age, an age in which belief is no longer axiomatic but optional. We educated peoples of the rich, industrialized democracies inhabit a disenchanted universe, a world unperturbed by occult powers. It doesn‚Äôt get to cheat and bring things about by magic, but must resort to some natural, causal mechanism. The remaining anti-secular, anti-naturalistic messages of some contemporary Christians, whether from Saddleback or Vatican City, are not the dictates of a triumphant force but the cries of an animal grown more desperate because it is cornered. After five centuries of surrendering to non-religious institutions the dominion over cosmology, biology, medicine, education, entertainment, the arts, and civil society, they are desperate to retain some sliver of continued relevance.

In it, Josh also raised an important point: Why is Richard Dawkins, promoting his new &lt;em&gt;evolution&lt;/em&gt; book, regularly being asked about his &lt;em&gt;atheism&lt;/em&gt;, and why he is ‚Äústrident,‚Äù ‚Äúpolarizing,‚Äù etc? Is it the media‚Äôs fault‚Äìor is it Dawkins‚Äô?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would actually say a bit of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists can be quite irresponsible, and even when they‚Äôre not outright irresponsible, they love to be provocative and to stir up conflict. To them, Dawkins is ‚ÄúMr. Big Atheist,‚Äù and thus instinctively seen as a polarizing figure. Many radio or TV hosts, and even print journalists that Dawkins encounters on his tour, will not have read his books carefully; instead, they will be going on impressions and what they‚Äôve heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, some of these journalists probably partake of the popular misconception that evolution and atheism are somehow equivalent. They may not even be able to &lt;em&gt;distinguish &lt;/em&gt;between Dawkins‚Äô last two books, and so of course, they‚Äôll leap from one to the other insensibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, atheism is, to a trouble-making journalist, potentially a much sexier topic than evolution. It‚Äôs divisive. It‚Äôs controversial. It‚Äôs much easier to create sparks with culture war questions than it is to patiently allow Dawkins to explicate science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I wish the media would just let Dawkins talk about evolution‚Äìit &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;the topic of the new book, and would be much more educational for the audience. But I don‚Äôt believe for a second that this is how the media behaves. That Dawkins would, after &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;, be framed as a scientist-atheist combo, or even the icon of atheistic science, was as inevitable as night after day. It‚Äôs the media equivalent of a law of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where Dawkins himself comes it‚Äìfor at least on some level, could he possibly not have known this? A few years back, long before we had &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/em&gt;, I &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/13/AR2007041302064.html"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; (with Matt Nisbet) of Dawkins that ‚ÄúThe public cannot be expected to differentiate between his advocacy of evolution and his atheism.‚Äù Just swap ‚Äúmedia‚Äù for ‚Äúpublic‚Äù and the sentence is equally accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; the public and the media know the difference? Hell yeah.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that the world we live in? Hell no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus arises the really tough question: Should Dawkins and his followers recognize this reality and adapt accordingly, or should they blame the media and public (for being the media and public)?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256824127577"><id gr:original-id="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/?p=708">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7876a384fec72a44</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">House of Numbers backed by quacks</title><published>2009-10-29T12:19:45Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T12:19:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/house-of-numbers-backed-by-quacks/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">You may have heard that the Spectators screening of House of Numbers and the follow up debate have now been cancelled, however, I doubt those of us who follow the antics of alternative therapists will have heard the last of this film.¬† A major source of information for alternative practitioners is Mike Adams‚Äô Natural News [...]&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gimpyblog.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=1769773&amp;amp;post=708&amp;amp;subd=gimpyblog&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>gimpy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256824127577"><id gr:original-id="711 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91dcc9e1f8b20005</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Review: SuperFreakonomics - Super Climate Fail</title><published>2009-10-29T11:37:02Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T11:37:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/711" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/071399990X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinsresear-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=071399990X"&gt;Superfreakonomics: Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=martinsresear-21&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=2&amp;amp;a=071399990X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I saw a &lt;a href="http://people-press.org/report/556/global-warming"&gt;rather perplexing poll&lt;/a&gt; that showed a sharp decline over the past year in the percentage of Americans who say there is solid evidence that global temperatures are rising (57% now vs 71% a year ago), and that this is because of human activity (36% now vs 47% a year ago).  This is in sharp contrast to the &lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/01/19/eco.globalwarmingsurvey/"&gt;97% of active climatologists&lt;/a&gt; who agree that human activity is causing global warming and the gradually increasing confidence of the IPCC reports summarising the state of climate science.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
One cause of this confusion is the &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/130"&gt;industry-funded disinformation campaign&lt;/a&gt; with its sophisticated PR techniques, think tanks and counterfeit ‚Äúgrass roots‚Äù groups (astroturfing); while another is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/2007/05/talkin_tosh_with_the_iea.php"&gt;ideology&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;"we're for economic freedom and low taxes and against government interference. GW, if real, will probably require state intervention to fix it. Therefore, GW must not be real."&lt;/i&gt; Others are simply slaves to contrarianism, attacking the conventional wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of contrarianism is the original Levitt and Dubner book ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freakonomics"&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù  covering such subjects as the negligible effects of good parenting on education, The economics of drug dealing (including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealers), and the role legalised abortion may have played in reducing crime. Now they have released the follow up, ‚ÄòSuperfreakonomics‚Äô, but unfortunately their &lt;a href="http://delong.typepad.com/files/superfreakonomics-chapter-5.pdf"&gt;chapter on climate change&lt;/a&gt; is a car crash, covering many long discredited points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the authors rely on the testimony of a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2009/10/what_do_superfreakonomics_and.php"&gt;variety of cranks&lt;/a&gt;, including William Happer, one of the &lt;a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=7603"&gt;notorious Senator Inhofe‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt;witnesses at the US Senate Climate Change hearings. Happer is the source of the rather silly &lt;i&gt;CO2 is not a poison‚Äù&lt;/i&gt; claim on page 183. I‚Äôve never actually seen anybody claim that CO2 &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of similarly daft claims make their way into the chapter, and I'll deal with a selection of them below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 165) Scientists warning of an imminent ice age in the 1970s.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact this is an often-debunked myth. There was no scientific consensus in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_cooling"&gt;imminent ice age&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the possibility of anthropogenic warming &lt;a href="http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0477/89/9/pdf/i1520-0477-89-9-1325.pdf"&gt;dominated the peer-reviewed literature even then&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 168) Economic models are better than climate models.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They present no evidence for this and even early, fairly primitive climate models (e.g. Hansen‚Äôs 1988 projections that he presented to congress) have done a fair job of modelling &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/05/hansens-1988-projections/"&gt;the overall annual global mean temperature trend&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, I would expect climate models to be superior as they are based on physical processes rather &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/11/faq-on-climate-models/"&gt;than statistical models&lt;/a&gt;. That is not to say the models are perfect and to be fair the authors do correctly point out some of the weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 169-170) AGW is a religion and Lovelock is it's high priest.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovelock is an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovelock#Gaia"&gt;outlier on climate change&lt;/a&gt; and in no way represents the scientific consensus. It's hard to understand how the authors could reach the impression that he was even a particularly credible figure in the research community, let alone a "high priest".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 182) All the models give the same answers and forecasters fiddle with the parameters to make it fit the output.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No they don't - that's one of the biggest problems. For example here are the outputs from individual model runs for one particular emissions‚Äô scenario from the different models included in the IPCC AR4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/ipcc.jpg" width="510"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"They fiddle with the parameters to make it fit"&lt;/i&gt; is a very common talking point among denialists, but simply isn‚Äôt the way things work, certainly not in the current set of models.  If there is a mismatch between models and measurements then scientists will check both, trying to find the source of the error.  They will look again at the physical processes they are modelling and try to make them more realistic, and they will run many tests on out-of-sample data, for example paleo-climate changes (mid Holocene, last glacial maximum, 8.2 kyr event), predicting for example the effects of volcanos liek Pinatubo ahead of time, then matching these with actual data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 182) CO2 is not the biggest greenhouse gas - it is water vapour.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water vapour is indeed the most dominant greenhouse gas but it is a positive &lt;i&gt;feedback&lt;/i&gt; rather than a &lt;i&gt;forcing&lt;/i&gt; agent. In other words, it‚Äôs effect is to amplify changes in temperature and it will amplify the warming effect caused by increasing CO2. Unlike external forcings such as CO2 which can be added to the atmosphere, the level of water vapour in the atmosphere is pretty much &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/water-vapor-greenhouse-gas.htm"&gt;a function of temperature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water vapour is brought into the atmosphere via evaporation - the rate depends on the ocean and air temperature and is governed by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation"&gt;Clausius-&lt;/a&gt;Clapeyron relation. If extra water is added to the atmosphere, it condenses and falls as rain or snow within a week or two. Similarly, if somehow moisture was sucked out of the atmosphere, evaporation would restore water vapour levels to 'normal levels' in short time. So water vapour can amplify a rise in temperature, but not cause it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 182) A recent paper asserts CO2 has little to do with recent warming - it's cleaning up the pollution.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This refers to a recent publication by &lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2009/Shindell_Faluvegi.html"&gt;Shindell and Faluvegi&lt;/a&gt;, and seems to be a misrepresentation or a failure to understand what the paper actually says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the authors &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/yet-more-aerosols-comment-on-shindell-and-faluvegi/"&gt;actually suggest&lt;/a&gt; is that some industrial aerosols pumped into the atmosphere had a cooling effect that masked the warming effect of CO2. Cleaning up the pollution has eliminated this cooling effect so the warming caused by CO2 is revealed. This is substantially different to Levitt's bewildering interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter continues in a similar vein, either ‚Äòrevealing‚Äô things that are well known and understood by the scientific mainstream - for example that sea level rise is caused by thermal expansion, or that increasing CO2 levels have a diminishing effect on temperature - or relating completely unsupported nonsense, such as the claim that CO2 is not the "right villain".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main conclusion of the chapter is that there is cheap ‚Äògeo-engineering‚Äô fix; pumping SO2 to the stratosphere where it oxidises into S04, which reflects sunlight, so cooling the earth and obviating the need to reduce CO2 emissions. The authors virtually ignore the great uncertainties with this approach. What happens if you over compensate? What happens if this affects certain regions more than others? As Tim Lambert at Deltoid asks &lt;i&gt;"what could possibly go wrong?"&lt;/i&gt; The answer is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2009/10/why_everything_in_superfreakon.php"&gt;plenty&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

I‚Äôve been corresponding with a gentleman who was a fundamentalist Christian but has left that faith and, subsequently, started to read about evolution. (I‚Äôm advising him on what to read.)¬† We started corresponding after he read &lt;em&gt;Why Evolution is True&lt;/em&gt;, which he liked (but also pointed out a few errors, like the discrepant dates for &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;‚Äôs disappearance).¬† He gave me permission to share his story, but anonymously since he‚Äôs not yet ‚Äúcome out.‚Äù¬† It shows, at least in this one case (it‚Äôs not unique; I‚Äôve heard from people with similar tales), that the writings of ‚Äúmilitant‚Äù New Atheists can not only help you give up your faith, but &lt;em&gt;also turn you into a fan of evolution&lt;/em&gt;.¬† He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I accepted evolution and took it for granted from about the age of ten. After college I became a born-again Christian, and accepted the Bible as the inerrant, infallible, and only inspired written Word of God. As a result,¬†the only way to read Genesis was literally. In private conversation with a minister, he warned me not to refer to people as animals, which I had done in the sense of not-plants, in front of any other¬†Christians, as they would think me an evolutionist and stop listening to anything else I might say.¬†I regularly received the Institute for Creation Research‚Äôs propaganda, and eagerly sought confirmation¬†of my worldview from Behe‚Äôs and Johnson‚Äôs books. I always maintained doubts in the back of my mind about the Young Earth view and the explanations of flood geology, but I couldn‚Äôt see any other way of reading Genesis that preserved a real Adam and Eve, and a real Noah, all of whom Jesus and the apostles were recorded in the New Testament¬†regarding as actual historical figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After decades immersed in this, I was persuaded by some ex-Protestants that the evangelical doctrine of sola scriptura (the Bible alone is a Christian‚Äôs final authority) was a recent, therefore¬†human, invention.¬†We should be subject to the Church, not a book. Except that a quick look at history readily shows how errant, fallible, uninspired, human, and downright corrupt the Church was! I tried to rebuild my faith in the Bible by reading all the Christian apologetics I could get my hands on, by heavyweight evangelicals like Michael Licona,¬†William Lane Craig, J.P. Moreland, and popular writers like Josh McDowell and Lee Strobel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was doing this, I was also reading the New Atheists. Some friends and I had been discussing atheism, when one of them said to me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very intelligent, and you always want evidence for everything. Why aren‚Äôt you an atheist?‚Äù So I decided for the first time to¬†let the atheists state their case. Dawkins was rather disappointing, but Harris‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;End of Faith&lt;/em&gt; was devastating. I tried burying myself in apologetics as an antidote, but then I came across critical biblical scholar Bart Ehrman. I started reading about the Bible instead of just reading the Bible. I read scholars‚Äô explanations for the contradictions and discrepancies filling the Bible. Soon my faith was all but destroyed. The New Atheists + modern biblical scholarship = infidel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that happened, the only thing keeping me from believing in evolution again was ID. Even if I couldn‚Äôt trust Genesis anymore to be an accurate account of creation, Behe‚Äôs arguments about intelligent design in light of irreducible complexity stayed with me. I previewed a few books online, read some customer reviews, checked my book club and saw that they carried your book,¬†then selected it as this month‚Äôs choice. So here we are!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He‚Äôs now engaged in a program of reading evolution books like &lt;em&gt;Your Inner Fish&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Climbing Mount Improbable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to this person for sharing his story.&lt;/p&gt;

They can feel it, and even ‚Äúmove‚Äù it. Phantom limbs are one of my favorite examples of the fact that our brains construct an internal model of reality (and our bodies are included in that model), and like all biological processes, that process can go awry. Deprived of sensory and motor feedback from the missing limb, sometimes those bits of the brain (the insular cortex) that give us a sense of ownership and agency over a limb continue to function, manifesting a phantom limb to own and manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, this process can lead to the emergence of a &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=515"&gt;supernumerary phantom limb&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì a third (or fourth or fifth) arm that the person can feel and manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers Moseley and Brugger &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/10/23/0907151106"&gt;recently published a study&lt;/a&gt; involving seven subjects with phantom limbs post-amputation. Their question was whether or not the subjects could be made to move their phantom limbs in anatomically impossible ways. They did this by giving them tasks to imagine with their phantom limbs, tasks that would be quick to accomplish by bending their wrist back in a normally impossible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of the seven subjects reported successfully completing the task. This was experimentally confirmed by timing the subjects in completing their tasks ‚Äì which were more quickly completed by using the impossible movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is most interesting is that once the subjects successfully moved their phantom limbs in the new way, their internal image of their phantom limb morphed to accommodate the new movement ‚Äì including a modified wrist joint over which they had a sense of ownership. This change was further corroborated by the fact that previously simple tasks were made more difficult by the new joint configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words ‚Äì the subjects‚Äô internal model of their phantom limb changed as a result of conscious effort to use the limb in new ways. The subjective ease and difficulty of tasks then conformed to the new anatomical model of the phantom limb. What this likely means is that there is a high degree of plasticity in those brain regions that create our internal model of or body parts and ownership over those body parts. This is consistent with the more basic observation that phantom limbs, and especially supernumerary phantom limbs, can exist in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two apparent applications for this plasticity. The first is as a therapeutic option for those with phantom limbs. Sometimes, the phantom limbs are contorted or contracted in uncomfortable positions. Encouraging patients with painful phantom limbs to imagine a task that will relieve the painful position may be an effective treatment. Other interventions have also been used successfully ‚Äì such as presenting subjects with a virtual image of their phantom limb, which moves into a more comfortable position, triggering their internal model to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this example brings up the second application for the apparent plasticity of our internal model of our own bodies ‚Äì prosthetics and virtual reality. In a ‚Äúsix million dollar man‚Äù scenario, where an amputee is given a robotic limb, it is plausible that recipients may be made to feel ownership over their new limb, rather than feeling as if they have something attached to their body. Sensory and motor feedback is helpful ‚Äì but this study suggests it is not even necessary ‚Äì imagining may be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, as the world of virtual reality looms before us, it is plausible that our brains can be easily tricked into feeling as if we occupy the virtual representation of ourselves. We will not just be looking at an our avatar in a virtual world, but feel as if we are the avatar and are in the virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how easy this will be to accomplish, and how complete the sensation will be. It may be that some sense of ownership will be possible, but will feel unnatural and disconcerting. Or it may be that most people will require considerable training to functionally occupy their virtual selves. Perhaps only the next generation, who begin the process at a young age, will become truly comfortable in their virtual selves. It may also take some time to understand and tweak the process until it becomes practical and comfortable for most people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256818928404"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=6118">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9da76caa770c4e6d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Blog review of WEIT and its colleagues.</title><published>2009-10-29T11:30:33Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T11:30:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/blog-review-of-weit-and-its-colleagues/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href="http://www.penmachine.com/2009/10/dawkins-coyne-shubin-greatest-show"&gt;Pennmachine.com&lt;/a&gt;, Derek Miller reviews and discusses the evidence-for-evolution books by the Three Donkeymen: Neil Shubin, Richard Dawkins, and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I saw a &lt;a href="http://people-press.org/report/556/global-warming"&gt;rather perplexing poll&lt;/a&gt; that showed a sharp decline over the past year in the percentage of Americans who say there is solid evidence that global temperatures are rising (57% now vs 71% a year ago), and that this is because of human activity (36% now vs 47% a year ago).  This is in sharp contrast to the &lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/01/19/eco.globalwarmingsurvey/"&gt;97% of active climatologists&lt;/a&gt; who agree that human activity is causing global warming and the gradually increasing confidence of the IPCC reports summarising the state of climate science.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
One cause of this confusion is the &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/130"&gt;industry-funded disinformation campaign&lt;/a&gt; with its sophisticated PR techniques, think tanks and counterfeit ‚Äúgrass roots‚Äù groups (astroturfing); while another is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/2007/05/talkin_tosh_with_the_iea.php"&gt;ideology&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;"we're for economic freedom and low taxes and against government interference. GW, if real, will probably require state intervention to fix it. Therefore, GW must not be real."&lt;/i&gt; Others are simply slaves to contrarianism, attacking the conventional wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of contrarianism is the original Levitt and Dubner book ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freakonomics"&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù  covering such subjects as the negligible effects of good parenting on education, The economics of drug dealing (including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealers), and the role legalised abortion may have played in reducing crime. Now they have released the follow up, ‚ÄòSuperfreakonomics‚Äô, but unfortunately their &lt;a href="http://delong.typepad.com/files/superfreakonomics-chapter-5.pdf"&gt;chapter on climate change&lt;/a&gt; is a car crash, covering many long discredited points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the authors rely on the testimony of a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2009/10/what_do_superfreakonomics_and.php"&gt;variety of cranks&lt;/a&gt;, including William Happer, one of the &lt;a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=7603"&gt;notorious Senator Inhofe‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt;witnesses at the US Senate Climate Change hearings. Happer is the source of the rather silly &lt;i&gt;CO2 is not a poison‚Äù&lt;/i&gt; claim on page 183. I‚Äôve never actually seen anybody claim that CO2 &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/2009/10/superfreakonomics_global_cooli.php"&gt;similarly daft claims&lt;/a&gt; make their way into the chapter, and I'll deal with a selection of them below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 165) Scientists warning of an imminent ice age in the 1970s.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact this is an often-debunked myth. There was no scientific consensus in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_cooling"&gt;imminent ice age&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the possibility of anthropogenic warming &lt;a href="http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0477/89/9/pdf/i1520-0477-89-9-1325.pdf"&gt;dominated the peer-reviewed literature even then&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 168) Economic models are better than climate models.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They present no evidence for this and even early, fairly primitive climate models (e.g. Hansen‚Äôs 1988 projections that he presented to congress) have done a fair job of modelling &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/05/hansens-1988-projections/"&gt;the overall annual global mean temperature trend&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, I would expect climate models to be superior as they are based on physical processes rather &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/11/faq-on-climate-models/"&gt;than statistical models&lt;/a&gt;. That is not to say the models are perfect and to be fair the authors do correctly point out some of the weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 169-170) AGW is a religion and Lovelock is it's high priest.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovelock is an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovelock#Gaia"&gt;outlier on climate change&lt;/a&gt; and in no way represents the scientific consensus. It's hard to understand how the authors could reach the impression that he was even a particularly credible figure in the research community, let alone a "high priest".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 182) All the models give the same answers and forecasters fiddle with the parameters to make it fit the output.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No they don't - that's one of the biggest problems. For example here are the outputs from individual model runs for one particular emissions‚Äô scenario from the different models included in the IPCC AR4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/ipcc.jpg" width="480"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"They fiddle with the parameters to make it fit"&lt;/i&gt; is a very common talking point among denialists, but simply isn‚Äôt the way things work, certainly not in the current set of models.  If there is a mismatch between models and measurements then scientists will check both, trying to find the source of the error.  They will look again at the physical processes they are modelling and try to make them more realistic, and they will run many tests on out-of-sample data, for example paleo-climate changes (mid Holocene, last glacial maximum, 8.2 kyr event), predicting for example the effects of volcanos liek Pinatubo ahead of time, then matching these with actual data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 182) CO2 is not the biggest greenhouse gas - it is water vapour.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water vapour is indeed the most dominant greenhouse gas but it is a positive &lt;i&gt;feedback&lt;/i&gt; rather than a &lt;i&gt;forcing&lt;/i&gt; agent. In other words, it‚Äôs effect is to amplify changes in temperature and it will amplify the warming effect caused by increasing CO2. Unlike external forcings such as CO2 which can be added to the atmosphere, the level of water vapour in the atmosphere is pretty much &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/water-vapor-greenhouse-gas.htm"&gt;a function of temperature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water vapour is brought into the atmosphere via evaporation - the rate depends on the ocean and air temperature and is governed by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation"&gt;Clausius-&lt;/a&gt;Clapeyron relation. If extra water is added to the atmosphere, it condenses and falls as rain or snow within a week or two. Similarly, if somehow moisture was sucked out of the atmosphere, evaporation would restore water vapour levels to 'normal levels' in short time. So water vapour can amplify a rise in temperature, but not cause it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Page 182) A recent paper asserts CO2 has little to do with recent warming - it's cleaning up the pollution.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This refers to a recent publication by &lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2009/Shindell_Faluvegi.html"&gt;Shindell and Faluvegi&lt;/a&gt;, and seems to be a misrepresentation or a failure to understand what the paper actually says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the authors &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/yet-more-aerosols-comment-on-shindell-and-faluvegi/"&gt;actually suggest&lt;/a&gt; is that some industrial aerosols pumped into the atmosphere had a cooling effect that masked the warming effect of CO2. Cleaning up the pollution has eliminated this cooling effect so the warming caused by CO2 is revealed. This is substantially different to Levitt's bewildering interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter continues in a similar vein, either ‚Äòrevealing‚Äô things that are well known and understood by the scientific mainstream - for example that sea level rise is caused by thermal expansion, or that increasing CO2 levels have a diminishing effect on temperature - or relating completely unsupported nonsense, such as the claim that CO2 is not the "right villain".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main conclusion of the chapter is that there is cheap ‚Äògeo-engineering‚Äô fix; pumping SO2 to the stratosphere where it oxidises into S04, which reflects sunlight, so cooling the earth and obviating the need to reduce CO2 emissions. The authors virtually ignore the great uncertainties with this approach. What happens if you over compensate? What happens if this affects certain regions more than others? As Tim Lambert at Deltoid asks &lt;i&gt;"what could possibly go wrong?"&lt;/i&gt; The answer is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2009/10/why_everything_in_superfreakon.php"&gt;plenty&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;

Despite the fact that there is &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/7/"&gt;no evidence for a link&lt;/a&gt; between vaccines and autism, celebrities like Jenny McCarthy have manufactured public mistrust in one of the safest, most cost effective means of combating disease known to humankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if scientists are not persuading the public with appeals to carefully designed trials and factual data, how should they make their point? I‚Äôm not sure I have the full answer, but I think I might have struck a nerve with the public lately. I decided to try a novel approach to communicating my concerns about pseudoscience on the Internet ‚Äì and presented 20 slides at 20 second intervals to a conference of ePatients in Philadelphia. I did it with powerful and humorous images, tied together with a long Limerick. Sound kooky? Maybe so‚Ä¶ but it resonated, and was received with cheers and applause. Now that‚Äôs how we like science to be recognized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs hard to recreate the experience ‚Äì with voice, images, and rhyme ‚Äì on the blog. But please check out the &lt;a href="http://getbetterhealth.com/a-tale-of-two-epatients-limerick-by-dr-val-jones/2009.10.27"&gt;slide deck here&lt;/a&gt;, and I‚Äôve reproduced the Limerick in its entirety below. It‚Äôs called, ‚ÄúA Tale Of Two ePatients‚Äù ‚Äì and the slides advanced at each ‚Äú***‚Äù. I hope my fellow scientists will join me in continuing to find novel approaches to win hearts and minds. Public health really is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;padding:0px;margin:0px"&gt;Megan‚Äôs Story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;A woman woke up from her sleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;With a pain that felt terribly deep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;It didn‚Äôt seem right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She worried all night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;But resorted to counting her sheep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;In the morning she saw a physician&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;To check on her tummy condition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;But alas what he found&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;By poking around-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;A cancer and some malnutrition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;So she asked what her chances could be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Of finding a way to be free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Of the mutating cells&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;They should bid their farewells&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She hoped to hear something happy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The doctor‚Äôs face turned very dour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm almost sure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;There isn‚Äôt a chance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;You‚Äôre far too advanced&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The prognosis is terribly poor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She asked if there might be some way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;To research new treatments today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;But the doctor moved on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;To see patients anon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;No time to say more now, ok?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Afraid to ask questions again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She decided to put down her pen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;With her anger and hurt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And his choice to be curt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She became an ePatient right then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Meg soon found a doctor online&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The top of his field ‚Äì so kind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And his new research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;From his USC perch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Showed promise for tumor decline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;His knowledge promised to advanced her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;For all things he had a good answer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;He provided the data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And other schemata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And planned for a cure of her cancer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;But just to be sure he was right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She checked out the NIH site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And with careful review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She knew what to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She refused to give up on her fight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The treatment was not very easy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She often felt shaky and queasy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Yet she stayed the course&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Pushing through it with force&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Walking whether ‚Äòtwas sunny or breezy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;A friend called to check on the rumor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;That Meg picked a fight with a tumor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The friend offered advice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;About herbals and spice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Which he presented in really good humor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Oh my friend this sounds really appealing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And I know all you want is my healing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;But how do you know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;To believe in this so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;When all you rely on is feeling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Dear Megan, he said with a wave&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;I know that you‚Äôre awfully brave&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;You don‚Äôt have to endure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The toxins I‚Äôm sure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;These herbals are able to save&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Well let‚Äôs look at their track record then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;If they really do work I‚Äôll give in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;So they researched Medline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And Mayo Clinic online&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Finding no evidence of a win&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;But there are people who say this will work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Herbs saved these three guys and a clerk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;They put their minds to it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Were sure they could do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And avoided chemo with a smirk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;But my friend in this life you must see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;We use science to think critically&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;If there is an effect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;We‚Äôre sure to detect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;A dose-response repeatedly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Meg carefully weighed all her choices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Giving weight to the most reasoned voices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She found the best science&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And increased self-reliance -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Worth more than a million Rolls Royces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Her first doctor rallied to meet her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Admitting she‚Äôd saved her own keister&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;So she offered a toast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;To the folks she loved most&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And the victory couldn‚Äôt be sweeter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;padding:0px;margin:0px"&gt;Julie‚Äôs Story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;A woman had been in the shower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;For something quite close to an hour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;When she noticed a lump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The tiniest bump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Just below her tattoo of a flower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;I guess I must have a bug bite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Though this bump doesn‚Äôt fe-el quite right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She wondered aloud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;With her head in a cloud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Assuming that it was alright&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Months later she noticed some pain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;On the spot where she had a food stain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;So she scratched off the spot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Took her walk to a trot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And proceeded to shut off her brain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Later on she woke up with a start&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;This lump‚Äôs really starting to smart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;So she went to the net&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Now breaking a sweat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Worried something was wrong with her heart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She netsurfed around for some time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Chatting live with the people online&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;They thought she might like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;A short hunger strike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Or to calm down her chest pain with wine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;But my skin is getting so red&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Am I making this up in my head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Why not watch for a while&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Or jog for a mile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;There‚Äôs nothing much more to be said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Julie liked her new friends on the web&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Though with patience beginning to ebb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She asked yet again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;To Kim, Kyle and Ken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;If they had some ideas instead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;An herbalist friend that I know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Diagnoses her friends on the go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Please call her right now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And she‚Äôll show you how&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;To cure pain with good energy flow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;So she called the healer in a pinch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And was told it was really a synch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;She should lie on the floor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;To strengthen her core&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;And breath without moving an inch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;But my skin is beginning to crack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;-Well of course it‚Äôs because you might lack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Vitamins for your dermis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Put them all in a thermos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Drink ‚Äòem down and put on an ice pack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Do you think I should see an MD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Julie asked of her community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Heck no, don‚Äôt go there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;You won‚Äôt have a prayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;You‚Äôll be poisoned immediately!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Don‚Äôt you think that there might be just one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Who could help out my skin rash a ton?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;It itches and hurts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;I can‚Äôt wear my shirts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;I can tell you this isn‚Äôt much fun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Julie left her friends on the computer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;To find a physician to suit her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;During the exam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The doc shouted ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;I‚Äôll need to call our trouble shooter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The oncologist looked on aghast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;At the breast cancer‚Äôs fungating mass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Why did you wait?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;You‚Äôve sealed your fate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;There‚Äôs no way to alter the past&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;You can‚Äôt fix this tumor for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Well now I see very clearly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;My friends told me docs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Are as useless as rocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;You don‚Äôt do much good, I agree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;But miss Julie, you‚Äôre breaking my heart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The oncologist, flipping his chart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;We do have a cure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;You‚Äôd have it for sure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;If you came in with a lump at the start&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;We can treat you for pain and unease&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;We‚Äôll give comfort however you please&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;The lesson of course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Consider the source&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;As an ePatient with a disease&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Oh doctor, we need to tell others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;Not to mix up our health with our druthers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;May my death find some meaning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;My soul intervening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:10px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;padding:0px"&gt;For breast cancer in daughters and mothers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/harris-barbour.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/harris-barbour1.jpg" alt="harris-barbour" title="harris-barbour" width="550" height="646"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, Harris &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/14/a-real-statement-from-albuquerque-city-council-member-don-harris-2/"&gt;issued an apology for his actions on this site&lt;/a&gt;.  He had some issues with how I approached the issue, but he did acknowledge doing something he shouldn‚Äôt have and I sincerely believe he feels remorseful about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New Mexico Independent&lt;/em&gt; has a &lt;a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/40509/abq-city-councilor-harris-apologizes-for-atheist-mailer"&gt;follow-up article on the whole debacle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In e-mails to readers of a popular Atheist blog, City Councilor Don Harris recently apologized for attempting to use his opponent‚Äôs religion against him, saying he had ‚Äúlearned a great deal,‚Äù from the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Independent, Harris said that &lt;strong&gt;once NMI‚Äôs stories about his mailer were picked up by FriendlyAtheist, he got ‚Äúa fair bit of e-mail.‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAlthough the safest course would be to leave it alone, I felt compelled to at least write the people back who took the time to write to me, and to post something on their site, which several of them asked me to do,‚Äù Harris told the Independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;I was reminded that the decisions that one makes when running for office and being in office are not simple ones, and they can have unexpected consequences&lt;/strong&gt;. Being true to one‚Äôs own principles, while respecting the principles of others‚Äô, as a public official is a delicate balance. Political campaigns are by definition divisive; then after the election some healing and mending fences may be in order. That was the case here,‚Äù he wrote, adding, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just doing the best I can.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also says I ‚Äúdid not reply to an e-mail from the Independent requesting an interview.‚Äù  Not sure what happened there, since I would‚Äôve replied to that.  I didn‚Äôt get their email, though.  (I sent them a message letting them know that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve learned a few lessons from this whole back-and-forth with Harris:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs not yet a taboo to use the word ‚Äúatheist‚Äù as slander.  We haven‚Äôt reached the level of respectability within public opinion that we deserve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politicians don‚Äôt always know &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we get upset when they use ‚Äúatheist‚Äù in a derogatory way.  We need to let them know that‚Äôs bigotry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some politicians actually &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to what we atheists have to say ‚Äî and respond in kind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way to fix this sort of problem is to write letters, contact the politicians, spread the message, and NOT let these stories slip under the radar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all of you who didn‚Äôt let this story die and who carried on email conversations with Mr. Harris during this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

The Society for Neuroscience(SfN) was formed 40 years ago and to commemorate the occasion, the journal of Neuroscience has made some review articles open-access. They are written by leading luminaries in their filed and are somewhat scholarly- though I found some of them pretty accessible too.

&lt;p&gt;Brian, I have seen your video ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://herebedragonsmovie.com/"&gt;Here be Dragons&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù and wow its hilarious. Starts very innocent and common sense like, then takes a deceptive plunge that instinctively makes your palm and face meet. Hitler claims the best lies need a little truth, in your case ‚Äì common since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video, by its definition, is propagandist martial and that is an observable fact. It is evident that you are a person with malicious intent towards society and professor of ignorance. I hope you get run over by a truck carrying copies of the US constitution, wouldn‚Äôt that be ironic. But don‚Äôt worry Brian, luckily for you we all have the right to live even if were complete fucking douche bags. Just please don‚Äôt have kids, we have enough confused, delusional, self righteous earth leeches on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daren R. Lee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Zeitgeist Movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I‚Äôm not half as proud as must be ‚ÄúThe Zeitgeist Movement‚Äù, who are fortunate to have such an insightful and articulate public representative. He manages to artfully limit the number of Hitler references to just one, and raises malapropism to new heights of dual meaning. So congratulations, Mr. Lee. You can pick up your prize from the officer just offstage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This award is apropos, inasmuch as &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt; (an amazingly paranoid conspiracy theory documentary made for the Internet) helped to inspire &lt;a href="http://herebedragonsmovie.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here Be Dragons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (my own Internet documentary made to help people see through such nonsense).

As is Michael Savage</title><published>2009-10-29T07:09:01Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T07:09:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/bill-donohues-pissed-again-as-is-michael-savage/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs right. Child Rapist Apologist Bill Donohue is pissed off at something. I swear, if I had a penny for every time this happened, I‚Äôd be a rich man. Wasn‚Äôt it only a week ago that he &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; outraged him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what‚Äôs made baby Jesus cry now? &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/oh_give_it_a_rest_bill.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Larry David has mocked religion before in the show (for instance, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ye4wkAiG0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xtJrH0IHso"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUc77Dn8Me0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.allmovie.com/work/curb-your-enthusiasm-the-benadryl-brownie-274436"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). But I guess Donohue only cares when its his religion that‚Äôs being mocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Donohue‚Äôs not the only one. Michael Savage (yeah, &lt;a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200807170005"&gt;that Michael Savage&lt;/a&gt;) also attacked Larry David, who he refers to as a ‚Äúself-hating Jew,‚Äù ‚Äúinsane,‚Äù and somehow an ‚Äúanti semite.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/WXvFCrpWS6E%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0%26hd%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy complains that &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; teaches people that all Jews are like Woody Allen stereotypes despite not watching &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;. . .obviously. He then mischaracterized Curb Your Enthusiasm, another show that he doesn‚Äôt watch, claiming that ‚Äúthe only Christian in the show‚Äù is depicted as fat and stupid, etc. The only Christian in the show? What?! Right off the top of my head, David‚Äôs on-screen wife Cheryl is a Christian. She was in the episode and was neither depicted as fat nor stupid. I‚Äôm pretty damned sure Ted Danson‚Äôs not Jewish. And he‚Äôs in almost every other episode of the show. Though I don‚Äôt recall seeing him in this particular episode, he was in the previous episode. And there are countless non-Jews in &lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;. And they‚Äôre not depicted as all fat and stupid. And let‚Äôs be fair here. Similar cases to the one mocked in the show really do happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Michael Savage says something else incredibly ignorant and stupid (I know. Shocker) by using the old Donohue ‚Äúthey only mock Christianity because they‚Äôre afraid to mock Islam‚Äù gambit. Which is of course absurd considering &lt;a href="http://www.reviewstream.com/reviews/?p=85348"&gt;Larry David HAS MOCKED ISLAM IN THE SHOW!&lt;/a&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I am outraged, Mike. I‚Äôm outraged that your bullshit is allowed on the air. It‚Äôs not Larry David that makes Jews look bad. You make humanity look bad, you hypocritical, self-righteous ass-clown!&lt;/p&gt;

It's just not.  But, what the hell.  I'm eating a pickle and drinking a beer, so we might as well have at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking tonight about whether to write here about this because, to be honest, I am feeling a little squeemy.  Perhaps it would be "uncivil" to write about this here.  But, that's the point of the blog, right?  To talk about all of the things in science that make us squeemy and sometimes that shit is downright uncivil...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, earlier in the week in the midst of data analysis and manuscript writing I got an email from a guy  whose anonymity I will maintain here (I think I am going soft on the d00ds), asking me to write a guest post for a job resource site.  I think professional development is an important general topic, and I asked him to define a specific, narrow question he&amp;#39;d like me to address. I was generally happy to help him with the development for his blog.¬† After all, Isis is nothing if not a giver.¬†  We went back and forth a bit, defining more and more focused questions, until finally I received this email:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re: Women in Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One topic that I have been uneasy writing about is appropriate attire for women while interviewing..I love your shoe fetish stuff and I think it is more difficult for women to decide what to wear and how to present themselves, especially female scientists...I know you can take a crack at that and personally I was torn between the red stilletos [sic] and knee high boots...both favorites of mine but then again I am a man and men are pigs...But I digress...you are different than many women scientists in your balance between feminism and being feminine and I think that is a struggle that many women scientist struggle with...I think your advice would be well received and funny enough for my readers....&lt;strong&gt;Actually, I am trying to push my blog numbers to &lt;em&gt;[Insert number greater than 1 but lower than Isis's traffic]&lt;/em&gt; unique hits next month so if you have a pic of you in knee high patent leather boots..let me know!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I totally got the message loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="naked in leather boots.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/naked%20in%20leather%20boots.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="629" width="468"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: Isis guest posts in order to get a little traffic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;For the record, I have previously posted on the appropriate attire for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/02/ask_dr_isis_--_grad_school_int.php"&gt;graduate school&lt;/a&gt;/post doc/&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2008/12/ask_dr_isis_interview_advice.php"&gt;faculty job interviews&lt;/a&gt; on this blog. In fact, in the almost year since I have been here I have answered &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/02/ask_dr_isis_--_grad_school_int.php"&gt;33 of your letters on my blog&lt;/a&gt; and many more privately.¬† Shockingly, as of today, I appear to have answered more requests for advice than I have posted shoes. I can&amp;#39;t recall that I ever had to show my legs (at least above the
ankle) or personally strike some sexy, fetished pose in order to do it. I&amp;#39;d like to think that many of you send me your questions (I am still sitting on a few) because occasionally my advice hits the mark and not just because I am hilarious and my tits are huge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/02/ask_dr_isis_--_grad_school_int.php"&gt;today I wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;But, it sucks as a feminist to have to give this advice because I could sense 
from this email that what our reader was really asking was how to wear what she 
wants without people thinking she doesn&amp;#39;t take her science seriously or 
misinterpreting her clothing choices as a sexual suggestions.¬† One woman&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;I 
love these red shoes!¬† The color reminds me of my tricycle from when I was a 
little girl!&amp;quot; can be one d00d&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;She is clearly wearing those shoes here because 
she is looking for some action. On my penis.&amp;quot;¬† Sometimes you just can&amp;#39;t win, and 
it is unfortunate that we have to consider the message others receive when we 
decide what to wear.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This all after I gave advice to a woman to wear her red heels or knee high boots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's most unfortunate is that from the use of the word "fetish," the reference to "men as pigs" and...um...the request that I pose on his blog in a pair of knee high leather boots to drive his traffic up (presumably NOT from the women who would be interested in my advice), I could tell exactly what message this person wanted me to send.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://player.ordienetworks.com/flash/fodplayer.swf&amp;amp;width=384&amp;amp;height=256&amp;amp;flashVars=key%3Dd08b02ae4b" width="384" height="256"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:left;font-size:x-small;margin-top:0pt;width:384px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/d08b02ae4b/we-are-douchebags" title="from Slick Gigolo"&gt;We Are Douchebags&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 1: I can tell you what message the email sent me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;So, what the balls is one amazing domestic and laboratory goddess to do?¬† Well, we can go one of two ways with this, I suppose.¬† We can someday finally accept that it&amp;#39;s probably not appropriate to use your professional colleagues as sex objects.

&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2009/10/data_weeps_does_brent_spiner_have_anti-v/DataHolmes.jpg" width="420" height="558" alt="DataHolmes.jpg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Brent Spiner is not living up to Commander Data's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Say it ain't so, Data! Say it ain't so!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last night, I decided for the heck of it to check my &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/oracknows"&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, something I only tend to do sporadically, although I do keep a constant stream of links to the latest Insolence flowing, to the gratitude and awe of my followers, when I saw this Tweet directed at me from someone with the 'nym &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ZombiePresident/status/5241683919"&gt;Zombie President&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;@BrentSpiner I prefer @oracknows over Dr jay gordon any day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh? I wondered what was going on. One thing you should know before I continue is that &lt;a href="http://www.therealbrentspiner.com"&gt;Brent Spiner&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BrentSpiner"&gt;active Twitterer&lt;/a&gt; (although after this incident I may have to refer to him as an active twit if his response to criticism shows that he is not educable). In fact, he's pretty darned funny at times. I recall a few months ago that he did a rather extended story in Twitter, complete with an attack on his house, his forced retreat to a safe room, and all sorts of other twists and turns, all over the course of several days. Given that I've been a long time Trek fan ever since I was a little kid and that I used to watch &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; almost religiously over the course of its seven year run, with Data being one of my favorite characters, I had more than ample reason to follow Spiner's Tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing the Tweet above, I looked some more. I didn't have far to look to find this Tweet directed at me from Bandon Decker, who &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Bandon_Decker/status/5243326066"&gt;Tweeted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@BrentSpiner Have you considered following @oracknows ? I find he makes much more sense than @JayGordonMDFAAP.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh. What was this about? I had to investigate. So I went to Spiner's Twitter feed and found this Tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Check out my new follow. Dr. Jay Gordon. He makes a lot of sense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, no, this didn't look good at all, especially when it was followed by this Tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;RT @MaggieL : That'd be easier if we knew his Twitter name. You mean this guy: &lt;a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com"&gt;http://www.drjaygordon.com&lt;/a&gt;?...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bummer. There was no mistake. Brent Spiner appeared on the surface to have drunk deeply of the anti-vaccine Kool Aid. But was it just on the surface, or is Spiner really an anti-vaccinationist? Let's see if we can figure it out. I waded into the Twitter exchange that followed--and was appalled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/data_weeps_does_brent_spiner_have_anti-v.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/data_weeps_does_brent_spiner_have_anti-v.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/80-reCMEFMg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256794365533"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/tweetlinks_10-28-09.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8830349746031937</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Tweetlinks"/><title type="html">Tweetlinks, 10-28-09</title><published>2009-10-29T04:57:50Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T04:57:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/VovWQHdeLD0/tweetlinks_10-28-09.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/tweetlinks_10-28-09.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Follow &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BoraZ" title=""&gt;me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to get these, and more, in something closer to Real Time (all my tweets are also imported into &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/coturnix" title=""&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; where they are much more easy to search and comment on, as well as into my &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/coturnix" title=""&gt;Facebook wall&lt;/a&gt; where they are seen by quite a different set of people):&lt;/p&gt;

They‚Äôre a multi-cultural collection of professional people, an Hispanic medical professional, a woman with leg braces and a clipboard. An African-American doctor (white coat), serious expression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to play Devil‚Äôs Advocate and stand up for the insurance company on this &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-autism27-2009oct27,0,7328448.story?track=rss"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, but I just can‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúA tactic used by insurance companies to deny expensive behavioral therapy to autistic children has been deemed illegal by a Los Angeles judge. In a preliminary ruling, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James C. Chalfant found that Kaiser Permanente‚Äôs refusal to pay for a child‚Äôs autism treatment because the provider was not licensed by the state runs counter to California‚Äôs Mental Health Parity Act. That act requires insurers to cover care for mental and behavioral problems at the same levels they do for physical illnesses.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment is ABA (applied behavior analysis) therapy, and many, if not most, providers are not licensed at the state level, meaning that the insurance companies would never have to cover treatment. As parents desperate for treatments and therapies for our kids, we need more support from insurance, not less. ABA is hardly an untested or experimental treatment, and I can‚Äôt defend a company claiming that it‚Äôs only trying to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù patients from unlicensed practitioners when it‚Äôs clear that the refusal to pay is based on profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;#39;Times New Roman&amp;#39;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal;font-size:x-small"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am always up for a dialogue on the issue of our moral relation to animals and on the ethical use of animals in scientific research. If folks inclined towards the animal rights stance want to engage in a dialogue right here, in the comments on this post, I am happy to host it.

&lt;p&gt;(I will not, however, be hosting a debate. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/09/dialogue_not_debate.php"&gt;A dialogue is different from a debate&lt;/a&gt;, and a dialogue is what I'm prepared to host.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That post has received upward of 250 comments, so there was certainly some sort of exchange going on.  But, did we manage to have something approaching a dialogue, or did we end up slipping into a debate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In considering this question, I want to offer a grid I encountered in the Difficult Dialogues Initiative at San Jose State University, adapted from material from the &lt;a href="http://www.publicconversations.org/"&gt;Public Conversations Project&lt;/a&gt;.  The grid compares characteristics of dialogues and arguments (which are not precisely the same as debates but are probably close enough for our purposes here):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/how_did_we_do_at_dialogue.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/10/how_did_we_do_at_dialogue.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/JtGmLC4_zYI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256782007172"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/good_stuff_to_read_on_the_scie.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88230d8707f4b34a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogospherics"/><title type="html">Good stuff to read on the scienceblorgs</title><published>2009-10-29T01:57:21Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T01:57:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/86IQSPlPCSg/good_stuff_to_read_on_the_scie.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/good_stuff_to_read_on_the_scie.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is really interesting:  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/10/what_is_squalene.php"&gt;What is squalene?&lt;/a&gt;  Next time you are talking to an antivaxer, just say "We have the squalene.

Dosage ranged from 25-50mg/day (dose adjustment at week 2 for poor responders). No other active comparator (e.g., paroxetine) was used in this study. Similar to the previous study (Loo et al, 2002), the efficacy of agomelatine on a severely depressed subpopulation was examine too.Surprise, surprise, agomelatine was shown to be superior to placebo (HAM-D total score 14.1 +/- 7.7 versus 16.5+/- 7.4). Plot twist: "The proportion of patients who were in remission by the end of the acute treatment period was not statistically  different between the two treatment groups." Of course, that could be due to the short duration (6-weeks) of the study.Remember this quote from the previous study I reviewed: "25mg of agomelatine was significantly better than placebo at 2 weeks..., whereas this significant advantage for paroxetine...did not emerge until 4 weeks." Here is the survival analysis for this study:The difference did not occur until week 4, the same as paroxetine in the previous study. So this study failed to replicate the result of the first study.Common side-effects reported include: "dizziness, nasopharyngitis and influenza were more common in the agomelatine group that placebo." Again, no sexual side-effects were reported (sorry, no fancy chart to show).Part 3:The third published study was by Olie and Kasper (2005, 4). This study is similar in design as the study mentioned-above. At the end of 6-weeks, there was a superior response for agomelatine compared to placebo (3.44 point difference).Here is the survival analysis curve for time to first response:Here, you can see a difference was noted at week 2 (replicating the original result), but then they merge at week 4 (difference was still significant) and then separate again thereafter. What is interesting about placebo temporarily merging  with the active drug at week four, is that there was a dose adjustment from 25mg to 50mg for poor responders at week 2. Probably not the robust result they were looking for, but a reaction non-the-less.Reported side-effects are similar to the previous studies:Comment: Both of these study are extremely short (6-weeks). 2/3 of depressed patients usually do not respond to their first anti-depressant. Moreover, while response rates (50% reduction in symptoms) are usually robust, remissions rates a paltry (usually 1/5-1/3 remission). No long-term information can be gathered from these two short-term studies. There is long-term data, but it's unpublished.Side-effect do appear mild. However, many SSRI antidepressant trials show mild side-effects. It's not until the drug is widely prescribe do common side-effects become evident.All three studies were biased against placebo (i.e., 1 week placebo wash-out period).Keep in mind that these are published studies of positive trials. There are negative trials that are simply not published (I'm shocked!).The European Medicines Agency, the parallel to the FDA, initially rejected the drug in 2006 (5).Here is what they said:In case you cannot read the image, it says, "The major concern of the CHMP was that the effectiveness of Valdoxan/Thymanax had not been sufficiently shown. The long-term study (the unpublished data I mentioned) did not show that the medicine was effective. The short-term studies shown that the medicine has an effect, but the extent of this did not allow the Committee to draw a firm conclusion on the medicine's effectiveness."The drug was finally approved in 2008 (6). In their report they list all the submitted trials.Some highlights:-In study CL3-22, which which included a fluoxetine comparator. This study, which was a short-term with a long-term (1 year) extension found that both agomelatine and fluoxetine were not statistically superior to placebo. (oops!).-In study CL3-23 agomelatine and paroxetine were not statistically superior to placebo over the short-and-long term. (whoops!).-CL3-24, the results were identical to CL3-33. (strike three, you're out!).-Study CL3-21 was a relapse prevention study against placebo. At the end of the trial, agomelatine had a relapse rate of 26% versus 24% for the placebo group (strike four! wait that's not right). They did a post-hoc analysis (i.e., statistical masturbation) and found that only for severely depressed patients there was a statistical difference. The proper thing to do at this point is to run a NEW study to test that intriguing hypothesis since the analysis was done after the fact. (It didn't happen, obviously).-Efficacy in the elderly was not demonstrated-Because of concerns over liver toxicity, liver monitoring is required. (do they require that for SSRI's)Versus other AntidepressantsMuch of the...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The public's health is the first victim, followed closely by individual patients and parents struggling with individual health decisions.  I cannot fault patients for making bad decisions---the anti-vaccination movement has a very effective propaganda arm.  Folks like Jenny McCarthy have a large audience and make no secret of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/mccarthy---where_does_the_dang.php"&gt;their desire to see infectious diseases increase in others&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do believe sadly it's going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it's their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They're making a product that's s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we'll use it. It shouldn't be polio versus autism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;These folks are so focused on their own quasi-religious delusions that they can no longer properly evaluate reality. ¬†That would be fine if they lived in isolated caves away from electronic media. ¬†But they don&amp;#39;t.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/the_anti-vaccination_movement.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/the_anti-vaccination_movement.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/3kl45TnYK74" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256774500760"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/michigan_officials_fear_extens.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5aa6e1d422ce7924</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Michigan: Officials fear extension funding soon will be cut</title><published>2009-10-29T00:40:42Z</published><updated>2009-10-29T00:40:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/s1XBEAqmQIg/michigan_officials_fear_extens.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/michigan_officials_fear_extens.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;After the state failed to issue MSU Extension and the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station, or MAES, their monthly payment, officials fear funding for these programs could be eliminated altogether.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programs primarily are supported by state funding and were appropriated $64 million in the 2009-10 state higher education budget, which is awaiting Gov. Jennifer Granholm's approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the funding is eliminated, it could mean drastic cuts and possible extinction for the MSU College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Extension Director Tom Coon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The College of Agriculture and Natural Resources receives about 74 percent of its funding from MSU Extension and MAES. The programs also fund 82 extension offices and 15 research stations statewide, employing almost 3,000 workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The work that we do generates new jobs by helping farms, helping businesses and helping young people become more successful through youth development," Coon said. "There are parts of Michigan's economy that aren't growing. This is one that is. It's actually generating new jobs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't just sit there, do something!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn't always that way. In 1982 when I first saw E.T. I had no idea that Elliott's use of Reeses' Pieces to lure E.T. into his home was part of a clever marketing ploy that had been pre-arranged with the multinational conglomerate selling the candy. Now that nearly every household has a DVR allowing viewers to fast-forward through commercials, advertisers are relying more and more heavily on product placement to show off their wares. But how effective are product placements in getting their message to customers?

There hasn't actually been a lot of published research on product placement, since marketing firms like to keep that information to themselves. And the research that has been done may not be realistic enough to draw useful conclusions: In one study, a researcher used low-production-value films created in the laboratory to test the efficacy of product placements, but that may not tell us much about how people respond to products in slick Hollywood productions. In other studies, a distinction wasn't made between products that simply appeared in a movie and ones that were important to the storyline. From these studies we know that people do tend to remember the brands they see in a movie, but we can't say much about how a particular product's placement makes a difference.

Moonhee Yang and David Roskos-Ewoldsen showed 373 students from the University of Alabama one of 15, 20-minute movie clips taken from major Hollywood films. Around the middle of each clip was a single product placement of interest. These products had been pre-selected by a preference panel to be roughly equally appealing. Another panel assessed the importance of the product in the movie's storyline by placing it in one of three categories: Background (not important to story), Used by Character, and Story Connection (meaning the product was actually related to the plot of the movie). This table lists all the products and films in the study:

Here's the latest (the colors are as sent to me: I guess it was very important!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="font-size:18px"&gt;On &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Thursday&lt;/span&gt;, October 29, 2009 at &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;8:45 am ET&lt;/span&gt;, Catholic League President &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Bill Donohue&lt;/span&gt; will appear on Fox News Channel's &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;"Fox and Friends."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p style="font-size:18px"&gt;He will discuss the recent attack on Jesus on HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Attack on Jesus". Jebus, what a loon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you know what the only reasonable response to such foolishness is. We must watch the Attack on Jesus, and laugh, even if I didn't think it was that funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/zWsQyoCMIUk%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I still have a stash of holy crackers. I might just have to escalate some more, just to witness Donohue's public meltdown, and make a point: nobody, especially anyone who is not Catholic, has to revere Catholic icons, and demanding that we do is only gonna get Jesus hurt some more.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of them have probably been for the better, some for the worse, and one in particular has been disastrous: the rise of gifting. In the last few months it has fundamentally broken the platform.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Facebook platform there arose a bit of a spam problem. Developers incentivized customers to send invites to their friends, often even paying them in-app currency to do so. It quickly became obvious that apps employing such tactics could grow to millions of users almost overnight and, in the process, create tremendous volumes of invites that hampered the Facebook user‚Äôs experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook reacted by doing a couple things. First they banned rewarding users for sending invites (or using other similar platform integration points) and they limited the amount of invites a user could send from any one app to 20 per day. The limit made it impossible to spam your entire list in just a couple clicks and the new incentive rules made users much less apt to spam over time. The idea was that if people were so constricted, and rewarded only when their friends actually signed up rather than when they sent the invite, people would be more considerate, invite only friends who might actually be interested, and the number of unwanted invites being sent out would decrease dramatically.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those changes helped, but still they wanted to do better, so they later changed the allocations such that the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù apps got more invites per day (up to 60) and the worst offenders were choked off entirely. Invites are the lifeblood of almost all Facebook apps, so it worked. That seemed to be an improvement until a few months ago when developers figured out how to game the system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is in how Facebook determines which apps are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. They do that mainly by looking at the app‚Äôs invite acceptance rate, as well as the rate at which those invites are blocked or ignored. An app‚Äôs allocations are based on how their rates compare to the median. When we first started developing about a year ago, the median hovered somewhere around 20-25%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is, it turns out, easily gamed. The original solution, used by Mob Wars and the like, was to create in-game ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù that come from an invite and give you in-game benefits. Want to run a job in Mob Wars? You‚Äôre only allowed to if you have enough friends in your mob. Want to attack people? Your success in battle will be almost entirely dependent on your mob size. You may need 20 buddies to do a mid-level job and 500 to attack another player with any shot of success. At some point the buddy requirements get so high that the only realistic way to get them is to send buddy invites (via Facebook invites) to large numbers of people who already have the app, which you found on some large ‚ÄúAdd Me‚Äù lists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This of course boosted Mob Wars‚Äôs invite acceptance rate. When you install the app, you might invite your real friends for a week until you run out. Let‚Äôs say you send 100 invites to actual friends, and 10% sign up. Not bad, but you need 20 to do that next job. So you join an add-me list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next thing you know you‚Äôve got 400 new friends, all of whom were on the list, and almost all of whom are sure to accept your invite request. So you invite them over the next couple weeks and they almost all accept. Despite the fact that only 10 out of the 100 &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; people you sent an invite accepted (not a particularly high rate) your &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; invites were accepted by 400 out of 500, making for an average of 80%. The acceptance rate didn‚Äôt go up because the developers made the game better, they just hacked the platform to make sure the people who already used it sent and accepted more invites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This still wasn‚Äôt that big of a problem because most people never got that far, the needed number of friends wasn‚Äôt too high, and the active players really didn‚Äôt need to send out the full 20 invites per day for very long. It pushed the median invite acceptance rate up as RPGs grew, but not ridiculously so. Then came gifts and the rise of Farm Town.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, in-game gifting as a platform hack was first figured out by MyFarm, and then later put to spectacular use by Farm Town. The idea is to have one app send many invites to people who play the game every day for as long as they play the game. Combine this with an engaging game and you‚Äôve got an invite acceptance machine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first log into Farm Town, you are taken to the gifting screen, where you can easily choose an item (such as a pig or an orange tree) and then send it to all of your friends. Each gift is a Facebook Invite that has to be accepted in Facebook (not in the Farm Town app) from your requests page. So you click the accept button, go to the app, are given the gift, then have to hit the back button and do it again for every gift you have.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now just about everyone who plays the game is sending out the full amount of gifts per day. And what happens is that their friends who play accept nearly 100% of them. The ones who don‚Äôt click ignore once, and the ones who do click accept 100 times. As a result, the median invite rate for the entire platform has since shot to near 60%, and it isn‚Äôt because spam has been reduced, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs been increased but the non-spam invites have been increased many times more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if your email provider, instead of blocking spam, somehow made you receive twice as much of it but then somehow made half of their customers (of which you may or may not be one) receive 100 times as much non-spam email. Your overall user experience suffers, and in fact even the people who are getting more non-spam are suffering, but the overall % of emails that are spam just decreased by a wide margin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs exactly what has happened on Facebook. Even the people who play the farm games don‚Äôt want that many invites. They want the gifts, and that‚Äôs fine, but surely nobody wants to log into Facebook, see 20 Farm Town gift invites, and have to accept them one at a time by clicking accept, loading the app, then clicking back to the requests page. It‚Äôs slow and painful. From a usability standpoint gifts should be given in-game and not even require acceptance (who would ever not want a free chicken?) but the developers get a tremendous advantage from the acceptance rate so the user has to suffer in order to help them game the platform.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem this creates is that you simply cannot have a top app without gifting, no matter how nonsensical its existence in your game is, or how much it detracts from the user experience or game mechanics. Your game could be the most engaging on the platform, but without a solid gifting system your invites are going to get choked off. Take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=43016202276"&gt;Restaurant City&lt;/a&gt;, which is maybe the most engaging game ever launched on the platform. It‚Äôs also a great platform citizen, attempting to get new users largely by making a game so engaging people want to tell their friends about it, rather than by giving them large rewards for spamming friends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurant City‚Äôs invites per day are down to 12 and it‚Äôs a Verified App. Being Verified means it gets boosted 2 buckets in the allocations. To put that another way, if it were not Verified it would be getting 6 per day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroll down through the top games on the Facebook platform and install them all, as I have, and you‚Äôll see a trend appear very quickly. Almost all of them dump you immediately onto a gifts page every time you log in. This is no coincidence. It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the only way to keep reasonable allocations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is simple: only count requests sent to someone for the first time when determining the median. Or better yet, switch to a better metric entirely like engagement. Facebook knows how much time my users spend on my apps (or at least they could if they so desired). Why not base my allocations on that rather than forcing me to beg my customers to send a dozen gifts with every login?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote 90% of this post over a month ago, and was prompted to write it today by the fact that the platform is &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/28/d-day-for-facebook-app-developers/"&gt;probably changing&lt;/a&gt; in about an hour and a half. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm somewhat dreading it. It‚Äôs been a long time since Facebook made a change that made me think more highly about developing on their platform, and with each knock to developers‚Äô allocations they‚Äôre going to push more and more people off. I worry that if trends continue, at some point we‚Äôll be left with just Playfish making new games and Zynga cloning them and then marketing them to the top. Our new game on Facebook is doing very well, and we‚Äôre already thinking about how to parlay that into a standalone web success. I know we‚Äôre not the only app developers thinking along those lines these days, and Facebook should take that seriously, if for no other reason than to give Zynga someone‚Äôs games to copy.&lt;/p&gt;

High fertility and religion often goes together, and whenever this topic comes up the immediate question is: will the religious inexorably &amp;#39;out-breed&amp;#39; the nonreligious?The answer to that rather depends on how religion (or lack of it) is transmitted through the generations. Luckily enough, there&amp;#39;s just been a very nice study on this by Vern Bengston, Professor of Sociology at the University of Southern California.Bengston and colleagues analysed data from the Longitudinal Study of Generations, which has been following over 3000 Californians for over 30 years. They now have over 4 generations in their database.In 1971, the first year of the study, they surveyed three generations: grandparents (generation 1), parents (generation 2), and children (generation 3). In the paper, they also looked at data from 2001, by which time generation 2 had become grandparents, generation 3 had become parents, and a new generation, generation 4, had arrived on the scene (generation1 seem to have disappeared !).Over that time, religious affiliation plummeted. In 1971, only 5% of generation 2 (parents) said they were unaffiliated. By 2001, 33% of this same generation were unaffiliated. In generation 4, the non-affiliated rate was 37%.But what about religious beliefs? In each survey, they asked people how religoius they were (on a 1-4 scale), and also a number of questions related to how traditional/literal their religious views were.The results are shown in the first figure (you can click on it for a bigger version). The symbols on the left represent the various generations in 1971, and on the right the generations in 2001. Lines connect generations that appear in both surveys.On the whole, people who were surveyed both times haven&amp;#39;t changed much. Mothers and fathers in 1971 are less religious in 2000, and  daughters (but less so sons) are more religious.But the major difference is generational. Grandparents in 2000 are less religious than grandparents in 1971. Parents now are less religious than parents then. And the new generation (generation4) is least religious of all.Now, they don&amp;#39;t give any information on how many children the religious participants had compared with the non-religious, but it&amp;#39;s probably safe to assume that they had more.So, with each generation, the religious have more offspring. And yet their numbers decrease!This paradox is, of course, easily explained. Although there is a small genetic component that predisposes to agnosticism and atheism, they are in fact social phenomena. Irreligion is not inherited. It&amp;#39;s learned.This can be seen most clearly with conservative religious beliefs. Twin studies consistently show that this is the component of religion with the largest genetic component. What&amp;#39;s more, conservative Christians have the highest birth rates. Even so, conservative religious beliefs have collapsed with the passing of older generations.Religion, even conservative religion, is not a gene to be inherited, it&amp;#39;s a meme to be transmitted.The study had another tidbit of information, and that&amp;#39;s about how much influence grandparents have over their grandchildren&amp;#39;s religiosity. The answer: not a lot.What we&amp;#39;re looking at in this graph is the correlation between the religion of the grandparents and that of the grandchildren, after adjusting for the religion of the parents. So this is the direct effect of grandparents, not the indirect effect (via their children and then on to their grandchildren).In 2001, grandmothers had a little bit of influence over the religion of their granddaughters. That was particularly true for conservative religious beliefs.But nobody listened to their grandfathers, and grandsons didn&amp;#39;t pay much attention to their grandmothers.What&amp;#39;s surprising is how this has changed from 1971. I haven&amp;#39;t done a graph for these data, but basically in 1971 grandparents influenced their grandchildrens church attendance, but less so their beliefs - and they had absolutely no effect over their conservative religious beliefs.In other words the role of grandparents in transmitting religion has changed completely in the past 30 years - more evidence that the nature of religion in society is changing.But there&amp;#39;s a bigger message here, and that&amp;#39;s the magnitude of the influence. Even when it comes to grandmothers and their granddaughter&amp;#39;s religiousness, the strongest link, the effect is very weak.And what this means is that the transmission of religion can be very rapid. The world of our grandparents is already ancient history - at least as far as attitudes and beliefs go.____________________________________________________________________Bengtson, V., Copen, C., Putney, N., &amp;amp; Silverstein, M.

Ask yourself, how many cultural productions (films, stories, songs, dances, arts) do not have love, the loss of love or the absence of love as their central theme?  Would you be satisfied with what was left over?  That fact that love has so much power over us is just one reason why evolutionary research is so fascinating.

A well-worn trope of human culture is mens obsession with female infidelity.  Othello.  Madame Bovary.  Desperate Housewives.  These are just three Western examples of this concern that are paralleled in nearly every society throughout time.  Such powerful and universal human emotions suggest a biological commonality that can be revealed through a scientific lens.

Currency in the United States features revered presidents and revolutionary war heroes. Yet, staring back at me on another country‚Äôs official currency was a man reviled by a large section of the American public: Charles Darwin. Given the anti-intellectualism prevalent in America it is difficult to imagine any scientist being given such a place of honour let alone the controversial Darwin.&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sui2ap1TKZI/AAAAAAAAAJI/UR0_FmO_6Hk/s1600-h/tenner.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:right;width:320px;height:161px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sui2ap1TKZI/AAAAAAAAAJI/UR0_FmO_6Hk/s320/tenner.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But, in the United Kingdom Darwin is considered a national hero. This year is his 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species and you could not have thrown a stone in the United Kingdom without hitting a Darwin celebratory event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had the pleasure of recently seeing a new dramatic film about Darwin called Creation. The theater was packed and not just with the traditional art house cinema crowd. People of all ages and backgrounds were there to see a film depicting Darwin‚Äôs struggle with his religious belief. The film does a good job showing how Darwin‚Äôs religious views were not only shaped by his scientific discoveries but also by his grief over the death of his eldest daughter. This Darwin struggles with the concept of a caring God in &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sui2_J6VNZI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/ll7MlNpBcjE/s1600-h/CreationMoviePoster.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:320px;height:230px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sui2_J6VNZI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/ll7MlNpBcjE/s320/CreationMoviePoster.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a world based on randomness. With such a sympathetic depiction of Darwin and a view of evolutionary thought as truth it is not surprising the film had a difficult time finding a U.S. distributor. Not only were distributors afraid of poor box office returns, they were also worried about potential boycotts from religious groups for their other films.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Distributors‚Äô concerns about Creation‚Äôs marketability are not surprising when we examine the history of cinema in regard to depicting Darwin and evolution. In my academic work I have followed the evolution of how Darwin and evolutionary thought have been depicted in cinema. Darwin‚Äôs demonstration of humanity‚Äôs link to its primate past was first played for comedic purposes in films of the early twentieth century. Films such as Reversing Darwin‚Äôs Theory (1908), The Monkey Man (1908), and Darwin Was Right (1924) poked fun at those who took Darwin‚Äôs evolutionary claims seriously. People who believe they are descended from apes will act like apes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sui4nFjOWXI/AAAAAAAAAJY/Vr3t4_zPCl0/s1600-h/image002.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:right;width:320px;height:256px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sui4nFjOWXI/AAAAAAAAAJY/Vr3t4_zPCl0/s320/image002.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After the highly publicized Scopes Monkey trial in 1925 the notion of a human/primate connection changed from one of comedy to one of horror in cinema. Several post-Scopes films, beginning with The Wizard in 1927, feature ‚Äúmad evolutionist‚Äù characters who design evil experiments in order to prove their ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù evolutionary theories about humanity‚Äôs connection to the animal world. Likewise, the goal of the mad evolutionists in The Beast of Borneo (1934) and Dr. Renault‚Äôs Secret (1942) is to prove humanity‚Äôs link to the animal kingdom. In front of a chart detailing the evolutionary ‚Äúladder of life,‚Äù the mad evolutionist Dr. Mirakle (played by Bela Lugosi) from Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932) informs an unbelieving carnival audience that ‚Äúthe shadow of the ape hangs over us all‚Äù and that he will mix human and gorilla blood to ‚Äúprove Man‚Äôs connection with the ape.‚Äù While this evolutionary-minded scientist is ultimately punished for his heretical conceptions, the film actually conveys the human/primate connection through Mirakle‚Äôs grotesque appearance and his clearly ‚Äúanimalistic‚Äù actions. In mad evolutionist films, the only human beings with a clear connection to primates are the evolution spouting evil scientists and their simian-like assistants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the comeuppance these mad evolutionists received for their beliefs, many of these films actually ran afoul of censors for their inclusion of evolution and Darwinism. The 1922 Lon Chaney, Sr., film A Blind Bargain was re-cut after test audiences found the movie too favourably disposed to Darwin and evolution. This included changing the original book the mad scientist uses to reach his secret lair from Origin of the Species[I1]  to a less controversial tome. Murders in the Rue Morgue was not shown or was severely edited in several states because some censor boards objected to the theme of ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs descent from the Apes.‚Äù&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sui5jPXIfqI/AAAAAAAAAJg/DljRnr8TH_c/s1600-h/dr-renault-secret-aff.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:228px;height:320px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sui5jPXIfqI/AAAAAAAAAJg/DljRnr8TH_c/s320/dr-renault-secret-aff.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A large number of films featuring Darwinian themes fell victim to the notorious ‚ÄúHays Code‚Äù of the Production Code Administration (PCA) Office when it went into effect in the 1930s. The code was established in large part due to the lobbying of religious organizations that were unhappy with the level of violence, sexual innuendo, and amoral themes in films. For example, filmmakers had to remove any reference to Darwin from the horror film Dr. Renault‚Äôs Secret to avoid offending religious people. The PCA‚Äôs judgment on the film reads: ‚ÄúThe story is based on theories of human origin in such a way that, if presented to the public, will undoubtedly offend the sensibilities of large groups of religious people of different faiths, and accordingly, could not be approved under the provisions of the code.‚Äù Of course, such a judgment would have killed the film‚Äôs commercial value so after consultation with the executive producers and the studio executives: ‚ÄúIt was agreed to eliminate any reference to Darwin or to his theory, and to establish the ape as a throwback.‚Äù&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the treatment of Darwinian thought in these horror films it is not surprising that Creation faces an uphill battle in American theatres. Which is unfortunate given how well the film depicts Darwin‚Äôs conflict with his wife over faith, his struggles concerning his theory‚Äôs moral implications, and his disagreements with his colleagues (especially T.H. Huxley). Most importantly, the film humanizes Darwin through his grief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/BREvUKpZTeU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-7995941807986935803?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been a little fun with Rebecca out on her world tour and away from the helm. We have all been blogging without pants on and swapping AI responsibilities like we were &lt;img src="http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/4059/rebecca11small.jpg" alt="Rebecca Watson" width="213" height="320"&gt;playing hot potato and there has been no one around to tell us to get back to work or to use ‚Äúproper‚Äù punctuation or to stay on topic‚Ä¶ oh look a homeopathic rainbow! Uh, sorry where was I? Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the getting drunk while blogging, there has been a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of that too! No‚Ä¶ wait a minute‚Ä¶ actually, there has been NONE of that! There have been NO drunk skype conference calls either! What the heck am I even talking about? Now that I think about it, it‚Äôs been really quiet and boring and rather sad without our skeptical queen and we really miss her! *sniffle*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figure now would be a really great time to put on pants, grab a martini and post some lovely photos I took of our fearless leader! I even managed to track her down for an interview. Hope it helps you get to know Rebecca a tiny bit better and I hope it fills that tiny void that her temporary absence has left! Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/9489/rebecca3small.jpg" alt="Rebecca Watson" width="320" height="213"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What first got you interested in skepticism and what inspired you to create Skepchick.org?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a juggler and magician since high school, and was a big fan of Penn &amp;amp; Teller, who turned me onto James Randi. I started reading Randi‚Äôs Swift updates on &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/"&gt;randi.org&lt;/a&gt;, then joined the forum. That‚Äôs where I discovered that skeptics were forming a strong community. Skepchick.org came about as a response to the lack of female-focused skeptical sites. It started as just a place we could advertise the Skepchick calendars, but the response was so overwhelming that I figured it should offer regular content. A monthly magazine gave way to a daily blog, which morphed into a multi-writer blog to keep up with growing numbers of readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. How do you find and choose your official Skepchicks?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src="http://img503.imageshack.us/img503/5430/rebecca6small.jpg" alt="Rebecca Watson" width="213" height="320"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few were friends who I knew were great writers. When we needed more writers, I put out a call for help and got tons of great responses from women who wanted to contribute. I chose a diverse group of various ages, locations, and experiences, but making sure that they all sounded like people I could imagine partying with. Partying is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What one skeptical topic do you wish there was evidence for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secret. I still want that cupcake-shitting unicorn I‚Äôve been wishing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Now that you‚Äôre married, are you happy with your decision to ‚Äúsave yourself‚Äù for your husband?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src="http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/5905/rebecca9small.jpg" alt="Rebecca Watson" width="213" height="320"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and I was so pleased with that decision that I decided to continue to ‚Äúsave myself‚Äù for a second marriage. You can never be too careful. Sid supports my decision, as does Yvette, the live-in au pair he hired soon after I told him of my choice. Which is weird because we won‚Äôt ever have any kids, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. What is the craziest thing you have had to research in the name of skepticism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anything I‚Äôve researched that‚Äôs not crazy? I mean, really. This is like picking the stupidest Pussycat Doll (the redhead). I‚Äôll go with Scientology. That shit is so crazy it makes me look crazy when I explain it to people who just think it‚Äôs a religion. ‚ÄúNo, seriously, they tried to infiltrate the government and steal secret documents and blackmail the IRS. No seriously they tried to get a journalist committed to a mental institution. No, seriously. SERIOUSLY.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/9635/rebecca10small.jpg" alt="Rebecca Watson" width="213" height="320"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;6. The phone rings. It‚Äôs Deepak Choprah. He says he is in London for a few days and would like to stop by for a few drinks with you and Sid and while he‚Äôs there he would absolutely love to balance your dosha free of charge. What do you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree, in an instant. My dosha has been out of balance for weeks now and it‚Äôs giving me a headache. And, free of charge? That amount of hilarity would be priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. What one podcast and what one book would you recommend to readers who are interested in learning more about science and or skepticism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs almost cliche at this point but everyone should read Sagan‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World"&gt;Demon-haunted World&lt;/a&gt;. For a general intro, it cannot be beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously everyone should be listening to &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;The Skeptics‚Äô Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/"&gt;Radio Lab&lt;/a&gt; is the only real sciencey or skeptical podcast I listen to on a regular basis, which maybe makes me a horrible skeptic but hey, I‚Äôm a busy chick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. How do you like London?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src="http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/7664/rebecca1small.jpg" alt="Rebecca Watson" width="320" height="213"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love it! I miss Boston but it‚Äôs hard not to be happy now that I live in the same time zone as my husband. Also, at the pub last night the bartender complimented me on a lovely accent, which does not get old. In Boston, I had to affect my masterful cockney accent to get a comment like that. ‚ÄúOi guv‚Äônuh, clean your chimbleys?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. When are you and Sid moving to Los Angeles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime next Smarch. See you then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/8208/rebecca7small.jpg" alt="Rebecca Watson" width="213" height="320"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;10. On Skepchick Island who would you recommend for the very important position of head of security?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I‚Äôd make A head of security. You do not eff with that woman. You just don‚Äôt. She will end you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. When are we getting our island?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smarch after next!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as soon as a rich benefactor gives us one. Bill Gates, I know you‚Äôre reading this. I KNOW YOU HAVE A GOOGLE ALERT ON YOUR NAME.&lt;/p&gt;

He was coauthor with Paul Gross of the 1994 book &lt;em&gt;Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science&lt;/em&gt; (the book which first called BS on the more ridiculous assertions of the postmodernist/social constructivist critique of science).  &lt;em&gt;Higher Superstition&lt;/em&gt; so annoyed the mandarins of science studies that they assembled &lt;a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0164-2472%28199621%2F22%290%3A46%2F47%3C%3E1.0.CO%3B2-I" rel="external "&gt;a special issue of the journal &lt;em&gt;Social Text&lt;/em&gt; to rebut it&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately for them, that issue contained &lt;a href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/" rel="external "&gt;Sokal‚Äôs famous parody article&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì Sokal had been inspired by Levitt &amp;amp; Gross ‚Äì and the revelation of the hoax effectively deflated the community of academics who advocated strongly relativist views of science.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 1996, Steve Fuller ‚Äì that‚Äôs Steve ‚Äúaffirmative action for intelligent design‚Äù Fuller, for those of you who followed the &lt;em&gt;Kitzmiller&lt;/em&gt; case ‚Äì wrote one of the ‚Äúserious‚Äù articles in &lt;em&gt;Social Text&lt;/em&gt;, and, I learned today, apparently also read Sokal‚Äôs article when it was submitted, somehow without catching the obvious signs of parody.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others in the science-studies movement took the critiques with some sense of humor and humility and made some adjustments ‚Äì notably, Bruno Latour has admitted that the tools of science-critique were very easily turned &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; progressive causes like environmentalism, and that science studies had to admit that science had some actual solidity in comparison to your run-of-the mill social phenomenon (see his ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/articles/article/089.html" rel="external "&gt;Why Has Critique Run out of Steam?&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù, 2004)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not Fuller. Apparently, Fuller has hated Levitt ever since the beginning of the ‚ÄúScience Wars.‚Äù  And now that Levitt is safely dead, &lt;a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/swfuller/entry/norman_levitt_rip/" rel="external "&gt;Fuller is calling Levitt a fascist&lt;/a&gt;.  And comparing postmodernists to the Jews, and their critics to anti-Semites‚Ä¶presumably fascist anti-Semites (gee, I wonder who they could be).  It‚Äôs really a piece of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never mind that Levitt was not just a liberal, but a straight-up socialist.  We all know how popular that position is in the U.S. these days.  Oh, and his memorial service on Nov. 1 will be at the Plaza Jewish Community Chapel in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who think that Levitt‚Äôs passing should be treated with a bit more class, I &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/10/27/farewell-to-norman-levitt/" rel="external "&gt;note this in the announcement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is with much sadness that we report the death of Norman Jay Levitt on Saturday, October 24, 2009, due to heart failure. His wife of 38 years, Renee Greene Levitt, reported the news to friends and colleagues of Norman, and announced that a memorial service will be held on Sunday, November 1 at 1:30 PM at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue at 91 St. She also asked that in lieu of flowers, memorial contributions be sent to the National Center for Science Education, 420 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Street, Suite 2, Oakland, CA 94609.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have achieved a ton of media attention.  A few have slipped under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I wondered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How much stronger would &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the various publicity campaigns for atheism have been if all the ads had appeared during the same week?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be difficult to coordinate such a massive campaign ‚Äî you‚Äôd have to get the money, the advertisers, and possibly the various local groups in coalition all around the same time.  But it is somewhat realistic.  Advertisers do it all the time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think there‚Äôs anything to be gained by doing all these campaigns one after another instead of all at once?&lt;br&gt;

"Thousands of Americans--hardworking ordinary Americans like you and me--already have H1N1," Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said during a press conference. "Now Obama wants to take that away from us. Ask yourself: Do you want the federal government making these kinds of health care decisions for you and your family?" Other prominent Republicans opposing Obama's declaration of emergency include Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, who urged residents of his state to continue not washing their hands, and radio host Rush Limbaugh, who made a point of dying of the virus during his show on Wednesday.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is thought to occur because the brain&amp;#39;s model of the body (referred to as the body image) still contains a representation of the limb, and this leads to the experience that their missing limb is still attached to their body. Occasionally, amputees say that they cannot move their phantom limbs. They are perceived to be frozen in space, apparently because they cannot be seen.

Yet, research shows that the body image is malleable and easily manipulated. And according to new research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, so too are phantom limbs. The study shows that some amputees can make their phantom limbs defy the anatomical constraints of the physical body, using visual imagery to make them perform movements which could not possibly be performed by a real physical limb.¬†¬†

So far, &amp;quot;reporters&amp;quot; were those genes coding for an easily detectable product (i.e., those coding for fluorescent or luminescent proteins). Wei Min and other Harvard&amp;#39;s colleagues introduced a new technique, namely stimulated emission microscopy, that seems able to turn into mini-lasers any non-fluorescent light-absorbing molecule. It means that several chromophores, such as haemoglobin and cytochromes, can now be directly detected through a new contrast mechanism for optical microscopy which is orders of magnitude more sensitive than absorption, is not subject to interference from other chromophores in the sample, and is amenable to three-dimensional sectioning. This open the race to the intelligent design of new chromo-reporters able to produce images of unlabelled, non-fluorescent molecules at sub-diffraction (nanoscale) resolution. Seeing is believing. The potential to kill the field of reporters is easily explained: who ever need a &amp;quot;reporter&amp;quot; when you can spy in a cell the whole bunch of molecular processes with resolutions at googlemeter per googlesecond?Min, W., Lu, S., Chong, S., Roy, R., Holtom, G., &amp;amp; Xie, X.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4583"&gt;The Fermi Haze: A Gamma-Ray Counterpart to the Microwave Haze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Authors: Gregory Dobler, Douglas P. Finkbeiner, Ilias Cholis, Tracy R. Slatyer, Neal Weiner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Abstract: The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveals a diffuse inverse Compton signal in the inner Galaxy with the same spatial morphology as the microwave haze observed by WMAP, confirming the synchrotron origin of the microwaves. Using spatial templates, we regress out pi0 gammas, as well as ICS and bremsstrahlung components associated with known soft-synchrotron counterparts. We find a significant gamma-ray excess towards the Galactic center with a spectrum that is significantly harder than other sky components and is most consistent with ICS from a hard population of electrons. The morphology and spectrum are consistent with it being the ICS counterpart to the electrons which generate the microwave haze seen at WMAP frequencies. In addition to confirming that the microwave haze is indeed synchrotron, the distinct spatial morphology and very hard spectrum of the ICS are evidence that the electrons responsible for the microwave and gamma-ray haze originate from a harder source than supernova shocks. We describe the full sky Fermi maps used in this analysis and make them available for download. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English:  if the dark matter is a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), individual WIMPs should occsasionally annihilate with other WIMPs, giving off a bunch of particles, including electron/positron pairs as well as high-energy photons (gamma rays).  Indeed, searching for such gamma rays was one of the primary motivations behind the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/05/04/fermi-waffles-on-dark-matter/"&gt;Fermi&lt;/a&gt; mission (formerly GLAST).  And it makes sense to look where the dark matter is most dense, in the center of the galaxy.  But it‚Äôs a very hard problem, for a simple reason ‚Äî there‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of radiation coming from the center of the galaxy, most of which has nothing to do with dark matter.  Subtracting off these ‚Äúbackgrounds‚Äù (which would be very interesting in their own right to galactic astronomers) is the name of the game in this business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Doug Finkbeiner at Harvard has for a while now been suggesting that there was already evidence for something interesting going on near the galactic center ‚Äî not in the form of high-energy photons, but in the form of low-energy photons.  The so-called &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/08/28/seeing-the-sky-with-different-eyes/"&gt;WMAP haze&lt;/a&gt; is alleged to be radiation emitted when high-energy electrons are being accelerated by magnetic fields, leading to low-energy photons (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron_radiation"&gt;synchrotron&lt;/a&gt; radiation).  And Finkbeiner and collaborators &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3655"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; that a careful analysis of data from WMAP (whose primary mission was to observe the cosmic microwave background) reveals exactly the kind of radiation you would expect from annihilations near the galactic center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that model is right, it gives us some guidance about what to look for in the gamma rays themselves, which Fermi is now observing.  And according to this new paper, this is what we see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4583"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/10/fermi-haze.jpg" alt="Excess gamma rays from the galactic center, from Dobler et al." title="fermi-haze" width="481" height="271" align="center"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs one of many images, and has been extensively processed; see &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4583"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; for details.  The new paper claims that there is an excess of gamma rays, and that it has just the right properties to be arising from the same population of electrons that gave rise to the WMAP haze.  These much higher-energy photons arise from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering"&gt;inverse Compton scattering&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî electrons bumping into photons and pushing them to higher energies ‚Äî rather than synchrotron emission.  So we‚Äôre not talking about gammas that are produced by dark-matter annihilations, but ones that might arise from electrons and positrons that are produced by such annihilations. The authors pointedly do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; claim that what we see must arise from dark matter, or even delve very deeply into that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been speculations that the microwave haze could indicate new physics, such as the decay or annihilation of dark matter, or new astrophysics. We do not speculate in this paper on the origin of the haze electrons, other than to make the general observation that the roughly spherical morphology of the haze makes it difficult to explain with any population of disk objects, such as pulsars. The search for new physics ‚Äì or an improved understanding of conventional astrophysics ‚Äì will be the topic of future work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs as it should be; whether or not the gamma-ray haze is real is a separate question from whether dark matter is the culprit.  But on a blog we can speculate just a bit.  Therefore I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say:  maybe it is!  Or maybe not.  But a wide variety of promising experimental techniques are attacking the problem of detecting the dark matter, and we‚Äôll be hearing a lot more in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256760992153"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_get_email_45.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9445f899b6295f55</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">I get email</title><published>2009-10-28T20:12:29Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T20:12:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/EOT7fpvy5FY/i_get_email_45.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/i_get_email_45.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's rather pathetic when banned loons like "help ma boab" come crawling back, begging to be released from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/plonk.php"&gt;the dungeon&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶especially when their apologies are this insincere.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; San Francisco Assemblyman Tom Ammiano had sponsored  a bill which passed unanimously granting the Port of San Francisco  financial power to redevelop a former shipyard for a new neighborhood  known as Pier 70.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; Ammiano also had made something of a scene at a Democratic Party  fundraiser early this month in San Francisco at which Schwarzenegger, a  Republican, had been invited by former San Francisco mayor and Assembly  speaker Willie Brown, a Democrat. This surprised many, in light of the  heated budget wars between the governor and legislature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Ammiano could be heard invoking the cry of Republican South Carolina&amp;#39;s  Rep. Joe Wilson at President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s address to a joint session  of Congress - &amp;quot;You lie&amp;quot; - as others heckled Schwarzenegger&amp;#39;s brief  speech. After the governor left, Ammiano took the stage with a rambling  criticism of Schwarzenegger for a variety of offenses ‚Äî among them the  governor&amp;#39;s vetoes of bills that would have legalized gay marriage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;When the governor's office delivered a veto-message for Ammiano's  own port bill a few days later, on Oct. 12, there appeared to be an  unmistakable hidden message within: Reading the first letter of each  line of the letter's two main paragraphs:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://gov.ca.gov/pdf/press/2009bills/AB1176_Ammiano_Veto_Message.pdf"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2009/10/28/veto%20message.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"My goodness. What a coincidence," a shocked, shocked  Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear is quoted by the Associated Press  as saying. "I suppose when you do so many vetoes, something like this  is bound to happen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some back-of-the-envelope calculations of probability, I'm sure we could set about refuting McLear's disingenuous response that the acrostic is merely a "coincidence." Scholars of Shakespeare have argued whether the following acrostic in &lt;em&gt;A Midsummer's Night Dream&lt;/em&gt;, in which the character Titania spells out her own name, could have appeared by chance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;hou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; am a spirit of no common rate,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;he summer till doth tend upon my state;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;AN&lt;/strong&gt;d I do love thee. Therefore go with me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;'ll give thee fairies to attend on thee;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;nd they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep‚Ä¶&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think in this case it's pretty clear that we're dealing with intentionally mischievous acrostic-making in the Governor's office. It reads very smoothly, so kudos to the writer of the veto message. Could it have been Ahnold himself? Doubtful, although he might have told someone in his office to construct the acrostic. (I wonder if whoever did it also leaked the story to reveal his or her handiwork.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos too to Mark Silva of The Swamp, for coming up with a novel taboo avoidance strategy in his headline, "&lt;a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2009/10/schwarzenegger_veto_you.html"&gt;Schwarzenegger to foe: (Veto) 'you'&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256759892959"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=3090">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f4af534ee57928d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">How to Go After Dark Energy?</title><published>2009-10-28T19:42:58Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T19:42:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/10/28/how-to-go-after-dark-energy/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs well known that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/12/10/a-dark-misleading-force/"&gt;dark energy&lt;/a&gt; is a mystery ‚Äî both for scientists, and apparently for funding agencies who are trying to figure out how best to learn more about this stuff that makes up about 73% of the energy of the universe.  I haven‚Äôt been paying close attention to the ins-and-outs of this saga (there are more rewarding ways to give yourself an ulcer), but &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/09/05/national-academy-dark-energy-first-maybe-lisa-second/"&gt;last I had heard&lt;/a&gt; the National Academy of Sciences had given very high priority to a satellite observatory meant to pin down the properties of dark energy.  This was the JDEM idea ‚Äî Joint Dark Energy Mission, where ‚Äújoint‚Äù indicates a partnership between NASA and the Department of Energy.  (They don‚Äôt always play well together, but the Fermi satellite is a notable recent success.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, via &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/dvergano/status/5205573868"&gt;Dan Vergano‚Äôs Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;, I see &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091027/full/4611182a.html?s=news_rss"&gt;a story in Nature News&lt;/a&gt; to the effect that things have become murky once again.  The proposals got too expensive, so NASA turned to the European Space Agency for help, but ended up giving away things the DOE thought were in their domain, so they threatened to &lt;a href="http://bigboss.lbl.gov/"&gt;take their toys and go home&lt;/a&gt;, giving up on the idea of a satellite altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is complicated by &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/04/19/dark-energy-fundamentalism-simon-white-lays-the-smackdown/"&gt;disagreement&lt;/a&gt; over how important it is to measure the dark energy &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2005/07/21/dont-be-fooled-by-w/"&gt;equation-of-state parameter&lt;/a&gt;, the number characterizing how quickly the energy density changes (if at all).  It‚Äôs frequently said that ‚Äúwe know nothing‚Äù about dark energy, but that‚Äôs not true; we know that it‚Äôs smoothly distributed and nearly-constant in density through time.  We even have a very natural candidate for what it is: the vacuum energy.  There is of course the problem that the vacuum energy is much smaller than it should be, but that problem is there whether it‚Äôs strictly zero or just really small.  Other models still have that problem, and tend to add other fine-tunings on top.  It would be great, and we would certainly learn a lot, if the dark energy were not simply vacuum energy; but right now we have no compelling reason to think it‚Äôs not, so it‚Äôs a bit of a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256759481037"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-96088503557170302.post-1339241034019838068">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb70ca62ee092c2b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">MHRA cause Boots to remove homeopathic product and update website</title><published>2009-10-28T17:50:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T17:50:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/10/mhra-force-boots-to-remove-homeopathic.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256759205392"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2379">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f6f8510d4177b8e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics and Regulation"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Join CFI in opposing funding mandates for quackery in health care reform</title><published>2009-10-28T19:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T19:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2379" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2196"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; warning about how funding for non-science-based modalities and, indeed, modalities that are purely religion-based, have found their way into various versions of health care reform bills that are currently wending their way through both houses of Congress. In other words, purveyors of faith healing and purely religious woo are trying to do what purveyors of ‚Äúalternative‚Äù medicine have already done through Senator Tom Harkin, and hijack the health care reform process to codify their preferred unscientific health care modalities as legitimate after science has rejected them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net"&gt;Center for Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; has launched a campaign to inform and educate our legislators. You can participate by using its talking points (or paraphrasing them or voicing your own objections) to &lt;a href="http://ga1.org/campaign/Med/explanation"&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress is considering health care legislation that would in part mandate coverage of non-evidenced based medical treatments such as prayer and therapeutic touch. This would raise the cost of health care for all Americans and represent a violation of the principle of separation of church and state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFI continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Center for Inquiry asks you to contact your Senators and Representative to voice your strong opposition to the proposal in the Heath Care bills that would mandate coverage of non evidence-based ‚Äúalternative‚Äù medical treatments including spiritual and prayer based healing under the guise of nondiscrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;America needs a health care system that focuses on increasing the health of individuals and reducing the cost of coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This type of health care system is not possible if insurers are required to pay for medical treatments with questionable at best results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Congress requires that insurers cover alternative treatments such as Christian Science prayer, therapeutic touch, or other non-evidence based medical procedures, the cost of health care for all Americans will go up. This runs counter to the goal that Congress has laid out: to make health care more affordable for all Americans. ‚Äì If the final version of health care reform includes a public option, this mandate would also force the public insurance plan to cover these treatments. Because the public option is federally funded, the inclusion of the mandate would represent an egregious violation of the principle of separation of church and state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree. It‚Äôs time to try to stop the insertion of faith-based quackery like Christian Science ‚Äúprayer‚Äù treatments as reimbursable medical expenses in whatever health care reform bill(s) is/are passed by Congress. You can help by going &lt;a href="http://ga1.org/campaign/Med"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and writing to your Congressional representatives and Senators.&lt;/p&gt;

Ron Hubbard‚Äôs &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;death&lt;/span&gt; discarding his body because his ‚Äúresearch‚Äù was done, and a description (4:55, video 1) of how Miscavige had a Scientology jacket made for his beagle (complete with epaulets and stripes of rank), forcing other Scientologists to salute the uniformed dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/features/view/feature/Nightlines-Scientology-Scuffle-259"&gt;online AtlanticWire piece&lt;/a&gt; describes the bizarre end of the taping, which, sadly, doesn‚Äôt appear on these videos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . on Friday, the dynamic was reversed. It was ABC Nightline reporter Martin Bashir who started it, hounding [Scientology spokesman Tommy] Davis with the question: ‚ÄúDo you believe that a galactic emperor called Xenu brought his people to earth 75 million years ago and buried them in volcanoes?‚Äù When Bashir persisted, Davis yanked his microphone and stormed off the set. Since then, Davis has apparently returned to ABC headquarters in New York when the interview was about to be aired, presumably to halt the program, and was sent packing by network security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/28/nightline-piece-on-scientology/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/GYGX-nM5vBM/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:¬† You can now see the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenu"&gt;Xenu&lt;/a&gt; part! It turns out that ABC news did another part of this piece on Oct. 24.¬† There are &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4jBz00VuzE&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;five more parts&lt;/a&gt; available on YouTube, but check out this piece.¬† The trouble with Xenu begins at about 2:45. Watch Tommy Davis squirm and stonewall when Lord Xenu is brought up, and then stalk off the set.&lt;/p&gt;

A study out today in Biology Letters shows that global warming will likely drive several species of primates closer to extinction by increasing the severity and frequency of El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a events (the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, ENSO).

(I hate it when I forget to cache a website that's being complained about. Never mind...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a complaint from this site, the MHRA contacted Boots and instructed them to change their website, using only the phrase &lt;blockquote&gt;Nelsons Sulphur 30c Pillules is a homeopathic medicinal product without approved therapeutic indications&lt;/blockquote&gt; according to the current legislation. Boots have since &lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Nelsons-Sulphur-30c-84-Pillules_923406/"&gt;removed the product completely&lt;/a&gt;, however the &lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/wcsstore/cmsassets/Boots/Content/Products/Homoeopathy%20-%20CAT:%20A00000517/10008234.P/add_leaf.pdf"&gt;Patient Guide to Homeopathy &lt;/a&gt;is still on the website. MHRA are now aware of this and so hopefully it too will disappear soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not that it matters really, because Holland &amp;amp; Barrett are selling Nelson&amp;#39;s Sulphur 30c pillules, complete with therapeutic indications, and completely contravening the law (original link to website &lt;a href="http://www.hollandandbarrett.com/pages/product_detail.asp?pid=932"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The MHRA are now aware, and the offending site can be seen here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XSCXYE5_zNo/SuiImnGn8mI/AAAAAAAAAI0/qkQKi_4BDaA/s1600-h/holland.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;width:400px;height:194px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XSCXYE5_zNo/SuiImnGn8mI/AAAAAAAAAI0/qkQKi_4BDaA/s400/holland.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Indeed, even Nelson's own site (original site &lt;a href="http://www.nelsonsnaturalworld.com/en-gb/uk/our-brands/nelsons-pure-clear/products/sulphur-30c/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) deems itself above the law by claiming that the product is "known by homeopaths for its many skin benefits" which is woolly wording in my book, but we'll see what the MHRA do.&lt;br&gt;(Nelson's also promote the product with therapeutic indications on their Nelson's Homeopathy page &lt;a href="http://www.nelsonshomeopathy.com/shop-online/Nelsons-Sulphur-30c_prod1761.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XSCXYE5_zNo/SuiIyYXOPrI/AAAAAAAAAI8/EmHhv3SVBCM/s1600-h/nelson.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;width:400px;height:222px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XSCXYE5_zNo/SuiIyYXOPrI/AAAAAAAAAI8/EmHhv3SVBCM/s400/nelson.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fastest.Blogpost.Ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-1339241034019838068?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256753512321"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=20695">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/35caa91510f77eb2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="taxes"/><title type="html">A Defense of Irrational Taxation?</title><published>2009-10-28T17:23:37Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T17:23:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/LgzjG997kB8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/a-defense-of-irrational-taxation/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Here's a behavioral puzzler: Why might it be more efficient for Connecticut to change its sales tax rate from 6 percent to e^2 percent ?

 

Or more generally, why might using irrational numbers as tax rates be less distortionary than rational tax rates?

A hint comes from a great article of &lt;strong&gt;Amy Finkelstein&lt;/strong&gt;, "E-ZTax: Tax Salience and Tax Rates." Her simple and powerful idea is that as the salience of tax rates declines, taxes will produce fewer distortions because taxpayers will not pay as much attention to the taxes.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/LgzjG997kB8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By Ian Ayres</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics ¬ª Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256753109294"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/fox_news_anchor_will_not_put_u.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f9023d74105bb29a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Republicans"/><title type="html">Fox News Anchor will Not Put Up with Being Disagreed With!!!11!!</title><published>2009-10-28T18:49:07Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T18:49:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/2WAKWfCk4_I/fox_news_anchor_will_not_put_u.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/fox_news_anchor_will_not_put_u.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was originally just going to point to this but it is so intense that I felt I just needed to have it on my site.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The New Humanism&lt;/em&gt; is an online magazine meant to explore and help pioneer new ways of bringing Humanists, atheists, agnostics and the nonreligious together to build a movement that can make a lasting and far-reaching positive impact. In short, we are interested in anything that is good, without God.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the concept, though I‚Äôm not yet convinced it‚Äôs a mindset that a lot of atheists will want to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A look at a few of the articles and I feel like they‚Äôre just setting themselves up for a backlash from the more vocal non-theists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenewhumanism.org/authors/zach-alexander/articles/still-atheists-run-deep"&gt;Why More Humanists Should Meditate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since June, we‚Äôve met about twice a month on Saturday mornings at the Harvard Science Center. After introductions and personal check-ins, we meditate for about half an hour, and then talk about what the experience was like, and what we think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre walking a fine line here, trying to appropriate practices associated with religions without buying into their discredited metaphysics or otherwise losing our secular bearings. We welcome debate about how to separate the wheat from the chaff ‚Äî what we should and shouldn‚Äôt make use of as Humanists.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenewhumanism.org/authors/rick-heller/articles/more-than-logical"&gt;A Place for the Emotions in Humanism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the organizations that represent nonbelievers use words like ‚Äúreason‚Äù or ‚Äúrational‚Äù in their titles. That serves us well as a counterpoint to ‚Äúfaith.‚Äù However, as some dictionary definitions equate reason with logic, one might gain the impression that we reject emotions as well. In fact, feelings are essential to human flourishing and optimal decision-making. Emotions, especially joy, have a place in Humanism.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little too touchy-feely?  For me, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not all flowers and rainbows, though.  The articles are interesting and I‚Äôd like to see &lt;a href="http://thenewhumanism.org"&gt;this magazine&lt;/a&gt; continue even after Greg‚Äôs book is an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if it would be more effective as an actual print publication ‚Äî a quarterly or annual magazine that could be sent to Humanist (and student) groups around the country for a very low cost.  The articles don‚Äôt quite function as blog postings, but they are exactly the type of reading you want to share with people who are making the transition into atheism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Mitchum, a neurobiology PhD from here who‚Äôs been going a great job on our Science Life blog, will also be live-blogging Darwin/Chicago, with an assist from me &lt;a href="http://sciencelife.uchospitals.edu/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.¬† Right now he‚Äôs featuring a good interview with Bob Richards on the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should also know that the library here has posted a cool multimedia page on the 1959 conference &lt;a href="http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/DarwinCentennial/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.¬†¬† It includes video and audio from the conference and even audio from a daffy Darwin musical that was written for the event (my favorite is &lt;a href="http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/DarwinCentennial/audio/TrilebiteTimeWillTell.mp3"&gt;the song ‚ÄúTrilobite‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a web feature that &lt;a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/features/20091026_darwin.shtml"&gt;details the historical links&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in a comment, we‚Äôve arranged to have every presentation filmed, so I expect that you‚Äôll be able to see them all on the Darwin/Chicago website before too long.&lt;/p&gt;

I assume Brian‚Äôll be plugging his new book, &lt;em&gt;Why E= mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which I have read and is excellent (review coming soon). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian is quite funny (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/21/tam-london-video-3-brian-cox/"&gt;as you may have noticed&lt;/a&gt;) and comfortable on television, so I suspect this will be quite a treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And congrats for him being able to do something I have yet to achieve: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/08/30/stephen-colbert-on-notice/"&gt;goad Colbert into an invitation&lt;/a&gt;. I hold out hope: eventually he‚Äôll run out astronomers to interview, and he‚Äôll &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to have me on the show. And that‚Äôs the W√∏rd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the series of posts introducing the participants - you can see the &lt;a href="https://mistersugar.wufoo.com/reports/scienceonline2010-look-whos-coming/" title=""&gt;whole list here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of dozen SciBlings will be there, but here are five I picked for today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Janet D. Stemwedel&lt;/b&gt; (aka Dr. Free-Ride) is a Philosopher and a Chemist. She is a Professor of Philosophy at San Jose State University in California and she blogs on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" title=""&gt;Adventures in Ethics and Science&lt;/a&gt; and can also be found &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/docfreeride" title=""&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janet is the veteran of our conferences - one of a handful to attend her fourth, and one of only two people who did something - a talk, presentation or session - every single year. I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/02/the_cool_aunt_of_the_sciencebl.php" title=""&gt;interviewed Janet&lt;/a&gt; last year as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This January, Janet will do two things - she will give a short Ignite-style talk "Blogging on the tenure track", and co-moderate a session titled "Online Civility and Its (Muppethugging) Discontents".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christina Pikas&lt;/b&gt; is a science librarian and a PhD student in information studies at JHU in Maryland. She blogs on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/christinaslisrant/" title=""&gt;Christina's LIS Rant&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cpikas" title=""&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Conference, also a veteran of these meetings, Christina will moderate a session on 'Online Reference Managers'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/02/librarians_have_been_doing_it.php" title=""&gt;interview with Christina here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SciCurious&lt;/b&gt;, the mysterious blogger at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/" title=""&gt;Neurotopia&lt;/a&gt; will be back this year as well. She can also be found &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/scicurious" title=""&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and she is this year's Guest Editor of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/openlab09/" title=""&gt;The Open Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, the annual anthology of the best writing on science blogs which hopefully will be ready for sale just in time for the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline09_interview_with_2.php" title=""&gt;her ABATC interview&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Dobbs&lt;/b&gt; is a &lt;a href="http://daviddobbs.net/" title=""&gt;journalist and writer&lt;/a&gt;. He blogs on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/" title=""&gt;Neuron Culture&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/davedobbs" title=""&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will be one of the moderators of the session "Rebooting Science Journalism in the Age of the Web"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paul Z. Myers&lt;/b&gt; is a Biology professor at University of Minnesota in Morris and he blogs on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" title=""&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;. This will be PZ's first appearance at this meeting. He can also be found on Twitter, both as &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/pzmyers" title=""&gt;himself&lt;/a&gt; and as his &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/pharyngulafeed" title=""&gt;blog's feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_introducin_2.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/cx7hu7KqVTw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256745948121"><id gr:original-id="http://openpaleo.blogspot.com/2009/10/happy-family-of-pachycephalosaurus.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6f959875068b2647</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">A Happy Family of Pachycephalosaurus</title><published>2009-10-28T10:18:35Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T10:18:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/U8Ibl5eidfI/happy-family-of-pachycephalosaurus.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://openpaleo.blogspot.com/2009/10/happy-family-of-pachycephalosaurus.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Distinguishing the skulls of juveniles and adults of the same species, and sometimes different species, can be a prickly thing in the fossil record. The result is that paleontology is littered with juvenile fossils that have been considered adults at some time or another. The crested duck-billed dinosaur Corythosaurus has also been known under names like Procheneosaurus, the famous Monoclonius is actually a juvenile of adult Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and kin, and the debate still continues on whether Nanotyrannus is a juvenile Tyrannosaurus.Yesterday in the open access journal PLoS ONE, paleontologists Jack Horner and Mark Goodwin published a long-awaited paper positing synonymy for a trio of iconic (and melodiously-named) dinosaurs. The bone-headed dinosaurs Pachycephalosaurus, Stygimoloch, and Dracorex are all one and the same animal, according to their work. The latter two are juvenile stages, whereas Pachycephalosaurus represents a full adult.Skulls of Pachycephalosaurus (top), Stygimoloch (middle; the front of the skull is missing), and Dracorex (bottom; the skull is crushed from top to bottom). In particular, note the changes in skull size and similarities in spike placement. Modified after the original in Horner and Goodwin 2009.How is this possible? The animals look so different, right? Pachycephalosaurus has this big bowling ball on top of its head, which the other two lack. Stygimoloch has a uniquely-shaped, narrow dome, and Dracorex has a completely flat head. Furthermore, Pachycephalosaurus lacks the elongated spikes that make the other two look so fearsome.Well, it turns out that this can all be attributed to ontogenetic changes (i.e., change as the animals get older). Horner and Goodwin assemble multiple lines of evidence for this hypothesis.First, the skulls of Dracorex, Stygimoloch, and Pachycephalosaurus form a size gradation from smallest to largest--exactly what one would expect for a growth series. By itself, this is not irrefutable proof, of course--it could just be that Dracorex had a small adult size compared to Pachycephalosaurus.Second, many of the knobs and bumps on the skulls can be matched up one for one between individuals of the various specimens. Alternatively, one would also expect that closely related (but different) species might have similar patterns of bumps. As Horner and Goodwin admit, there is some variation between individuals of the different &amp;quot;species&amp;quot;--but, the authors also note that this sort of variation is entirely expected and occurs even within undisputed adult Pachycephalosaurus.Third, specimens of Stygimoloch, both in CT scans and physically cut specimens, show an open suture between the two frontal bones of the dome. Pachycephalosaurus domes are completely fused up. Open sutures are often strong indications that an animal is still growing--and, it&amp;#39;s particularly intriguing that a small &amp;quot;species&amp;quot; has them but a large &amp;quot;species&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t!Finally, microscopic examination of the bones in two of the three &amp;quot;species&amp;quot; (Stygimoloch and Pachycephalosaurus; there weren&amp;#39;t any Dracorex available for cutting up) shows that Stygimoloch was still growing (and thus not a full adult)--but Pachycephalosaurus specimens weren&amp;#39;t growing much at all (and therefore were probably full adults).Any one of these lines of evidence might be interesting, but not completely convincing. Taken together, however, they make a pretty compelling case that Dracorex and Stygimoloch are juvenile Pachycephalosaurus. Because Pachycephalosaurus was named first, the first two become junior synonyms. It&amp;#39;s a shame, because they&amp;#39;re such cool names!As for duckbilled dinosaurs, horned dinosaurs, and even modern crested birds like the cassowary, the story in the pachycephalosaurs suggests that weird ornaments on the skull were something that happened only as the animals approached full size. The domes practically appeared overnight! The teenage years must have been a real headache for these dinosaurs.Thanks to the wonders of open access, the article is freely available for all to read. Additionally, it is worth taking advantage of the rating and comment features at PLoS ONE [disclaimer: I am a section editor for that journal]. . .few other scientific publications allow the readers to annotate the papers directly!CitationHorner, J., &amp;amp; Goodwin, M.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration on Monday came out strongly against efforts by Islamic nations to bar the defamation of religions, saying the moves would restrict free speech.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Some claim that the best way to protect the freedom of religion is to implement so-called anti-defamation policies that would restrict freedom of expression and the freedom of religion," Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters. "I strongly disagree."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This mystery was known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event"&gt;Tunguska event.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_how_could_a_meteor_explode/tunguska-2.jpg" width="500" title="Taken more than a decade after the event... this was really, really destructive!" alt="tunguska-photo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how did this happen?  The amount of energy released was estimated to be somewhere between 5 and 30 Megatons of TNT.  (Comparably to a "typical" hydrogen bomb.)  What could've caused this devastation?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_how_could_a_meteor_explode/tunguska3.jpg" width="500" height="444" title="If this had occurred directly over New York City, it would have razed the entire island of Manhattan." alt="tunguska3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer: &lt;b&gt;a large meteor&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;small asteroid/comet&lt;/b&gt; could have done this &lt;i&gt;easily&lt;/i&gt;.  How?  Let me explain.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a meteor enters Earth's atmosphere, it's moving very, very quickly relative to the Earth.  Meteors have a speed relative to Earth anywhere between about 40,000 and 260,000 kilometers-per-hour (11 to 72 kilometers/second), which is incredibly fast.  The Earth's atmosphere works -- through friction -- to slow this meteor down, heating it up and causing it to glow.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_how_could_a_meteor_explode/meteor1.jpg" width="500" title="Image credit to Arne Danielsen." alt="meteor1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if there's a lot of ice and/or frozen carbon dioxide in this meteor, it's going to heat up and start to boil.  If you have a solid piece of rock with a cavern of boiling water inside, it's only a matter of time before the pressure builds up enough to cause a powerful explosion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_how_could_a_meteor_explode/tunguska_20s.jpg" width="500" title="By this point, the meteor should have lost nearly all of its kinetic energy, turning it into heat, which makes this meteor unbelievably hot..." alt="tunguska_20s.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I assume my meteor moves at the maximum speed its allowed, 260,000 kilometers-per-hour, I can figure out how massive it needs to be to produce 10 Megatons (4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Joules) of energy.  The answer?  A little over &lt;b&gt;1,000 tonnes&lt;/b&gt;, which means it was probably a rock a little less than ten meters on each side.  Which means it was about the size of the smaller rock to the left of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haystack_Rock"&gt;Haystack Rock&lt;/a&gt; in this picture.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/q_a_how_could_a_meteor_explode/800px-Cannon_Beach_02.jpg" width="500" title="After a year in Oregon, I *still* haven&amp;#39;t made it out to see this.  Sorry, one-eyed Willie!" alt="800px-Cannon_Beach_02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And physics will take care of the rest: convert that kinetic energy into heat energy, use that heat to boil liquid inside, and -- just like it did for &lt;a href="http://fliiby.com/file/392349/p3omfqms4o.html"&gt;the mythbusters&lt;/a&gt; -- the increased pressure will cause the explosion we're all looking for.  And the only scientific principle you need to know to make this possible?  &lt;a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/2745/data/lawce1.htm"&gt;The conservation of energy&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's it.  Plain-and-simple, how simply hurtling through the atmosphere, if you're filled with something that can boil, can cause you to explode with a tremendous amount of energy.  And there's no faking that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/q_a_how_could_a_meteor_explode.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256743606007"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=3752">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53638a8c7634ebf1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">What Would Bridge the New Atheist/Accommodationist Divide?</title><published>2009-10-28T13:27:05Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T13:27:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/28/what-would-bridge-the-nasty-new-atheistaccommodationist-divide/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This question was raised for me by a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/26/my-thanks-to-tom-johnson/#comment-34310"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; by Luke Vogel, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;I have expressed my concerns at length, I do wish we, perhaps with a blog post by the Intersection, that I (we) can return to defining and defending and idea of ‚Äúaccomodationism‚Äù since I had begun the process, which includes highlighting the paper by Austin Dacey which gave us the terms as used now in the science and religion debates. I think this focus can highlight our complete agreements with people like Sean Carroll, Lawrence Krauss, Michael Shermer and many others, while also recognizing the primary concerns that are shared by all of us that seem so intensely interested in what happens at The Intersection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my own perspective, I partly translate this as follows: Is there any way to get back to a productive discussion over the merits of ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/10/on_accommodationism.php"&gt;accommodationism&lt;/a&gt;,‚Äù or the lack thereof?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to hear what the New Atheists would say; but I think we are a long way from seeing this happen. The problem is that there does not even appear to be an understanding of basic terms and positions‚Äìa problem compounded by a concomitant lack of civil discourse or good will. Both sides, I‚Äôm sure, consider themselves to have big grievances that have not been addressed; so any additional comment just fans the flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could this change? Well, first of all, I‚Äôm highly skeptical that it can. But if I were to suggest the conditions in which it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt;, I would say that a serious dialogue cannot resume without an end of name calling, &lt;em&gt;ad hominem&lt;/em&gt; attacks, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/21/a-trio-of-responses-to-jerry-coyne%E2%80%99s-attack-on-unscientific-america/"&gt;extensive misrepresentation of positions&lt;/a&gt;. If there is no interest in getting basic views right, understanding them, or admitting those views are based on evidence and not unreasonable, there is no way a two-way dialogue can be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that‚Äôs my own take, but there are two sides here. It might be fruitful if some New Atheists would respond with their own take on Vogel‚Äôs question, if only to see how broad the gap really is between two groups of people who, after all, probably share well over 95 percent of their intellectual DNA.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256742494533"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/2009/10/this-is-what-the-spectator-sent-when-they-cancelled-their-aids-denialism-extravaganza/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/731ac800c5b4e20e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">This is what the Spectator sent when they cancelled their Aids denialism extravaganza</title><published>2009-10-28T12:24:52Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T12:24:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/10/this-is-what-the-spectator-sent-when-they-cancelled-their-aids-denialism-extravaganza/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Ben Goldacre</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256741204252"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=6674">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f6d85b64e3f41f6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SciFi"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><category term="Memories of the Future"/><category term="Star Trek"/><category term="WIl Wheaton"/><title type="html">Book review: Memories of the Future</title><published>2009-10-28T14:00:14Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T14:00:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/fj4vpdrAfYM/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/28/book-review-memories-of-the-future/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/memories-of-the-future---volume-1/7742853"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/wil_memories_future.jpg" alt="wil_memories_future" title="wil_memories_future" width="213" height="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There are any number of reasons I don‚Äôt generally do book reviews on the blog. For one, I‚Äôve been in the writing scam^h^h^h business for a while, so now I have a metric buttload of friends who write books, and reviewing all their books would be overwhelming. Plus, what do you do if their book sucks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I make an exception when the book itself is exceptional. Such is the case for &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/memories-of-the-future---volume-1/7742853"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memories of the Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a review of the first few episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation told from Wil Wheaton‚Äôs unique viewpoint (full disclosure: Wil is a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/11/01/happy-wil/"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; and I may have just a wee lingering bit of a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/06/05/i-love-wil-wheaton/"&gt;mancrush&lt;/a&gt; on him). If you don‚Äôt know ‚Äî and really, why the heck are you reading my blog if you don‚Äôt ‚Äî &lt;a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/"&gt;Wil&lt;/a&gt; played Wesley Crusher on TNG. Since then he‚Äôs made a name for himself as a writer, and it‚Äôs deserved. He‚Äôs really good at it, drawing the reader in with very personal stories and a wicked sense of humor laced with snark and webby goodness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all comes into play here. In &lt;em&gt;Memories&lt;/em&gt;, he writes blow-by-blow reviews of TNG episodes that are alternately hilarious and thoughtful (the reviews, not so much the episodes). He writes both as a fan of the show, an actor on the show, and a man who is trying to honestly discuss the pros and cons of each episode. Especially cool are the times Wesley Crusher is an annoying weenie, because Wil lets it all out ‚Äî excoriating the writers when called for but also admitting when he felt that his acting was still immature. It‚Äôs a refreshing honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a random quote I got by opening the book at, um, random. It‚Äôs from Datalore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After a brief encounter with soon-to-be-ex Chief Engineer Argyle, Dr. Crusher promises Data that she‚Äôll keep the existence of his mysterious off switch to herself. Data asks her if she would want people to know about &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; off switch, if she had one. She laughs nervously, and we get a quick look at a bottle of J√§germeister in her office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2702320482/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/2702320482_8941692e4b_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The absolute best part of the book is in his review of &amp;quot;The Naked Now&amp;quot;, a poorly conceived story idea early in the show‚Äôs history where the writers entirely failed to build on the legacy of the original series to help smooth the way for the new one. So why is this the best?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because months ago Wil emailed me, asking a question about supernova astrophysics that was relevant to the show. I sent him a few paragraphs of expository hilariousness, and he stuck it right in the book! It‚Äôs right there on page 27:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait. Stars have cores? I always thought they were balls of gas undergoing constant nuclear reactions. Man I wish I was as smart as Wesley, so I knew for sure! Luckily for us, I know someone who is as smart as Wesley, so I asked him. Ladies and gentlemen, my friend Phil Plait.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what I wrote you‚Äôll just have to buy the book, but I‚Äôll note that it‚Äôs brilliant and rumors (started by me and listened to attentively by my dog) have already started buzzing about a Pulitzer. And I hate to disagree with Wil, but I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as smart as Wesley ‚Äî I‚Äôm just written better. And don‚Äôt let him fool you: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/01/27/in-which-i-bow-to-wil-wheatons-superior-intellect/"&gt;Wil knows a lot about warp travel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, if you are a fan of TNG then this book will make you laugh a lot. If you‚Äôre a fan of Wil‚Äôs then you probably already bought it. But while I was reading it I had a lot of fond memories jogged; I remember avidly watching the show when it aired in my first year of grad school. I‚Äôd sit with friends every week, enjoying the show immensely, in between making fun of it when needed. And as painful as some of those episodes were, because of this book ‚Äî and Wil‚Äôs writing in general ‚Äî some good has come of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh‚Äì &lt;a href="http://www.wilwheatonbooks.com/memories-of-the-future-volume-one/"&gt;Wil has put selected audio readings from the book online&lt;/a&gt;, so if you‚Äôre like Comic Book Guy (Worst. Analogy. Ever.) and too lazy to hold a book up, you can still listen to him reading it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, &lt;a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/"&gt;you should read his blog&lt;/a&gt;. That‚Äôs how I first found him; a dear friend years ago told me I should look into this Wil Wheaton guy. I was skeptical at first, but within a few paragraphs of the first blog entry I read I was hooked. Our senses of humor are very similar, so if you like my blog you‚Äôll like his as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, enough gushing! Stop reading this and go buy his book. And the good news? The book is only Part 1 (season 1 episodes 1 ‚Äì 13). Wil, I know you‚Äôre reading this, because all you Hollywood types are vain and shallow and self-absorbed, so when does Part 2 come out? Huh? Huh?&lt;/p&gt;

We got to talking about how hard it was for adults learning foreign languages to ever sound like native speakers.

One reason for this is, apparently, is that there are sounds that occur in some languages and not others. If you are raised hearing only English in your first year or two of life, your brain loses some of its ability to discern the sounds that don't arise in spoken English.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/pGoe9U7zNRM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By Steven D.

You won't be surprised to learn that AiG's answer is that yes, they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, demons are real spiritual and personal beings, not just forces or phenomena in the physical and psychological realm. Various Bible passages reveal that they have intellect, emotions, and will. They think, hate, and choose plans of action against God, Christ, and mankind. They especially hate believers in Christ because believers belong to Christ and are foes of Satan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Scriptures provide many details about demons. They are spirit beings created by God and responsible to God (Colossians 1:16). They are creatures limited in space, time, and powers. They have become morally perverted and are called "unclean spirits" (Matthew 10:1) or "evil spirits" (Luke 7:21). They promote immoral and sensuous lifestyles (2 Peter 2:1-18). They cause false teachers of depraved minds to oppose the truth and appeal to carnal and selfish impulses (2 Timothy 3:6). They sow false followers of Christ in the world (Matthew 13:37-42). They blind the minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing God's salvation through faith in His Son (2 Corinthians 4:3-4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, they're everywhere. The best part, though, is the next paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demons promote primitive religions, magic, superstition, and worship of evil spirits. They are the dynamic behind idolatry and their devotees, whether worshipers of the gods Marduk, Asher, Zeus, Jupiter, Apollo, Ra, Diana, Aphrodite, or a host of lesser manmade deities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Like Jesus," I ask, innocently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will agree that &lt;i&gt;belief&lt;/i&gt; in demons is a sign that you're dealing with a primitive religion and superstition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/they_really_are_that_crazy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/63nU3vf3f9M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256739909943"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/10/vim-the-answer-gfoo/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6b234856fec09655</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">!vim the answer: :g/^foo/,/^$/‚Ä¶</title><published>2009-10-28T13:42:47Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T13:42:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/10/vim-the-answer-gfoo/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;!vim the answer: :g/^foo/,/^$/d or the sed equivalent&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256739809172"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=10163">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/45b828e41c063003</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Favorites"/><category term="Guest Bloggers"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Stuff You'll Like"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Skepchick Presents: A Conversation with Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson (Part 5)</title><published>2009-10-28T14:00:14Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T14:00:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/skepchick-presents-a-conversation-with-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson-part-5/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following video¬†is Parts¬†5 of my conversation with Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson.

the end very much and agree wholeheartedly:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Christian depiction of the human condition seems to be spot-on. This is one thing Christianity gets exactly right. There is something deeply and seemingly irremediably wrong with us. We stain everything we touch. Even the citadel of reason is breached. As an academic, I long regarded intellect as a very high if not quite the highest good. Now I think it is grossly overrated. I have come to realize that I.Q. and rationality are hardly correlated at all. On the contrary, I have discovered the appalling extent to which very many of the smartest people employ their intellectual gifts and high-powered intellectual tools (like analytic philosophy) to create and defend pernicious ideologies and towering lunacies. Maybe worse are those who sell their intellects to the service of the highest bidders. ‚ÄúReason is a whore,‚Äù said Luther, and, by God, he was at least 90% right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://secularoutpost.infidels.org/2009/10/strongest-argument-for-christianity.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-1598645046091787646?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The clerk‚Äôs office in federal district court in Santa Anna, California has determined that nearly $20,000 in court costs should be borne by high school student Chad Farnan‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fees are to be paid by Advocates for Faith &amp;amp; Freedom, a Christian legal group that represented Farnan pro-bono. The school district and teachers‚Äô union, whose attorneys also represented Corbett, now plan to file a motion to recover over $378,000 in attorneys‚Äô fees.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is complicated to figure out.  Corbett was found to have violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school district and Corbett, at separate hearings, were found to be not liable for Corbett‚Äôs actions because of his ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2009/09/teacher-awarded-qualified-immunity-in.html"&gt;qualified immunity defense&lt;/a&gt;.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, Farnan‚Äôs legal team has to pay the court costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbett‚Äôs team is still seeking to recover attorney‚Äôs fees ($378,519) and it‚Äôs possible that Advocates for Faith &amp;amp; Freedom will have to pay that again.  Not surprisingly, they‚Äôre appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/court-corbett-district-2621599-fees-friday"&gt;See?  Complicated.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbett actually &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/19/christian-student-involved-in-lawsuit-now-gives-speeches-at-republican-fundraisers/#comment-378045"&gt;commented on this site about his situation&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî he feels that the reported comments he made in class have been distorted and taken out of context.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are you muscling into my territory (what, aren't creationism and atheism enough?), but you had to subject me to the most &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/physics.php"&gt;mind-numbing example of why homeopaths&lt;/a&gt; are the most clueless purveyors of pseudoscience there are! Behold, &lt;a href="http://www.visiontherapysolutions.com"&gt;Dr. Charlene Werner&lt;/a&gt;, an optometrist (apparently) and a homeopath. I warn you, however. If you have any understanding of physics or chemistry whatsoever or if you've ever read (and liked) Stephen Hawking's &lt;em&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/em&gt; (or anything else he's ever written), sit down now. Take a deep breath. Heck, crack open a bottle of wine and down at least half of it before you watch this video. I'm serious. You'll need it. You might need to lie down, too. In fact, you might need to lie down with a cool washcloth across your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't say I didn't warn you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly, the woo doth flow. Like a river. Like the energy from a supernova. From Bozeman, Montana, where, apparently they don't have enough woo and have to import it from Texas. Now do you see why I couldn't wait until Friday to give Werner a tiny taste of my characteristic not-so-Respectful Insolence?

Needless to say, the science is hot and I know that I will rock the talk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So, I am super excited and nervous and am trying to think about what to wear. Normally, I like to wear these super hot red stilettos or knee high black boots. Now, my question is this - should I tone down my hotness and go more conservative? How do I strike a middle ground but still be true to myself? Any advice would be appreciated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sincerely and devotedly -&lt;br&gt;
Sxydocma1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;BTW.  Love your new DSW purchase! I never understood the gladiator sandals either. I am headed to DSW tomorrow!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;











&lt;p&gt;I have to tell you, little muffins, I hate these kinds of questions.  Not because I don&amp;#39;t want to answer them.¬† I do.¬† I really, really do. But, because they make me have to put a cork in my hot, hot feminist ways lest I spew bad advice all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/hKoB0MHVBvM%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x2b405b%26color2%3D0x6b8ab6&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 1: Awesome spewing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, my early morning, idealistic feminist leanings make me want to tell this reader that she should be able to give her lecture dressed up as the tooth fairy and it shouldn&amp;#39;t matter.¬† She should go ahead and wear her red pumps or knee high boots and everyone else be damned.  Science should really be all about the data and that should be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://roflrazzi.com/2009/10/26/celebrity-pictures-eddie-izzard-attitude-accessory/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://roflrazzi.wordpress.com/files/2009/10/celebrity-pictures-eddie-izzard-attitude-accessory.jpg" alt="eddie izzard" title="celebrity-pictures-eddie-izzard-attitude-accessory" height="454" width="481"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://roflrazzi.com/2009/10/26/celebrity-pictures-eddie-izzard-attitude-accessory/"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: But, we all know that's not reality, even for Eddie Izzard.  h/t to &lt;a href="http://arikia.com/"&gt;Arikia Millikan&lt;/a&gt; for sending this to me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That wouldn&amp;#39;t be very good advice, though.¬† So, gather &amp;#39;round, little muffins, and let Mama leave you with a life lessons to make these decisions easier in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;You Can Almost Always Wear &lt;u&gt;One&lt;/u&gt; Amazing Something...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do I mean by that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking at your wardrobe and you have one amazing something - a wild pin, a fantastic vintage necklace, a pair of red pumps - you can almost always get away with it and have it be an interest topic of conversation, as long as the rest of the outfit is relatively subdued in comparison.¬† For example, some of you may be familiar with this picture from &lt;a href="http://roflrazzi.com/2009/10/26/celebrity-pictures-eddie-izzard-attitude-accessory/"&gt;my early blog days&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Contact Picture.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/Contact%20Picture.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="300" width="400"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: Isis's amazing Naughty Monkeys and all her domestic and laboratory goddess-like stuff.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been known to wear these around MRU, but usually with a pair of neutral pants like jeans or black slacks, and a neutral top. Red stiletto heels could totally rock an academic event as long as you do it like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="red heels.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/red%20heels.JPG" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="429" width="280"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3: Sxydocma1, looking adorable, gets ready for her conference.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And avoid this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/red_pumps_for_my_plenary_lectu/lucky%20brand%20ad.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/10/red_pumps_for_my_plenary_lectu/lucky%20brand%20ad-thumb-400x560-21372.jpg" alt="lucky brand ad.jpg" height="560" width="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ltcconline.net/lukas/gender/menincontrol/pics/mencontrol3.jpg"&gt;Figure 4&lt;/a&gt;: It's not that fine a line&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 3 is a stock photo I picked up from a collection I subscribe to that I have been hanging on to for a while.¬† As soon as I got this letter, I thought of it because I remembered seeing it and liking it. I think that what makes her outfit workable for an academic conference is that the dress is relatively modestly cut and the jewelry is fairly subdued.¬† The major focal point is her shoes and the rest is not distracting.¬† I could just pinch the woman in Figure 3. ¬† If I were going to wear those shoes for a plenary lecture, I might choose a pair of well-pressed black pants and a collared blouse.¬† I think that would be absolutely fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, it sucks as a feminist to have to give this advice because I could sense from this email that what our reader was really asking was how to wear what she wants without people thinking she doesn&amp;#39;t take her science seriously or misinterpreting her clothing choices as a sexual suggestions.¬† One woman&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;I love these red shoes!¬† The color reminds me of my tricycle from when I was a little girl!&amp;quot; can be one d00d&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;She is clearly wearing those shoes here because she is looking for some action. On my penis.&amp;quot;¬† Sometimes you just can&amp;#39;t win, and it is unfortunate that we have to consider the message others receive when we decide what to wear.¬† Still, the One Something Amazing Rule has generally worked for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck, little muffin!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/ask_dr_isis_-_red_pumps_for_my.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/aeXfcsm8A8w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256738262782"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1146">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ac2cd8e2fb872081</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="Hulda Clark"/><title type="html">Hulda Clark Died of Cancer</title><published>2009-10-28T13:51:33Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T13:51:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1146" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Notorious cancer quack, Hulda Clark, died recently. However, it was not made public at the time that Clark, who claimed to have the cure for all cancers (and later the cure for all disease) died of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2009/10/requiem_for_a_quack_part_ii/HuldaClarkDeathCertificate.pdf"&gt;death certificate&lt;/a&gt;, which is now public, shows a contributing factors in her death to be multiple myeloma ‚Äì a form of blood cancer. The immediate cause was listed as anemia, with hypercalcemia ‚Äì both can be caused by multiple myeloma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clark was personally responsible for much human suffering and misery, and she lured in countless victims with her quackery and her false claims for a cure of cancer. She, of course, also tried to scare patients away from standard therapy for cancer. Of course, she herself had to die eventually of something, and cancer is the second leading cause of death, so it is not much of a coincidence that she died of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt this fact will put much of a dent in the cancer quackery industry ‚Äì an industry that does not trade much on evidence and reason to begin with, but rather fear, distrust, desperation, and false hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/requiem_for_a_quack_part_ii.php"&gt;Orac has some further thoughts on the matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Researcher Jonas Warringer is trying to find ways to slow the rate of genetic adaptation in certain microbes down to keep them from evolving resistance to antibiotics. But look at this (and I translate):&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slowed-down evolution can counteract antibiotic resistance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resistance of an infectious agent against antibiotics is particularly serious when it comes to drugs made from fungi, penicillin for instance. Fungal cells are similar to human ones, which makes it hard to develop drugs that hit fungal cells (and are effective) but leave human cells unharmed (thus avoiding side effects).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution creates random variations in the traits of an organism, which shows in infectious agents as an improved resistance against the drugs they encounter. In the end we get completely resistant fungal strains -- and the drug becomes ineffective.&lt;p&gt;What the press release fails to mention is that we usually use antibiotics against &lt;i&gt;bacterial&lt;/i&gt; infections, not fungal ones. The research reported on is in fact irrelevant to the much-publicised concerns about MRSA and other bacterial strains that have evolved resistance to antibiotics. Looks like an attempt to ride the publicity wave of a separate issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bruce Chatwin did have fungal trouble, though.

&lt;div style="width:254px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/Hookworm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="Hookworm" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/Hookworm.jpg" alt="Hookworm" width="244" height="286"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARGHHHH! Run for the hills, it&amp;#39;s a Helminth!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had talks about scabies in the Aboriginal population, the mites that spread the disease, and I interviewed &lt;a href="http://www.parasite.org.au/arcnet/registry/aloukas.html"&gt;Dr Alex Loukas&lt;/a&gt;, parasitologist from the Queensland Institute for Medical Research.¬†Dr Loukas has an interest in a member of the Helminth family the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"&gt;hookworm&lt;/a&gt;, and is currently working on developing a vaccine against the infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hookworms are no longer a big problem for humans in Australia, but remain a health risk in the developing world. The manifestation of a serious hookworm infection is anaemia from a loss of blood, corresponding with low levels of iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the malaria parasite I wrote about in &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/10/28/locking-in-on-malaria/"&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, hookworms consume the haemoglobin component of blood and they do this by latching onto the walls of the intestine and leeching blood into their gut. They then excrete the left overs out through their anus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the &lt;strong&gt;pornography&lt;/strong&gt; part of Alex‚Äôs talk yesterday. He has a video taken during a routine colonoscopy (which failed to work during the presentation and I can‚Äôt say that I am really sorry) showing a dog hookworm attached to the inside of a human patient‚Äôs intestine. According to Alex, it precisely demonstrates this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He refers to it as &lt;strong&gt;‚Äúpornography for parasitologists‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;. And people say scientists are weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, the main focus of Alex‚Äôs work is to develop a vaccine for hookworm. This might sound a bit strange to you at first, since many of us would know that there is already one available for dogs. Alex told me however that this vaccine, whilst a viable technology to adapt for human use, is far too expensive to use in the developing world. This is because it is an ‚Äúattenuated vaccine‚Äù, meaning the hookworm larvae are irradiated to a senescent or no longer active state, then when the immune system is exposed to them, antibodies are created and immunity developed. This is a very expensive process however, requiring the culturing of hundreds of thousands of hookworm larvae for vaccine manufacture. Cost is a critical factor for the availability and distribution of medical care in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:188px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/Hookworm2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:6px" title="Hookworm2" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/Hookworm2.jpg" alt="Hookworm2" width="178" height="254"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasitology - it&amp;#39;s fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome these issues, Alex‚Äôs approach is to create an antibody against a protein in the feed cycle of the hookworm. This enzyme is critical for the final stages of the digestion of the haemaoglobin component of the blood. If the enzyme doesn‚Äôt work, the hookworm cannot extract nutrients and it effectively starves to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method of delivery of the antibody to the gut of the worm is particularly fascinating. The host, being the human, is exposed to the hookworm gut protein, thereby making antibodies against it, which will enter their blood stream. The hookworm then feeds on the blood,  ingests the antibodies which enter its gut and stop the digestive enzymes from working. Alex refers to this as the ‚ÄúPoison Chalice‚Äù of vaccines. Elegant and ingenious.&lt;/p&gt;

She is the star of a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0c5yClip4o&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; in which she explains the scientific basis of homeopathy. Before you watch it, make sure you are sitting down, relax, and brace yourself for an onslaught of profound scientific illiteracy combined with stunning arrogance. For those with more delicate constitutions I will give you the quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Einstein taught us that energy equals matter and light, but because matter can be condensed down to a very small space if you remove all the empty space between the elementary particles (I am paraphrasing to make her statements minimally coherent), we can mostly ignore matter. Therefore energy is light, and we are all made of energy ‚Äì not matter (or at least so little matter, you can ignore it). Stephen Hawking then came up with string theory, which tells us that all matter (which we can ignore) is made of vibrating strings. Therefore we are made of vibrating energy. All diseases are therefore caused by unhealthy vibrational states, and all disease can be treated by returning the body to a previous healthy vibrational state. This can be done with homeopathy, which extracts the vibrational energy out of stuff and places it in a small pill that can be used at any time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it? This is now my favorite example of meaningless pseudobabble from a CAM proponent. Also, I am not picking on some unrepresentative crank ‚Äì this is as good as homeopathy gets. Werner may be more clumsy and fumbling than more eloquent homeopathy proponents, but when you strip it down, magical vibrations is what you get. But Werner does a fabulous job of exposing the gaping holes is homeopathic nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werner is also Dr. Charelene Werner which made me curious of her degree and practice, and this led me to a topic that I do not think we have every covered on SBM ‚Äì behavioral optometry. Dr. Werner is an optometrist who engages is a host of pseudoscientific practices, homeopathy being just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral or developmental optometry is similar to chiropractic, in that it is a health care profession that is self contained, separate from mainstream medical science, with historical roots survival into modern practice. There is a kernel of legitimacy (perhaps) to some of what they do, but then a vast expanding set of clinical claims for which there is little or not evidence. The big difference is that behavioral optometrists, unlike chiropractors, have largely been flying below the radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also appears to be a spectrum, like with chiropractic, and I‚Äôm sure those behavioral optometrists who try to be evidence-based may take exception to being lumped in with the likely of Dr. Werner. But ‚Äì professions have an identity, and you don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs happening under the banner of your profession, clean it up from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A look at &lt;a href="http://www.visiontherapysolutions.com/"&gt;Dr. Werner‚Äôs website&lt;/a&gt; give us a clear picture of her philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a holistic based optometric practice dedicated to the highest quliaty vision care for your entire family. We believe that 70% of how you physically function is through the vision system. Therefore, when the vision system is improved or enhanced it also increases overall physical wellness and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflects, in my opinion, the tendency for practitioners who are not science-based to slowly expand their claims and scope of practice.¬† If anecdotes are all you require (not even minimal biological plausibility) to accept that your interventions work, then before long you will think they work for everything. Dr. Werner likely does not grasp how extraordinary a claim it is to say that 70% of physical function is through the vision system. I wonder how she came up with that figure. The vague claims to ‚Äúimprove or enhance‚Ä¶physical wellness‚Äù leaves the door nicely open to treating just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral optometry is premised on the belief that eye and visual function can be improved, at any age, through training, exercises, or glasses with special lenses or prisms. There is little support or plausibility for this claim so broadly conceived, although there may be some truth to this concept in specific cases. A thorough review of the claims and literature for the various treatments of behavior optometrists is beyond one article, but I did find some recent reviews. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19154276?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_SingleItemSupl.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=5&amp;amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;This review from 2008&lt;/a&gt; takes a broad look at behavioral optometry practices and concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a continued paucity of controlled trials in the literature to support behavioural optometry approaches. Although there are areas where the available evidence is consistent with claims made by behavioural optometrists (most notably in relation to the treatment of convergence insufficiency, the use of yoked prisms in neurological patients, and in vision rehabilitation after brain disease/injury), a large majority of behavioural management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what I found from a look through the literature. The studies that are being cited by proponents are small, unblinded, pilot studies. There is a distinct lack of large randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the claims made run directly contrary to evidence in the neurological literature. For example, using prisms to treat dyslexia (a reading disorder) based upon the premise that dyslexia is largely a visual problem (despite normal standard visual testing). However, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19608907?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=2"&gt;the evidence has shown&lt;/a&gt; that dyslexia is not a visual problem but a disorder of the language area of the brain ‚Äì a language and learning disorder. The claims of behavior optometrists regarding dyslexia started out being without evidence, but have increasing run contrary to prevailing evidence, but optomestrists failed to adapt or update their theories and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one condition that seems the most plausible and is most accepted is called convergence insufficiency ‚Äì difficulty in properly focusing both eyes on near objects. There is weak evidence to support training exercises to help with this disorder, but other methods that are used to treat it (for example and exercise called pencil push-ups) has not been shown to be effective. While this condition requires more research, it is plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the plausibility spectrum is &lt;a href="http://www.contacts-vision.com/syntonic_vision_phototherapy.asp"&gt;syntonic phototherapy&lt;/a&gt;. This is the use of specific colors of light to treat a wide range of symptoms and conditions, and improve performance. A search in pubmed on ‚Äúsyntonic phototherapy‚Äù yielded zero results. There is probably some research under different terms, but just using ‚Äúphototherapy‚Äù as a search terms yields too many results to wade through (legitimate phototherapy is used for a range of skin and other conditions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to promotional sites, syntonic phototherapy dates back to the 1920‚Äôs and one man, Dr. Harry Riley Spitler- always a red flag. They seem to follow the pattern of referencing some legitimate basic science (for example the existence of light pathways in the brain that are not involved in conscious vision) to justify specific clinical claims without referencing quality clinical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opthalmologists (MD eye doctors) historically have flirted with some of the claims of behavioral optometry, but &lt;a href="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002939405006872"&gt;a recent survey of practice&lt;/a&gt; concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although visual training has been used for several centuries, it plays a minor and actually decreasing role in eye therapy used by the ophthalmologist. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, most visual training is carried out by non-ophthalmologists and is neither practiced nor endorsed in its broadest sense by ophthalmology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, there is generally low plausibility for many of the claims of behavior optometry, a lack of evidence for most of the methods used, a lack of consistency with the overall scientific literature and practice, and an expanding list of conditions they believe they can treat. These are all symptoms of a profession that lacks an appropriate level of respect for evidence and science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore no surprise to find a practitioner who also uses other unscientific modalities, such as homeopathy, and can so casually display such profound scientific illiteracy. Dr. Werner therefore managed to be an embarrassment to two professions at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

Why? Because they had reprinted journalist Simon Singh‚Äôs article about chiropractic, which said that in the UK they were making bogus claims about how chiropractic can cure all manners of ills such as asthma and colic in babies, when it‚Äôs been shown it cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got that? This chiropractor, Joseph Ierano, complained against them because of someone else‚Äôs article! Brilliant.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The good news is that &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/announcements/chiropractors-complaint-against-australian-skeptics-dismissed/"&gt;the HCCC just told the Skeptics they have dismissed the complaint&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôd love to report that, amidst howls of laughter, they said that Ierano‚Äôs complaint has no merit, his arguments were totally wrong, and not only has chiropractic &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=59"&gt;been shown in many studies to have no efficacy against diseases like colic and asthma&lt;/a&gt;, it in fact &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=316"&gt;can be a very dangerous practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, however, it was dismissed because the Australian Skeptics group is not a health care provider, and is therefore not in the jurisdiction of the HCCC. So it was a technicality. That‚Äôs still good news, since the AS is not in any trouble, but as they say in that link above, they wish this could‚Äôve been used by the HCCC as a larger scale means to investigate and publicly discuss the inefficacy of chiropractic in these cases. Too bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a lot of publicity coming from this whole thing, since the British Chiropractic Association sued Simon Singh for libel due to his original article, instead of simply providing evidence that their claims were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; bogus (and when they finally did try to support chiropractic, their claims were woefully off-target). &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/04/the-peculiar-case-of-simon-singh/"&gt;The blogosphere erupted with support for Singh&lt;/a&gt;, as did a lot of mainstream press soon thereafter. A very cynical eye indeed has been turned to the practice of chiropractic of late. It‚Äôs long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I have read ‚Äî including studies done by doctors as discussed in such books as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trickortreatment.com/"&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Science-Ben-Goldacre/dp/000728487X/?tag=bs0b-21"&gt;Bad Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî chiropractic‚Äôs only claim for helping is that there is some marginal evidence it can relieve lower back problems, but that‚Äôs it. It doesn‚Äôt cure toothaches, or anything carried by germs, or really anything else (excluding the placebo effect, which can be provided in any of number of other ways that don‚Äôt involve actual physical manipulation). And when the neck is manipulated, chiropractic can have serious side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a health care practitioner, but with what I know now, I would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; go to a chiropractor. Some of them may understand the limitations of their practice, but clearly far too many do not. If you have some sort of health issue, go to your board-certified physician and ask them what they think of alternative practices, and ask them to be blunt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre talking about your &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; here, folks. Don‚Äôt hand it over to someone who may not have a clear grasp of what their so-called alternative medicine can ‚Äî and cannot ‚Äî do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256729106357"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1845">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b9d5af3a1acaaeb6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Prosody"/><title type="html">Richard Powers on his way to a decision</title><published>2009-10-28T11:15:04Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T11:15:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1845" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RichardPowers1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="563538"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RichardPowers2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="1533621"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RichardPowers3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="201585"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://audio.wnyc.org/studio/studio102309h.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="8490970"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RichardPowers0a.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="73271"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RichardPowers0b.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="153520"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, Kurt Andersen &lt;a href="http://www.studio360.org/episodes/2009/10/23"&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; the novelist Richard Powers on Studio360. You can listen to the whole nine-minute interview here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the interview, Powers breaks into a sequence of declarative phrases with final rising pitch ‚Äî what&amp;#39;s sometimes called &amp;quot;uptalk&amp;quot;. Before and after this sequence, which  sets the stage for an account of his decision to become a writer, he consistently uses falling patterns. It seems clear that he means the rising contours to have a rhetorical effect. But it&amp;#39;s equally clear that the intended effect is not to signal insecurity or to call into question his commitment to the truth of what he&amp;#39;s saying. So as part of my on-going campaign to &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=uptalk"&gt;document uptalk&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî especially non-stereotypical examples ‚Äî here&amp;#39;s a description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The preceding passage starts this way, with Powers describing why he left physics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;You- you mentioned the- the- the "two cultures" crisis that uh&lt;br&gt;
that Snow put on everyone's agenda but uh&lt;br&gt;
in fact the crisis really is the "million cultures" crisis and uh&lt;br&gt;
how- however much exhilaration I took out of physics, it w- rapidly became clear to me that uh&lt;br&gt;
even two physicists working in closely related fields couldn't always communicate with each other, and- and for me to make any kind of meaningful contribution&lt;br&gt;
would require&lt;br&gt;
a kind of intense specialization, where year after year I learned more and more about smaller and smaller domains, until I was in-&lt;br&gt;
in danger of knowing everything there was about nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powers goes on to explain why graduate school in literature was also too confining, and continues to use phrase-final falls. Then comes the story of how he decided to write a novel ‚Äî and right up to the crucial moment of decision, he mostly ends his phrases with rises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andersen:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;So when you decided OK, this is I- I- I'm not gonna be&lt;br&gt;
uh a scientist, I'm not going to be uh&lt;br&gt;
a literature&lt;br&gt;
teacher&lt;br&gt;
then you- did you just simply make the decision OK I'm going to write novels and&lt;br&gt;
start writing them?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The books actually started/&lt;br&gt;
on a Saturday morning/  uh in- in uh  nineteen eighty one/&lt;br&gt;
I was living in the Fens/  just behind the Fine Arts Museum/&lt;br&gt;
the- the MFA in Boston/&lt;br&gt;
and there was a- a retrospective exhibition&lt;br&gt;
of the German photographer August Sander.&lt;br&gt;
and I had no prior exposure to this work/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andersen:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The early 20th century photographer?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;German photographer from the end of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century um&lt;br&gt;
and uh I remember going into this first American retrospective/&lt;br&gt;
and turning around the corner and/&lt;br&gt;
seeing this magnificent and haunting photograph, of these three young men&lt;br&gt;
in their Sunday best, walking along a muddy road just glancing out over their right shoulder as if&lt;br&gt;
suddenly surprised by the photographer.&lt;br&gt;
Leaning forward, reading the caption on this photo&lt;br&gt;
which read&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;three‚Äì or three young Westerwald farmers on their way to a dance, nineteen fourteen&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
So of course they were  not on their way to the dance that they thought they were on their way to/&lt;br&gt;
and just down the road was world war one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andersen:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And so you suddenly&lt;br&gt;
had your mission.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I did, I- I looked at that photograph/&lt;br&gt;
I had an almost intact story   in mind/&lt;br&gt;
this was a Saturday/&lt;br&gt;
on Monday I went in to- to my data processing job/&lt;br&gt;
and gave my two weeks notice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From then on, Powers reverts to falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andersen:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It sounds as though you had a mission for a career of fiction writing, not just a book.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;((Well I'm)) I'm not sure it's a mission, I think it's simply&lt;br&gt;
the shape that my own temperament takes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm skeptical that there's any systematic difference between the rises often used with yes/no questions, and the rises used for various other reasons, as in Powers' story.¬† As an additional andecdotal piece of evidence in this discussion,¬† here's a comparison (at the scale of¬† time and pitch display) between the end of Andersen's question and the start of Powers' answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Andersen:&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Ä¶ did you just simply make the decision OK I&amp;#39;m going to write novels and&lt;br&gt;
start writing them/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RichardPowers0a.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt; The books actually started/&lt;br&gt;
on a Saturday morning/  uh in- in uh  nineteen eighty one/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RichardPowers0b.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really address this question in a responsible way, of course, would require comparing the dynamics of¬† a large number of examples of both kinds, paying careful attention to the alignment of the pitch contour with the syllable sequence and with the amplitude contour. But these are among the many examples that make me doubt that there's a systematic difference in such cases (as has sometimes been suggested) between rises that start at the bottom of the speaker's range and rises that start higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd also want to try some perception experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the picture, "&lt;a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Farmers_on_Their_Way_to_a_Dance"&gt;Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ThreeFarmers.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another version of the story is &lt;a href="http://www.parisreview.com/media/298_POWERS.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in a 2003 interview published in the Paris Review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;INTERVIEWER&lt;br&gt;
When did you begin your writing career?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;RICHARD POWERS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In the early eighties, I was living in the Fens in Boston right behind the Museum of Fine Arts. If you got there before noon on Saturdays, you could get into the museum for nothing. One weekend, they were having this exhibition of a German photographer I‚Äôd never heard of, who was August Sander. It was the first American retrospective of his work. I have a visceral memory of coming in the doorway, banking to the left, turning up, and seeingthe first picture there. It was called &lt;em&gt;Young Westerwald Farmers on Their Way to a Dance&lt;/em&gt;, 1914. I had this palpable sense of recognition, this feeling that I was walking into their gaze, and they‚Äôd been waiting seventy years for someone to return the gaze. I went up to the photograph and read the caption and had this instant realization that not only were they &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on the way to the dance, but that somehow I had been reading about this moment for the last year and a half. Everything I read seemed to converge onto this act of looking, this birth of the twentieth century‚Äîthe age of total war, the age of the apotheosis of the machine, the age of mechanical reproduction. That was a Saturday. On Monday I went in to my job and gave two weeks notice and started working on &lt;em&gt;Three Farmers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256728199990"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/mr_deity_episode_9_mr_deity_an.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/972a09a70da47ebe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Mr. Deity Episode 9: Mr. Deity and the Book</title><published>2009-10-28T10:02:16Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T10:02:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/ohq9y-xtZ4c/mr_deity_episode_9_mr_deity_an.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/mr_deity_episode_9_mr_deity_an.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/yDTo2XpLa5s%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/mr_deity_episode_9_mr_deity_an.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/ohq9y-xtZ4c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256727950597"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=17713">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f3666ebda5eb45b6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Secular Coalition for America"/><title type="html">Wonderful Segments About Atheism Featured on The Boston Channel</title><published>2009-10-28T11:00:28Z</published><updated>2009-10-28T11:00:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/28/wonderful-segments-about-atheism-featured-on-the-boston-channel/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, The Boston Channel featured several segments on the topic of being ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://www.thebostonchannel.com/chronicle/21393672/detail.html"&gt;Good Without God&lt;/a&gt;.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

In one sense the doctor is giving you a clean bill of health. But there&amp;#39;s the chance they have made a mistake. What&amp;#39;s more, if the symptoms persist without explanation, you face the stigma and frustration of people suspecting your problems are &amp;quot;merely&amp;quot; psychological or, worse still, made up. A new study has investigated neurology patients who were told that their symptoms had no identifiable physical cause, following them for a year and a half to see if and how their diagnoses changed.Jon Stone and his colleagues recruited the help of 36 consultant neurologists working in Scotland&amp;#39;s main neurology clinics. Besides a minority of patients who were excluded for being too young or ill, records were kept from nearly all new neurology cases in Scotland between December 2002 and February 2004.Of the 3781 available patients, around a third were diagnosed as having symptoms that were either &amp;quot;somewhat&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;not at all&amp;quot; explained by physical disease, as opposed to being &amp;quot;largely&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;completely&amp;quot; explained. Of these unexplained cases, the majority were told by their neurologists either simply that their symptoms were unexplained or that they had a headache or that they had conversion symptoms (the physical manifestation of an emotional problem). In a minority of cases, patients were given vague diagnoses such as &amp;quot;pain symptoms&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fatigue&amp;quot;. Had the story changed much 19 months later? Through contact with the patients&amp;#39; GPs (their primary physicians), Stone&amp;#39;s team found just four cases where the neurologist had confidently declared the patient&amp;#39;s symptoms as unexplainable, but where an organic illness had subsequently been diagnosed - these were multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Disease and two forms of brain lesion.About 100 other patients had also subsequently received a change of diagnosis, but in most of these cases it was simply that an organic cause that had previously been identified as &amp;quot;somewhat explaining&amp;quot; the symptoms was now seen as the sole cause. In other cases, the initial neurological diagnosis had allowed for the possibility that a physical diagnosis might later be found; a genuinely new condition had emerged; or in some cases, the first neurologist still disputed the subsequent organic diagnosis made by another doctor. There were also five deaths, although these were apparently unrelated to the patients&amp;#39; earlier symptoms. &amp;quot;New diagnoses that explained the original symptoms rarely emerged over the following 18 months in this study,&amp;quot; the researchers said. &amp;quot;Whilst the diagnoses of &amp;#39;symptoms unexplained by organic disease&amp;#39; must continue to be made with care, the data presented here suggest that serious diagnostic change after an initial clinical assessment by a consultant neurologist is unusual.&amp;quot;  _________________________________Stone J, Carson A, Duncan R, Coleman R, Roberts R, Warlow C, Hibberd C, Murray G, Cull R, Pelosi A, Cavanagh J, Matthews K, Goldbeck R, Smyth R, Walker J, Macmahon AD, &amp;amp; Sharpe M (2009).

&lt;p&gt;To be more precise, the 6th General Meeting of the International Proteolysis Society held at the Marriot Hotel in Surfers Paradise. As one can expect in Queensland at this time of year, the weather is warm and very humid (read:&lt;em&gt; lovely&lt;/em&gt;). We arrived at the end of a weekend of street car racing, so much of the centre of town is still cordoned off with barriers, fences and large signs for beer companies. Evidence of a recent bogan invasion is rife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:267px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5864.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:6px" title="IMG_5864" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5864-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_5864" width="257" height="191"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poolside at the Marriot Hotel, Surfers Paradise. The famous natural reef complete with tropical fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the conference delegates are clearly excited to be in such a location, one even stating that it is proof that ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;proteolysis takes you to paradise!&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù Suffice to say, there is a definite tropical/resort atmosphere and attitude permeating proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:270px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5865.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:6px 10px" title="IMG_5865" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5865-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_5865" width="260" height="194"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is hard (*does a little jig*)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we must not forget this is about the science, and in particular, proteases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are proteases?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially they are enzymes, (like the ones you may have heard about on television commercials for washing powder), which are responsible for chewing up and recycling proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remember back to high school genetics, you would recall that DNA, which is made up of hundreds of thousands of genes, (about twenty three thousand in the case of the human genome) holds the code for all our proteins. Enzymes are a class of these proteins, assigned many and varied tasks, such as protecting our cells from stress, helping to protect our DNA from damage and recycling damaged proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proteases (which are also enzymes) have varied roles including turning other proteins on and off and helping our cells to reproduce. But, like many functions in the human body such as the immune system, sometimes things can go wrong and instead of being useful, become toxic and cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we need proteases to survive, they can also contribute to illnesses such as cancer. One particular type of protease known as ‚Äúcathepsin S‚Äù on one hand, helps our immune system fight invading pathogens, but on the other, has been shown to assist in the spread of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And humans are not the only ones who need proteases to survive. Parasites such a malaria and hookworm (a member of the Helmith family) need them to extract energy from their food. And in the case of these critters, human blood is what they love!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about Malaria?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaria remains a huge global health crisis; 1 child dies every 5 seconds, there are 5 million cases every year of which 2 million die and a further 3 billion people are at risk of infection. The majority of these people are in the developing world and many are children less than 5 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:295px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/r318111_1412821.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border:2px solid black;margin:6" title="r318111_1412821" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/r318111_1412821.jpg" alt="r318111_1412821" width="285" height="191"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr McGowan at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Sheena McGowan is a structural biologist from Monash University in Melbourne who has been &lt;a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/news/newsline/story/1412"&gt;studying the proteases of the malarial parasite&lt;/a&gt; in a search for new drugs. Her approach focuses on the feeding cycle of the malarial parasite which involves invading red blood cells and feeding on the haemoglobin by breaking it down into single elements. This ‚Äúbreaking down‚Äù process requires a protease, and Sheena has figured out if she can block the function of the protease, she could effectively starve the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with a large group of scientists from all across the world, Dr McGowan has been able to determine the precise structure of the malarial protease, using an approach known as X-ray crystallography (see below). This is a very complex and difficult process, but in principle, by obtaining crystals of the protease and firing X-ray beams at it, scientists can work out the shape and precise structure. This information then allows Sheena and her team to design compounds that will block it from working. A bit like putting a key in to a lock, but coating it with superglue first, so that it sticks really tight and never comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:282px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/malaria.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="malaria" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/malaria-300x214.jpg" alt="malaria" width="272" height="194"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crystal structure of the malarial digestion enzyme. The drug that may be able to inhibit it (&amp;quot;the key&amp;quot;) is shown in magenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr McGowan‚Äôs work will help address the burgeoning problem of malarial infection in the developing world, especially in places where severity of the infection is exacerbated by co-infection with other infectious diseases such as HIV or tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime there  is some good news on the malaria front, with a scheduled roll out of a vaccine across Africa in 2010. But, Dr McGowan is cautious to remind us that this will not be the end of the malaria scourge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, parasites are clever little buggers, rapidly evolving ways to get around our drugs. This is why work like that of Dr McGowan and her team is so important in tackling new and innovative methods to design new drugs against infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

He's just written a &lt;a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100014886/richard-dawkinss-latest-attack-on-the-catholic-church-is-vicious-and-crazy-the-man-needs-help/"&gt;brief, cranky complaint about Dawkins' righteous smackdown of the Catholic church&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the totality of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins's latest attack on the Catholic Church is worthy of a dribbling loony on the top of a bus. He calls the Church "the greatest force for evil in the world", "an institution where buggering altar boys pervades the culture" and describes it "dragging its skirts in the dirt and touting for business like a common pimp". (Pimps in skirts - that's a new one.) And &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/richard_dawkins/2009/10/give_us_your_misogynists_and_bigots.html"&gt;all in The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The peg for this piece? The Pope's offer to make special arrangements for Anglicans converting to Rome, a matter I would have thought was none of Prof Dawkins's business. But I'm not going to bother to argue with any of his points, because these are the ravings of a man who appears to have lost all sense of proportion. Seriously: is there something wrong with him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, no, Damian! What's wrong with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the quote-mining. He did not call the church "the greatest force for evil in the world". He asked a question, "What major institution most deserves the title of greatest force for evil in the world?", and gave a general answer, "In a field of stiff competition, the Roman Catholic Church is surely up there among the leaders." I would have thought that the English could comprehend their own language, but apparently that isn't necessarily true of religion columnists. Quelle surprise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Dawkins' characterization of the Catholic church was spot on, and justified by a recital of its flaws: that bizarre belief in transubstantiation, its misogyny, its deadly opposition to contraception in Africa, its homophobia, its history of pederasty. It's not simply a matter of administrative reshuffling of priests between the Church of England and the Vatican, as Thompson seems to imply, but an attempted merger brought about by enticing the most reactionary of the Anglican priesthood, something that will not correct the sins of the church, but worsen them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Dawkins wasn't the only person to notice the nasty implications of this merger. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/a_merger_in_the_offing_for_big.php"&gt;So did I&lt;/a&gt;. It's even the subject of some humor.&lt;/p&gt;

Apparently no one was injured. I have no clue how I missed this, but &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/6444895/Asteroid-explosion-over-Indonesia-raises-fears-about-Earths-defences.html"&gt;The Telegraph has the story&lt;/a&gt;. This is not an everyday occurrence, but 10 meter rocks probably do come in and explode high over the Earth‚Äôs surface every few years or so. If they‚Äôre rock they won‚Äôt make it to the ground; instead they blow up due to the incredible force of their passage through the air (in this case, the explosive yield was about 50 kilotons of TNT). Smaller rocks will rain down, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it‚Äôs metal, that would be worse. It might withstand the aerodynamic pressure and hit intact. However, like I said, this is pretty rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper article above plays up the &amp;quot;What if it were just a bit bigger?&amp;quot; aspect, which is true enough, but what can we do? A rock or chunk of metal 30 or so meters across is dangerous, sure, but is too small to see very far out, so there‚Äôs not much we can do about it. That‚Äôs not exactly great news. It‚Äôs possible it might get spotted a day or two in advance ‚Äî we‚Äôve seen smaller ones with a day‚Äôs warning ‚Äî but most likely our first warning would be the flash in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would cost a fortune, hundreds of millions or more, to set up telescopes to scan the sky deeply and quickly enough to see all these rocks. There are some ‚Äôscopes like that in the works, but I suspect the political will to create the network needed just isn‚Äôt there. It may take a few more impacts like the one over Indonesia before people start taking this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, we know of only animal apart from humans to regularly engage in fellatio - the short-nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus sphinx). 

The bat&amp;#39;s sexual antics have only just been recorded by Min Tan of China&amp;#39;s Guangdong Entomological Institute (who are either branching out, or are confused about entomology). Tan captured 60 wild bats from a nearby park, housed them in pairs of the opposite sex and voyeuristically filmed their liaisons using a night-time camera. Twenty of the bats got busy, and their exploits were all caught on video.

Male bats create tents by biting leaves until they fall into shape. These provide shelter and double as harems, each housing several females who the male mates with. Fruit bat sex goes like this: the female approaches and sniffs the male, and both partners start to lick one another. The male makes approaches with his thumbs (like the Fonz) and mounts the female (like the Fonz). Sex itself is the typical rhythmic thrusting that we&amp;#39;re used to, and afterwards, the male licks his own penis for several seconds.

But Tan also found that female bat will often bend down to lick the shaft of her mate&amp;#39;s penis during sex itself. This behaviour happened on 70% of the videos, making it the only known example of regular fellatio in a non-human animal. It also prolonged the sexual encounter - males never withdrew their penises when they were being licked and, on average, the behaviour bought the couple an extra 100 seconds of sex over and above the usual 2 minutes. The licking itself only lasted for 20 seconds on average, so each second of it buys six extra seconds of penetration. ¬†

NSFW - short-nosed fruit bats having sex. I will have you know that the music choice came with the video and has nothing to do with me.

Oral sex is rare in other animals. Bonobos do it (but really, what don&amp;#39;t they do?) but it&amp;#39;s more of a form of play among young males, and there&amp;#39;s one anecdotal instance of an orang-utan doing the same. Some animals, such as ring-tailed lemurs, lick each other&amp;#39;s genitals to judge whether they&amp;#39;re ready for mating, but there&amp;#39;s no evidence that they do so as an actual part of sex. As for other bats, it&amp;#39;s entirely possible that they too engage in oral sex. However, given their inaccessible roosts and nocturnal habits, we&amp;#39;re largely in their dark about their sex lives. 

Nonetheless, Tan suggests a few possible reasons for the short-nosed fruit bat&amp;#39;s penchant for fellatio, aside from the anthropocentric conclusion of &amp;#39;pleasure-giving&amp;#39;. Bat penises contain erectile tissue much like our own. It gets stiffer if it&amp;#39;s stimulated, so females could use oral sex to prolong their encounters with males, by maintain their erections or lubricating it for easier entry. 

While many of us might nod sagely at the need for longer sex, Tan suggests that for the bats, it could mean easier transport of sperm to the oviduct, or more secretions from the female that are conducive to fertilisation. It could also be a way of hogging a mate, keeping him away from rival females. 

Alternatively, the antiseptic properties of saliva might help to strip the male&amp;#39;s penis of bacteria or fungi, and prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. The fact that males lick their own penises after sex supports this idea. ¬†

And finally, oral sex might help females to pick up chemical traces on her mate that might suggest if he&amp;#39;s a suitable mate. Obviously, they&amp;#39;d already be having sex, but female mammals often exert choice over their sexual partners after the fact, rejecting sperm from inferior males, or encouraging congress with superior ones to displace it. All of these explanations are just hypotheses for the moment, but they could all be tested in the future.

Yvonne Martin (previously at Abbott) has a nice article about why tautomers are important in drug design and what are the continuing challenges in predicting and understanding them. This should be a good reminder for both experimentalists and theoreticians to consider tautomerism in their projects.So why are tautomers important? For one thing, a particular tautomer of a drug molecule might be the one that binds to its protein target. More importantly, this tautomer might be the minor tautomer in solution, so knowing the major tautomer in solution may not always help determine the form bound to a protein. This bears analogy with conformational equilibria in which the conformer binding to a protein more often than not is a minor conformer. Martin illustrates some remarkable cases in which both tautomers of a particular kinase inhibitor were observed in the same crystal structure. In many cases, quantum chemical calculations indicate a considerable energy different between the minor protein-bound tautomer and its major counterpart. A further fundamental complication arises from the fact that solvent changes hugely impact tautomer equilibria, and not enough data is always available on tautomers in aqueous solution because of problems like solubility.Thus, predicting tautomers is crucial if you want to deal with ligands bound to proteins. It is also important for predicting parameters like logP and blood brain barrier penetration which in turn depend on accurate estimations of hydrophobicity. Different tautomers have different hydrophobicities, and Martin indicates that different methods and programs can sometimes calculate different values of hydrophobicity for a given tautomer, which will directly impact important calculations of logP and blood-brain penetration. It will also affect computational calculations like docking and QSAR where tautomer state will be crucial.Sadly, there is not enough experimental data on tautomer equilibria. Such data is also admittedly hard to obtain; the net pKa of a compound is a result of all tautomers contributing to its equilibrium, and the number of tautomers can sometimes be tremendous; for instance 8-oxoguanine which is a well known DNA lesion caused by radiation can exist in 100 or so ionic and neutral tautomers. Now let's say you want to dock this compound to a protein to predict a ligand orientation. Which tautomer on earth do you possibly choose?Clearly calculating tautomers can be very important for drug design. As Martin mentions, more experimental as well cas theoretical data on tautomers is necessary; however such research, similar to solvation measurements discussed in a past post, usually falls under the title of "too basic" and therefore may not be funded by the NIH. But whether funded or not, successful ligand design cannot prevail without consideration of tautomers. What was that thing about basic research yielding its worth many times over in applications?Martin, Y. (2009).

Here are the results after a bit more than a day:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Poll About My Book WIBA:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It looks interesting and on my wish list  19 (24%)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm currently reading it 14 (17%)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've read it but it contains nothing new  5 (6%)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've read it and recommend it to others  6 (7%)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've read it and highly recommend it to others  17 (21%)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't know of it until now  8 (10%)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most people who visit DC do not vote on polls and since I have some Christians who fear my book and influence they'll lie for Jesus by voting that "it contains nothing new." Maybe it doesn't, but this poll isn't scientific so we cannot know what people really think. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What intrigues me is the number of people who have not heard of it. Their name is &lt;i&gt;Legion&lt;/i&gt; to use a Biblical term. But now they do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know readers might be a bit tired of this kind of promotion, but since my publisher isn't doing it who else will? After a bit more than a day I learned that 10% of the people who visit DC (and who also vote) have not heard of it. That's why I continually promote it. I promote it for &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/10/question-about-most-effective-way-to.html"&gt;these stated reasons alone&lt;/a&gt;. I am not in this for the money, although donations are appreciated since I must have it to live the meager lifestyle I do. I'm in it to change the religious landscape one person at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope you understand and are thankful I didn't leave the poll up for weeks. ;-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carry on.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6318868775003715263?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Joe's latest post starts off like this:&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to introduce you to my friend Terri. She is a person of simplicity, and yet her depth of character has you looking down and not seeing bottom. Being a complicated person is not what I am talking about. Any chick ‚Äì any dude, for that matter ‚Äì can be complicated, conflicted, unpredictable, with ‚Äúissues.‚Äù That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about at all. I‚Äôm talking about a person who is enough of an individual to have a personality you can nail down. You can predict them, and yet they can teach and surprise you in unforeseen ways.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A French court has convicted the Church of Scientology of fraud, but stopped short of banning the group from operating in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two branches of the group‚Äôs operations and several of its leaders in France have been fined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case came after complaints from two women, one of whom said she was manipulated into paying more than 20,000 euros (¬£18,100) in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Scientology spokesman told the BBC the verdict was ‚Äúall bark and no bite‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France regards Scientology as a sect, not a religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had asked for the group‚Äôs French operations to be dissolved and more heavily fined, but a legal loophole prevented any ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, a Paris judge ordered the Church‚Äôs Celebrity Centre and a bookshop to pay a 600,000-euro fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alain Rosenberg, the group‚Äôs head in France, was handed a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined 30,000 euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three other leading members of the group were also fined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, given the Church of Scientology‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_controversy#Litigation_as_Harassment_of_Critics"&gt;overly litigious nature&lt;/a&gt; and proclivity for targeting their critics as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_controversy#Fair_Game"&gt;‚Äúfair game‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; for a number of aggressive strong-arm tactics, it is refreshing to see someone stand up so strongly to them.¬† I suppose that more and more people are getting tired of the CoS &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/cults.html"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt; and their quest for brainwashing &amp;amp; manipulating their members.¬† But, you can expect the CoS to continue their loathsome practices for as long as they are able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they can try, but as long as they do there will be &lt;a href="http://xenu.net"&gt;those who oppose them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because as an adherent to reality, I‚Äôm not allowed to just make stuff up. &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-2383-Honolulu-Exopolitics-Examiner~y2009m10d21-Official-disclosure-of-extraterrestrial-life-is-imminent" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sadly, others need not follow that rule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;An official announcement by the Obama administration disclosing the reality of extraterrestrial life is imminent&amp;quot;, indeed. What does &lt;em&gt;imminent&lt;/em&gt; mean? A year? 10? I‚Äôm guessing never. But as long as the antiscience advocates can use words like &lt;em&gt;soon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;imminent&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;impending&lt;/em&gt;, they can keep their believers on the hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why am I not surprised to see &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/hoagland/"&gt;Richard Hoagland‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; name in that article?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every now and again I have to do that comical rapid-shaking-of-the-head accompanied by that wugga wugga wugga sound when I think that people actually buy into this, um, stuff. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚Äì&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, Hemant posted the interview in which Scientologist spokesman Tommy Davis &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/25/scientology-spokesperson-cant-admit-hi-own-beliefs/"&gt;walked off set&lt;/a&gt; instead of answering a question about his belief.  We can criticize him for being unwilling to admit his own beliefs, but it‚Äôs not as if he‚Äôll suffer much.  His stunt has gotten him and his church more attention.¬† Most of the publicity is negative, and yet some people are still convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicly revealing someone to be a fake/idiot doesn‚Äôt hurt them as much as we think.¬†  It‚Äôs something James Randi has discovered countless times, from his battles with Uri Geller to his expos√© of Peter Popoff (who, by the way, is &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxqRN5vjDHQ"&gt;back to his old tricks scamming people in need&lt;/a&gt;).¬†  But Randi has made unique use of the dramatic insult and walk off technique, and his ‚ÄúCarlos Hoax‚Äù came to my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1988, James Randi and 60 minutes hatched a plan to show how easy it is for con men to exploit the media.¬† Randi created a fake spirit-channeler named Carlos and pitted him against the Australian media ‚Äì a group known for their harsh interviews and skepticism.¬† In one week they had gained a following and booked a packed show at the Opera House.¬† During an interview in which Carlos‚Äô methods were being challenged, his manager threw water on the host and stormed off.¬†  That in turn sparked more media attention.¬†  This is a long video and I‚Äôm starting it at the most relevant part, but if this sounds interesting to you (I was fascinated) I recommend the whole thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid%3D8392582596446539758%26hl%3Den%26fs%3Dtrue&amp;amp;width=100&amp;amp;height=100&amp;amp;flashVars=initialTime%3D1293" width="100" height="100"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Around 8 minutes, before I started this clip] One of the roles the Australian media prides itself on is to protect the public from frauds and charlatans.  But it does give rise to a problem: in pursuing a questionable character like Carlos, do you end up playing into his hand by giving him too much free publicity?  After all, even if you do the best job you can in exposing him, there will still be people vulnerable enough to be taken in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[end of clip] Why should such a phony care if he had to go through such grillings on TV?¬† He was able to gain access to vulnerable minds who otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have heard of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worry that Tommy Davis won some people over by storming off with an outraged air.¬† Creating a ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù can give people the impression that there must be something to the argument.  That‚Äôs why so many scientists refuse to debate creationism ‚Äì the very debate will lend undeserved credibility to nonsense.  Of course, if a topic isn‚Äôt publicly debunked, it can fester in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to come down on the side of public skepticism and scrutiny of ideas, but I‚Äôm young and idealistic.  I believe that honesty is the best policy and open conversation will tend to expose the truth.¬† I do, however, see the argument for the other side.¬† What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jesse Galef</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://friendlyatheist.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://friendlyatheist.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Friendly Atheist</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256677647818"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=20683">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0ea4678044553491</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="SuperFreakonomics"/><category term="television"/><title type="html">Pray for Me: I'm Going on The Daily Show Tonight</title><published>2009-10-27T20:05:32Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T20:05:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/pray-for-me-im-going-on-the-daily-show-tonight/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The first time I went on &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt;, nearly five years ago, I dreaded it for weeks in advance.

Protons and lead ions were threaded in two directions around part of the ring before being dumped, and everything worked without a hitch.  The graphs show the ion beam spot entering Collision Point 2 before being dumped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/10/TestWeekEnd_26October2009.gif" alt="TestWeekEnd_26October2009" title="TestWeekEnd_26October2009" width="294" height="200"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LHC machine commissioning will pick up where it left off more than a year ago, and the plan is, if all goes well, to collide beams of protons in the experiments at a center of mass energy of 7 TeV (3.5 TeV per beam) before the end of the year.  The luminosity will not be large at first, but should increase steadily with time until next fall, when the long shutdown to retrofit the remaining magnets with new quench detection and helium pressure relief systems begins.  By that point the experiments hope to have accumulated upwards of 200 pb&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of integrated luminosity.  This initial data sample is sorely needed to shake down the detectors and start tuning up the event reconstruction and analysis.  And who knows, maybe we‚Äôll see something totally unexpected.  (Please, no black hole comments!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next main milestone will be beam circulating around the whole ring and captured by the RF system.  That should happen by &lt;a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/lhc%2Dfirst%2Dphysics/schedule/"&gt;mid-November&lt;/a&gt;.

Kimball&lt;/a&gt;, future prophet of the LD$ church, in which he actually claims to have seen native Americans turning whiter ("becoming white and delightsome") as a result of activity within the Mormon church:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw a striking contrast in the progress of the Indian people today.... The day of the Lamanites is nigh. For years they have been growing delightsome, and they are now becoming white and delightsome, as they were promised. In this picture of the twenty Lamanite missionaries, fifteen of the twenty were as light as Anglos, five were darker but equally delightsome The children in the home placement program in Utah are often lighter than their brothers and sisters in the hogans on the reservation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one meeting a father and mother and their sixteen-year-old daughter were present, the little member girl--sixteen--sitting between the dark father and mother, and it was evident she was several shades lighter than her parents--on the same reservation, in the same hogan, subject to the same sun and wind and weather....These young members of the Church are changing to whiteness and to delightsomeness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holy fucking shit, I mean, I knew these guys were despicable and retarded, but &lt;i&gt;wow&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;That act requires insurers to cover care for mental and behavioral problems at the same levels they do for physical illnesses. The ruling came as part of a lawsuit filed by &lt;a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/"&gt;Consumer Watchdog&lt;/a&gt;, a Santa Monica advocacy organization, against the California Department of Managed Health Care to require the agency to side with consumers when insurers refuse to pay for ABA therapy. The ruling also clears the way for a trial to determine whether the department, which is responsible for regulating health plans, is doing enough to require insurers to cover such treatment. A spokeswoman for the department said the ruling would not change the way it handled disputes over autism therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A branch of Toronto‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://www.sickkids.ca/"&gt;Hospital for Sick Children &lt;/a&gt;is being criticized for funding an autism conference whose organizers champion the belief that childhood immunization causes the neurological disorder. The event, slated to start Saturday at the University of Toronto, also includes presentations that some experts are calling unproven science, promoting such alternative treatments for autism as homeopathy and hyperbaric oxygen chambers. Organized by &lt;a href="http://www.autismone.org/"&gt;AutismOne &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.autismcanada.org/"&gt;Autism Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the meeting has received $5,000 in funding from SickKids Foundation, the hospital‚Äôs fundraising wing. Blogs designed to expose practitioners of dubious science have railed against the event for the past two months.¬†A spokeswoman for the foundation said the grant was awarded in May after Autism Canada submitted a detailed application. The Foundation also indicated that it takes a ‚Äúneutral stance‚Äù on alternative and complementary health care for children, and has a history of funding it.&lt;/p&gt;

The James Randi Educational Foundation &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/745-the-houdini-seance-live-on-the-internet.html"&gt;will be holding a seance to contact the spirit of Harry Houdini live on the internet&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houdini was a hero to James Randi, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Houdini#Yearly_s.C3.A9ances"&gt;he famously said&lt;/a&gt; that if there were an afterlife, he would do whatever he could after he died to contact his wife. She held a seance, and‚Ä¶ nothing happened. However, when you have people like Randi and magician Andrew Mayne involved, why, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; can happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, maybe not anything. Like, say, actually contacting a dead spirit. But I bet this will be a very fun event, and I encourage all skeptics and believers ‚Äî especially believers ‚Äî young and old to drop in.

The chair didn‚Äôt stay empty for long. It has been &lt;a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/comms/61.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Michael Green will become the new Lucasian Professor. Green is one of the pioneers of string theory, and is already at Cambridge. I‚Äôm not sure he even switches offices, or chairs for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking did seminal work in general relativity. He proved a number of singularity theorems (with Roger Penrose). He wrote The Large Scale Structure of Spacetime (with George Ellis). John Wheeler conjectured that quiescent black holes have ‚Äúno hair‚Äù (i.e., all black holes look identical, being distinguished only by mass, charge, and angular momentum), and Hawking (with Israel, Carter, and Robinson) proved this to be true. Hawking is a true expert on gravity, which seems completely appropriate for someone donning Newton‚Äôs mantle. Does Green‚Äôs appointment indicate that, at least in Cambridge‚Äôs mind, string theory is the anointed successor to general relativity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking sat in the Lucasian Chair for three decades. Green is expected to occupy it for a little less than four years, at which point he reaches Lucasian retirement age (67). Aren‚Äôt there any young whippersnappers worthy of the seat?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>daniel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256673109299"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2353">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/df3786a3e6b5a32c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Public Health"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="Vaccines"/><title type="html">The effective wordsmithing of Amy Wallace</title><published>2009-10-27T19:30:02Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T19:30:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2353" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most engaging and clearly-written pieces of science journalism over the last year or so was published in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; magazine last week.  Now in the midst of a firestorm of attention, Amy Wallace‚Äôs, &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/all/1"&gt;‚ÄúAn Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us All,‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; is part interview with rotavirus vaccine developer, pediatric infectious disease physician and immunologist, Dr Paul Offit, and description of the anti-vaccination movement in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace‚Äôs work is the centerpiece of a masterful collection of smaller articles providing science-based information about vaccination that also refuts common anti-vaccination myths including &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience_argument"&gt;‚ÄúHow To Win An Argument About Vaccines‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience_misinformants"&gt;‚ÄúThe Misinformants: Prominent Voices in the Anti-Vaccine Crusade‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wired‚Äôs follow-up discussion of the issue includes, &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/a-short-history-of-vaccine-panic/"&gt;‚ÄúA Short History of Vaccine Panic,‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; for those of us who ‚Äúhave a day job‚Äù and not enough time to read Paul Offit‚Äôs 2008 book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Autisms-False-Prophets-Science-Medicine/dp/0231146361"&gt;‚ÄúAutism‚Äôs False Prophets.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I have to admit that it wasn‚Äôt until I began blogging four years ago that I realized just how vocal the anti-vaccination movement was in the United States.  I come from a time (just on the tail end of the Baby Boom) where I still have relatives who were afflicted with polio and other now-preventable infectious diseases. From my hometown of Wallington, NJ ‚Äì a stone‚Äôs throw from New York City ‚Äì Bill Michalski writes in &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/nyregion/by-the-way-constructive-crotchetiness.html"&gt;‚ÄúPoland On The Passaic‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; how the fear of polio spread through town during the 1930s and 40s, with white flags hung out on front porches to warn away visitors. The devastation of these childhood illnesses makes the risks (yes, I agree there are some risks) of vaccination itself inconsequential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is a risk-benefit proposition but one where someone else‚Äôs view affects us all.  Lack of vaccination compromises ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù that keeps us all safe, for example, from diseases like smallpox that have been eliminated from the face of the earth. Your vaccination is also important to others who may be immunosuppressed from cancer drugs, HIV/AIDS, or, in the case of someone close to me, immunosuppressant drugs to prevent organ transplant rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have commented widely on Wallace‚Äôs article for its scientific and medical accuracy.  However, I wanted to focus more so on the effectiveness of the writing as a scientific communication tool because much of the article gives the reader a concise view of issues and psychology that often take typical bloggers thousands of words to express (and still less effectively!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is Paul Offit Perceived as Evil?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wallace does a terrific job of showing us just how scary life is for Paul Offit and his family (with death threats reminiscent of those by animal rights and anti-abortion activists). He is a doc at the Children‚Äôs Hospital in Philadelphia and, as mentioned earlier, is one of the developers of a vaccine for rotavirus sold commercially as RotaTeq¬Æ. While not particularly deadly (although the parents of the 20-60 dead US infants and toddlers annually may beg to differ ‚Äì as well as those of the half million worldwide), rotavirus causes a severe form of acute diarrhea in several hundred thousand US children annually under age 5. If you‚Äôve had a kid with it, you wish they didn‚Äôt have to endure it if a vaccine would prevent the infection and sequelae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace also describes how Offit was in the hospital with kids suffering from polio in the mid-1950s.  Hence, unlike many of today‚Äôs anti-vaccination advocates, Offit was influenced deeply and early by witnessing firsthand the devastation of now-preventable infectious diseases.  That‚Äôs the world in which my parents and grandparents lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt was a pretty lonely, isolating experience,‚Äù Offit says. ‚ÄúBut what was even worse was looking at these other children who were just horribly crippled and disfigured by polio.‚Äù That memory, he says, was the first thing that drove him toward a career in pediatric infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace goes on to describe a case in 1977 where, as an intern, Offit observed the death of a child from rotavirus, being surprised that the disease still killed kids. I‚Äôd say that many of us in science and medicine were influenced similarly by watershed events in our lives that led to pursuit of our respective career tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-vaccination advocates often criticize Offit for being in the pocket of Big Pharma (whatever that really means) because he made $50 million from the development of the RotaTeq vaccine.  Offit admits to it being several million ‚Äì a much more realistic number given what I know about deals made by institutions vs. remaining payouts to individual scientists ‚Äì and he has every right to benefit from the intellectual property he has developed from his hard work. Offit has a four-bedroom house with his wife (who is also a pediatrician) and they each drive a Toyota Camry. He does not appear to have an extravagant lifestyle and, to be honest, why should we begrudge him if he did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offit acknowledges that he received a payout ‚Äî ‚Äúseveral million dollars, a lot of money‚Äù ‚Äî when his hospital sold its stake in RotaTeq last year for $182 million. He continues to collect a royalty each year. It‚Äôs a fluke, he says ‚Äî an unexpected outcome. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not embarrassed about it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was the product of a lot of work, although it wasn‚Äôt why I did the work, nor was it, frankly, the reward for the work.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of us who have our kids vaccinated for rotavirus and I‚Äôm perfectly happy for Offit to collect a royalty.  (I‚Äôd even encourage him to buy a more comfortable vehicle because I know how unnerving the Philadelphia commute can be.). Does this make him evil?  In fact, last week the CDC &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5841a2.htm?s_cid=mm5841a2_e"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine is already responsible for reducing cases and hospitalizations for rotavirus. If that‚Äôs the definition of evil then I aspire to be evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace also notes indirectly that the anti-vaccination movement is doing just what they accuse Offit of doing: making money off of the situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this year‚Äôs Autism One conference in Chicago, I flashed more than once on Carl Sagan‚Äôs idea of the power of an ‚Äúunsatisfied medical need.‚Äù Because a massive research effort has yet to reveal the precise causes of autism, pseudo-science has stepped aggressively into the void. In the hallways of the Westin O‚ÄôHare hotel, helpful salespeople strove to catch my eye as I walked past a long line of booths pitching everything from vitamins and supplements to gluten-free cookies (some believe a gluten-free diet alleviates the symptoms of autism), hyperbaric chambers, and neuro-feedback machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, where the science is not yet complete, pseudoscience (and the attendant hucksters and vultures) seem to fill the void.  The difference between them and Offit: the product Offit developed has extensive scientific data to back up its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency of Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But getting back to what impressed me most about Wallace‚Äôs article was how concisely she presented her content. Here, she sums up one of my discussion points above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, because the looming risk of childhood death is out of sight, it is also largely out of mind, leading a growing number of Americans to worry about what is in fact a much lesser risk: the ill effects of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To describe the hypocrisy of an Offit opponent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence the death threats against Paul Offit. Curt Linderman Sr., the host of ‚ÄúLinderman Live!‚Äù on AutismOne Radio and the editor of a blog called the Autism File, recently wrote online that it would ‚Äúbe nice‚Äù if Offit ‚Äúwas dead.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd met Linderman at Autism One. He‚Äôd given his card to me as we stood outside the Westin O‚ÄôHare talking about his autistic son. ‚ÄúWe live in a very toxic world,‚Äù he‚Äôd told me, puffing on a cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To describe the logical trapping of pseudoscience believers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .the astronomer Carl Sagan reached a similar conclusion: Science loses ground to pseudo-science because the latter seems to offer more comfort. ‚ÄúA great many of these belief systems address real human needs that are not being met by our society,‚Äù Sagan wrote of certain Americans‚Äô embrace of reincarnation, channeling, and extraterrestrials. ‚ÄúThere are unsatisfied medical needs, spiritual needs, and needs for communion with the rest of the human community.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back over human history, rationality has been the anomaly. Being rational takes work, education, and a sober determination to avoid making hasty inferences, even when they appear to make perfect sense. Much like infectious diseases themselves ‚Äî beaten back by decades of effort to vaccinate the populace ‚Äî the irrational lingers just below the surface, waiting for us to let down our guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To describe how people evaluate, incorrectly, perceived vs. actual risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perceived risk ‚Äî our changing relationship to it and our increasing intolerance of it ‚Äî is at the crux of vaccine safety concerns, not to mention related fears of pesticides, genetically modified food, and cloning. Sharon Kaufman, a medical anthropologist at UC San Francisco, observes that our concept of risk has evolved from an external threat that‚Äôs out of our control (think: statistical probability of a plane crash) to something that can be managed and controlled if we just make the right decisions (eat less fat and you‚Äôll live longer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We scientists can do well to be students of Ms. Wallace‚Äôs efficiency with words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Wired demonstrates that, like the rest of us who employ the scientific method to evaluate data, it‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/answering-your-questions-about-thimerosal"&gt;okay to admit&lt;/a&gt; (as well as the responsible thing to do) when one makes a mistake and then describe the consequences, or lack thereof, of the misstatement.  For example, Wallace‚Äôs article did mistakenly state that vaccines no longer contain thimerosal (ethylmercury), an anti-microbial preservative that has proven safe in over a dozen studies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An earlier version of this story suggested that no childhood vaccines contain thimerosal; in fact some versions of the influenza vaccine, which is not typically mandated for children‚Äôs admission to school, does contain the preservative. Go here for &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/answering-your-questions-about-thimerosal"&gt;a further explanation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amy Wallace the Journalist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finally, what I think also impresses me is Amy Wallace herself and her approach to this article.  Wallace is not your typical science journalist.  The majority of &lt;a href="http://amy-wallace.com/web-content/framesetarticles.html"&gt;her portfolio&lt;/a&gt; is comprised of works on Hollywood and the entertainment industry.  She is not a lobbyist or otherwise a representative of the pharmaceutical industry ‚Äì as you might guess, she is already being accused of being such by anti-vax advocates, In fact, &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; has published &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/who-is-this-amy-wallace-anyway/"&gt;a follow-up&lt;/a&gt; on Ms. Wallace‚Äôs background in response to a misinformation campaign about her that has already developed. (Nor this hasn‚Äôt stopped the anti-vax commenters from stating that the entire &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; feature is a paid hit job for the pharmaceutical industry.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the facts don‚Äôt support an opponent‚Äôs view on a pharmaceutical or therapeutic issue, the tendency is an intellectually lazy cry of ‚ÄúPharma Shill.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace‚Äôs approach to Offit himself is, I think, so effective because she is supremely experienced at writing about personalities, their inner workings, and how they are viewed by the public.  As an entertainment writer, she also has to delve into the truths behind the motivations of people and get past appearances and hype.  She went above and beyond in giving time and publicity to anti-vaccination advocates, and their websites, and pretty much gave the reader all they need to make up their own minds about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, all of scientists with whom I communicate on blogs and Twitter have agreed that the science reported in Wallace‚Äôs article is almost entirely valid and supported by solid, published data. Dr. Gorski has, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2211"&gt;registered his support&lt;/a&gt; here at SBM back on October 20th.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the combination of scientific validity, her engaging writing style, and historical/psychological commentary on pseudoscience comes together to create an example of what science journalism can and should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record-setting pageviews for &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; and froth in the comments from anti-vaccination activists tells us all we need to know about how influential Ms. Wallace‚Äôs article is already ‚Äì and will continue to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage SBM readers to follow Ms. Wallace on her Twitter feed &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/msamywallace"&gt;@msamywallace&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning last evening, she began writing about the e-mail she has received, both hateful and supportive, regarding her story.  She notes that in 25 years of professional journalism (NYT, LATimes, etc.), she has never received such volume and vitriol of communications on any other topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a Tuesday morning, while I wandered, cold and yawning,&lt;br&gt;
Up the grimy stair steps winding skyward toward my office door,&lt;br&gt;
On the wall's bile-greenish surface, noticed I a note whose purpose&lt;br&gt;
Took more consciousness to process than I'd had the step before.&lt;br&gt;
"English majors strike," I murmured, "with tactics I've not seen before,&lt;br&gt;
Reciting Poe and nothing more."&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite the risk of provoking the ire of believers, we should discuss the actions of religious institutions as we would those of all others ‚Äî courteously and vigorously. This is a mark of respect, an indication that we take such ideas seriously. To slip on the kid gloves is condescending, akin to the way you would treat children or the frail or cats. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . My political beliefs, my ideas about social justice, are as deeply held as my critics‚Äô religious beliefs, but I don‚Äôt ask them to treat me with reverence, only civility. They should not expect me to walk on tiptoe. It is not as if religious institutions occupy a precarious perch in American life. It is not the proclaimed Christian but the nonbeliever who is unelectable to high office in this era when politicians of every party and denomination make a public display of their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure what he means by ‚Äútaking such ideas seriously.‚Äù If he means ‚Äúaccepting that the ideas &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be credible,‚Äù I disagree.¬† By now we all know whether we find the assertions of religion credible, and yet we continue to argue about them when they‚Äôre not.¬† If¬† by ‚Äúseriously‚Äù he means ‚Äúrealizing that these ideas have a real impact on society,‚Äù then I‚Äôm with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen also has a few words about media coverage of the Vatican‚Äôs attempt at Anglican-poaching:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so it is disheartening that the editorial pages of our most important newspapers did not castigate the Vatican‚Äôs invitation to misogyny and homophobia. Some blogs did so. Daily Kos headlined its coverage, ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/10/20/795374/-Vatican-welcomes-bigoted-Anglicans"&gt;Vatican Welcomes Bigoted Anglicans&lt;/a&gt;.‚Äù But the discussion provided by, say, network news barely rose above the demure. That‚Äôs not courtesy; it‚Äôs cowardice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice piece by a guy who can hardly be called ‚Äúmilitant.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

The gore, the predictable plot, the buckets of red corn syrup, the cheesy one-liners‚Ä¶ But most of all I love the eerie feeling that I still get when watching a scary movie. As a skeptic I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; there are no vampires or zombies or parasitic aliens, and hopefully there is no deranged man waiting in the closet with a machete, yet I still fall for it when I get involved &lt;img title="136598_main" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/136598_main1.jpg" alt="136598_main" width="288" height="288"&gt;with a film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, some of it even sticks with me. I have not been able to look at a clown (with the exception of Captain Spaulding) without feeling sick to my stomach and like I‚Äôm having a panic attack since I saw IT as a kid. Pennywise is a motherfucker, for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horror movies are the only type of film that I can lose all skepticism in for the duration. Granted, if they‚Äôre particularly awful I still find myself saying, ‚ÄúYeah flipping right,‚Äù the whole time, but well made horror makes me cringe, cover my eyes and reel at the thought of what could happen next. &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805570/"&gt;Midnight Meat Train&lt;/a&gt; actually made me leap from my seat and run to the bathroom to throw up. Seriously, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;As skeptics who don‚Äôt believe in the paranormal, what scary movies freak you out? Do you find yourself more drawn to reality-based horror? Or do you still cringe over a scary fantasy? Why do you think we‚Äôre able to drop the skepticism for the sake of a cheap thrill?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Stu,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good news! The story is already up on Pharyngula (PZ didn't waste a
minute) and the mocking has begun.  Enjoy!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By the way, what pissed me off the most about you was not the PZ suit, but
your lie about giving the eulogy at Steve Gould's memorial service.  Don't
ever repeat that lie again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's Pivar's rejoinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never said I gave a eulogy at Steve Gould's memorial. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The day after Steve died I read the Kaddish service at the funeral obsequies in his small library, the minion including  the Rabbi, the preparators, artist Steven Assails who made a drawing, and anatomist Eliot Goldfinger who took a death mask. Rhonda Schearer Gould, Helen Matsos and I then accompanied the body to New Jersey for cremation. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your  information re the case is also incorrect. You are seeing the first step in an agreed change in venue.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm making popcorn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/whee_more_jousting.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/r6oSJ9QieHY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256670972408"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/donors_choose---almost_there.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b890d74d69fb79a0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Donors Choose"/><title type="html">Donors choose---almost there!</title><published>2009-10-27T18:28:25Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T18:28:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/m4FJsYmjg5A/donors_choose---almost_there.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/donors_choose---almost_there.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You guys are great.

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2009GL039186.shtml"&gt;study published in mid October&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Geophysical Research Letters&lt;/i&gt; (Tedesco and Monaghan, 2009) documents record minimum snowmelt for Antarctica during austral summer 2008-2009 and lower-than-normal melt for several recent years, based on a 30-year satellite microwave record.  Numerous blogs have cited the results as a challenge to &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7228/abs/nature07669.html"&gt;previous studies reporting Antarctic warming&lt;/a&gt;, while also steadfastly ignoring other studies with similar results (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008GL036369.shtml"&gt;Barrett et al., 2009&lt;/a&gt;).  They have overlooked that these studies show that Antarctic warming has occurred mostly in winter and spring, whereas melting of course occurs in summer.  And they oversimplify the causality and hence confuse our prediction for the future.  We found that the same mechanism that has primarily caused low snowmelt in recent years will likely change in a manner that will enhance snowmelt in forthcoming decades. A brief summary follows.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/maps_w_bar-300x247.jpg" alt="Map of Antarctica showing number of melting days in summer 2008-2099." title="maps_w_bar" width="300" height="247"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Map of Antarctica showing number of melting days in summer 2008-2009.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrates that low melt years during the 1979-2009 satellite record are related to the strength of the westerly winds that encircle Antarctica, known as the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM).  When the SAM is in a positive phase ‚Äì meaning that the belt of winds is stronger than average ‚Äì &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/296/5569/895"&gt;it has a cooling effect on Antarctic surface temperatures&lt;/a&gt;.  The SAM was especially strong in austral spring and summer 2008-2009, and subsequently the 2008-2009 snowmelt was lower than normal.  During the past 30-40 years, the SAM has gradually strengthened during austral summer (Marshall 2003), &lt;a href="http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;amp;doi=10.1175%2FJCLI3774.1"&gt;due mainly to human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion&lt;/a&gt;.  In turn, the increasing &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2008/2007JD009094.shtml"&gt;SAM has weakened longer-term summer warming over Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;.  The SAM index is not strongly positive every year of course, and particularly when combined with other atmospheric circulation changes (e.g. a strongly positive Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) ‚Äì indicative of La Nina conditions) may contribute to anomalously high or low summer temperatures in any given year.  The figures shown in our Supplementary Material section in our original paper illustrate this point nicely (below):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/temperatureanom1998-300x173.jpg" alt="1998 Summer" title="temperatureanom1998" width="300" height="173"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/temperatureanom1999-300x173.jpg" alt="1999 Summer" title="temperatureanom1999" width="300" height="173"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Monthly averaged December-January surface temperature anomalies (K) for 1998 (left, strong negative SAM and SOI) and 1999 (right, strong positive SAM and SOI).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ozone hole is projected to recover significantly during the next 25 ‚Äì 50 years due to the Montreal Protocol, which limits ozone-depleting substances used in industrial and household applications.  As the ozone hole ‚Äòheals‚Äô, the increasing summer SAM trends &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/prrl/2008-15.html"&gt;are projected to subside&lt;/a&gt;.  As this happens, it is likely that summer temperature increases over Antarctica will &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2004/2004GL020724.shtml"&gt;become stronger and more widespread&lt;/a&gt; because the warming effect from greenhouse gas increases will no longer be kept in check by the dynamic&lt;br&gt;
cooling impact of the SAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the linkage between the SAM and snowmelt leads to our key conclusion: that enhanced snowmelt is likely in Antarctica as the SAM trends subside during the 21st century and summer temperatures become warmer.  Our results agree with &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2002/2002GL015415.shtml"&gt;studies that have noted cooling and/or slower warming&lt;/a&gt; during the past three decades due to increasing SAM trends over the same period.   Additionally, our conclusions do not contradict findings showing &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/01/state-of-antarctica-red-or-blue/"&gt;strong regional warming on the Antarctic Peninsula and in West Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; for the past 50 years, and &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006.../2006GL027057.shtml"&gt;warming over the entire continent for the past century.&lt;/a&gt;   Our record is limited to the satellite era only, during which ozone depletion has dominated Antarctic summer temperature trends, and as already noted above, the observed warming in the last 50-100 years has occurred mostly in winter and spring.  This context is important.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>eric</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256670062305"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/?p=1490">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0cd73356a191258f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Science"/><category term="Greenhouse gases"/><category term="Reporting on climate"/><title type="html">350</title><published>2009-10-27T18:23:36Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T18:23:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/10/350/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was quoted by Andrew Revkin in the New York Times on Sunday in a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/science/earth/25threefifty.html"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about the 350.org International Day of Climate Action (involving &lt;a href="http://www.350.org/"&gt;events in 181 countries&lt;/a&gt;). The relevant bit is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Gavin  A.  Schmidt,  a  climate  scientist  who works with Dr. Hansen and manages a popular blog on climate  science, realclimate.org, said those promoting 350 or debating the number might be missing the point.&lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúThe  situation is analogous to people trying to embark on a cross-country road trip to California but  they‚Äôve  started  off heading to Maine instead,‚Äù Dr. Schmidt said. ‚ÄúBut instead of working out ways to turn around, they have decided to argue about where they are going to park when they get to L.A.‚Äù&lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúIf  you ask a scientist how much more CO2 do you think we should add to the atmosphere, the answer is going to be none.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been told that some readers may have misinterpreted the quote as a criticism of the 350.org campaign itself. This was not the intent and in fact my metaphor wouldn‚Äôt have made sense in that context at all. Instead, it was a criticism of people who are expending effort &lt;em&gt;arguing&lt;/em&gt; about whether 350 is precisely the right number for a long term target, or whether it should be somewhat higher or lower. Since we aren‚Äôt currently headed anywhere near 350 ppmv (in fact we are at 388 ppmv CO2 and increasing by about 2 ppmv/yr), we need to urgently think of ways the situation can turn around. Tapping into the creativity and enthusiasm shown by the 350.org campaigners will certainly be part of that process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed some of the thinking behind this ‚Äò&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/04/target-co2/"&gt;Target CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‚Äò when Jim Hansen and colleagues‚Äô paper first came out, where I think we made it clear that picking a specific CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; target to avoid ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô climate change is an inexact science at best. The comments by &lt;a href="http://community.nytimes.com/comments/dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/a-global-focus-on-a-hot-number/?sort=editors-selection"&gt;Robert Brulle and Ray Pierrehumbert&lt;/a&gt; at DotEarth and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2009/10/is_350_the_right_target_for_at.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=channellink"&gt;James Hrynyshyn&lt;/a&gt; also highlight some of that complexity.  And I think the suggestions by ‚Äò&lt;a href="http://community.nytimes.com/comments/dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/a-global-focus-on-a-hot-number/?permid=175#comment175"&gt;Paulina&lt;/a&gt;‚Äò for how a tweaked article might have been clearer are very apropos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the final line in my NYT quote should make clear, personally I think the scientific case not increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; any further is very strong. Since the planet has not caught up with current levels of concentrations &lt;del&gt;emissions&lt;/del&gt; (and thus will continue to change), picking an ultimate target that is less than today‚Äôs level is therefore wise. Of course, how we get there is much trickier than knowing where it is we should be going, but having a map of the destination is useful. As we discussed in the ‚Äò&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/hit-the-brakes-hard/"&gt;trillionth ton&lt;/a&gt;‚Äò posting a couple of months back, how we get there also makes a difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my original email to Andy Revkin, I had actually appended a line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If  you ask a scientist how much more CO2 do you think we should add to the atmosphere, the answer is going to be none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the rest is economics.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(and technology, and sociology, and psychology and politics etc.) but the point is that working out how we get there from here is the real challenge and the more people who are aware and involved in developing those solutions the better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256668484300"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=6708">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aeb22b06858413f9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alt-Med"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Space"/><category term="antivax"/><category term="Mythbusters"/><title type="html">Some stuff</title><published>2009-10-27T18:00:38Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T18:00:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/qEKervPzPRM/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/27/some-stuff/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a few things from here and there:&lt;/p&gt;

Neuroscience a couple of weeks ago. These authors explored the spatial organization of cells in multisensory areas of the superior temporal sulcus in macaque, in particular the distribution of visual- versus auditory-preferring cells.  What they found is that like-preferring cells cluster together in patches: auditory cells tend to cluster with other auditory cells, visual cells tend to cluster with other visual cells.  This is only mildly interesting in its own right because it just shows that functional clustering, long-known to be a feature of unimodal sensory cortex, also holds in multisensory cortex.  What makes this important is the implications this finding has for fMRI.  If &amp;quot;cells of a feather&amp;quot; cluster together and if these clusters are not uniformly distributed across voxels in an ROI then different voxels will be differentially sensitive to one cell type versus another.  And this is exactly the kind of underlying organization that multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can detect.  So, this new finding justifies the use of fMRI data analysis approaches such as MVPA.

&lt;p&gt;I grew up a christian and was raised in a baptist home (yikes). I am divorced and I have two children ages 11 and 7. I have only been an atheist for 3 years. My children were exposed to christianity from birth and still attend church with their mother, which scares the proverbial Hell out of me. They do not know of my change in ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is, when do I talk to them about it? Even though I am an atheist, I still pray with them every night that they are with me. Now I realize this seems odd but, I believe it brings them comfort‚Ä¶ the kind of comfort that is no different than my daughter‚Äôs stuffed alligator that she sleeps with every night‚Ä¶ and talks to. I do not believe the alligator can hear her anymore than god would in our prayers. Am I misleading my children? or it is ok, to a point in their age, to make sure they feel comforted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad of Two&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dad,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very complicated, very delicate and there are many ‚Äúifs,‚Äù so based only on your letter, I cannot give you many definitive suggestions.  I can only generally lay out for you issues of which you should be aware and pitfalls to avoid. Some possibilities I describe may sound worrisome, but it may turn out that this is resolved more easily.  If I discuss something that is obvious to you, or if I warn you against something that you‚Äôd never even consider, please forgive me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children in divorced families are caught between conflicting loyalties.  They are naturally loyal to both their parents. When their parents disagree on something important, the kids can feel uncomfortable taking one side over the other. When the parents don‚Äôt get along and even dislike each other, the kids end up having varying levels of guilt mixed into their love for each parent. They think in either/or, black-and-white terms.  Understanding things like gray areas, ambiguity, nuance and compromise are for much more mature people.  Even many adults never master these.  So in the kids‚Äô minds, when they are loving one parent, to some extent they may think they are being disloyal to the other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The severity of that inner conflict and the pain involved is determined mainly by how conscientiously the divorced parents cooperate to mitigate it for the kids.  In the best of cases, the parents communicate openly, and agree to make it clear to the kids that loving them both is okay, and that they don‚Äôt have to choose one parent over the other. Then the kids‚Äô discomfort can be greatly reduced.  It is also important for such conscientious parents to make it clear that it is not the kids‚Äô fault that their parents don‚Äôt get along.  Internalizing that undeserved guilt is a sadly common consequence when their feelings are not openly and frequently discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the worst of cases, the parents, focused on their own resentment for each other, use their kids as weapons against each other.  They will denigrate their ex spouse in front of the kids, and even tell them to spy on the other.  Meanwhile, the other parent may be doing something similar, so the children become ropes in a tug-of-war, or  stones to be thrown back and forth, or very conflicted double agents.  Many other metaphors would express the situation where more damage is done to the innocents in the middle than is done to the two enemies who are in conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your two kids, going back and forth between you and their mom are already caught in at least a little of this.  That is inevitable, even in the best of cases.  What you must do for them is to at least not make it worse. You may be able to make it better with patience, humility and selflessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the ‚Äúiffy‚Äù issues that are not clear here, and would affect your best course of action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you able to cooperate with your ex-wife to promote the best interest of the children?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the best scenario, you would first tell your ex-wife about your atheism, and alleviate whatever fears and misconceptions she might have from that revelation. Then the two of you would work out a detailed agreement about the children‚Äôs religious upbringing, about how things like prayer would be handled, and how you will tell the kids about your views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that best scenarios are rare, but if there is any room there, work with it.  If she is not as willing to cooperate with you as you are with her, it may take some time to negotiate with her and to coax her to focus on realistic solutions that benefit the children, but also respect both of your needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is atheism vs. religion going to be a very severe a conflict between you and your ex-wife?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; If it is so contentious that it will cause the ‚Äúweaponizing‚Äù of the kids, or make them the prize in a contest of who will ‚Äúwin them over,‚Äù then it may be preferable to not reveal your non-belief to your ex-wife at all.  If you choose to not tell her about your atheism, DO NOT tell your kids about it with the requirement that ‚ÄúThis will be a secret between us, don‚Äôt tell Mommy.‚Äù  That would severely increase their inner conflict of loyalties, and it would most likely leak out anyway.  A tangled mess of tension, guilt, confusion, anger and hurt would come from that.  Avoid, if you can, teaching them to lie to someone they love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to get the kids to see things the way you do?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a parent, it‚Äôs natural that you would want that. But the question really is, how badly do you want that, and to what amount of conflict are you willing to subject the kids?   Thinking that you will be ‚Äúsaving‚Äù them from the evils of religion would be just as regrettable as your ex-wife possibly thinking that she‚Äôs ‚Äúsaving‚Äù them from the evils of atheism.  Both of these mentalities are based on a vision of a future outcome that is probably colored more by emotion than reason.  They both tend to increasingly focus the parents on wanting to be right and wanting to have their own way.  The wellbeing of the children in the here-and-now begins to recede into the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the right to try to influence your children, and so does your ex-wife. Short of illegal abuse, neither of you have the right to completely prohibit the influence of the other. If cooperation with your ex is not an option and competition is too destructive, then your course will have to be to influence them quietly by your example.  They will benefit from watching you be a man who is true to his convictions &lt;em&gt;by the way he lives&lt;/em&gt; rather than the things he says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the course you take according to the considerations above, you can begin being more true to your own views by not participating actively in their prayers.  When they say, ‚ÄúAre we gonna say our bedtime prayers, now?‚Äù you can smile and say, ‚ÄúSure, you can if you want.‚Äù  That subtly gives the choice to them.  If they say, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you gonna pray with us?‚Äù you might smile and say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for you kids, Sweetheart.  I‚Äôm going to sit here and think about how much I love you.‚Äù  That is after all, what you‚Äôre actually doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You compared their prayers to a stuffed toy they use for comfort.  They know that you and other adults no longer use stuffed toys, and they see no problem with that.  Your subtle message is that this is a thing that people grow out of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next several years, you will have thousands of interactions with them where your example will be more a powerful teaching tool than a specific tutorial. They will watch how you think things through, how you hold back coming to a conclusion while you look for evidence, and how you make it okay for anyone to question anything.  When you help them with their homework, you will be frequently asking things like, ‚ÄúHmm. How do we know this?‚Äù or ‚ÄúOkay, what evidence is there for your idea?‚Äù  You will be planting the seeds of skepticism and critical thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps soon, perhaps not soon, the right time will come for you to speak to them frankly and openly about your unbelief.  There are so many unknown conditions in your situation that it is not possible to recommend a specific time or age that is best. At ages 11 and 7 they are probably beginning to be able to understand the basics of what you want to tell them, but there is so much variation in children‚Äôs cognitive and emotional development, and so many variables in your relationship with their mother.  I‚Äôm sorry that I have to say it depends, it depends, it depends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time comes, tell your kids the truth about &lt;em&gt;yourself.&lt;/em&gt;  Don‚Äôt talk about God, talk about your lack of belief, and what you need in order to believe something.  Make it clear to them that it is up to them to decide for themselves what they will believe as they grow up.   Make it clear that it is okay for them to change their minds as time goes by.  &lt;b&gt;Make it clear that you will love them if they choose to disagree with you.&lt;/b&gt;  That must be completely true for you or it will soon be shown to be false, and it will only make things worse.  Be in every breath the man who speaks the truth he lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad, your focus on wanting your kids to be comforted at this age shows that as a parent you have your priorities in the right order.  It means that their wellbeing is at the top, and your personal needs taper down from that.  As they grow, you will be more able to accommodate your needs with theirs so that you are not constantly sacrificing being true to yourself in order to be kind to them.  It will probably be a gradual shift until they are able to be their own persons standing alongside you, having learned by your example as you adjusted to their increasing maturity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your kids have an excellent father. &lt;/p&gt;

The latest hangup, though, is that the creationists want to have a pre- and post-debate survey, and they plan to give the audience these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I think intelligent design should be taught alongside evolution in all schools, public and private.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Strongly Disagree	Disagree		Undecided		Agree		Strongly Agree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I think intelligent design should be taught alongside evolution by teachers who support it, without punishment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Strongly Disagree	Disagree		Undecided		Agree		Strongly Agree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I think that as a minimum, the evidence against evolution should be taught alongside evidence for evolution.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Strongly Disagree	Disagree		Undecided		Agree		Strongly Agree&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve told them that that last question is simply unacceptable: it&amp;#39;s misleading, prejudicial, and begs the question. There is no evidence against evolution. If there were, I&amp;#39;d agree ‚Äî teach it. However, until they can say something specific, I&amp;#39;m not going to let them get away with sneaking in a stupid loaded question to their audience ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explained that as is, I&amp;#39;d answer that question with &amp;quot;strongly agree&amp;quot;, because I think that evidence should be taught‚Ä¶but that I know they want to use it to pretend that there is some substantial support for teaching &lt;i&gt;creationism&lt;/i&gt;, which is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much waffling is going on on their part. I've put my foot down: cut the question out. They're trying to weasel in some fuzzy alternative that will have the same effect. The first two questions are fine, they directly address the subject of the debate more specifically (that is, "Intelligent design"), but the last is just an open-ended bit of noise that they want to use to justify their anti-science agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with these charlatans is aggravating on so many levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/more_reasons_not_to_debate_cre.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/6sRZEbuMa-k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256664156068"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=3740">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eaac4fc912d09b80</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Good Without God: A Positive Take on Secularism</title><published>2009-10-27T16:42:34Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T16:42:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/27/good-without-god-a-positive-take-on-secularism/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061670111?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061670111"&gt;&lt;img title="Good Without God" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/10/Good-Without-God2.jpg" alt="Good Without God" width="240" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As an atheist and a secularist, one of my greatest concerns has long been the tone of negativity that, in my perception, we often put forward to the rest of the world. It‚Äôs a concern I much share with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kurtz"&gt;Paul Kurtz&lt;/a&gt;, a secularist hero and my former boss at the Center for Inquiry in Buffalo, NY, who has long been worried about ensuring that humanists have positive, constructive messages to offer about the virtues of a life of unbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how fortunate to have just learned of the release of the Harvard humanist chaplain Greg Epstein‚Äôs new book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061670111?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061670111"&gt;Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The book description suggests that it is exactly what I, and Kurtz, are looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;With the current state of the economy, the ongoing wars that rage across the globe, and the unsettling changes to the earth‚Äôs climate, questions about the role of God and religion in world affairs have never been more relevant or felt more powerfully. Many of us are searching for a place where we can find not only facts and scientific reason but also hope and the moral courage needed to overcome such challenges. For some, answers to the most challenging questions are found in the divine. For others, including the New Atheists, religion has no place in the world and is, in fact, an ‚Äúenemy.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;But in &lt;em&gt;Good Without God&lt;/em&gt;, Greg Epstein presents another, more balanced and inclusive response: Humanism. With a focus on the positive, he highlights humanity‚Äôs potential for goodness and the ways in which Humanists lead lives of purpose and compassion. Humanism can offer the sense of community we want and often need in good times and bad, as we celebrate marriages and the birth of our children, and as we care for those who are elderly or sick. In short, Humanism teaches us that we can lead good and moral lives without supernaturalism, without higher powers . . . without God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;In this constructive response not only to his fellow atheists Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and Sam Harris but also to contemporary religious leaders such as Rick Warren and Jim Wallis, Epstein makes a bold claim for what nonbelievers do share and believe. At a time when the debate about morality rages more fiercely than ever‚Äîand when millions are searching for something they can put their faith in‚ÄîHumanism offers a comfort and hope that affirms our ability to live ethical lives of personal fulfillment, aspiring together for the greater good of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get Epstein‚Äôs book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061670111?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061670111"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

My favorite quote from the secretary:

Reading the Secretary's blog post, it strikes me just how differently he is reacting to a challenge than Arne Duncan (now the Secretary of Education) did when I first told him about my work on teacher cheating when Duncan was in charge of the Chicago Public Schools.</summary><author><name>By Steven D.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? For example, what is your Real Life job? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nominally, I do "complex systems modeling and analysis", but the projects I work on are hush-hush. It's all very need-to-know. I could figure out what I'm doing, but then I'd have to kill myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hammy Shakespearean over-actor. Once more unto the breach, dear friends, and who would have thought the old man to've had so much blood in him? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I see from your blog that you wrote a science-fiction novel. What's that about? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="BlakeStacey pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/BlakeStacey%20pic.jpg" width="180" height="275" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Until Earthset is a tale of forbidden love, murder most foul and artificial intelligence, all set in an alternate 1968. Why I wrote it -- well, the compulsion to invent imaginary people and make them suffer is probably just one of those delightful spandrels we've inherited, a side effect of our brains thinking in narrative terms. After the fact, I was able to invent several justifications for my hobby. For example, we keep having arguments on the Blogohedron about the relationship between science and art, about how scientific accuracy works in fiction and all that, and it's nice to have a little practical experience in the matter. To a stuffy audience, I could sell my novel as a 130,000-word thesis on The Two Cultures Question (TM), but really, it's a murder mystery with robots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you think science fiction has an obligation to be scientifically accurate?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, let's break that down a bit. "Science" is (a) a community of people using (b) a set of methods and tools to build (c) a body of knowledge which sometimes (d) gets applied to make technology. If the characters in your story investigate something wholly fictitious, like an alien monolith, using the practices which real scientists would actually employ, are you being "accurate"? Even stories not expressly written to be didactic build up our mental image of the world. Now, you could try to use fiction in an "educational" way to convey the facts of science, to transmit the data about our discoveries, but you can also use it to illuminate the methods of the trade and the social mores of the profession. Think of a novel like Contact -- or, to pick an extreme example, the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. The scientific knowledge base of the story is fanciful, but the travails of the characters do call to mind issues about science as a profession, such as the ways people (and women in particular) have had to balance career and family. Art is generally better at raising questions than providing answers. If you're looking for hard data in fiction, if you want to find the blueprint for a perfect society in a made-up story, well, peace be with you in your quest. But that's only half the picture. In the age of Open Access and Google Scholar, we can dig up any particular datum we need, if we know how to look; the challenge is having a clue on how to start, and knowing how to handle what we bring back. The former requires an understanding of the broad strokes of scientific knowledge, and the latter depends on good critical thinking skills. A science education has to teach both, to have any worth at all, and science fiction can help us explore science-as-method even though we've yet to dig up that monolith in Tycho crater. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At ScienceOline'09, Henry Gee argued that creating science fiction requires the same kind of imagination as doing science, because both start with inventing hypotheses about the world and then exploring what they would entail&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'd say there's a great deal of truth in that. In science, hypotheses survive when they mesh well with the data, whereas in SF, the conjectures which endure are the ones which make for good stories. (Our understanding of the strong nuclear force has advanced quite a bit since 1972, but Asimov's The Gods Themselves hardly suffers for having arrived before quantum chromodynamics!) There's this notion afoot that if a scientist doesn't like a movie which has some science-talk in it, this has to be because the science was bad! This is rather like saying the only reason a plumber can dislike a movie is because it doesn't show anybody using the bathroom. Now, I don't want to make a blanket statement here, but I do know a few science people, and from what I've seen, they're plenty willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of a story -- except when the story itself isn't good enough to suspend disbelief for! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;With one book down, where will you go next? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm taking a stab at mathematics education, partly spurred by my own unhappy memories of high-school mathematics classes, which in retrospect turned out to be four years of almost wholly wasted time. Coming from someone who went on to get a physics degree, that's pretty harsh! I happily deal with abstruse mathematics every working day, but you couldn't pay me to sit through Pre-Calculus again, so something must be off here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And you'll be speaking on mathematics education at ScienceOnline'10?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="http://www.naturalmath.com/" title=""&gt;Maria Droujkova&lt;/a&gt;, yes. For all I know, we'll be demonstrating our spiffy computer graphics to an empty room, because we'll be scheduled at the same time as some "civility in communication" session, to which everybody will go so they can argue at each other about how best to be a nice person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally meeting Brian Switek of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/" title=""&gt;Laelaps&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. SkySkull of &lt;a href="http://skullsinthestars.com/" title=""&gt;Skulls in the Stars&lt;/a&gt; was fun, because we share enthusiasms even though we work in different fields -- Brian and I have gotten righteously steamed over "textbook cardboard", for example, which he finds in palaeontology and I in physics. But you asked if anything changed my views, which isn't the same as reaffirming them. That's more difficult to say. I can tell you, though, that meeting &lt;a href="http://extremebiology.net/" title=""&gt;Stacy Baker's high-school students&lt;/a&gt; was a blast: I skipped out on the sessions of the last day to chat with them instead. They provided the questions, I tried to bring the answers. If anything at the conference changed the way I think about the biz, it was that conversation. When you meet the people who are poised to benefit the most from good science communication, the quarrels you used to have on the Blogohedron look downright silly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to finally meet you and thank you for the interview. I am looking forward to seeing you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise. Thank you very much for the opportunity to ramble. &lt;/p&gt;

They are very upset because &lt;a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/hsc-religious-question-unfair-students-say/story-e6freuy9-1225790627659"&gt;they consider one of the questions on a standard exam to be "unfair"&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question four on Islam, worth 20 marks, gave candidates a quotation referring to the Qur'an and the prophet Muhammad. Then it asked candidates: "With reference to the quotation, analyse the role played by the revelation through the Prophet in the life of Muslims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds reasonable to me. They&amp;#39;re students of religion ‚Äî I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;ve discussed the idea of revelation often enough, they&amp;#39;re supposed to be able to interpret texts, they&amp;#39;ve been given a quote, now all they have to do is spin out a nice line of blather, which again, is almost certainly a skill students of religion are expected to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no. These students make some familiar complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One student identified only as Clare said: "When we reached section three I think most students in the state had a communal heart attack as we discovered obscure and obtuse questions which were from absolutely no part of the otherwise very straightforward syllabus.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"I just lost 20 marks from a paper I studied very hard for."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As a number of schools called for an explanation, Newington College student Nick Grogin said he was stunned by one question.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"I had never seen anything like that in the syllabus," he said. "Nothing about it related to what I had studied and been taught."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was nothing about Islam in their studies? That would be deplorable. Or there was nothing about revelation, or about interpretation in their studies? That would be even more shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are students who don't get it. I've had a few of them in biology classes, too. Some students think that if the answer to a question wasn't plainly spelled out in lecture or in their texts so that they can just "study" (a verb that in some vocabularies means "memorize") and spit back that very same answer, the question is unfair. Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clare and Nick, you fail. And you deserve to fail. And not just because you're wasting your time in Religion Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good test also examines a student's ability to &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt;, to come up with good answers to brand new problems. When a student is so limited in their intellectual ability that they are incapable of generalizing from principles they learned in the context of Christianity to Islam (or, as I've sometimes discovered, when they are flummoxed by a problem in Mendelian genetics in zebrafish rather than flies), they've flunked the thinking part of the exam.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/thats_not_an_unfair_question.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/b88CKOPncZg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256661308078"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/you_know_whats_wrong_with_chri.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0bc1adcd72586e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">You know what's wrong with Christians?

Somehow, I'm not surprised. But even fellow Christians have noticed and find fault with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, how Christians tip and behave in restaurants. If you have ever worked in the restaurant industry you know the reputation of the Sunday morning lunch crowd. Millions of Christians go to lunch after church on Sundays and their behavior is abysmal. The single most damaging phenomenon to the witness of Christianity in America today is the collective behavior of the Sunday morning lunch crowd. Never has a more well-dressed, entitled, dismissive, haughty or cheap collection of Christians been seen on the face of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait‚Ä¶the &amp;quot;single most damaging phenomenon to the witness of Christianity in America&amp;quot; is poor tipping? I don&amp;#39;t think so ‚Äî that&amp;#39;s more of a symptom of a shallow, selfish, superstitious philosophy that is in itself an affront to thinking human beings everywhere. I don&amp;#39;t think that if I were bussing tables that getting a 20% tip would convince me that talking snakes, genetics via striped sticks, and getting excused for my sins because a crazy rabbi got executed two millennia ago are &lt;i&gt;rational ideas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But otherwise, yeah, it's simple decency to leave a reasonable tip for people who work hard for low pay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/you_know_whats_wrong_with_chri.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/bdwyCwUqC1w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256661308077"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/doug_wilson_is_a_nasty_piece_o.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8664aedd40f3ead5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evil"/><title type="html">Doug Wilson is a nasty piece of work</title><published>2009-10-27T15:38:04Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T15:38:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/7CkeDVygwww/doug_wilson_is_a_nasty_piece_o.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/doug_wilson_is_a_nasty_piece_o.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/ask_em_what_they_really_think.php"&gt;I mentioned yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, Christopher Hitchens is touring the country with a pastor, Doug Wilson, doing public debates. A reader wrote in to inform me of who Wilson is, and I was appalled. He has a ministry in Idaho which has ties to the white supremacy movement! &lt;a href="http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=646"&gt;Doug Wilson has an entry at the Southern Poverty Law Center&lt;/a&gt; that explains that he coauthored a book, &lt;a href="http://www.tomandrodna.com/notonthepalouse/SSAIW.htm"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Southern Slavery As It Was&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with Steven Wilkins, a neo-Confederate, that was essentially a &lt;a href="http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/slavery.htm"&gt;mangling of history and theology to assert that slavery in the South wasn't so bad after all&lt;/a&gt;. He runs a private school in Idaho that celebrates Robert E. Lee's birthday; he wants a "cultural reformation" in America, and his model, his ideal, is the antebellum Confederacy. He's a regular speaker at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Reconstructionism"&gt;Christian Reconstructionist&lt;/a&gt; conferences sponsored by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_the_South"&gt;League of the South&lt;/a&gt;. His ideological heroes are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewis_Dabney"&gt;Robert Lewis Dabney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousas_John_Rushdoony"&gt;Rousas John Rushdoony&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/slavepage.htm"&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/Wilson.htm"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; that point to the vileness of this sleazebag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He doesn't confine his bigotry to other races, either. He's a wanna-be theocrat who &lt;a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2003_10_26_dneiwert_archive.html"&gt;wants to return to biblical barbarities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson used the Bible's view on homosexuals as another example. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Bible indicates the punishment for homosexuality is death. The Bible also indicates the punishment for homosexuality is exile. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"So death is not the minimal punishment for a homosexual," Wilson said. "There are other alternatives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't understand at all why Hitchens would want to be associated with such a creature, unless he was specifically seeking out the very worst that American Christianity brings to the table. Unfortunately, he's contributing to the reputation of a monstrous blight on the Palouse, a racist, theocratic ideologue whom &lt;a href="http://www.tomandrodna.com/notonthepalouse/"&gt;people of that region deplore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/doug_wilson_is_a_nasty_piece_o.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/7CkeDVygwww" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256661208673"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=6072">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/23349e17d443c37a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Hitchens on debating the faithful</title><published>2009-10-27T16:21:58Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T16:21:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/27/hitchens-on-debating-the-faithful/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2233586/"&gt;Over at Slate,&lt;/a&gt; Christopher Hitchens describes what he‚Äôs learned from his debates with folks like Douglas Wilson (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/doug_wilson_is_a_nasty_piece_o.php"&gt;apparently a repugnant character&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson isn‚Äôt one of those evasive Christians who mumble apologetically about how some of the Bible stories are really just ‚Äúmetaphors.‚Äù He is willing to maintain very staunchly that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ and that his sacrifice redeems our state of sin, which in turn is the outcome of our rebellion against God. He doesn‚Äôt waffle when asked why God allows so much evil and suffering‚Äîof course he ‚Äúallows‚Äù it since it is the inescapable state of rebellious sinners. I much prefer this sincerity to the vague and Python-esque witterings of the interfaith and ecumenical groups who barely respect their own traditions and who look upon &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; as just another word for &lt;em&gt;community organizing&lt;/em&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . Thanks to the foolishness of the ‚Äúintelligent design‚Äù faction, which has tried with ignominious un-success to smuggle the teaching of creationism into our schools under a name that is plainly stupid rather than intelligent, and thanks to the ceaseless preaching of hatred and violence against our society by the fanatics of another faith, as well as other related behavior, such as the mad attempt by messianic Jews to steal the land of other people, the secular movement in the United States is acquiring a confidence that it has not known in years, while many of those who put their faith in revelation and prophecy and prayer are feeling the need to give an account of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is apparently a $204 fine for not speaking English while driving in Dallas.  Supposedly this stems form a Federal regulation that big rig truckers must be able to speak English.  This regulation was over zealously interpreted and implemented in Dallas, and enforcement of this dumb-ass rule has actually been carried out.  It is most astonishing to me that it took three years of Dallas cops handing out these citations for people to suddenly realize that they were living in a world of shame and oppression.

It's meant for a general audience; in fact, a number of the entries originated as responses to queries from readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here's his point of view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to be picky‚Äìreally picky‚Äìabout English grammar and usage. [illustrations of his earlier pickiness follow] (p. iv)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new approach to language can be called joyous bewilderment. Rather than fretting about oddities, trends, and variations, I delight in them. The variation and change is exactly what makes language so interesting. I'm a work in progress, but gradually I'm learning to see quirks and changes in English and rather than respond with "How dangerous," to reply instead, "How cool!" or at least, "How interesting!" (p. viii)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not exactly a disinterested party here: I supplied one of the blurbs for the book (Erin McKean and Geoff Nunberg wrote the others), I am thanked in the Introduction, and I'm quoted or cited five times in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blurb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bierma has been exceptionally careful in his research for stories involving language‚Äìstarting by seeking out scholars who might have the information he&amp;#39;s looking for and then actually listening. So his columns are both informed and informative. Oh yes, and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256657169604"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=6059">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6654644f8ca874b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Darwin/Chicago 2009</title><published>2009-10-27T14:46:15Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T14:46:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/27/darwinchicago-2009/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our big University of Chicago DarwinFest, organized by Bob Richards, Neil Shubin and me, starts this Thursday and goes through Saturday evening.  It features a glittering panoply of biologists, philosophers, and historians of science, reprising the famous U of C conference of 1959.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our formal registration is full up, with 600 people having plunked down their fee, but we‚Äôll still accept some walk-ins.  The website is &lt;a href="http://darwin-chicago.uchicago.edu/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the program is &lt;a href="http://darwin-chicago.uchicago.edu/participants.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I‚Äôll report as much as I can consistent with my helping run the thing.  In the meantime, here‚Äôs the schedule for the plenary session at Rockefeller Chapel this Thursday evening (Lewontin was my Ph.D. advisor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6:00 p.m.  Welcome by Robert Zimmer, President of the University of Chicago&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6:15 p.m.  Richard Lewontin (Harvard University): ‚ÄúGenetic Determination and Adaptation: Two Bad  Metaphors‚Äù&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7:00 p.m.  Ronald Numbers (U. of Wisconsin): ‚ÄúAnti-Evolutionism in America: Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design‚Äù&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7:45 p.m.  Marc Hauser (Harvard University): ‚ÄúFrom Where do Morals Come?  NOT Religion!‚Äù&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a snap of Julian Huxley at the plenary session in 1959, also at Rockefeller Chapel:&lt;/p&gt;

To wit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;In a blind test, the AP gave temperature data to four independent statisticians and asked them to look for trends, without telling them what the numbers represented. The experts found no true temperature declines over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;‚ÄúIf you look at the data and sort of cherry-pick a micro-trend within a bigger trend, that technique is particularly suspect,‚Äù said John Grego, a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Yet the idea that things are cooling has been repeated in opinion columns, a BBC news story posted on the Drudge Report and in a new book by the authors of the best-seller ‚ÄúFreakonomics.‚Äù Last week, a poll by the Pew Research Center found that only 57 percent of Americans now believe there is strong scientific evidence for global warming, down from 77 percent in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fear that the new spate of global cooling claims are having a serious impact, perhaps even an impact detectable in the numbers above‚Äìso Borenstein‚Äôs is a much needed debunking.

In fact, blogs allow the repeated and systematic transfer of half-knowledge and subjectivities which can be 'consumed' and amplified even further by other non-scientific media (other blogs, Twitter, etc.). ... Bloggers usually react with anger and denial if you point out that their blogs are not as important as the bloggers think. Nevertheless, blogs contribute to increased visibility for scientists who are at best mediocre."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, one of the marks of a first-rate scientist is apparently that she &lt;i&gt;does not blog&lt;/i&gt;. Luckily, my experience with young German scholars has taught me that this kind of Prussian authoritarianism is going extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month and half ago, we learned that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/why_do_intelligent_people_use_alternativ_1.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;√ºber&lt;/em&gt;-quack Hulda Clark&lt;/a&gt;, the woman who said that she had the &lt;em&gt;Cure for All Cancers&lt;/em&gt;, had died on September 3, 2009. I was criticized for entitling my post &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/requiem_for_a_quack.php"&gt;Requiem for a Quack&lt;/a&gt;, but, given how Clark's quackery had contributed to the suffering and deaths of an unknown number of cancer patients, I didn't really feel too bad about it, although I do realize that the taboo about speaking ill of the recently dead is a strong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was curious what the cause of Dr. Clark's death was, because it seemed rather mysterious, being described as the result of a "spinal injury," with no further description. Then, a reader sent me a scan of Hulda Clark's death certificate, and this is what it listed as the cause of death:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple myeloma. Cancer of plasma cells, a form of lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't believe me? Check out &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2009/10/requiem_for_a_quack_part_ii/HuldaClarkDeathCertificate.pdf"&gt;Hulda Clark's death certificate&lt;/a&gt; (certain addresses whited out) for yourself. Even &lt;a href="http://www.huldaclark.net"&gt;Hulda Clark's own website&lt;/a&gt; admits that she had multiple myeloma:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. Clark helped many people get well, but she couldn't help herself. Her first symptom was excruciating pain in her arms. Pain medicines were ineffective. It would turn out she had deterioration in her neck vertebrae which was pinching those nerves. Her hands stopped functioning. It would turn out later she had carpal tunnel syndrome. So as soon as Dr. Clark knew there was something wrong, she physically could not use her Syncrometer techniques to investigate it because her hands and arms did not work well enough. Her health deterioration was a mystery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not really. The cause of her health deterioration, while perhaps a mystery initially, is quite clear now. She had multiple myeloma. It's also a pretty lame excuse. I mean, come on! Clark "trained" dozens of acolytes to use her Syncrometer. Are they really saying that not a single one of them could use her device, which she claimed as part of the "cure for all cancers," to cure her cancer, as she claimed she could cure all cancers? Not that it would have done any more good for Clark than it did for any of the cancer patients who misplaced their faith by putting it in her, but the excuse used to explain why Clark died of cancer when she had spent so many years claiming that she could cure it is lame in the extreme. Surely there must have been &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; who could have operated the Syncronometer for her!

He wrote:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Frequently believers in God express that they have no doubt about the existence of God, in the sense that they are either just as or more certain that God exists as they are that other people exist‚Ä¶I find this confidence very annoying. I have two reasons, one personal and the other philosophical. My personal reason is that it makes me feel isolated from the wider world of religious believers, whose experiences obviously differ radically from mine; I do not feel as certain about God‚Äôs existence as I do about my mother‚Äôs existence. In fact, I feel much less certain about God‚Äôs existence than my mother‚Äôs existence. For example, I can‚Äôt even imagine a plausible explanation for my experiences if it turns out my mother doesn‚Äôt exist. However, I can imagine plenty of relatively plausible explanations for religious experience if it turns out God does not exist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My philosophical reason for finding the sentiment annoying is that the categories of evidence available for investigating the question of God are quantitatively less than those available for investigating other people. God has a couple of unfortunate properties, but most unfortunate of these is his invisibility (invisible things are either very tiny, or fictional; theologians insist God is neither). A lesser but still significant annoyance is the fact that God cannot be shown to others. I have introduced (many) people to my mother ‚Äì not once has anyone walked away without a belief in my mother‚Äôs existence. This annoyance is separate from her visibility; I can also put people into contact with my mother without them seeing her. I can also point out to them that they (if they are lucky) experience mother-like creatures all the time. In fact, some people even are mothers. Lastly, although I don‚Äôt accept the atheistic argument from religious pluralism, there obviously is no such phenomenon with respect to belief in human persons. In other words, there aren‚Äôt communities of reasonable people who deny the existence of my mother‚Ä¶.The upshot is that I still have way more confidence that my mother exists than I do confidence that God exists.&lt;/blockquote&gt;My response follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Good Joshua, now we‚Äôre talking. You seem to admit that empirical evidence provides you with more confidence than non-empirical evidence. Great! Now let‚Äôs move on to other types of evidence. Is psychological evidence (i.e. the study of human behavior under controlled conditions), better than non-empirical evidence? Is neurology (i.e. brain science) better than non-empirical evidence? Is archeological, geological, astronomical, biological and botanical evidence better than non-empirical evidence? You‚Äôre on the road to affirming scientific evidence is better than non-scientific evidence. And it is. By far. Hands down. No question. Scientific evidence is the best way, and probably the only way, to settle the faith questions before us. The feeling of certainty that religious believers all over the world share is a psychological malaise. It is quite simply unjustified. But faith demands it and believers desire it. There is no way with non-empirical evidence that anyone can be more certain of anything in comparison to empirical evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you have to support your faith? You claim to have a veridical properly basic experience (providing your experience is veridical‚Äì-a circular argument if you ask me). But psychology can explain such a claim as wish fulfillment, especially since so many other religious believers around the world claim to have experienced their gods too, with certainty. That is not much by way of evidence at all, but merely a self-justifying way to confirm by way of apologetics what you want to believe. Then you have historical evidence, which, when compared to scientific evidence is poor evidence, something I explain in a later chapter for my book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You‚Äôre on the road to saying you simply believe because of when and where you were born and that you are merely attempting to confirm what you believe because you want to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll disagree, but I just don‚Äôt see how you can any longer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://egalicontrarian.com/index.php/2009/10/23/how-certain-should-we-be-about-the-existence-of-god/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6884972251257103043?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007626" title=""&gt;Extreme Cranial Ontogeny in the Upper Cretaceous Dinosaur Pachycephalosaurus&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Extended neoteny and late stage allometric growth increase morphological disparity between growth stages in at least some dinosaurs. Coupled with relatively low dinosaur density in the Upper Cretaceous of North America, ontogenetic transformational representatives are often difficult to distinguish. For example, many hadrosaurids previously reported to represent relatively small lambeosaurine species were demonstrated to be juveniles of the larger taxa. Marginocephalians (pachycephalosaurids + ceratopsids) undergo comparable and extreme cranial morphological change during ontogeny. Cranial histology, morphology and computer tomography reveal patterns of internal skull development that show the purported diagnostic characters for the pachycephalosaurids Dracorex hogwartsia and Stygimoloch spinifer are ontogenetically derived features. Coronal histological sections of the frontoparietal dome of an adult Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis reveal a dense structure composed of metaplastic bone with a variety of extremely fibrous and acellular tissue. Coronal histological sections and computer tomography of a skull and frontoparietal dome of Stygimoloch spinifer reveal an open intrafrontal suture indicative of a subadult stage of development. These dinosaurs employed metaplasia to rapidly grow and change the size and shape of their horns, cranial ornaments and frontoparietal domes, resulting in extreme cranial alterations during late stages of growth. We propose that Dracorex hogwartsia, Stygimoloch spinifer and Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis are the same taxon and represent an ontogenetic series united by shared morphology and increasing skull length. Dracorex hogwartsia (juvenile) and Stygimoloch spinifer (subadult) are reinterpreted as younger growth stages of Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (adult). This synonymy reduces the number of pachycephalosaurid taxa from the Upper Cretaceous of North America and demonstrates the importance of cranial ontogeny in evaluating dinosaur diversity and taxonomy. These growth stages reflect a continuum rather than specific developmental steps defined by "known" terminal morphologies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007571" title=""&gt;Timing of Locomotor Activity Circadian Rhythms in Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Circadian rhythms are driven by endogenous biological clocks and are synchronized to environmental cues. The chronobiological study of Caenorhabditis elegans, an extensively used animal model for developmental and genetic research, might provide fundamental information about the basis of circadian rhythmicity in eukaryotes, due to its ease of use and manipulations, as well as availability of genetic data and mutant strains. The aim of this study is to fully characterize the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in C. elegans, as well as a means for genetic screening in this nematode and the identification of circadian mutants. We have developed an infrared method to measure locomotor activity in C. elegans and found that, under constant conditions, although inter-individual variability is present, circadian periodicity shows a population distribution of periods centered at 23.9¬±0.4 h and is temperature-compensated. Locomotor activity is entrainable by light-dark cycles and by low-amplitude temperature cycles, peaking around the night-day transition and day, respectively. In addition, lin-42(mg152) or lin-42(n1089) mutants (bearing a mutation in the lin-42 gene, homolog to the per gene) exhibit a significantly longer circadian period of 25.2¬±0.4 h or 25.6¬±0.5 h, respectively. Our results represent a complete description of the locomotor activity rhythm in C. elegans, with a methodology that allowed us to uncover three of the key features of circadian systems: entrainment, free-running and temperature compensation. In addition, abnormal circadian periods in clock mutants suggest a common molecular machinery responsible for circadian rhythmicity. Our analysis of circadian rhythmicity in C. elegans opens the possibility for further screening for circadian mutations in this species.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007606" title=""&gt;A Validated Methodology for Genetic Identification of Tuna Species (Genus Thunnus)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tuna species of the genus Thunnus, such as the bluefin tunas, are some of the most important and yet most endangered trade fish in the world. Identification of these species in traded forms, however, may be difficult depending on the presentation of the products, which may hamper conservation efforts on trade control. In this paper, we validated a genetic methodology that can fully distinguish between the eight Thunnus species from any kind of processed tissue. After testing several genetic markers, a complete discrimination of the eight tuna species was achieved using Forensically Informative Nucleotide Sequencing based primarily on the sequence variability of the hypervariable genetic marker mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA CR), followed, in some specific cases, by a second validation by a nuclear marker rDNA first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1). This methodology was able to distinguish all tuna species, including those belonging to the subgenus Neothunnus that are very closely related, and in consequence can not be differentiated with other genetic markers of lower variability. This methodology also took into consideration the presence of introgression that has been reported in past studies between T. thynnus, T. orientalis and T. alalunga. Finally, we applied the methodology to cross-check the species identity of 26 processed tuna samples. Using the combination of two genetic markers, one mitochondrial and another nuclear, allows a full discrimination between all eight tuna species. Unexpectedly, the genetic marker traditionally used for DNA barcoding, cytochrome oxidase 1, could not differentiate all species, thus its use as a genetic marker for tuna species identification is questioned.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_209.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/kNu5zDz-q98" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256652926380"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=17655">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/894432e4abd3bcac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Sports"/><title type="html">Animal Sacrifices Before the 2010 World Cup?</title><published>2009-10-27T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/27/animal-sacrifices-before-the-2010-world-cup/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôm more offended as a vegetarian or as someone who is anti-superstition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2010 World Cup ‚Äî arguably the biggest sporting event in the world ‚Äî is set to take place in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are South African leaders doing to &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091023/od_nm/us_world_rituals"&gt;prepare the stadiums for competition&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;South African traditional leaders plan to perform ritual animal slaughters to bless stadiums for the 2010 World Cup&lt;/strong&gt; tournament ahead of the start of the showcase event next June, they said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zolani Mkiva, chairman of the Makhonya Royal Trust, a grouping responsible for co-ordinating cultural activities, said the tournament, the first to be held in Africa, needed to be blessed in true ‚ÄúAfrican style.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe must have a cultural ceremony of some sort, where we are going to slaughter a beast (cow),‚Äù said Mkiva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe believe that from the start we‚Äôve got to do things in accordance with our own traditions,‚Äù Mkiva said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, what?!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if this is part of their culture, screw their traditions.  How does animal sacrifice do anything for the soccer match?  What does it mean to bless the stadium, anyway?  Is someone afraid it‚Äôs going to collapse?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose we can be thankful that their traditions don‚Äôt involve human sacrifice and female circumcisions‚Ä¶ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omri Ceren&lt;/strong&gt; at Vagabondish &lt;a href="http://www.vagabondish.com/charming-south-african-leaders-want-to-bless-2010-world-cup-by-soaking-stadiums-with-blood-of-sacrificed-animals/"&gt;doesn‚Äôt see how this makes any sense&lt;/a&gt; either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When people arbitrarily select which indigenous traditions they‚Äôre going to highlight for outsiders, that‚Äôs a &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt;. We‚Äôre not talking about religion here. We‚Äôre talking about a bloody manufactured spectacle across 10 soccer stadiums ‚Äì- both soccer and stadiums already being a departure from Africa‚Äôs ‚Äúown traditions‚Äù ‚Äì- done to emphasize ‚Äústyle.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any different from religion.  It‚Äôs superstitious ritual that has no &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; effect on the stadium (or the world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the World Cup Local Organizing Committee has the good sense to put a stop to this before it gets anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre not convinced how ridiculous this is, &lt;strong&gt;Grahame L. Jones&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt; suggests &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-jones-soccer25-2009oct25,0,7475732.story"&gt;how this scenario would look&lt;/a&gt; in another part of the world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Imagine that it is 1994 again and that the opening game of the World Cup is about to take place at Soldier Field in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps it‚Äôs the first game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, or at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, or at any of the other six venues used during the ‚Äò94 tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine the crowds outside the stadium, the fans in a festive and anticipatory mood, children among them. Now imagine a cow being led on a rope to a designated spot outside the stadium and having its throat cut and its blood drained as part of the pregame ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unthinkable? You bet. Sickening? Absolutely.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn‚Äôt be allowed here and it shouldn‚Äôt be allowed there.&lt;/p&gt;

As I write this weather is not so great so it may be a scrub, but &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/BANews"&gt;follow me on my BANews feed on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for the latest!]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt usually talk about iPhone-specific stuff, but as it happens I own (a spiffy pink) one, and this is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/missions.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/NASA_iphoneapp_missions.jpg" alt="NASA_iphoneapp_missions" title="NASA_iphoneapp_missions" width="160" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/index.html"&gt;NASA just released a new app for the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, and I like it. It has info on missions, pictures, videos (links to YouTube), and more. It‚Äôs a pretty slick app, professionally put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can filter the missions to look at using categories like Earth, Solar System, Moon and Mars, and so on. It tells you when it launched, what the mission elapsed time is (which is pretty nifty), and from there you can access images and video related to the mission. Not only that, but if you tap the Earth icon when a mission is displayed, it will show you a real-time map of the location of the spacecraft over the Earth! I checked it using the space station against the info at &lt;a href="http://www.heavens-above.com"&gt;Heavens Above&lt;/a&gt;, and it matched closely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start from the home page and tap the image icon at the bottom, you get a choice of pictures from NASA‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html"&gt;Image of the Day&lt;/a&gt; as well as the venerable &lt;a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod"&gt;Astronomy Picture of the Day&lt;/a&gt;. I checked those and they were up to date with the current day‚Äôs images, too. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos appear to be in reverse chronological order, which is nice. Also, if you tap the RSS symbol you get the NASA Twitter stream. Very well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any complaints I have are minor. It refers to Fermi as GLAST, which was its name before launch‚Äì a year ago. Some missions are missing, and I hope they‚Äôll put them in when they update the software. &lt;a href="http://swift.sonoma.edu"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; would be a great candidate for this, especially if they give real-time access to when it sees gamma-ray bursts. Things like that would turn this app from something cool into something extremely handy. Also, it seemed a little slow to get started, even using 3G. I turned on my wireless connection and it zipped right up though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still and all, it‚Äôs worth the download. If you‚Äôre a geek like me (and c‚Äômon, admit it: if you‚Äôre reading this blog in the first place, it‚Äôs too late to hide it) you‚Äôll enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

There is some variation of opinion within the anti-vaccinationists, but not much. Some claim that vaccines do not work at all, while other acknowledge some benefit. Some try to be coy by saying they are just asking questions (sure, like the 9/11 truthers are ‚Äújust asking‚Äù), while others come right out and make demonstrably false claims, like vaccines cause autism. But they all cluster around the opinion that vaccines are toxic (in some way) and that they cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is remarkable about the anti-vaccine crowd is their consistency in talking points. One might call it message discipline (enough to make Republicans jealous) but I think that implies more deliberate coordination than there is evidence for. I may be wrong in this, but I think it is enough to say that they all travel in the same virtual circles and play off each other‚Äôs rhetoric and arguments. They are a political/ideological community, and such communities are more plugged in today because of Web 2.0 than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not just talking about slogans, like ‚ÄúGreen our Vaccines‚Äù, which are designed for widespread use. Reading the various anti-vaccine websites and authors you begin to see a pattern of specific talking points coming in waves.¬† Squalene has been in vaccines as an adjuvant for years, yet suddenly many of the anti-vaccine sites are squawking about squalene. I have not tracked down the original source of the squalene flap ‚Äì it spread so quickly through the anti-vaccine blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job of the science-blogging community has been to analyze the anti-vaccine talking points when they crop up, and to provide some actual scientific information to balance the fear-mongering of the anti-vaccinationists. With regard to squalene, for example¬† ‚Äì this is a naturally occurring organic molecule that is made in the liver and has been used safely in vaccines for years without any adverse events. I think the fear-mongering about squalene may have been  triggered by a report that Gulf War veterans had anti-squalene antibodies from the squalene in the vaccines they received, and that this might have caused Gulf War syndrome. &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/topics/adjuvants/squalene/questions_and_answers/en/"&gt;As it turns out&lt;/a&gt;, there never was squalene in the vaccines the Gulf War veterans received, anti-squalene antibodies occur naturally and seem to increase with age, and have no association with vaccines. So every single element of the anti-squalene fear was factually wrong, but the anti-vaccine movement got a cycle of fear-mongering out of it, and now squalene is permanently on the list of potential toxins in vaccines (substances are added to the list, but never removed, even when they are cleared as safe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another talking point I have seen crop up recently, on the Age of Autism blog and elsewhere, is the minimizing of the evidence for the safety of vaccines, and specifically the lack of association with autism, as only dealing with one vaccine (the MMR) and one ingredient (thimerosal). David Kirby, writing for the (in my opinion) anti-vaccine and anti-science-based medicine  Huffington Post, recently wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin with, it is unscientific and perilously misleading for anyone to assert that ‚Äúvaccines and autism‚Äù have been studied and that no link has been found. That‚Äôs because the 16 or so studies constantly cited by critics of the hypothesis have examined just one vaccine and one vaccine ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirby was discussing the recent study that purports to show an increased risk of autism-like features in monkeys who received the Hepatitis B vaccine. David Gorski has already &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1989"&gt;dismantled this study here&lt;/a&gt;, so I won‚Äôt repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was struck when reading this that I had been reading almost the exact same phrase from J.B. Handley over at the anti-vaccine site Age of Autism ‚Äì a remarkable consistency of talking points. This particular point is a manifestation of moving the goalpost ‚Äì no amount of evidence, of course, will clear vaccines in the eyes of the anti-vaccinationists. Let‚Äôs review a bit of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest reference I can find to a possible link between vaccines and autism is a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/944354?ordinalpos=467&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;case report from 1976&lt;/a&gt; of a child who was diagnosed with autism following a smallpox vaccine ‚Äì the report concluded that a causal association was unlikely. Then there is nothing until the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9500320?ordinalpos=464&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Andrew Wakefield study in 1998&lt;/a&gt; which started the autism-MMR vaccine scare. In other words, until Wakefield raised the concern of a possible connection between vaccines and autism, there was no reason to suspect a connection. There was no basic science or epidemiology suggesting a connection, and vaccine monitoring had not triggered any red flags about autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccine movement, which was already in existence, picked up on Wakefield‚Äôs study and (true to form) that became their latest talking point of fear about vaccines. They made the argument in retrospect that the increasing vaccine schedule of the 1990s correlated with the increasing autism diagnosis rates of this same period. Subsequent studies (&lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/vaccines-and-autism/"&gt;summarized here&lt;/a&gt;) both invalidated Wakefield‚Äôs conclusions and showed that the MMR vaccine is not associated with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But autism was now on the radar of the anti-vaccine movement, so they turned (without really ever giving up on MMR) to a vaccine ingredient, thimerosal, which is a mercury-based preservative in some vaccines (and, interestingly, never in the MMR vaccine). There already was in existence an anti-mercury community who had been fear-mongering about environmental mercury for years. At this point I have to say that, yes, mercury is a neurotoxin, and it is absolutely legitimate to study the effects of mercury and to limit all cause human environmental exposure to mercury. That‚Äôs all good. But it seems to be human nature that for every legitimate point there is a person or group who will take it to extremes. Mercury is a toxin, but toxicity is all about dose. The mercury-militia, as they are sometimes called, went beyond science and reason by blaming sub-toxic levels of mercury for whatever they could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the anti-vaccine movement and the mercury militia became quite cozy over the issue of thimerosal. What is disturbing is that they have also infiltrated the autism community, and now do their best (much to the annoyance of many in the autism community) to equate autism awareness with anti-vaccine and mercury fear mongering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case ‚Äì fear over thimerosal exposure and autism was raised by the anti-vaccine movement, so this fear was addressed. Numerous studies have now shown no association between thimerosal exposure and autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. The most devastating evidence was the near complete removal of thimerosal from vaccines in the US by 2002, which in the subsequent seven years had zero effect on the rate of increase of autism diagnoses. David Kirby (who did much to fan the flames of fear of thimerosal) and others predicted autism rates would plummet ‚Äì they didn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, the increasing rates of autism diagnoses has also been studied, and at present the consensus of scientific evidence is that the apparent increase is mostly or entirely due to a broadening of the definition of autism and increased surveillance.¬† True autism incidence appears to be flat over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Kirby and others are shifting to other vaccines and other vaccine ingredients. Why? There never was any reason to suspect vaccines as a cause of autism in the first place. True autism incidence is not even increasing. There is no credible data to link vaccine and autism. The consensus of evidence is that autism is dominantly a set of genetic disorders (not a single disorder or disease). There is no compelling evidence for any significant environmental factor in autism, although minor environmental factors cannot be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you see the rhetorical trick that Kirby and Handley are playing ‚Äì the published evidence only excluded MMR and thimerosal as causes of autism ‚Äì not the other vaccines or vaccine ingredients. Their unstated major premise (the one they want to slip in the back door) is that there is some reason to suspect vaccines as a cause of autism in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason they are likely to cite is the anecdotal observation of parents that symptoms of autism appeared at or around the time of receiving a vaccine. They will make such arguments as emotional as possible ‚Äì scientists are not listening to mommies, and mommies know their children. Yes, but mommies are human and subject to all the errors of observation and thinking that plague our species. It turns out that subtle signs of autism are present long before parents recognize them ‚Äì even before the vaccines they blame were given. Plus, if Kirby and Handley are now willing to admit that MMR has been cleared (I don‚Äôt think they are, but that is what the ‚Äúone vaccine, one ingredient‚Äù argument would imply) then they also have to admit that all those parents who observed that their child‚Äôs autism began in temporal correlation with the MMR vaccine were either wrong or victims of a coincidence of timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this reflects is that the anti-vaccine movement is not intellectually rigorous or, in my opinion, even honest. They grab onto whatever argument they can, even if there is a lack of internal consistency. It is like the famous kettle defense ‚Äì when an attorney puts forward several defences of their client, all of which are mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another flaw in the one vaccine, one ingredient notion is that if the MMR vaccine has been cleared by the evidence, then doesn‚Äôt that also clear all of the ingredients of the MMR? Of course, many of those ingredients are the same as many of the other vaccines. At least we can say that the evidence suggests a lack of toxicity from any of the ingredients in the MMR in the doses present in the MMR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy the anti-vaxers use for such arguments is to deny reasonable applications of the dose response that we would expect from all pharmacological effects, including toxicity. In other words, the greater the dose of the toxin the greater the toxic effect should be ‚Äì in this case the risk of autism or neurological disease should increase with dose, not be flat. Anti-vaxers routinely deny this basic and generally accepted fact of biology. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=466"&gt;when a study showed&lt;/a&gt; that doubling the dose of thimerosal had no effect on adverse outcomes, they argued that the study is useless because there wasn‚Äôt a zero thimerosal control. This blatantly denies the fact that doubling the dose of a putative toxin, in the dose range that causes toxicity, should increase the toxicity. This is one of the lines of evidence that is actually required in order to scientifically establish toxic cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for any ingredients that MMR shares with other vaccines, the addition of MMR should add to the toxicity (for example increase the risk of developing autism) but studies have not detected any such effect. So it is not fair or accurate to say that the evidence has looked at only one vaccine and one ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be pointed out that there are vaccine monitoring systems in place. These systems are not looking for a particular correlation with vaccines ‚Äì they are looking for any correlation. If there were a significant increase in the risk of developing autism from vaccines, these systems should detect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moving the goalpost strategy will work forever with the anti-vaccinationists, because there is an astronomical number of permutations of vaccine ingredients, specific vaccines, and possible target diseases and disorders. We will never have definitive evidence specifically ruling out every possible vaccine combination for every possible disease. The same is true, of course, for every single medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in France anti-vaccine concerns focus on multiple sclerosis, not autism. So antivaxers in the US and UK can simply migrate over to MS once they run out of steam on autism fear-mongering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do have are studies and monitoring systems looking for any signal of adverse events peaking above the noise in the data. We will also chase down any specific hypotheses that crop up. The data shows that vaccines are very safe, and despite very rare reactions to vaccines (which are acknowledged and compensated) there is no credible evidence to correlate vaccines and autism or neurodevelopmental disorders. The specific hypotheses of MMR and thimerosal have been directly studied and the evidence strongly supports a conclusion of lack of correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Kirby‚Äôs claim that such statements are unscientific ‚Äì a fair look at all the evidence supports the conclusion that there is a lack of association between vaccines and autism. Further, there is no reason to hypothesize that there would be such a link, and further still there is compelling evidence that true autism rates are not increasing, and that autism is dominantly genetic in origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsible scientists look at the totality of evidence to make an internally consistent argument.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256650686133"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=10140">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de18272ac1ad687b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 10.27</title><published>2009-10-27T13:30:07Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T13:30:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/skepchick-quickies-10-27/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

It&amp;#39;s sort of related to Pentatrichomonas (Hampl et al. 2006 Int J Sys &amp;amp; Evol Microbiol), although the support for that seems rather weak.(Cooper et al. 1994 Avian Diseases; SEM of   Cochlosoma anatis; Bar = 3um)It reminds me of diplomonads (eg. Giardia) with its flat shape and adhesive sucker disc appendage - most likely a good adaptation for the intestinal environment. The ventral side is even more diplomonad-esque:(Cooper et al. 1994 Avian Diseases; SEM of   Cochlosoma anatis on intestinal mucosa(dorsal view), note the marks left by the parasite&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;suckers&amp;#39; in the vili; Bar = 5um)Also, both are &amp;#39;amitochondriate&amp;#39; anaerobes; trichomonads (and all the other parabasalians) have hydrogenosomes, which are ultra-reduced mitochondria with a pathway for producing hydrogen gas. Diplomonads and retortamonads lack hydrogenosomes, and have really taken the whole Mitochondria Lite business to the extreme - they have tiny non-descript mitosomes which are basically kept around for one metabolic purpose: FeS cluster metabolism*.I digress, but that&amp;#39;s pretty much all I have to say about Cochlosoma. Besides its peculiar shape, it seems to be your garden variety trichomonad with a case of Giardia-envy. Although who knows, these things are also grotesquely understudied...Brace yourselves for the next mystery micrograph, which shall be posted SOON! done*Thus far no eukaryote has been found without at least that part of the mitochondrial metabolic pathways left behind. Kreb&amp;#39;s/TCA cycle can be quite &amp;#39;easily&amp;#39; dispensed with or greatly reduced, despite it being the more &amp;#39;famous&amp;#39; part of mitochondrial metabolism. Microsporidia (intracellular parasitic fungi) have the most reduced mitochondria. Turns out that their mitochondria lack ATP production altogether. The ATP is stolen from the host cell, and actually imported to the mitochondrion! (Tsaousis et al.

(This is the message I got from many UKers when I lectured on The Queen Mary last spring.)¬† Now an Ipsos Mori poll, reported in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/oct/25/teach-evolution-creationism-britons"&gt;Sunday‚Äôs Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, says that 54% of those surveyed in the UK agree with this statement: ‚ÄúEvolutionary theories should be taught in science lessons in schools together with other possible perspectives, such as intelligent design and creationism.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;three points higher&lt;/em&gt; than the same response in the U.S.¬†¬† And although we think of Egypt as a country verging on Islamic fundamentalism, the most striking result was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was found that Britons were almost three times more likely than Egyptians to want creationism and intelligent design to be included in the teaching of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I haven‚Äôt seen the poll itself, and we all know that you can bias results by how you ask the questions.¬† Nevertheless, this is a distressing ‚Äî though not surprising ‚Äî outcome.¬† It‚Äôs painful to see a country like the UK regress in this way.¬† And if it‚Äôs real regression, and not just the biased results of one poll, then what social forces are behind it? Dawkins, I think, has attributed it to the rise of Islamic schools, but I doubt that more than a fraction of the 973 Britons polled were Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

His wife of 38 years, Renee Greene Levitt, reported the news to friends and colleagues of Norman, and announced that a memorial service will be held on Sunday, November 1 at 1:30 PM at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue at 91 St. She also asked that in lieu of flowers, memorial contributions be sent to the National Center for Science Education, 420 40th Street, Suite 2, Oakland, CA  94609. Our deepest condolences to Renee and to Norman‚Äôs family and extended family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman Levitt received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1967 and taught mathematics, specializing in topology, for forty years at Rutgers before retirement. He was a frequent contributor on public attitudes toward science, as well as the follies of academic life that arise in connection with misunderstanding of science, regularly contributing review essays for &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Review of Books&lt;/em&gt;, and many other publications. His books include &lt;em&gt;Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and its Quarrels with Science&lt;/em&gt; (with Paul R. Gross) in 1994, &lt;em&gt;The Flight from Science and Reason&lt;/em&gt; in 1997, and &lt;em&gt;Prometheus Bedeviled: Science and the Contradictions of Contemporary Culture&lt;/em&gt; in 1999. In 1989 he published a technical work entitled&lt;em&gt; Grassmannians and the Gauss Maps in Piecewise-Linear Topology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman was best known, however, for his relentless defense of science, particularly against those in the academy ‚Äî generally labeled as social constructivists, deconstructionists, or postmodernists ‚Äî who tended to lump science in with other cultural traditions as ‚Äújust another way of knowing‚Äù that is no better than any other tradition, and thereby reduce the scientific enterprise to little more than culturally-determined guess work at best and hegemonic power mongering at worst. In the pages of &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt;, for example, he reviewed a number of books by such academics, most recently tearing into the British sociologist of science Steve Fuller for his expert testimony at the Dover trial in which Fuller defended Intelligent Design creationism as a legitimate science that deserves equal treatment with evolutionary theory. Already schedule for publication in the next issue of &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; was Dr. Levitt‚Äôs review essay entitled ‚ÄúScience: A Four Hundred Page Hissy-Fit,‚Äù a review of &lt;em&gt;Science: A Four Thousand Year History&lt;/em&gt; by Patricia Fara, which we have &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/09-10-26#feature"&gt;pre-published in &lt;em&gt;eSkeptic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in tribute to one of the finest writers to ever grace the pages of &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt;. Editing Norman Levitt was unlike editing any other author in the 17-year history of the magazine. His vocabulary was unparalleled and his command of literature, history, and culture was second to none in the sciences. I give you just one typical example, from the aforementioned essay. As you can see, Norm did not suffer foolish authors gladly:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutatis mutandis, the British historian of science Patricia Fara has written a book that treats its own vast subject ‚Äî science and the history of its development ‚Äî in a similarly contemptuous and condescending way. Fara‚Äôs case reposes on the twin shaky pillars of epistemological relativism and self-ascribed political righteousness. It is outlandishly Pecksniffian in tone and substance. She has an appallingly cavalier attitude toward evidence and documentation. She argues by means of flat assertion and unsupported generalization, sins, one assumes, she would never let her callowest undergraduates get away with. When I read a book, however closely, my marginal notations are usually brief and infrequent. Not so in the case of &lt;em&gt;Science: A Four Thousand Year History&lt;/em&gt;; my copy is crammed with notes to myself, most of them pointing out the author‚Äôs grotesque gaffes. Imprecision reigns on every page; inaccuracies, irrelevancies, omissions, anachronisms, errors, and outright howlers go galumphing through the text with the author‚Äôs blithe acquiescence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norm, we shall miss you terribly. Your literal voice may be gone, but your literary voice will live on forever.  &lt;/p&gt;

Read my response below.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;John, you seem to be implying that it would be easier to persuade a theist who was 'argued' into his faith that theism is false than it would be to persuade a theist who accepted his faith for reasons unconnected with arguments. Is this accurate? If so, it would follow that it would be easier to persuade, say, Professor Ed Feser, who has said that it was his study of philosophy that moved him from atheism to theism, than your average believing churchgoer. But this doesn't strike me as true. In fact, it seems to me that it's precisely the rational ground of the faith of a Feser that would make 'deconverting' him all the more difficult (since he would most likely have already have considered in great detail the sorts of objections you could raise). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, do you think it's the case that it's easier to persuade an atheist who was 'argued' into his position than an atheist who lacks belief for reasons unconnected with arguments? (In this latter case I'm thinking about an ardent atheist whose atheism is an important part of his life, but not in any serious intellectual sense. I've certainly met atheists of this 'type.')&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that conversions and 'deconversions' do frequently come about *by way* of argument, but not *during* discussions (reading, etc.) in which these arguments are addressed. That is, while it's not the case that you're likely to hear, "Wow, you're right! I'm going to accept/reject [ ] now," it is the case that the arguments we make 'plant seeds' in the minds of others, and may often play (whether one knows it or not) crucial roles in with respect to conversion/deconversion. I don't expect to persuade anyone *during a discussion* that my position is true, but I do hope to get them to think in ways that will allow them to see its truth (or tenability, or whatever) for themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;My response follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Eric, you raise some interesting and even complex issues. When it comes to faith questions is anyone really argued into believing, or away from it? I do not think human beings are logical machines. Our passions get in the way all of the time. The evidential weight of believing one way or another is judged by our experiences. We live in a Christian culture so it stands to reason that given these experiences we have a strong tendency to judge the evidence in favor of Christian theism. Furthermore, if a person was raised by snake handlers then he will become a snake handler, while if he‚Äôs raised in Massachusetts by a Catholic family will become a Catholic. Why is that? And don‚Äôt you agree that it would be hard to argue these people out of what they believe? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The issue of education as in the case of Professor Feser is interesting as well. Human beings have a strong tendency to find confirming evidence for what they believe, so just because he‚Äôs educated doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt do this. I doubt very much that he changed his mind purely for epistemic reasons. Why is it that when confronted with this sociological, cultural and psychological data nearly everyone agrees that people adopt the faith of their culture but then to a man they all say, but that‚Äôs not what happened in my case? In other words, they will all agree that, say, 95% of people adopt the faith of their culture but then at the same time they will also say, but that‚Äôs not me? How can 95% of the people say this, when they are part of the 95%? It becomes crystal clear that 95% of the people who say this are in denial. So no, I don‚Äôt think any theist is ever truly argued into his faith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think less indoctrinated, less educated, and disenfranchised believers would be easier to deconvert. And I think that it‚Äôs difficult, very difficult, to argue anyone out of their faith, because it‚Äôs faith. So the reason it would be harder to argue Feser out of his faith is not only because he was not truly argued into it, but also because he has sought to confirm it at the highest levels, just as a Muslim or a Mormon scholar would be harder to be argued out of his faith. Remember, in my book it was a crisis, plus new information, minus a lack of a loving Christian community that were the three factors in my life that led me away from what I believed. I suspect that in most cases those same factors are required for others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yes, all we can do is present the arguments and make each other think. Whether the other factors are there to help facilitate this conversion are not up to us to provide. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/10/question-about-most-effective-way-to.html?showComment=1256605281486#c7288582484583837483"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3943234995480898512?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.momlogic.com/images/biblebanner.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.momlogic.com/images/biblebanner.jpg" title="CheerBible" width="433" height="307"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt the banners were inevitably going to lead to a lawsuit.  A parent complained and the cheerleaders were told to stop their proselytizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the right decision.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christians who thought they were being ‚Äúvictimized‚Äù by following the law here had an easy way to counteract this if they chose to ‚Äî students could just bring their own pro-Christian signs to the game.  That would be perfectly legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/us/27cheerleader.html"&gt;they‚Äôre taking that advice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/10/27/us/27cheerleader_CA0_337-395/popup.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/10/27/us/27cheerleader_CA0_337-395/popup.jpg" title="StudentSigns" width="550" height="366"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
‚Ä¶ a month later, the new policy has produced an unexpected result: more biblical verses than ever at football games, displayed not by cheerleaders but by fans sitting in the stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startled and dismayed by the district‚Äôs policy, this town of 9,600 people has taken up the cause ‚Äî and the signs ‚Äî of the cheerleaders. Calling themselves Warriors for Christ, a twist on the school‚Äôs Warriors nickname, fans have held rallies at churches and a local polo field and sold more than 1,600 T-shirts bearing passages from Deuteronomy and Timothy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple things stand out to me about this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have the soundbyte from an atheist student:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Even Caleb Wickersham, a 17-year-old atheist from nearby southern Tennessee, acknowledges that fans are exercising a legal right to free speech. ‚ÄúFrom an atheist‚Äôs standpoint, it‚Äôs frustrating because I don‚Äôt want more religion in my face,‚Äù Caleb said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs their constitutional right.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that quotation because he shares the sentiment I think a lot of us would have.  He may not like it, but he acknowledges the legality of what the students are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times do we hear about atheists publicly sharing their beliefs in a legal way (e.g. the atheist billboards, getting an atheist license plate, wearing a &lt;a href="http://outcampaign.org/"&gt;Scarlet A&lt;/a&gt; button, etc.) and the Christian response seems to always be, ‚ÄúThis is offensive and it needs to stop‚Äù?  I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs always the case, but it‚Äôs not very often I hear Christians saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it but it‚Äôs their constitutional right.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second interesting thing I learned is who led the way for the cheerleaders to stop using their pro-Christian banners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The parent who contacted the school, Donna Jackson, is a graduate student at Liberty University, the evangelical Virginia institution founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Ms. Jackson, who had taken a law class, says she was just trying to protect the school from litigation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm shocked: A Liberty student who actually knows the law?!  Impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Christians are still pissed off they can‚Äôt display their banners on the field, but those are likely the same people who would get offended if the banner in question was anything other than Christian.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think they‚Äôd be equally supportive of a banner that read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs probably no god.  Now stop worrying and play the game.‚Äù &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="http://www.curriculum.wa.edu.au/internet/Communications/Whats_On/Talking_Stories33"&gt;past two years the Philosothon has been a great success&lt;/a&gt; - this year looks to be no different! The image is from the 2008 Philosothon, &lt;a href="http://www.dialogueaustralasia.org/?p=231"&gt;where there‚Äôs more details on the Dialogue Australia site.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philosothon has evolved from an event involving nine Perth schools in 2007 to an annual event involving sixteen West Australian schools and many interstate schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event encourages students to participate in ‚ÄòCommunities of Inquiry‚Äô, investigating deep philosophical and ethical questions. The judges‚Äô observations seem to suggest that the standard of inquiry improves each year. In preparing and participating in the event students have the opportunity to practice and develop higher order thinking and communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be a facilitator at the event and one of the organisers, Leanne Rucks, was recently interviewed for the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv"&gt;Skeptic Zone podcast (episode #45).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is bound to be a don‚Äôt-miss for those interested in seeing how the Western Australian Philosophy and Ethics course and philosophy in the classroom is revolutionising how young people think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics the students will be discussing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Given that roughly 50% of the population is female should our political institutions be required to have 50% female representation? (Political Philosophy )&lt;br&gt;
2. How do we know whether or not something exists if it only exists in theory? Realism and instrumentalism in science. (Philosophy of Science)&lt;br&gt;
3. Is torture ever permissible? (Ethics)&lt;br&gt;
4. Does sport necessarily develop good character? (Philosophy of Sport)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you there, will let you know how it went!&lt;/p&gt;

Producing bullshit requires no such conviction. A person who lies is thereby responding to the truth, and he is to that extent respectful of it. When an honest man speaks, he says only what he believes to be true; and for the liar, it is correspondingly indispensable that he considers his statements to be false. For the bullshitter, however, all these bets are off: he is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all, as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are, except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whenever I encounter quacks or bad psychics or similar, I very rarely believe they are liars.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After all, there must be easier and more lucrative ways of being dishonest.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I prefer Professor Frankfurt's approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It does seem to explain a lot...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[This topic has also been covered with more erudition and insight by the wise old duck &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/05/on-bullshit-and-mindfucking.html"&gt; Le Canard Noir&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[The full Frankfurt article is &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040421060422/www.jelks.nu/misc/articles/bs.html"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-8539848858026976261?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256628065069"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2265">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bdc62e64f340ce1c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Book Review"/><category term="Air Force"/><category term="Coppola"/><category term="Iraq"/><category term="military medicine"/><category term="surgery"/><category term="trauma"/><title type="html">Military Medicine in Iraq</title><published>2009-10-27T07:00:15Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T07:00:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2265" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;¬†Doctors get a lot of flak these days without ever going near a battle zone. They are bombarded with accusations of not caring about their patients, of being shills for Big Pharma, of being motivated by money, of killing patients with medical errors and drug side effects. In addition, they are bombarded with claims that non-scientific medical systems (so-called alternative medicine, from chiropractic to Ayurveda) offer greater benefits to patients.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a delight to read &lt;a href="http://www.coppolathebook.com/book.php"&gt;a new book&lt;/a&gt;¬†¬† about a doctor who was exposed to real flak in Iraq. His story is a wonderful reminder of how effective modern medicine is and it is an eye-opener about the selfless dedication of doctors who put themselves in harm‚Äôs way; who accept lower incomes, separation from families, and poor living conditions; who care desperately about their patients; and who magnanimously apply the same skills to treating friend and foe.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coppola: A Pediatric Surgeon in Iraq&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The author, Chris Coppola, is an Air Force pediatric surgeon who was twice deployed to Balad Air Base, 50 miles north of Baghdad, as a trauma surgeon. In his first night on call, he treats the five worst gunshot injuries he has ever seen ‚Äì and they are all in the same patient! Despite serious damage to liver, colon, small intestine, pancreas, duodenum, vena cava and spine, the patient, a 22 year old Iraqi policeman, recovers. As the foreword of the book explains, the survival rate for troops injured in the field was 20% in WWI, 40% in WWII, 66% in Viet Nam, and is now an astounding 97% in Iraq. Lessons learned in war are translated to civilian trauma care and we all benefit from the knowledge however much we may deplore the war.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No subluxations were adjusted, no qi manipulated, no acupuncture points stimulated, no homeopathic or herbal medicines given. Beside numbers like these, alternative medicine looks pretty puny and irrelevant. And the Air Force‚Äôs initiative to train doctors in battlefield acupuncture looks frankly delusional.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coppola is in Iraq during the first elections. An elderly woman is the victim of an IED (Improvised Explosive Device) detonated near a line of people waiting to vote. As they prepare her for surgery to stabilize her broken bones, she proudly holds up her right index finger with the purple ink stain showing she voted. They also treat a 17 year old girl who was shot in the neck at a polling place and will likely never walk again. They treat a small child with a skull fractured by shrapnel while waiting with his father in a voting line. Children are particularly at risk from IEDs: their heads are proportionately larger and they are closer to the ground.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They treat an insurgent whose bomb detonated prematurely. He is a would-be murderer, but all Coppola sees is ‚Äúa dying man who needs our treatment.‚Äù¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has to work through translators. Cultural differences intrude as he tries to explain to a father that his baby ‚Äúboy‚Äù is really a girl with an intersex condition. Such a child would be raised as a girl in the US, but the Iraqi father violently objects to that option because of cultural prejudice against females.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They treat many Iraqi citizens and are worried when they release them because they are not likely to get adequate follow-up care. The Iraqi medical system has been devastated: doctors have fled, supplies are impossible to get. The Iraqis are not taxed: the government is funded only by oil sales and foreign aid. They do colostomies meant to be temporary but know it is unlikely their patients will ever be able to get the colostomies taken down. They see Iraqis with soiled towels wrapped around their colostomies because they can‚Äôt get colostomy bags. When a colleague wonders if they should send a patient to a burn facility, he is told ‚ÄúWe&lt;em&gt; are&lt;/em&gt; the burn facility in Iraq.‚Äù¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iraqi children he treats are small for their age and malnourished. Nutritious food is part of the medical treatment. They discover that a Kurdish refugee boy is only taking a few bites of his meals and hoarding the rest to take home to his family. They persuade him to eat by offering him Oreos and enough other donations from their own care packages to fill two large bags to take home.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coppola paints a vivid picture of deployed life: eating MREs (Meals Ready to Eat), jogging with 35 pounds of body armor and other protective equipment, suffering through the ‚Äúhurry up and wait‚Äù military hassles, having to wear a gun in the OR during alerts, taking cover from incoming missiles, desperately missing his family. There is a signpost with the distance to various cities around the world, topped by a sign ‚ÄúHell ‚Äì 0 miles.‚Äù And yet he is more than willing to go back for a second deployment because he knows how badly he is needed.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He treats casualties from the battle at Abu Ghraib prison, where prisoners and insurgents mounted a coordinated attack on the guards. Iraqis tell him they were not surprised to learn that prisoners had been tortured by Americans. They assumed that torture was being used ‚Äì torture had always been a part of that prison, and far worse had happened under Saddam Hussein, attested to by the adjacent mass graves. Not that that‚Äôs any excuse.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By his second tour, the patient population had changed. After the troop surge, Al Qaeda was no longer so brave about attacking Americans; now they concentrated on civilian targets, even including schools. Instead of American and Iraqi soldiers, now most of their patients are civilians and 1/3 of them are children.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most affecting stories in the book is that of Leila, a little girl who was extensively burned by an incendiary bomb thrown into her home. Her father was an Iraqi officer who had been successfully subduing the insurgents in his area and this was an act of revenge. Coppola is doing a complicated skin graft procedure on Leila when an emergency intervenes to commandeer his OR; he has to improvise to save the grafts and free up the OR as soon as possible. He treats her tenderly for a couple of months and is devastated when she eventually dies of a complicating infection. Later an Iraqi adult patient is taken away by guards. Coppola learns that that patient was the one who had thrown the firebomb into Leila‚Äôs house ‚Äì and the American hospital had saved his life. And he later learns that Leila‚Äôs father is killed by insurgents.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another detainee is ungrateful even after several life-saving operations. He only speaks to repeatedly vow to shoot them all.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coppola is in the OR during a Christmas USO show with Robin Williams, Lance Armstrong, Miss USA, Kid Rock, Lewis Black and other celebrities. He is sorry that he missed the concert but says he couldn‚Äôt have enjoyed it knowing a child was waiting to be operated on. He says, ‚ÄúEach new injured child I see seems to rip the scab off a wound in my heart that won‚Äôt let me rest.‚Äù One of the reasons he chose surgery over pediatrics is that he is so distressed when he has to cause pain to an awake child.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coppola accepted an Air Force scholarship and advanced training that obligated him to 6 years of pay-back service. He points out that this meant a financial disadvantage. In 3 years in private practice he could have paid off any medical school debts and still have had a greater income than his Air Force salary for 6 years. He joined the Air Force because he wanted to serve his country. He went to Iraq because he had signed a contract and was obligated to go wherever they sent him.¬† Some of his colleagues supported the war, some did not, but they were all there to save lives. All were volunteers.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word kept running through my mind as I read this book. It is a word seldom used these days. The word is ‚Äúhonor.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

After all, it's not like we've gone and made it in a lab or discovered it in an experiment.  15 years after David Weinberg composed &lt;a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~dhw/Silliness/darkmatterrap.mp3"&gt;the Dark Matter Rap&lt;/a&gt;, we still don't know exactly what dark matter is.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's a whole lot that we do know about it just from looking out at the Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter/galaxycluster.jpg" width="500" title="That&amp;#39;s one rich cluster!" alt="galaxycluster.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, there are a whole bunch of scales we can see, from galaxies to clusters to superclusters and the large-scale structure of the Universe as a whole.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter/soapbubbles-large.gif" width="500" title="Thanks to some new surveys, we can map the positions of millions and millions of galaxies..." alt="soapbubbles-large.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And -- since the big bang happened just under 14 billion years ago -- we can look at what these objects looked like at many different times along the way.  We can see galaxies back when the Universe was a few hundred million years old, clusters when it was just 3 billion years old,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter/farthestgalaxycluster.jpg" width="500" title="10.2 billion years ago, the light from this cluster was emitted.  Today, this is what we see." alt="farthestgalaxycluster.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the overall large-scale structure all the way back to when the Universe was just a few hundred thousand years old!  (Thanks, &lt;a href="http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~afrank/A105/LectureXVI/COBE_Wmap.jpg"&gt;WMAP&lt;/a&gt;!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what do we learn about the properties of dark matter from all of this?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter/reddwarfplanet.jpg" width="500" title="Not like a planet at all..." alt="reddwarfplanet.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. It isn't in dense clumps.&lt;/b&gt;  Not faint, dark stars, not planets, not basketballs, and not gas and dust.  We've already gone over that it can't be normal matter, but it also &lt;i&gt;can't form structures&lt;/i&gt; the same way that normal matter does.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter/n4216-halo2.gif" width="500" title="Every galaxy had a dark matter halo that dwarfs -- in both size and mass -- the galaxy you&amp;#39;re used to seeing." alt="n4216-halo2.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. It doesn't interact with itself.&lt;/b&gt;  Yes, it interacts gravitationally, but that's not what I mean.  It doesn't feel the strong nuclear force, it doesn't feel the electromagnetic force, and if it feels the weak force, it feels it even more weakly than &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino"&gt;neutrinos&lt;/a&gt; do!  (And you need about a light year of lead to stop your typical neutrino.)  As a result of this, dark matter is incredibly fluffy and diffuse, which means even in our Solar System, by the heart of our galaxy, dark matter's effects are negligibly unobservable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter/distant_galaxy.jpg" width="500" title="Structure formation is the key to understanding dark matter, at least astrophysically." alt="distant_galaxy.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. These dark halos form very early.&lt;/b&gt;  This is very important.  Looking back as far as we can see, we find that these diffuse collapsed structures have been around for pretty much the entire history of the Universe.  This tells us that the dark matter is &lt;i&gt;cold&lt;/i&gt;, or that its &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"&gt;kinetic energy&lt;/a&gt; has pretty much always been much, much less than its mass.  This rules out every single standard model particle that we know of from being dark matter, since the stable ones are relatively light and are all produced &lt;i&gt;hot&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter/dark-matter-625x450.jpg" width="500" title="Dark matter?  Whoomp!  There it is!" alt="dark-matter-625x450.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So what is it?&lt;/b&gt;  Unfortunately, this is really all we know about &lt;a href="http://cdms.berkeley.edu/Education/DMpages/essays/candidates.shtml"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt;.  We know how much there is, we know what its gravitational effects are, we know how it &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; interact, and we know that it's always been cold and relatively slow-moving.  Can you invent something that meets these requirements?  Then congratulations, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; have just invented a dark matter candidate!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the viable candidates fall into three main categories:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter/images-thumb-130x97-21304.jpeg" width="117" height="87" alt="images.jpeg"&gt;The Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP)&lt;/b&gt;: you were once hot and produced during the big bang, but you stopped interacting with the rest of the Universe when it was very young.  You cooled and collapsed, and you were heavy enough that by time we see structure, you're cold.  The &lt;b&gt;lower limit&lt;/b&gt; on how massive you are is somewhere around 100 times greater than the mass of a proton.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter/images-1.jpeg" width="121" height="80" alt="images-1.jpeg"&gt;The Reptile&lt;/b&gt;: because you were born cold.  You could have a large mass or a teeny-tiny mass, or be anywhere in between.  But however you were made, you were born with very little energy, and were therefore made (or at least given a mass) sometime &lt;i&gt;well after&lt;/i&gt; the big bang.  The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion"&gt;axion&lt;/a&gt; is a great example of this, and I just invented the moniker "reptile", so be prepared to explain yourself to your physicist friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter/images-2-thumb-130x97-21307.jpeg" width="130" height="97" alt="images-2.jpeg"&gt;The exotic&lt;/b&gt;: because you're not like anything else we know in the Universe.  Maybe you're a bunch of unstable particles held together by some bizarre property that renders you undetectable.  Maybe you're a fundamental fluid with a miniscule amount of viscosity, the only one we've ever encountered in the Universe.  And maybe you're something else entirely, but you're neither WIMP nor a reptile.  That's okay, we've got a home for you.  "Exotic."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
And that's it.  There are searches going on for all three types, there are indirect tests trying to distinguish the three types, and so far, all we've learned is that dark matter isn't any of the things we would have been able to find so far.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there's still a very, very long way to go to discover what it is.  But although I may not be able to tell you that it's an elephant, I know it has tusks, a trunk, and smells terrible!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For myself, I've concluded that dark matter very, very likely exists, that these three places are the right places to be looking, and that the more astrophysical evidence we can acquire (to tell us where the dark matter is, what its gravity is doing, etc.), the better we'll know this unseen elephant.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concludes my official series on Dark Matter, but I'm always happy to talk more about it and answer good questions!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/what_is_dark_matter.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256624446495"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=4524">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/355208549fddd0d5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><category term="News From Around The Blogosphere"/><category term="Weirdness"/><category term="athvertising"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="Baby Einstein"/><category term="California"/><category term="Dollhouse"/><category term="Felicia Day"/><category term="Inland Empire Atheists"/><category term="Iowa"/><category term="Joss Whedon"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Sean Astin"/><category term="Walt Disney"/><category term="zombie"/><title type="html">News From Around The Blogosphere 10.26.09</title><published>2009-10-27T06:15:53Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T06:15:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/26/news-from-around-the-blogosphere-10-26-09/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:CQoRPUP__nuksM:http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerderby/einstein_baby.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:CQoRPUP__nuksM:http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerderby/einstein_baby.jpg" alt="" width="106" height="115"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/education/24baby.html?_r=2"&gt;Walt Disney refunds parents for not making their kids geniuses&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì Disney is refunding parents for all those ‚ÄúBaby Einstein‚Äù videos.

Unfortunately, as seems to be the case lately, other things have distracted me, and I'm late to the party. Better late than never, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, &lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/"&gt;Biofortified&lt;/a&gt; is in the Ashoka Changemakers contest, GMO Risk or Rescue. First prize is a $1500 grant and a conversation with Michael Pollan. Thanks to PZ, Biofortified has pulled into first place. Even though my vote-generating mojo does not approach PZ's, I thought I'd still ask my readers to go and register, and then to vote for Biofortified. Instructions are &lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/2009/10/vote-for-biofortified/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href="http://www.gmwatch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=11620:fixing-the-competition"&gt;want some of that filthy Monsanto lucre&lt;/a&gt; that is supposedly (or so it is implied) behind an astroturf movement that (or so the anti-GMO cranks think) is behind PZ and everyone else who is supporting Biofortified at this late stage in the game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This group has been putting out the following messsage on Twitter: "Vote for Biofortified in Ashoka Changemakers contest".
 
A Monsanto PR operator has discreetly done the same and now the votes for Biofortified have suddenly exploded, more than doubling in a matter of hours in a completely unprecedented pattern.

&lt;p&gt;The winner of the Chagemakers competition gets a cash prize of $1500 and a conversation with New York Times food writer, Michael Pollan, but above all cudos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think the GM industry trying to fix this competition stinks, then please vote for one of the anti-GM candidates in the Changemakers contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leading anti-GM contestant at the moment supporting consumer choice is the NonGMOProject who are trying to bring voluntary GM labelling to the U.S. You can find out more here: http://www.changemakers.com/en-us/node/58742&lt;br&gt;
Voting on the Changemakers site can be a bit confusing so we've given clear instructions below. Please make the effort and vote today as voting will close very soon. Thank you!&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Don't let the biotech industry steal the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilarious, and such an utterly, pathetically predictable response from cranks. In any case, if I'm going to be a "pharma shill" (as so many anti-vaccinationists and alt-med cranks accuse me), I might as well be a GMO shill too, right? Why the heck not? So help me get a share of that beautiful Monsanto biotech money&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt; and at the same time help a great skeptical blogger win the competition. The vote ends at 6 PM on Wednesay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;For the irony-challenged, literal-minded cranks who like to attack me, that is sarcasm. I'm joking. I don't need any of that Monsanto lucre. Pharma companies, and in particular vaccine manufacturers, pay me more than enough to keep me able to stay in my sweatpants all day churning out anti-alt-med screeds.&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And stupidity - just in case the vendors of this nonsense might believe they've actually created something useful. Read it, and see...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are building your own audiophile power cord to improve component performance, you need the WattGate 381 receptacle. Why build a performance power cable only to plug it into the same receptacle that's been in use for almost 100 years? WattGate's 381 is a no compromise solution for the demanding AV enthusiast. Construction of the 381 is top-notch and features glass-filled, nylon front and rear housings. Mounting strap, rivets and grounding strip are gold plated, solid brass for the ultimate in corrosion resistance and power transfer. Installation of the 381 is simple and efficient due to rear wiring and large, #10 brass terminal screws. Terminal clamps are gold plated, solid brass and shaped to better grip the conductors. Like the 330 and 350, the 381 leaves the competition behind with its contacts. Configured in a triple-wiper design allows the plug blades to be gripped at three separate points. Additionally, the heavy-duty contacts maximize the clamping spring-rate and ensure conductivity. A three-layer plating process is also completed on the 381: Oxygen free copper plating, electrolysis nickel, and finally 24k gold plating. Receptacle is cryogenically treated and rated at 125 VAC, 20A.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>randi@randi.org (James Randi)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256621594303"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=4521">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c3f5e9e7ff723feb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cults"/><category term="France"/><category term="Paul Haggis"/><category term="Scientology"/><category term="Tommy Davis"/><title type="html">Yet another bad week for Scientology</title><published>2009-10-27T05:27:12Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T05:27:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/26/yet-another-bad-week-for-scientology/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.truthdig.com/images/arts_culture_uploads/PaulHaggis2_300.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.truthdig.com/images/arts_culture_uploads/PaulHaggis2_300.jpg" alt="" width="173" height="170"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First, $cientology Spokesman &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/10/25/scientologist-spokesmen-embarrassed-by-his-own-beliefs/"&gt;Tommy Davis walks out on his ABC interview with Martin Bashir&lt;/a&gt; after being confronted with questions about the ‚Äúchurch‚Äôs‚Äù beliefs. &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/void(0)/*196*/"&gt;Then the French government fined ‚Äúthe church‚Äù 600,000 Euros ($902,200) for fraud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now comes news that Oscar-winning filmmaker &lt;a href="http://www.movieline.com/2009/10/paul-haggis-renounces-scientology.php?page=all"&gt;Paul Haggis has not only left $cientology, but has publicly denounced the cult too&lt;/a&gt;. In his open letter, he blasted $cientology on a number of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haggis called them out on their involvement involvement in California‚Äôs Prop 8 that overturned gay marriage in the state, their refusal to denounce this anti-gay bigotry, and their lies to cover it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you know, for ten months now I have been writing to ask you to make a public statement denouncing the actions of the Church of Scientology of San Diego. [‚Ä¶] I called and wrote and implored you, as the official spokesman of the church, to condemn their actions. I told you I could not, in good conscience, be a member of an organization where gay-bashing was tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that first conversation, back at the end of October of last year, you told me you were horrified, that you would get to the bottom of it and ‚Äúheads would roll.‚Äù You promised action. Ten months passed. No action was forthcoming. The best you offered was a weak and carefully worded press release, which praised the church‚Äôs human rights record and took no responsibility. Even that, you decided not to publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church‚Äôs refusal to denounce the actions of these bigots, hypocrites and homophobes is cowardly. I can think of no other word. Silence is consent, Tommy. I refuse to consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also called them out on the cult‚Äôs disconnection policy as well as their dishonest denials of the policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was shocked. We all know this policy exists. I didn‚Äôt have to search for verification ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt have to look any further than my own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might recall that my wife was ordered to disconnect from her parents because of something absolutely trivial they supposedly did twenty-five years ago when they resigned from the church. This is a lovely retired couple, never said a negative word about Scientology to me or anyone else I know ‚Äì hardly raving maniacs or enemies of the church. In fact it was they who introduced my wife to Scientology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it caused her terrible personal pain, my wife broke off all contact with them. I refused to do so. I‚Äôve never been good at following orders, especially when I find them morally reprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a year and a half, despite her protestations, my wife did not speak to her parents and they had limited access to their grandchild. It was a terrible time. [‚Ä¶] To see you lie so easily, I am afraid I had to ask myself: what else are you lying about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haggis then called $cientology out on the cult‚Äôs ‚ÄúFair Game‚Äù policy in which the they viciously attack their critics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How dare you use private information in order to label someone an ‚Äúadulteress?‚Äù You took Amy Scobee‚Äôs most intimate admissions about her sexual life and passed them onto the press and then smeared them all over the pages your newsletter! I do not know the woman, but no matter what she said or did, this is the woman who joined the Sea Org at 16! She ran the entire celebrity center network, and was a loyal senior executive of the church for what, 20 years? You want to rebut her accusations, do it, and do it in the strongest terms possible ‚Äì but that kind of character assassination is unconscionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I am now painfully aware that you might see this an attack and just as easily use things I have confessed over the years to smear my name. Well, luckily I have never held myself up to be anyone‚Äôs role model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great majority of Scientologists I know are good people who are genuinely interested in improving conditions on this planet and helping others. I have to believe that if they knew what I now know, they too would be horrified. But I know how easy it was for me to defend our organization and dismiss our critics, without ever truly looking at what was being said; I did it for thirty-five years. And so, after writing this letter, I am fully aware that some of my friends may choose to no longer associate with me, or in some cases work with me. I will always take their calls, as I always took yours. However, I have finally come to the conclusion that I can no longer be a part of this group. Frankly, I had to look no further than your refusal to denounce the church‚Äôs anti-gay stance, and the indefensible actions, and inactions, of those who condone this behavior within the organization. I am only ashamed that I waited this many months to act. I hereby resign my membership in the Church of Scientology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haggis specifically cited &lt;a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/article1012148.ece"&gt;a series of articles in the &lt;em&gt;St. Petersburg Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showing just how effective a tool the internet has become in combatting $cientology‚Äôs misinformation. The &lt;em&gt;St. Petersburg Times&lt;/em&gt; went even further by &lt;a href="http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/"&gt;chronicling $cientology‚Äôs official responses to their articles (in writing as well as audio) and a host of background information about the cult&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less fun is the part where I try to get paid.  To bill an insurance company, I must use numeric diagnostic codes that best fit what I'm seeing, and I must pick a code representing a level of service, that is, how hard I worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagnostic codes are referred to as ICD-9 codes, and the service codes are called E/M codes. Not all ICD-9 codes are easily billable.  For example, if a patient comes to see me for anxiety or depression, I can't bill for it.  I can bill for "malaise and fatigue" (780.7), but not for generalized anxiety disorder (300.02) (supposedly it's possible, but, like the Loch Ness monster, it's always a friend of a friend of a friend who saw it).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/are_you_a_99214_with_25002_401.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/are_you_a_99214_with_25002_401.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/J6eU72IhSDU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256617458798"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/?p=1114">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/552d7fda560b3fa6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="ghosts &amp; paranormal"/><category term="humor"/><category term="cartoon"/><category term="electromagnetic fields"/><category term="EMF"/><category term="equipment"/><category term="extrasensory perception"/><category term="ghost hunter"/><category term="ghost meter"/><category term="ghosts"/><category term="Halloween"/><category term="infrared"/><category term="orb"/><category term="paranormal"/><category term="physics"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="science"/><category term="skepticism"/><category term="South Park"/><category term="spirit"/><category term="TAPS"/><category term="temperature"/><category term="The Atlantic Paranormal Society"/><category term="waves"/><category term="woo"/><title type="html">South Park Spoofs ‚ÄúGhost Hunters‚Äù</title><published>2009-10-27T03:46:48Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T03:46:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/10/27/south-park-spoofs-ghost-hunters/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/halloween.html"&gt;Halloween and skepticism&lt;/a&gt;, I shall be posting some things related to both in the days to come.¬† The first is a &lt;a href="http://vodpod.com/watch/2309785-theres-a-wetness-coming-from-my-pants-clips-south-park-studios"&gt;hilarious spoof of various ‚Äúghost hunter‚Äù shows by those wacky guys at South Park.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They‚Äôre all pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a list of dozens of students names the day before. I take masses of journals and files down with me to a hall, get given a badge, find a table with my name plaque on it and wait, with a bunch of other teachers. I usually bring a crossword puzzle to start the night off, before everyone arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time? The second parent of the night, I‚Äôm discussing the details of the assessment sheet with enthusiasm. While talking, I somehow start scratching my temple with a pen (with lid on the end, which features a clip tab), because I‚Äôm so caught up in explaining the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tab gets stuck in my hair. Hooks in. I now have a pen, practically hanging from my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:0pt;margin-right:0pt"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left" src="http://img410.imageshack.us/img410/9215/k2avatar.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"&gt;I try to subtly get it out by pulling it, pretending I‚Äôm just still tapping or scratching my head, talking all the while, hoping they don‚Äôt notice. It becomes so snarled that I have to stop‚Ä¶ and ask the parent to help me to untangle myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three minutes, my hair has come out from its scholarly-bun and is now frizzed out in fury, but we finally get the damned pen out of my hair. By this point, we have completely&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;#39;Helvetica&amp;#39;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;[ WARNING ::: DATABASE ERROR ::: CONTENT OVERRIDE ::: SOURCE: EXTERNAL ]&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth parent group of the night (once I have tidied my bun back into respectability and ripped the clip off the pen and disposed of it) are real sweeties. We‚Äôre discussing happily what is coming up for the rest of the year‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;and I swallow a fly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;stand&lt;/em&gt; swallowing insects. I usually regurgitate immediately upon eating bugs. I‚Äôm swallowing rapidly right now, even just thinking of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôve just swallowed a fly‚Ä¶ oh god‚Ä¶&lt;/em&gt;‚Äò and they laugh and say that I should go get a drink but I say that they only have (there‚Äôs a BELL, which segregates time allowance for talking to the teachers!) four minutes to go and I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; tell them the rest of the details of the task their daughter has done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talk faster than I ever have before‚Ä¶ which is pretty damned fast if you‚Äôve ever heard me: &lt;em&gt;here‚Äôs-the-overall-grade-and-yes-grammar-oh-reading-list-don‚Äôt-forget-next-&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it all gets back to the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't think this is a particularly controversial or unclear statement, but then, I know what I mean by it. In the process of communication, however, the intended meaning sometimes gets lost or transformed. A statement that addresses an entire catalytic cycle, for instance, might be interpreted as addressing only the chemical step. This seems to have happened in a pair of papers that concern the transfer of energy from conformational rearrangements to a chemical reaction.Consider a reaction scheme in which an enzyme loosely associates with substrates (E.S), then "closes" to form a tight, catalytically-competent complex that then undergoes a reaction with the rate kchem:Pisliakov et al. (1) ask whether the closing process can accelerate kchem. They ask this question primarily because a group from Harvard University proposed that this was possible in a paper printed last year in J. Phys. Chem. B (2). In that paper, Min et al. performed some simulations suggesting that such an acceleration was at least possible, and consistent with some enzymatic data. Pisliakov et al. approach the question with simulations of the reaction of the phosphotransfer enzyme Adk with 2 ADP molecules to form ATP and AMP. As part of the catalytic cycle, the enzyme goes from an open state (PDB: 4AKE) where the ATP and AMP binding sites are exposed to solvent, to a closed state (PDB: 1ANK) where the substrates are shielded from the surrounding solution by ATP and AMP "lids" that close down over the active site.One can, perhaps, imagine that when the enzyme closes around the substrates, some motion will occur that promotes the transfer of a phosphate group from one molecule to another. Pisliakov et al. use a three-tiered system of simulations to address the question, as a way of trying to get around the difficulty of dealing with the long timescales required.  Their simulations allow them to adjust the energy barrier to match the experimental rates or accelerate the reaction so that the whole pathway can be simulated. In general, they find that conformational fluctuations do not enhance the chemical reaction rate in this system.I have two main concerns about the science that was performed here. The first is that the energy barriers in the long-timescale experiment appear to be improperly paramaterized. In estimating these barriers for the phosphotransfer reaction in Adk, Pisliakov et al. used 260 /s as kchem. However, although the actual reaction carried out by Adk follows an extremely complex scheme, the analysis performed by Wolf-Watz et al. utilized a simplified scheme that combined all post-association steps into a single kcat. This is why the concordance between kcat and kopen justifies the conclusion that lid-opening is rate-limiting. In principle, the experiments used for that paper are incapable of separating the opening and closing steps from the chemical step. Therefore we have no experimental knowledge of the phosphotransfer rate, except that it is greater than 260 /s. This perplexing error appears to have originated with Min et al., but I am surprised Warshel's group did not catch it. This is not a major problem because the bulk of the conclusions of the experiment were drawn from a different simulation in which the energy barriers were lower, but this leads to my second concern. If the structural transition involves a very smooth and coherent rearrangement of the protein, then simply manipulating energy barriers should not result in a serious error of analysis. In reality, however, ensemble motions of protein elements are not going to be so directed or uniform. Structural rearrangements are not highly singular steps, but involve a large number of intermediates and transition states. Motions in the late stages of the structural transition that promote catalysis may well be missed by simplified models, or accelerated beyond productivity by lowering the energy barrier.That said, I'm not particularly surprised that Pisliakov et al. find that energy from the conformational coordinate does not transfer to the chemical coordinate, nor do I disagree with the finding. Despite what Pisliakov et al. appear to believe, the papers that have come out of Dorothee's group don't argue that the millisecond motions contribute directly to the chemistry. Doro doesn't believe that for a second. Neither do I. The importance of dynamics has little to do with shoving the reaction along the chemistry coordinate, but everything to do with getting substrates bound and into a state where chemistry is possible.Dynamics allow an enzyme to reconcile incompatible functional requirements. To efficiently function as a phosphotransfer enzyme (as opposed to a hydrolytic phosphatase), Adk must expel water from the active site during catalysis. If the active site is inaccessible to solution, however, there is no way for the substrates to diffuse into it. It is difficult to create a single, rigid fold that can accommodate both these demands, but by fluctuating between two states the problem is resolved quite easily. So yes, the dynamics are essential to catalysis, but that does not imply that the conformational and chemical energy coordinates are coupled.More perplexing is the discussion of the hierarchy of motion, which Pisliakov et al. take to mean that nanosecond motions somehow contribute to the chemical coordinate. As I discussed when that paper was initially published, the question being addressed was whether and how motions on the fast timescale (ps-ns) in Adk were related to the slower (ms) motions of the lids. In a hierarchy of motion, fast timescale fluctuations enable or promote slow timescale dynamics. In the case of Adk, this means that nanosecond flexibility at structural hinges allow the millisecond motions of the ATP and AMP lids. It was not implied, then or since, that the nanosecond motions in question make a direct contribution to movement along the chemical coordinate. This is not to say that there are no researchers who believe that ns motions contribute to catalysis ‚Äî I've previously mentioned some work on hydrogen tunneling that makes precisely this argument. In the specific case of Adk, however, the contribution of ns motions to catalysis consists entirely in their enabling of the slower ensemble motions of the nucleotide binding domains, and nobody but the Warshel group has suggested otherwise.There is an ongoing disconnect in the literature concerning the role of dynamics in catalysis. While it is true that in many cases rates of structural transitions correlate with rates of catalysis, this does not imply that the conformational transition coordinate is linked to the chemical reaction coordinate by direct transfer of energy. It is more likely that the dynamics of the enzyme contribute to catalysis by generating reaction-competent states from reaction-incompetent states. This is not to say that dynamics cannot possibly make a contribution to phenomena such as hydrogen tunneling, but it strikes me as unlikely that motions on the millisecond timescale will contribute to a chemical coordinate. Experiments, rather than simulations, will be the ultimate test of the idea. However, in principle, this hypothesis can only be tested experimentally on enzymes where the conformational changes do not limit the chemical reaction rate. Because th...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

At ScienceBlogs, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_anti-vaccine_war_on_science_an_epide.php"&gt;Orac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/10/one_of_the_most_engaging.php?utm_source=selectfeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss"&gt;Abel Pharmboy&lt;/a&gt; gives big thumbs-up to the article.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccination movement is a little weird ‚Äî they claim that vaccines, which are universally credited with wiping out smallpox and polio and other bad things, are responsible for causing autism and diabetes and other also-bad things, all just to make a buck for pharmaceutical companies.  The underlying motivation seems to be a combination of the conviction that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/11/27/things-happen-not-always-for-a-reason/"&gt;things must happen for a reason&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî if a child develops autism, there must be an &lt;em&gt;enemy to blame&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî and a general distrust of science and technology.  Certainly the pro-science point of view is fairly unequivocal; like any medicine, vaccines should be used properly, but they have done great good for the world and there are very real dangers of increased risk for epidemics if enough children stop receiving them.  Good for &lt;em&gt;WIRED&lt;/em&gt; for taking on the issue and publishing an uncompromisingly pro-science piece on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the anti-vax movement is more than just committed; they‚Äôre pretty darn virulent.  And since the article came out, author &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/who-is-this-amy-wallace-anyway/"&gt;Amy Wallace&lt;/a&gt; has been subject to all sorts of attacks.  She‚Äôs been documenting them &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/msamywallace"&gt;on her Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;, which I encourage you to check out.  Some lowlights:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôve been called stupid, greedy, a whore, a prostitute, and a ‚Äúfking lib.‚Äù I‚Äôve been called the author of ‚Äúheinous tripe.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;J.B. Handley, the founder of Generation Rescue, the anti-vaccine group that actress Jenny McCarthy helps promote, sent an essay titled ‚ÄúPaul Offit Rapes (intellectually) Amy Wallace and Wired Magazine.‚Äù In it, he implied that Offit had slipped me a date rape drug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just now, I got an email so sexually explicit that I can‚Äôt paraphrase it here. Except to say it contained the c-word.  And a reference to dead fish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In his book, Autism‚Äôs False Prophets, Dr. Offit writes about scientists who have been intimidated into staying silent about autism/vaccines.  If scientists ‚Äì who are armed with facts and trained to interpret them ‚Äì are afraid, can it be any surprise that a lot of parents are, too?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It‚Äôs pretty horrifying stuff.  But there is good news:  Wallace also reports that the large majority of emails she has received were actually in favor of the piece, and expressed gratitude that she had written it.  There are strong forces arrayed against science, but the truth is on our side, and a lot of people recognize it.  It gives one a bit of hope.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256612708445"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/10/chaos_and_initial_conditions.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4dec108f6521ed6c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chaos"/><title type="html">Chaos and Initial Conditions</title><published>2009-10-27T03:07:15Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T03:07:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/rK6U0W9v9Do/chaos_and_initial_conditions.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/10/chaos_and_initial_conditions.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; One thing that I wanted to do when writing about Chaos is take 
a bit of time to really home in on each of the basic properties of
chaos, and take a more detailed look at what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; To refresh your memory, for a dynamical system to be chaotic, it needs
to have three basic properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sensitivity to initial conditions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Dense periodic orbits, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; topological mixing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The phrase "sensitivity to initial conditions" is actually a fairly poor
description of what we really want to say about chaotic systems. Lots of
things are sensitive to initial conditions, but are definitely not
chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Before I get into it, I want to explain why I'm obsessing
over this condition. It is, in many ways, the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; important
condition of chaos! But here I am obsessing over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As I said in the first post in the series, it's the most widely known
property of chaos. But I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; the way that it's usually
described. It's just &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. What chaos means by sensitivity 
to initial conditions is really quite different from the more general
concept of sensitivity to initial conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/10/chaos_and_initial_conditions.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/10/chaos_and_initial_conditions.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/rK6U0W9v9Do" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256608639967"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=10132">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4d330aa94ab729d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Scientology"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">HollyWoo Report: Scientology Has a Bad Day</title><published>2009-10-27T01:46:46Z</published><updated>2009-10-27T01:46:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/hollywoo-report-scientology-has-a-bad-day/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f059cab8f4e2267933e937b2ca89070&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a busy news day for HollyWoo and specifically, the Church of Scientology. It seems one of their highly prized members has not only decided to take a walk but he has written a lovely letter explaining why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry folks, it‚Äôs not John Travolta but it is the Oscar award winning director, Paul Haggis. It seems Mr. Haggis (of Crash fame) is very disappointed with the church‚Äôs official spokesman, Tommy Davis for his refusal to speak up for gay rights. You can read his letter &lt;a href="http://www.movieline.com/2009/10/paul-haggis-renounces-scientology.php?page=all"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears Tommy not only refuses to speak up for gay rights he also refused to answer questions on ABC‚Äôs Nightline program. Here is part 3 of a 5 part series that shows Scientology‚Äôs spokeman throw off his mike and storm out of an interview.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Hkh2TPhoZgo%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the series is pretty informative if you are interested in the wacky world of Scientology I recommend watching it. Martin Bashir asks some good questions, such as why ‚Äúe meters‚Äù have not been subjected to controlled scientific testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time we have heard or seen Tommy throw a fit. Remember this audio from the St. Petersburg Times report on Scientology? &lt;a href="http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2009/reports/project/church-response.shtml"&gt;Check out audio track 5&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, there was an embarassing batch of news coverage from a recent ABC Nightline investigation which featured a lot of things about the organization that the CoS wishes people didn‚Äôt know.¬† Here‚Äôs a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYGX-nM5vBM"&gt;Youtube link to the Nightline story‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Their public sponsorship of Proposition 8, a hate-filled legislation that succeeded in taking away the civil rights of gay and lesbian citizens of California ‚Äì rights that were granted them by the Supreme Court of our state ‚Äì shames us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called and wrote and implored you, as the official spokesman of the church, to condemn their actions. I told you I could not, in good conscience, be a member of an organization where gay-bashing was tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that first conversation, back at the end of October of last year, you told me you were horrified, that you would get to the bottom of it and ‚Äúheads would roll.‚Äù You promised action. Ten months passed. No action was forthcoming. The best you offered was a weak and carefully worded press release, which praised the church‚Äôs human rights record and took no responsibility. Even that, you decided not to publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church‚Äôs refusal to denounce the actions of these bigots, hypocrites and homophobes is cowardly. I can think of no other word.¬† Silence is consent, Tommy. I refuse to consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined the Church of Scientology thirty-five years ago. During my twenties and early thirties I studied and received a great deal of counseling. While I have not been an active member for many years, I found much of what I learned to be very helpful, and I still apply it in my daily life. I have never pretended to be the best Scientologist, but I openly and vigorously defended the church whenever it was criticized, as I railed against the kind of intolerance that I believed was directed against it. I had my disagreements, but I dealt with them internally. I saw the organization ‚Äì with all its warts, growing pains and problems ‚Äì as an underdog. And I have always had a thing for underdogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I reached a point several weeks ago where I no longer knew what to think. You had allowed our name to be allied with the worst elements of the Christian Right. In order to contain a potential ‚ÄúPR flap‚Äù you allowed our sponsorship of Proposition 8 to stand. Despite all the church‚Äôs words about promoting freedom and human rights, its name is now in the public record alongside those who promote bigotry and intolerance, homophobia and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Mormon Church drew all the fire, that no one noticed, doesn‚Äôt matter. I noticed. And I felt sick. I wondered how the church could, in good conscience, through the action of a few and then the inaction of its leadership, support a bill that strips a group of its civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my state of mind when I was online doing research and chanced upon an interview clip with you on CNN. The interview lasted maybe ten minutes ‚Äì it was just you and the newscaster. And in it I saw you deny the church‚Äôs policy of disconnection. You said straight-out there was no such policy, that it did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shocked. We all know this policy exists. I didn‚Äôt have to search for verification ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt have to look any further than my own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might recall that my wife was ordered to disconnect from her parents because of something absolutely trivial they supposedly did twenty-five years ago when they resigned from the church. This is a lovely retired couple, never said a negative word about Scientology to me or anyone else I know ‚Äì hardly raving maniacs or enemies of the church. In fact it was they who introduced my wife to Scientology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it caused her terrible personal pain, my wife broke off all contact with them. I refused to do so. I‚Äôve never been good at following orders, especially when I find them morally reprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a year and a half, despite her protestations, my wife did not speak to her parents and they had limited access to their grandchild. It was a terrible time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs not ancient history, Tommy. It was a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you could laugh at the question as if it was a joke? You could publicly state that it doesn‚Äôt exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see you lie so easily, I am afraid I had to ask myself: what else are you lying about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is when I read the recent articles in the St. Petersburg Times.¬† They left me dumbstruck and horrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were not the claims made by ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù looking to dig up dirt against us. These accusations were made by top international executives who had devoted most of their lives to the church. Say what you will about them now, these were staunch defenders of the church, including Mike Rinder, the church‚Äôs official spokesman for 20 years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommy, if only a fraction of these accusations are true, we are talking about serious, indefensible human and civil rights violations. It is still hard for me to believe.¬† But given how many former top-level executives have said these things are true, it is hard to believe it is all lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I pictured you assuring me that it is all lies, that this is nothing but an unfounded and vicious attack by a group of disgruntled employees, I am afraid that I saw the same face that looked in the camera and denied the policy of disconnection. I heard the same voice that professed outrage at our support of Proposition 8, who promised to correct it, and did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carefully read all of your rebuttals, I watched every video where you presented the church‚Äôs position, I listened to all your arguments ‚Äì ever word. I wish I could tell you that they rang true. But they didn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was left feeling outraged, and frankly, more than a little stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And though it may seem small by comparison, I was truly disturbed to see you provide private details from confessionals to the press in an attempt to embarrass and discredit the executives who spoke out. A priest would go to jail before revealing secrets from the confessional, no matter what the cost to himself or his church. That‚Äôs the kind of integrity I thought we had, but obviously the standard in this church is far lower ‚Äì the public relations representative can reveal secrets to the press if the management feels justified. You even felt free to publish secrets from the confessional in Freedom Magazine ‚Äì you just stopped short of labeling them as such, probably because you knew Scientologists would be horrified, knowing you so easily broke a sacred vow of trust with your parishioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How dare you use private information in order to label someone an ‚Äúadulteress?‚Äù You took Amy Scobee‚Äôs most intimate admissions about her sexual life and passed them onto the press and then smeared them all over the pages your newsletter! I do not know the woman, but no matter what she said or did, this is the woman who joined the Sea Org at 16! She ran the entire celebrity center network, and was a loyal senior executive of the church for what, 20 years? You want to rebut her accusations, do it, and do it in the strongest terms possible ‚Äì but that kind of character assassination is unconscionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I am now painfully aware that you might see this an attack and just as easily use things I have confessed over the years to smear my name. Well, luckily I have never held myself up to be anyone‚Äôs role model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great majority of Scientologists I know are good people who are genuinely interested in improving conditions on this planet and helping others. I have to believe that if they knew what I now know, they too would be horrified. But I know how easy it was for me to defend our organization and dismiss our critics, without ever truly looking at what was being said; I did it for thirty-five years. And so, after writing this letter, I am fully aware that some of my friends may choose to no longer associate with me, or in some cases work with me. I will always take their calls, as I always took yours. However, I have finally come to the conclusion that I can no longer be a part of this group. Frankly, I had to look no further than your refusal to denounce the church‚Äôs anti-gay stance, and the indefensible actions, and inactions, of those who condone this behavior within the organization. I am only ashamed that I waited this many months to act. I hereby resign my membership in the Church of Scientology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Haggis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ps. I‚Äôve attached our email correspondence.¬† At some point it became evident that you did not value my concerns about the church‚Äôs tacit support of an amendment that violated the civil rights of so many of our citizens. Perhaps if you had done a little more research on me, the church‚Äôs senior management wouldn‚Äôt have dismissed those concerns quite so cavalierly. While I am no great believer in resumes and awards, this is what you would have discovered:&lt;/p&gt;

If it didn‚Äôt affect you personally, either your friend or aunt or mother or sister or grandmother seemed to be struggling with the disease. There was the routine of chemotherapy, hair loss, mastectomy, and on‚Ä¶ it almost seemed as common as dealing with the removal of wisdom teeth. Just take a look at the incidence in Rockland County over 4 years (click &lt;a href="http://www.health.state.ny.us/statistics/cancer/registry/zipcode/breast/rockland.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the expanded list):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.health.state.ny.us/statistics/cancer/registry/zipcode/breast/rockland.htm"&gt;&lt;img title="Picture 4" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/10/Picture-4.png" alt="Picture 4" width="593" height="156"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in Maine, the wife of a professor in my department was diagnosed with the same condition. Many peers had not encountered breast cancer personally until then and I realized my county was unusual. I also learned the couple coincidentally used to live on the street where I grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what‚Äôs going on in Rockland? Some local doctors wonder about environmental toxins and others suggest that the particular genetic make-up of residents may make the population more susceptible than average. Speculation abounds, but there are no answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I‚Äôm concerned about yet another friend having a biopsy. Meanwhile &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/10/26/tweens.breast.cancer/index.html"&gt;CNN reports&lt;/a&gt; on the troubling new trend of younger women getting the disease. The incidence is still quite low, but we ought to be paying close attention. As &lt;a href="http://www.nbcam.org/"&gt;National Breast Cancer Awareness month&lt;/a&gt; draws to a close, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates there were 192,370 new cases of invasive &lt;a href="http://ww5.komen.org/"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; in women and 1,910 in men last year in the United States. Rates in this country are among the highest in the world.

She was probing me to see if I would be willing to accept new students into the laboratory.  As we chatted, I glanced at my email and saw a link to this from MRU's administration:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2009/10/asu_grad_student_shoots_himsel.php"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
ASU Graduate Student Shoots Himself in Professor's Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm left pretty speechless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with a mentor of mine last night over dinner where I shared with him that I feel like I have not yet figured out how to manage the laboratory "right."  I seem completely unable to find the balance between giving people so much freedom that they don't have enough guidance to succeed and being so in their business that they feel micromanaged and overwhelmed.  I hope to someday be the kind of person who inspires people to succeed independently -- to be like the people who inspired me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graduate school is hard.  I think that graduate school should be hard, and I learned so many lessons because I had to struggle with things. Probably the most important lesson I learned as a student was to solve my own problems.  I want my students to struggle with things and to learn to be self-sufficient.  But I think this stuns me because it reminds me that I am learning these people management lessons potentially at the expense of others.¬† &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will I know when my students feel hopeless, versus knowing that they are dealing with a healthy amount of discomfort?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got no answers right now and I&amp;#39;m not even sure that I am completely mentally processing this.¬† All I can do, I suppose, is to keep all of the parties involved in my prayers and remember to tell the people in the lab tomorrow that I am proud of them.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/graduate_student_shoots_himsel.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/TNx9UYL-OXM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256599093686"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/imposed_monday_afternoon_jams.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e0a17a1a7a5350c1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Imposed Monday Afternoon Jams...</title><published>2009-10-26T22:39:42Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T22:39:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/G7DjrC30BhY/imposed_monday_afternoon_jams.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/imposed_monday_afternoon_jams.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure she knows I can hear, but the woman in the office next to me has been listening to pre-K-Fed Britney all day.

In a new study by Steven J. Stanton and colleagues in the open-access journal PLoS ONE, researchers asked 163 Republican and Democratic voters (57 of whom were men) to provide saliva samples both before and after the 2008 election between John McCain and Barack Obama.  What the researchers determined was that Republican men showed significant reductions in testosterone after they learned that their candidate had lost the election.

That&amp;#39;s according to a PLoS One paper called  Dominance, Politics, and Physiology.It&amp;#39;s already known that in males, winning competitions - achieving &amp;quot;dominance&amp;quot; - causes a rapid rise in testosterone release, whilst losing does the opposite. That&amp;#39;s true in humans, as well as in other mammals. The authors wondered whether the same thing happens when men &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; vicariously - i.e. when someone we identify with triumphs.What better way of testing this than the U.S. Presidential Election? The authors took 163 American voters, and got them to provide saliva samples before, during and after the results came in on the night of the 4th November. Here&amp;#39;s what happened -In Obama supporters (the blue line, natch), salivary testosterone levels stayed flat throughout the crucial hours. But supporters of John McCain or  Libertarian candidate Bob Barr, suffered a testosterone crash after Obama&amp;#39;s victory became apparent. That was only true in men, though; in women, there was no change.Heh. Of course, we hardly needed biology to tell us that people often identify strongly with their preferred political parties, and the fact that social events cause hormonal changes shouldn&amp;#39;t surprise anyone - the brain controls the secretion of most hormones.The gender difference is interesting, though. Does this mean that men identify closer with politicians? Or maybe only with male ones - what would have happened if Hilary had won... or Palin? It could be that the testosterone surge accompanying success is strictly a man thing, although it&amp;#39;s been shown to occur in women in some studies, but not consistently.Finally, I should mention that this paper contains some excellent quotes, such as &amp;quot;...Robert Barr, who arguably did not have a chance of winning...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;In retrospective reports of their affective state upon the announcement of Obama as the president-elect, McCain and Barr voters felt significantly more unhappy&amp;quot; and my favourite, &amp;quot;men who voted for John McCain or Bob Barr (losers)&amp;quot;. That last one may be taken slightly out of context.Stanton, S., Beehner, J., Saini, E., Kuhn, C., &amp;amp; LaBar, K. (2009).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚Äì&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always have better explanations for unknown phenomena than resorting to saying ‚Äúa supernatural force did it.‚Äù  &lt;strong&gt;Richard Feynman&lt;/strong&gt;, as always, put it well in this quick black-and-white clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/wLaRXYai19A%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From my knowledge of the world that I see around me, I think it is much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the result of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence rather than the unknown rational efforts of extra-terrestrial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It brought to mind a great line of reasoning that &lt;strong&gt;Hume&lt;/strong&gt; has in &lt;em&gt;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavors to establish‚Ä¶ When anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should really have happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are known flaws in the human brain.¬† Not only are we are terrible data-gathering devices, but we have biases and imperfections that affect our interpretation of the data we do gather.¬† If a person tells you that they‚Äôve had a religious experience, the first question should be how they know it‚Äôs due to an external entity, and not just the inner workings of their brain.¬† And as it turns out, we have an excellent scientific explanations.¬† When the brain is deprived of oxygen a simple centrifuge people report the same visions and feelings as the so-called near-death experiences.  When the temporal lobe of the brain is stimulated, it recreates these ‚Äúmystical‚Äù experiences¬†in labs.¬† &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone tells us that they know they‚Äôve interacted with a God, we can reply: It is far more likely that the experience was the result of our known, natural flaws than some unknown, supernatural divine entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for anyone who thinks otherwise, I present you with this holy pattern from the Church of Jesse, which I am moving and distorting with my brain from many miles away.¬† You have the opportunity to directly experience my power with your own eyes!¬† Kneel before me, preferably while sending a check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this event took place right near a playground Alex is very fond of, with a gigantic marble slide. As soon as we got there, Alex started asking to go in the playground and go on the slide, and we spent a fair amount of energy trying to persuade him to take place in some fun easy obstacle course stuff (touch the traffic cones, hop like a frog, walk like a bear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we rewarded him with a new polar bear from the store that has little plastic animals, and that was our fitness day. Given our current employment (or unemployment) status, we‚Äôre not really in the market for an afterschool program we‚Äôd have to ¬†pay for, for Alex, but we both liked &lt;a href="http://www.autismfitness.com/"&gt;Eric Chessen&lt;/a&gt; very much and think his¬†fitness program for kids with autism is well-designed. If I have one regret about Alex‚Äôs early childhood (and actually I have several) it‚Äôs that we didn‚Äôt play ball with him. I believe that the back-and-forth of simple ball-playing is a form of communication, and kids with autism in particular might spark something that leads to verbal communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MJ says he is the father of ‚Äúthree beautiful daughters who unfortunately have to struggle with autism.‚Äù He is also the driving force behind &lt;a href="http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/"&gt;Autism Jabberwocky&lt;/a&gt;, a terrific blog that asks tough questions. (Disclosure: MJ wrote about us on his blog, and we were really glad ‚Äîand he also left a comment or two here on Autismvox.com at a time when we were happy to get a friendly comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I love about Autism Jabberwocky: rolling list of recent autism blog topics on the lefthand side. It‚Äôs nice to see our name there, of course, but it also reminds us to check in with other interesting blogs. Very clear blog archive by month, listing the number of posts. I always learn something when I read Autism Jabberwocky. &lt;a href="http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/10/what-about-dr-thomas-insel.html"&gt;Today &lt;/a&gt;it‚Äôs a good discussion about Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health and chair of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee. As usual, MJ has pointed out something no one else has really considered, and I doubt I myself would have noticed, as tired and fogged and bogged down by Other Stuff as I so often am. Glad he‚Äôs around with his sharp eye and keen observations.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, so do millions of other people, so she‚Äôs probably relatively safe from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are we safe from‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;colliding galaxies?&lt;/em&gt; Apparently, only Felicia knows for sure, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjRJeaNtxN4"&gt;as she demonstrates in this NASA PSA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey! That was funny! Like, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; funny! Lots of inside jokes for Felicia‚Äôs fans, too (&amp;quot;Is this your first time doing an internet video, Miss Day?&amp;quot;) A lot of times videos like this are just painful, but this one is actually really good. Felicia is great, and the Sean Astin stuff cracked me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think&lt;em&gt; someone‚Äôs&lt;/em&gt; been reading my book‚Ä¶ OK, probably not. But the way she talked about all the astronomy was very natural and smooth, so I just know deep in her heart Felicia‚Äôs harboring a strong and undeniable love for astronomer. I mean &lt;strong&gt;astronomy&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes! &lt;em&gt;Astronomy!&lt;/em&gt; Of course that‚Äôs what I meant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has a great piece where he &lt;a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2009/08/bait-and-switch-of-contemporary.html"&gt;goes after other Christians&lt;/a&gt; for something he dislikes about their (his) subculture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Personal acts of piety and devotion are vital to a vibrant spiritual life and continued spiritual formation. But &lt;strong&gt;all too often ‚Äúworking on my relationship with God‚Äù has almost nothing to do with trying to become a more decent human being&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with contemporary Christianity is that a massive bait and switch is going on. &lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù has essentially become a mechanism for allowing millions of people to replace being a decent human being with something else, an endorsed ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù substitute&lt;/strong&gt;‚Ä¶
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate his point, he uses the example of Christian tipping on Sundays ‚Äî a point &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/01/30/dont-serve-the-christians-on-a-sunday/"&gt;I‚Äôve talked about here before&lt;/a&gt;.  It‚Äôs no surprise that servers *hate* working on Sundays precisely because they know Christians will be coming in and tipping them nothing.  Or next to nothing, if they‚Äôre lucky‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Millions of Christians go to lunch after church on Sundays and their behavior is abysmal. The single most damaging phenomenon to the witness of Christianity in America today is the collective behavior of the Sunday morning lunch crowd. Never has a more well-dressed, entitled, dismissive, haughty or cheap collection of Christians been seen on the face of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ Rather than pouring our efforts into two hours of worship, bible study and Christian fellowship on Sunday why don‚Äôt we just take a moment and a few extra bucks to act like a decent human being when we go to lunch afterwards?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a tremendous critique of Christianity coming from a person of faith.  This is a piece all Christians ought to read, but I fear few will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they followed Beck‚Äôs advice, it wouldn‚Äôt make their beliefs any more reasonable, but it might make dealing with Christians that much more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Atheist&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.the-atheist.com/avoid-responsibility-by-wasting-time-with-jesus/"&gt;raises a question&lt;/a&gt; he‚Äôd like to ask Christians after reading the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
‚Ä¶ Is it more important to have a good relationship with your deity, or with the people around you?  I‚Äôm not implying that the two are mutually exclusive, but clearly some people give preference to one over the other, and in my experience (and one would assume from the article, Dr Beck‚Äôs) it tends to be their deity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give Us Your Misogynists and Bigots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What major institution most deserves the title of greatest force for evil in the world? In a field of stiff competition, the Roman Catholic Church is surely up there among the leaders. The Anglican church has at least a few shreds of decency, traces of kindness and humanity with which Jesus himself might have connected, however tenuously: a generosity of spirit, of respect for women, and of Christ-like compassion for the less fortunate. The Anglican church does not cleave to the dotty idea that a priest, by blessing bread and wine, can transform it literally into a cannibal feast; nor to the nastier idea that possession of testicles is an essential qualification to perform the rite. It does not send its missionaries out to tell deliberate lies to AIDS-weakened Africans, about the alleged ineffectiveness of condoms in protecting against HIV. Whether one agrees with him or not, there is a saintly quality in the Archbishop of Canterbury, a benignity of countenance, a well-meaning sincerity. How does Pope Ratzinger measure up? The comparison is almost embarrassing. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . Archbishop Rowan Williams is too nice for his own good. Instead of meekly sharing that ignominious platform with the poachers, he should have issued a counter-challenge: ‚ÄúSend us your women, yearning to be priests, who could make a strong case for being the better-qualified fifty percent of humanity; send us your decent priests, sick of trying to defend the indefensible; send them all, in exchange for our woman-haters and gay-bashers.‚Äù Sounds like a good trade to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to hand it to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;: this piece appeared in its &lt;em&gt;On Faith&lt;/em&gt; column, run by Sally Quinn and John Meacham.¬† And it answers my question of a few posts ago: ‚Äúwhere is the religion editor who doesn‚Äôt feed intellectual pablum to her readers?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

(The sales do, however, bespeak a deep need in the American psyche.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/26/rick-warren-vs-bill-maher/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/PtAmhvRTxBU/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Apropos, today‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; has an article, &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2233184/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Riding God‚Äôs Wave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, about Warren‚Äôs astounding success as author and pastor of Saddleback Church.¬† The excuse for the piece, written by &lt;a href="http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/polisci/facstaff/wolfe.html"&gt;Alan Wolfe&lt;/a&gt;, is the appearance of a new biography of Warren, &lt;em&gt;Prophet of Purpose&lt;/em&gt;, by Jeffrey Sheler.¬† Wolfe‚Äôs article seems fair, and shows that Warren is actually much more conciliatory and invested in doing good¬† than other big-time pastors like Jerry Falwell and Jim Bakker.¬† But he can‚Äôt resist a little slap at secularism at the end (these faitheist perorations are, it seems,¬† becoming commonplace):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Warrens‚ÄîRick and his wife, Kay‚Äîare capable of astonishing generosity. Rick plows the profits from his ventures back into his faith-based initiatives; in his life, you will not find even a whiff of the scandals that accompanied Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. Kay Warren, while suffering from breast cancer, developed the idea of using every bit of her influence and money to fight the suffering caused by HIV/AIDS in Africa, a courageous venture for a conservative Christian, or indeed for anyone else, to undertake. The Warrens have put to rest the shadow of Elmer Gantry. It really is possible to be both religious and sincere. When you attribute all your success to God, you are no longer focused on your own self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, however, Rick Warren, who shares his wife‚Äôs larger commitments, can be insufferably sure of himself. Seemingly surprised by gay and lesbian opposition to the decision to allow him deliver the inaugural prayer, he tried to deny that he had equated gay marriage with incest when he clearly had. Warren, it would seem, does not take criticism well. Displace your own abilities onto a supernatural power and you are easily led to blaming others for the messes you cause. Avoiding self-interest, you can fall into self-importance. Warren‚Äôs ego is hard to miss. One can only wonder what the presidents of Israel and Syria really think of this provincial from California who seems to believe that he has a proper place on the world stage beside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One does not have to be an evangelical to realize that a world of ruthless calculators living for no higher purpose is as shallow as a world in which religious faith allows no room for individual self-development. Rick Warren, Sheler‚Äôs book makes clear, has found a message that reconciles profit and high purpose, faith and individual effort, and offers a form of humility that, at its best, galvanizes without aggrandizing. [JAC note: this book was &amp;quot;written with Warren&amp;#39;s cooperation.&amp;quot;]¬† It may not be how I, or others, would balance the relationship between individual striving and a life of meaning, but it is plainly a formula uncannily well-timed for our disoriented, driven moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the alternative to strident religious faith that Wolfe presents? A ‚Äúworld of ruthless calculators living for no higher purpose‚Äù? It‚Äôs this ridiculous dichotomy that enables Wolfe to choose the middle ground and heap encomiums on Warren and his message.¬† But what about this alternative:¬† ‚Äúa secular life devoted to helping others, being moral, and enjoying your friends, family, job, and avocations‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The pharmaceutical company, and maker of the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella, has decided &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to resume production of the individual, or ‚Äúsplit‚Äù, components of the vaccine. A Merck representative made the announcement during a meeting of the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Tuesday. During previous ACIP meetings, science experts on that committee presented compelling arguments against¬† continued, large scale production of the monovalent components of the MMR vaccine, which were echoed by scientists in Merck‚Äôs vaccine division. In a moment, I‚Äôll discuss the arguments against the split vaccine, and why this is so important a decision. First, some background on the issue of splitting the MMR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck has manufactured individual measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines on a small scale for various reasons. For example, the monovalent measles vaccine has been recommended during measles epidemics to protect infants 6-12 months of age from infection, and rubella vaccine is given to women without immunity, to protect against &lt;a title="CRS" href="http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccineinfo/vaccine_detail.cfv?id=24"&gt;congenital rubella syndrome&lt;/a&gt; in future pregnancies. But since 1967, the MMR vaccine has been the primary source of protection against measles, mumps, and congenital rubella. The¬† original recommendation for the use of the combination vaccine at 12 months of age, and the recommendation in 1989 to add a booster dose at 4-6 years, has led to the near eradication of these diseases in the US. But in 1998, the infamous Andrew Wakefield warned the public to avoid the MMR vaccine, and instead opt for the monovalent components, spread out over time. This announcement came during a press conference to announce his also infamous, and thoroughly discredited &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper linking the MMR vaccine to autism. It came as a shock to all of us who understand the importance of the MMR vaccine, and who know of no scientific rationale to split the vaccine. Wakefield claimed he had reason to believe the combined vaccine might lead to autism in some children. Of course, his reason was not based on any scientific evidence, and we now know that he had an &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-patents.htm"&gt;undisclosed financial incentive&lt;/a&gt; to push people toward a monovalent measles vaccine. To this date, not a single shred of science supports the notion that the MMR vaccine causes autism, nor are there any scientifically plausible reasons that it would. As we know, &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/vaccines-and-autism/#Key%20Research"&gt;mountains of data&lt;/a&gt; point to just the opposite conclusion. Despite absolutely no scientific rationale for splitting the MMR vaccine, and despite the fact that all of Wakefield‚Äôs claims about the MMR vaccine and autism have been thoroughly debunked, the myth lives on. I am still confronted by parents who are worried about the vaccine, and who request, or at least ask about, splitting the vaccine. On my local parents list-serve, the issue constantly rears its head, and each time I attempt to step in to reassure and educate, I am met with a wall of fear and opposition. Because of this irrational fear, pockets of unimmunized children have set the stage for disease outbreaks, and have already led to &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5733a1.htm"&gt;outbreaks around the country&lt;/a&gt;. Just this week I received an &lt;a title="Measles Alert" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/2009/09md41.pdf"&gt;alert from the NYS DOH&lt;/a&gt; about a mumps outbreak in my own backyard, similar to &lt;a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/2009/09md25.pdf"&gt;an alert in July&lt;/a&gt; about a measles outbreak. Unbelievably, this doesn‚Äôt seem to phase the many parents who have fallen victim to the growing epidemic of vaccine fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons Merck‚Äôs decision about the MMR vaccine is so important. In addition to creating the need for more doctor visits, with more shots, more pain, and at greater cost, splitting the vaccine into individual components prolongs the vaccination process (each component must be separated by at least a month to insure efficacy), increasing a child‚Äôs vulnerability to disease. Administration of separate components over prolonged intervals is also less likely to result in completion of the series, than is administration of a single vaccine. But perhaps more importantly, this decision is a vote against irrationality and an anti-scientific worldview that has begun to endanger society. Many parents will be upset and disappointed by Merck‚Äôs decision, especially those who were &lt;a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/2009/05/return-of-separate-measles-mumps.asp"&gt;just recently reassured&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a title="Cashing in on fear: the danger of Dr. Sears" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=512"&gt;Dr. Sears&lt;/a&gt; that Merck was poised to reintroduce the separate components in 2011. The fact is,  this was actually a bad decision for Merck from a purely economic perspective. It costs considerably more to manufacture, produce, and test combination vaccines than monovalent vaccines.¬† Selling three individual components would also produce more revenue than a single combination product. Nevertheless, the anti-vaccine lobby will most assuredly find a way to paint this decision as a picture of government-industry conspiracy, intent on covering up the truth and depriving parents of a safer choice. One could say ‚Äúyou never win‚Äù, but for now I‚Äôm just happy we did.&lt;/p&gt;

And (I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve heard) this year we have the added burden of worrying about the pigs getting us sick. And the media is all over the pandemic, and making sure you‚Äôre not only terrified of the swine flu, but terrified of the vaccine for it as well. The swine flu is going to kill you‚Ä¶ and preventing the swine flu is going to kill you‚Ä¶ but relax, no one‚Äôs trying to kill you‚Ä¶ except the government‚Ä¶ and big pharma‚Ä¶ and your doctor‚Ä¶ and the anti-vaxxers. But besides them, you‚Äôll be fine‚Ä¶ as long as you don‚Äôt catch the flu‚Ä¶ or get a shot‚Ä¶ ever. Really. Stop freaking out! The only people who have to worry are people who are babies, pregnant, have suppressed immune systems, lung disease, asthma, allergies, a love of bacon, an aversion to ham or go out in public, use handrails, or touch anything that anyone else has touched or possibly breathed on. Seriously. Everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just make a choice‚Ä¶ die of the ham flu, or end up like this gorgeous cheerleader:&lt;/p&gt;

(I will also be able to attend the 2010 AAAS conference in San Diego this February, thanks again to the Knight program.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPCC meeting itself runs much longer than December 12-18, of course, but this seemed a sampling of the most relevant chunk of time. I‚Äôll be blogging regularly from over there, as well as perhaps filing a story. Technically, we Knight Fellows are not supposed to write for the duration of our time here, but this may merit an exception‚Ä¶.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been glum news reports lately, indicating that the Copenhagen meeting may be a let-down. I‚Äôm very worried about these reports, and the lack of progress we‚Äôve seen both from Congress and the administration on climate change (see Karen Aline McKinnon‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/10/26/obamas-mit-speech-on-energy-and-climate-a-critical-take/"&gt;recent take&lt;/a&gt; on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, bringing people together in Copenhagen, with a deadline, will certainly create a lot of energy and efforts at deal-making‚Äìeven if the U.S. cannot bring anything as good as a piece of legislation to the table. So, I am not at all convinced‚Äìyet‚Äìthat the Copenhagen meeting will be fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have another concern that I‚Äôve mentioned in the past‚Äìone related the timing of this event. Sure, I‚Äôm going in December; but I think it‚Äôs a very stupid time of year to have such a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what we know of global warming and public opinion, as well as about contrarian attack strategies when it comes to climate change, having the successor to Kyoto in the middle of winter in a northern country (see &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003490"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for data on the weather and climate of Copenhagen) is just asking for trouble and mockery and confusion. Whether or not there is a cold spell or snowstorm, the images of delegates huddling and perhaps freezing will just give immense ammo to the other side, and will likely generate endless sound bites on Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well‚Ä¶it can‚Äôt be helped now. I‚Äôm still glad I‚Äôm going, whatever the temperature. I‚Äôd love any tips about the city, as well as any comments from those who are going‚Äìor those with thoughts on how the IPCC meeting is likely to play out‚Ä¶.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256583427849"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/britains_got_a_lot_of_singers.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0c6dc33f71405190</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Britains got ... a lot of singers who sing like this, apparently.</title><published>2009-10-26T19:02:56Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T19:02:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/uaL1fWP_7Vo/britains_got_a_lot_of_singers.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/britains_got_a_lot_of_singers.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Universe Itself? The Doctor? Tony Newman and Doug Phillips?) have tried to sabotage the Large Hadron Collider‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;from the future!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I‚Äôm not buying it, but it‚Äôs an interesting idea. The authors of a published study say that we should perform some sort of experiment before turning the LHC on to see if someone from the future is trying to contact us. But I have a better idea: let‚Äôs turn the LHC on &lt;em&gt;and see if it works&lt;/em&gt;. If it does, then we‚Äôre done with this idea. And if it doesn‚Äôt, hand me my sonic screwdriver. There‚Äôs work to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Edited to add: Well, the folks at CERN &lt;a href="http://user.web.cern.ch/user/news/2009/091026.html"&gt;have been injecting particles into the LHC stream&lt;/a&gt; since Friday.

&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;a href="http://scienceonline2010.com/register.html" title=""&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline2010&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/the_registration_for_the_scien.php" title=""&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; I intend to, like I did in the past years, introduce the participants to my blog readers in a series of blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can check out the &lt;a href="https://mistersugar.wufoo.com/reports/scienceonline2010-look-whos-coming/" title=""&gt;entire list&lt;/a&gt; for yourself (already at 201 people!) but I will try to provide a little more information about everyone so, if you are attending, you may be on a special lookout for someone you really want to talk to or, if you are not attending, to see what you're missing so you can tune in virtually next January and make a firm promise to yourself that you will try to make it in person next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can get even more of a flavor if you read the interviews with past participants - many of whom will be coming back in 2010 - here they are from the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008 meeting&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline09&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I'd start the series in a logical way - getting the four of us organizers out of the way first. So here we go....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anton Zuiker&lt;/b&gt; is a &lt;a href="http://mistersugar.com/" title=""&gt;veteran blogger&lt;/a&gt; (see how many years back you can go in his archives!) particularly interested in medical blogging, foodblogging and storyblogging. But even more, he is interested in building a community - using online tools to get people together in real life. Thus, he organized a series of monthly blogger meetups over the years, the annual Blogger BBQ at his home, a Long Table series of events (just started last month), several blogging conferences and found &lt;a href="http://blogtogether.org/" title=""&gt;BlogTogether.org&lt;/a&gt;, a community of North Carolina bloggers and online communicators that is the official organizer of the ScienceOnline conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anton is &lt;a href="http://www.jomc.unc.edu/graduate-studies-graduate-students/medical-journalism-students#2002" title=""&gt;one of the first graduates&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://jomc.unc.edu/medicaljournalism" title=""&gt;Medical and Science Journalism Program at UNC&lt;/a&gt; and is currently the Manager of Internal Communications at the &lt;a href="http://www.dukemedicine.org/" title=""&gt;Duke University Health System&lt;/a&gt;. If that is not enough for you - the list gets longer on his &lt;a href="http://mistersugar.com/about" title=""&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt;....and of course, you can follow him &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mistersugar" title=""&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephanie Willen Brown&lt;/b&gt; is &lt;a href="http://jomc.unc.edu/faculty-staff-staff-by-area/brown-stephanie-willen" title=""&gt;the director&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://parklibrary.jomc.unc.edu/" title=""&gt;Park Library&lt;/a&gt;, the library of the &lt;a href="http://jomc.unc.edu/" title=""&gt;School of Journalism and Mass Communication&lt;/a&gt; at UNC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephanie's blog is &lt;a href="http://cogscilibrarian.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;CogSci Librarian&lt;/a&gt; and you can also follow her &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/JoMCParkLib" title=""&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. At ScienceOnline2010, Stephanie will co-moderate the session "Scientists! What can your librarian do for you?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Kroll&lt;/b&gt; is the Professor and Chair of Pharmaceutical Sciences at &lt;a href="http://www.nccu.edu/index.cfm" title=""&gt;North Carolina Central University&lt;/a&gt;, but if you are a regular reader of science blogs, you probably know him better as Abel PharmBoy of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/" title=""&gt;Terra Sigilatta&lt;/a&gt; blog and the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/abelpharmboy" title=""&gt;eponymous Twitter handle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ScienceOnline2010, David will co-moderate the session "Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial Session: Engaging underrepresented groups in online science media."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you know me (and if you are here for the first time - welcome and look around - you can learn more about me on my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/about.php" title=""&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; and find me in various online places all linked &lt;a href="http://coturnix.org/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/scienceonline2010_-_introducin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/YD38Dbl_h80" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256582207016"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1842">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da409beadb835e2c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and advertising"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">Complimentary Internet in the lobby</title><published>2009-10-26T18:28:34Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T18:28:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1842" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does "Complimentary High-speed Internet access on the lobby level" mean?  You can see the phrase on the website of the &lt;a href="http://www1.hilton.com/en_US/hi/hotel/IADAHHF-Hilton-Washington-Dulles-Airport-Virginia/index.do"&gt;Hilton Washington Dulles Airport hotel&lt;/a&gt;.  Did you imagine it meant that if you opened your laptop on the lobby level of the hotel a wireless Internet network would come up and you could connect for free?  Oh, you are so naive. You are not a sophisticated jet-setter like Robert Langdon and me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Actually, until a few minutes ago I was like you.  I imagined, trustingly, that after checking out of my room and doing my morning recording session at &lt;a href="http://www.teach12.com/"&gt;The Teaching Company&lt;/a&gt;, I¬†would be able to sit in the lobby of my hotel and continue to work on academic and administrative tasks until my evening flight out of Dulles, and I would have complimentary high-speed wireless Internet access courtesy of the hotel.  But instead the usual &amp;quot;Now agree to a $9.99 charge on your room bill&amp;quot; screen came up as soon as I pointed the browser in the direction of Language Log.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went and asked at the registration desk.  And here is what Hilton Hotels thought "complimentary high-speed Internet access" meant: if you are a guest, and you register for Internet access in your room, and agree to have the $9.99 charged thereto, then after that you can also use your laptop in the lobby for no extra charge.  So &lt;b&gt;if you pay $9.99 for the relevant 24 hours&lt;/b&gt; it's free.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's a pretty weird interpretation of "complimentary".  Suppose (I invited the assistant manager to imagine) they said there were complimentary apples on the lobby level, and when you went to get some they explained that they actually meant that if you went up to your room and paid for an order of room-service apples to be brought up and signed for, you could then bring one down and eat it in the lobby area.  Would you not be mildly surprised?  Or even modestly irked?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only the linguistic point I am concerned with here.  I had picked this hotel after reading its Internet access policies; they were important to my plans.  I am a native speaker of English, and I felt that I the text they published had genuinely misled me on an important point.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't tell this story to criticize Hilton Hotels. The assistant manager immediately saw the force of my logic and the misleading character of the website language.  What she did was to reopen my bill, get me registered as agreeing to pay $9.99 for another 24 hourse, and then she used her discretion to take $9.99 off the bill.  Net money changing hands: zero dollars, zero cents.  Net cost to hotel (where the wireless router is on all the time no matter what), zero.  Another satisfied customer, at no expense.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the composer of the website boilerplate really does need to be taken back to truth-in-advertising school.  The notion that "complimentary Internet access" might mean "complimentary Internet access for those guests who have paid for Internet access" is going a semantic bridge too far.  Isn't that right?  Is it me, or is it them?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

In the comment, Johnson had related¬† how some of his New Atheist-inspired scientist colleagues had behaved toward religious folks at bridge-building conservation events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comment obviously reflected one individual‚Äôs experience and point of view, and nothing more. But it struck me as worth highlighting, in light of my many well known concerns about the New Atheist movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a bit surprised how much hoopla the simple elevating of a comment into an individual post, with minimal additional commentary, has caused. Clearly, Johnson &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;touched a nerve. Accordingly, my post unfortunately subjected him to various attacks; fortunately his real identity remains unknown (though I am aware of it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of all this, this post is simply to thank ‚ÄúJohnson‚Äù for commenting here, for sharing his story, and for being willing to defend it as vigorously as he has done. It is one person‚Äôs perspective, but as I said before, I consider it a striking one. I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôve heard it, and I hope Johnson and others like him will continue to comment here on science, religion, and the New Atheism, despite the heat it can sometimes cause.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256579810105"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/?p=1960">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c410c99748470de1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Talks"/><category term="The Tangled Bank"/><title type="html">Where I‚Äôll Be Talking (Now That I‚Äôm Conscious)</title><published>2009-10-26T17:53:27Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T17:53:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/10/26/where-ill-be-talking-now-that-im-conscious/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;After weeks of manically scrubbing my hands with soap, Purel, and eye of newt, I ended up getting swine flu anyway.

For instance, when oak trees husband their resources for an extra-big crop of acorns every few years instead of spreading them out, acorn-eating rodents are overwhelmed by the bumper crop, and more likely to miss some, or even forget some of the nuts they cache. These benefits of synchronized mass seed production, or &amp;quot;masting,&amp;quot; are straightforward, but how it happens is less clear. A paper in the latest issue of Ecology Letters has an answer -- synchronization happens accidentally [$-a].

Bumper acorn crops ensure that squirrels miss a few. Photo by douglas.earl.When Dan Janzen first described masting as an adaptation in plants&amp;#39; coevolution with seed predators, he proposed that &amp;quot;an internal physiological system&amp;quot; [$-a] acted as a timer between masting events, with masting ultimately triggered by weather conditions. However, mathematical models have suggested a different possibility, the &amp;quot;resource-budget hypothesis:&amp;quot; that masting synchronization arises through an interaction of resource and pollen limitation [$-a].

Resource limitation works in concert with pollen limitation by catching plants at two stages of the seed-production process. First, if the resources required for seed production are more than can be accumulated in a single year, or if the availability of resources varies from year to year, then some years will be spent building up reserves instead of producing flowers. When reserves are built up, seed production is limited by the availability of pollen to fertilize flowers. Plants that flower when most of the rest of the population doesn&amp;#39;t will fail to set much seed, so they&amp;#39;ll have reserves to make seeds in the next year. This doesn&amp;#39;t require Janzen&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;internal physiological system&amp;quot; for the plants to synchronize, although such a system might evolve to reduce the likelihood of wasting resources by flowering out of synch.

The new paper tests this model in populations of a western U.S. wildflower, Astralagus scaphoides, which flowers at high frequency every alternate year. The authors prevented seed production in the plants by removing their flowers, either in a &amp;quot;press&amp;quot; of three years in a row or in a single &amp;quot;pulse&amp;quot; during one high-flowering year. The plants&amp;#39; response to these treatments would reveal the role of resource and pollen limitation in synchronizing seed production.If resource depletion after fruit set prevents reproduction in successive years, we predicted that &amp;#39;press&amp;#39; plants would Ô¨Çower more than control plants every year, as they were never allowed to set fruit. We predicted that &amp;#39;pulse&amp;#39; plants would Ô¨Çower again in 2006, but not set fruit due to density-dependent pollen limitation in a low-Ô¨Çowering year.The authors also measured the sugars stored in the roots of plants collected before and after flowering in a high-flowering year.

Seed predator in action. Photo by tombream07.The resource-budget hypothesis worked. Plants prevented from setting seed were forced out of synch with the rest of the population. &amp;quot;Pulse&amp;quot; plants flowered the year after treatment, but because few other plants did, they received little pollen and set little seed. They then had resources to flower yet another year, with the rest of the population this time, and set much more seed, depleting their reserves and bringing them back into synch. &amp;quot;Press&amp;quot; plants continued to flower at high rates each year, as long as they were prevented from setting any seed. Sugar levels built up in the tested roots during non-flowering years, and dropped after high-flowering years.

So masting arises as an emergent result of two limitations acting on plants -- the resources needed to make seed, and good access to pollen. A couple of simple rules lead, undirected, to an ordered system that affects entire natural communities.

The thinking is that a handful of atheists might see your sign, realize they‚Äôre not alone, and perhaps even join your group.  The vast majority of people who see it will ignore it.  And some might complain.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But good marketers know that you can get more success by just targeting your ad to where your audience will more likely see it, even if it means fewer eyes altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So forget the highways and buses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase of advertising, we should go for the independent coffee shops:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ad was bought at a coffee shop in Riverside, CA, where they allow groups to rent space for the signs.  Is that controversial?  Not really, especially when you host some of your functions in that same location &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a smart move by the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/InlandEmpireAtheists/"&gt;Inland Empire Atheists&lt;/a&gt;, and I hope they get a few new members in the process.  (And at a fraction of the cost!)&lt;/p&gt;

See what you think:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I just read your book and, like others, really think your "Outsider Test Of Faith" is one of the best recent contributions to the literature. The best thing about it is that it is non-coercive and honest. As such, it is a challenge that is far less threatening than perhaps might be posed by other atheists/agnostics/skeptics. I have one quick question:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To me, the OTF makes perfect sense. I don't really see how one cannot deny the validity without blatantly exposing their own bias. But as you know, religious believers are dealing with an entirely different set of biases, issues, and concerns. Have you had much success in getting them to at least consider it? If so, what approach have you seen as most fruitful? In other words, how the heck do you get through to people that it matters? :) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is an example. I have a friend that is Mormon. We had a chance to discuss her faith and she said that, given a hypothetical choice between knowing that Joseph Smith lied about the divine origin of the &lt;i&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/i&gt; or just living on as she is, she would rather live on. She said she just had too much comfort. Of course, she backtracked by saying she already knew it was true anyways. But what is the best way to show someone like this that there is more at stake than just comfort? It's quite interesting because in this specific case (and with many other intelligent Mormons I know) there is an amazing display of compartmentalizing going on. But when it comes to their religious beliefs the mind turns off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have always felt that the skeptic is at a disadvantage in these discussions because, to the believer, they seem to be offering nothing but the loss of their dear, comforting, beliefs. How would you go about presenting the case so that it is more clear what is at stake, what they have to gain (or what they have to lose by devoting their life to a lie)? I have always felt that getting a person to honestly and critically examine their beliefs is THE key. Once they are ready to be honest and objective the rest of the arguments can't really be stopped.  But bridging that gap can be tough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I responded as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thanks for writing. In my opinion it is extremely difficult to argue Christians out of their faith because they were not argued into it in the first place. We swim in a Christian culture. And as you say, we have nothing to offer believers when compared to the hope for God's help and heaven in the afterlife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's why I wrote my book. It takes a cumulative case like I offer in it to make them see that they are wrong. If you cannot get them to read it then all you have is an argument here or there, and they can usually escape the force of any one argument by punting to other background factors not on the chopping block at the moment. We either present a whole cumulative case or it will be extremely difficult. It's even difficult when we do that, like I did in my book. We must provoke enough doubt that a Christian will want to read a skeptical book like mine. So the goal would be to do that, I think. Make enough headway such that they will want to read it. That's a big enough chore in and of itself! But again it is very difficult to argue Christians out of their faith because they were not argued into it in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my next book there are four chapters that hammer home the OTF. &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/site/thechristiandelusion/"&gt;Don't miss it&lt;/a&gt;. All you can do is argue for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since you mentioned a Mormon &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/sound-familiar-anyone.html"&gt;see this post of mine&lt;/a&gt;. I used this post in my next book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-115118114145178318?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krista Van Vleet sets out to explore the lives among the natives of the Sullk‚Äôata region. In doing so, she establishes the role of ritual, exchange, and nurture which play roles in relatedness among these people. She does so by recounting stories told to her by the inhabitants and drawing upon observations from her time with them. In exploring the culture of this region, she not only illustrates their rituals and traditions in contrast with that of western society, but also explores our own culture as well. This is the primary reason for my reading this book and that which I took away from her writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactions of parents, spouses, children, and siblings only begin to illustrate the relationships among the natives of this region. Highly complex relationships exist within the exchange community known as one‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;ayllu&lt;/em&gt;. The ayllu is developed over one‚Äôs lifetime extending to, as we would call in western society, relatives and in-laws, and to neighbors, friends, and more distant genetic relatives. Van Vleet illustrates these exchanges and interactions with a series of stories illustrating the complexity and subtlety of these relationships. She tells the story of a child, Javier, who had ‚Äútwo mothers,‚Äù in the sense that, when his birth mother (Julia) was unable to care for her child, the responsibility was given to her sister (Silveria) who provided and cared for him as a young child. Javier, in the sense of children being the receivers of food and nurture, was the child of both Julia, who cared for him from birth until her injury, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Silveria, who cared for him after Julia‚Äôs injury until she had recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children, in this culture, are nurtured by the parents. Parents are, upon the child becoming independent, given gifts from their children as a sign of love and gratitude. Silveria was upset when Javier failed to bring her a radio as he had done for Julia, insisting that Javier his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the story of ‚ÄúJavier‚Äôs Two Mothers‚Äù is used to illustrate how children, in a sense, are the child of the parent, it serves additionally to give insights into how Julia‚Äôs sister assisted her when she was unable to care for her child. Additionally, children can be ‚Äúloaned‚Äù to couples whose children have all moved away. This serves to release the burden upon the childless couples to complete all necessary work for their subsistence, but also removes some of the burden from the parents with many children. This exchange of labor (&lt;em&gt;ayni&lt;/em&gt;) is one of the corner stones of their culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Vleet illustrates this in a wonderfully short, but information rich, ethnography containing insights into conflict and resolution, violence and abuse, sexuality and alcohol, as well as many other aspects of life in Sullk‚Äôata. She explores both the said and unsaid, the distinct and frighteningly similar, aspects of their culture. She further explores marriage and the integration of Catholic requirements upon civil marriage and how these requirements have been integrated as another layer of reciprocity is added upon the already quite complex exchanges of the ayllu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real fault I found with this book is the complexity with which it explains. For individuals with only minimal knowledge of anthropology, it makes for quite a difficult read, however, with a bit of extra time and parsing the arguments thoroughly, it is quite easy to understand. Most of her claims are, if not at least intuitive given the narrative associated with it, fairly well explained and supported by additional references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I fear I cannot possibly give this book a thorough review due to my lack of familiarity with cultural anthropology, but I have tried even so. Anyone with an interest in viewing, not just life in Sullk‚Äôata, but also life in our own society, through new eyes would be encouraged to read this book. It will not give you a comprehensive guide to the lives of these people, but it will give you insight into our own lives. You may even come away as I have, wondering why we do some of the things we do.&lt;/p&gt;

It is hard to put this into right words. Those who know me, know that I was shocked to find out the extent of the Bible Belt grip here in NC, and again, I can not help but have immense respect toward Nature and be as humble as our human existence allows. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du%C5%A1ko_Radovi%C4%87" title=""&gt;Dusko Radovic&lt;/a&gt; said once (I know there are plenty of ex-Yugoslav readers here, thus both original quote and translation): ¬ªMi smo mrve na Zemlji, Zemlja je mrva u kosmosu. To se moze razumeti sve dok nas ne zaboli zub. Mrvine mrve mrva...¬´ ¬ªWe are crumbs on Earth, Earth is a crumb in the Universe. All that is easy to comprehend until we have a toothache. Crumb in the crumbs crumb¬´&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes, I was lucky to be born in a wonderful country that used to be, in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Belgrade. Lucky to be surrounded with amazing people who did good, one way or another. Ones who were kind and respectful to show me how to act, and the opposite ones, to show me how not to act and how to avoid the traps. For both of them one big thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of why I consider myself lucky is to be able to study biology, and some 24 years ago University of Belgrade had really extensive curricula. Today, according to Bologna accords, BSc in Biology at University of Belgrade is equal to an MSc elsewhere, but when I graduated Serbia was still not part of the Bologna process. I worked for eight years at the Ecology Department at Institute for Biological Research on predator-prey relationships, small mammal identification and mostly owl research. Thus my full name doesn't ring much bells, as Tanja Sova does: 'sova' means an owl, and that was the word people associated with me so often, it became my pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved to USA, Arizona at first and two years ago to North Carolina, I developed a line of artwork inspired by nature. Discovering Etsy helped a lot in many ways, but that is a story for some other interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up??? You are kidding! Why would I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, well... Since I went into adulthood, I was provided with tools to play seriously. You know, when we were young, it was digging around and taking care of pets that was considered play. With a degree, you just turned that play into some serious job. Now I play, I mean create artwork, and I love it. Yes, giving and sharing knowledge / skills is my ultimate wish what I want to do when I grow more gray, I mean when I grow up ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
In economy like this, and we've been trained that very well back in Yugoslavia / Serbia, one has to be like a cat: to get on its feet. I am open for possibilities, but for now I am self employed making mostly &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop_sold.php?user_id=5602886" title=""&gt;custom orders on Etsy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biologist in me is active, although in the background for a while. Bringing the missing pieces into the puzzle of personal and professional knowledge, as well providing inspiration for art. As a parent, I enjoy sharing links with my children and discussing them. Sometimes I am too busy to be able to read all I would want to, so the most active blog reader in the family, &lt;a href="http://paperdisciple.wordpress.com" title=""&gt;Djordje&lt;/a&gt; comes with his opinion and it develops most of the time into a discussion either when we craft something together or when we are on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's all your fault J OK, jokes apart, when we knew we were moving to NC, I googled information that I considered important to learn where am I moving to (SC and VA were options as well), and just came upon your blog. WOW! The new world opened.  The amount of time I spend there really depends on available time I have, which is unpredictable. However, sometimes there are some hot topics that steal me from artwork and grab my full attention following the links. I was really, really glad to be able to meet in person many people whose blogs I have read. Irreplaceable experience which I am looking forward repeating. It was discovering many very cool people first of all, and learning about new blogs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When did you become an artist? How do you combine your interests in science and art?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I would rather say that &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_transaction.php?transaction_id=14920417" title=""&gt;just like this figure&lt;/a&gt; was more of a freeing the captured sculpture from within, the same is with artist in us: circumstances make the artist surface from within, with each artwork it is more prominent. Whenever I can, I do my best to combine science and art. I've learned long time ago that having strong imagination helps understanding natural sciences, and understanding science brings vast amount of art themes to create. I really enjoy Etsy for although you can find ANYTHING there, it has somehow enough numbers of free thinking and highly educated people, many biologist themselves amongst sellers, who apply science knowledge / theme / process / subject into their art. Again, being popular amongst scientists and students, Etsy is helping in widening the public for really specific subjects that otherwise would not have as much appreciation in general public. Examples for such an artwork is this pendant that you can &lt;a href="http://vosshall.rockefeller.edu/" title=""&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/tatjana_in_nytimes.php" title=""&gt;NYTimes article&lt;/a&gt; brought some amazing people, such as Leslie Vosshall, with whom I worked on pendants I am sure not many people from general public would appreciate or understand: &lt;i&gt;Drossophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. Learning more about her and her work was even greater joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You led two sessions at the conference - one about producing Art  for a blog, and the other about Open Access in developing countries. How did they go and what did you learn from them?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting &lt;a href="http://glendonmellow.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Glendon Mellow&lt;/a&gt; was a joy even before we met in person. There are so many interests we have in common and I love his visions of science. Luckily the format of unconference was really good, as you have on-the-spot exchanging and sharing information. I am hoping we tackled some strings and definitely know that there were dozens of tips shown that are more, in my opinion, technical information rather than art itself. However, all those tips are enhancing blogging. Lot of laughter, some quite unintentional but very welcome, as a result of miscommunication between &lt;a href="http://www.counterminds.com/" title=""&gt;Betul&lt;/a&gt; and Djordje :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.danicar.org/" title=""&gt;Danica&lt;/a&gt; and I are coming from two different angles and I believe we have opened some questions and definitely paved the way to the upcoming 2010 session with Jelka Crnobrnja-Isailovic. I think session with Danica was also good example of how it is important to have people with different backgrounds in the library systems. Even in biology itself, I recall often a block to understanding between ecologists and molecular biologists, for instance. Demands of publishing at the same rate with laboratory experiments versus field work that needs to have few seasons before showing proper results worth publishing simply does not add up. That is one of the topics for upcoming session as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jelka and I are not only colleagues, but first of all friends, and I am sure this will reflect in a fluid and relaxed session at the unconference in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, your art, blog-reading and perhaps blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish a day had more than 24 hours (48 would do just fine) for all I would want to do. It was so refreshing being again amongst scientists and some new kids on the block (Balasevicevi 'neki novi klinci'). I have learned a lot as a parent (at that time homeschooling Djordje), as a biologist to pass tricks and tips to my fellow biologists in Serbia, both who are in education and research, and to understand first-hand the American way of approaching problems I could only read about. Talking in person helps a lot, really. It is hard to stress who would stand out, for there are many, really, and placing the names I would not feel good for the others (say I will mention trilobite, tulumbe, vole dance, discussion about religion just to mention a few topics without mentioning the names), but I really have to say I was blown away with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_101.php" title=""&gt;Ms Stacey's students&lt;/a&gt;! As my owns kids are similar age, I was honored to meet them, and quite a few young ladies and gentlemen impressed me the most with their knowledge, dignity, eloquence and mannerisms. My kudos to them. About my blog: have opened one, but still short in time to write. Hopefully in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you again and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward being part of the conference again. Thank you and Anton for incredible amount of time and energy to organize these truly important events!&lt;/p&gt;

Oftentimes such claims are out of proportion with available evidence, perhaps based on reasonable-sounding theories but not so much on convincing data. Here are a few examples of SBM bloggers addressing food and diet: &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=207"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=251"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=570"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1591"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting subset of food claims relate to the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in the food chain, safety both for individuals and for ecosystems. I‚Äôd like to recommend SBM readers to a blog called &lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/"&gt;Biofortified&lt;/a&gt; written by graduate students and scientists in plant genetics. The Biofortified bloggers explain hot topics and controversies in genetic engineering, attempting to cut through the wild propoganda in favor of calm science. The authors tend to be more pro-GMO than not‚Äîperhaps unsurprising since their careers are spent studying them‚Äîbut they strike me as quite reasonable in their support. Here are a¬†few posts I liked: on &lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/2008/11/what-scares-you-about-ge-foods/"&gt;fears about GE crops&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/2009/01/to-label-or-not-to-label/"&gt;food labels&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/2009/04/the-inadequacy-of-anecdotes/"&gt;anecdotal health claims&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/2009/05/aclu-and-gene-patents/"&gt;gene patents&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/2009/03/breeding-tetanus-vaccines-into-plants/"&gt;smoking your vaccines someday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is a particularly good time for you to check out Biofortified because they are competing in the Ashoka Changemakers ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/2009/10/vote-for-biofortified/"&gt;GMO: Risk or Rescue?&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù contest. According to Karl, a¬†grad student who writes on Biofortified, theirs is the only ‚Äúpro-science‚Äù group in the running. The prize includes a¬†nice grant and an opportunity to have a conversation with author Michael Pollan. If you like the blog enough to vote for them by this Wednesday 10/28 at 6pm EST, see details about the contest &lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/2009/10/vote-for-biofortified/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's quickly remedy the situation.A couple weekends ago I had some pond water on hand, and it turned out to be quite productive. I was on a bit of a heliozoan and amoeba spree when I encountered these things:At first it seemed like a 'heliozoan'*, but wasn't quite round enough. Then I noticed filopodia. Heliozoa with filopodia? Nah. But it didn't quite qualify for your typical amoebozoan either, so I was rather confused. To make it even more fun, some of them had spicules sticking out (see the optical section through the top in the rightmost image above). Then I started seeing similar things without spicules, and they seemed to be related:So I spent an hour or so trying to figure this one out**. They turned out to be Nucleariids, a group of filose amoebae basal to fungi. The top one appears to be Rabdiophrys, which has been, in fact, confused with or considred as heliozoa; the bottom one may well be Nuclearia itself - some mixed images of Nuclearia and Rabdiophrys can be found here.Nucleariids are filose amoebae, meaning they produce long thin thread-like pseudopodia without internal microtubule bundles (which would be axopodia, like those of 'heliozoa'). They are on the fungal side of the great cauldron of Miscellaneous Opisthokonts sometimes called 'Choanozoa' by TC-S. Other times, he seems to reserve Choanozoa for those on the animal side of opisthokonts. Yet other times, he seems to fail to piss off cladists and actually use monophyletic terms. Which one of those is 'in season' likely depends on the monsoon patterns in Bangladesh. Or the temperature fluctuations on one of Jupiter's moons. Further research needs to be done. Materials include ethanol and acid, if I recall. Anyway, here's a damn tree already:(Ruiz-Trillo et al. 2007 Trends Genet; Opisthokonta - our fellow ass-tailed relatives)The Choanozoa/Misc Opisthokonts actually tend to be insignificant-looking amoeboid things most of the time, except for Choanoflagellates, which are these really cute lorica-building flagellates with a cone of microvili surrounding the flagellum on their asses. Speaking of which, opisthokont means 'posterior flagellum', or, less pretentiously, ass-tail. Some fungi (chytrids) have flagellated motile spores, and their flagellum happens to be on the posterior relative to the cell's swimming direction. As mentioned earlier, in most eukaryotes the flagellum performs a pulling action, whereas the opisthokont flagellum pushes the cell. This actually poses some problems for filter-feeding organisms, which use flagella for propelling food particles towards their 'mouth', and may be part of the reason some Choanoflagellates started aggregating into colonies - to stop themselves from moving away from their prey when using flagella.Here's another specimen of putative Rabdiophrys:And yet another:I can keep going:Seriously, I've got A LOT of those guys!Switching to Nuclearia now:Note the absense of spicules:Hey, it could be worse: I also have a freaking pile of non-descript random amoeboid things. SMALL non-descript random amoebae.There's a 'cellular' slime mould that turns out to be among the nucleariids: Fonticula (Brown et al. 2009 MBE; advance publication). The poor thing has been lumped with everything from Acrasids to cellular slime moulds, and subsequently neglected for a couple decades. This is the first documented case of slime mould aggregation in opisthokonts, which may contribute a thing or two to the evolution of fungal and metazoan multicellularity. (off topic note: ciliates can aggregate too!)So now we've finally covered an opisthokont. Phew. That was bugging me.* Just FYI, heliozoa are not a real group - they're united by their sun-like morphology, axopodia and nothing else...** Being too impatient to use dichotomous keys (which also simply fail to exist for some organisms), I use a combination of papers, websites and Google image search to find stuff. Basically, you find something that lists a bunch of organisms in the vicinity of what you think it might be, and then look to see if any of the pictures might match. If it's something so obscure that even Google is unaware of its existence, you have to sift through ancient forlorn journal articles sometimes, but usually it doesn't take that long to cross another name off the list.If completely stumped, I'll just start googling random morphological descriptions in both scholar and image search, until hitting something familiar. As random and haphazard and unprofessional as this method is, it's actually much more effective than figuring out dichotomous keys, in my opinion. Especially when you're unfamiliar with the...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I had a blog post all ready to go saying this whole thing sounded &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; fishy to me, and before I could post it I found out &lt;strong&gt;this story has been confirmed as a fake&lt;/strong&gt;. Here‚Äôs the scoop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reports indicated that there were eyewitnesses to a fireball around 17:30 local time yesterday (for example, &lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;js=y&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fnecton.lv%2Farticles%2Fnews%2F122-meteorits-mazsalaca.html&amp;amp;sl=ru&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;history_state0="&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=et&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.epl.ee%2Fartikkel%2F481056"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs fine, but what had me very suspicious was the report of a crater about 20 meters or so across. In general, small impact don‚Äôt leave craters; or atmosphere slows meteoroids down, so anything in the meter or smaller size wouldn‚Äôt be moving quickly enough to dig a big crater. &lt;a href="http://www.fotoblog.lv/rep/17160/?cid=23313"&gt;Pictures were posted to a blog&lt;/a&gt;; while there was nothing initially I could point to that screams &amp;quot;FAKE!&amp;quot; to me, my spidey sense was all a-tingle. Here‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;js=y&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fnecton.lv%2Farticles%2Fnews%2F122-meteorits-mazsalaca.html&amp;amp;sl=ru&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;history_state0="&gt;one picture&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;js=y&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fnecton.lv%2Farticles%2Fnews%2F122-meteorits-mazsalaca.html&amp;amp;sl=ru&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;history_state0="&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/latvian_meteorite.jpg" alt="latvian_meteorite" title="latvian_meteorite" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows the center of the crater, and again, it just didn‚Äôt look real to me. The crater is too deep for its width (most impact craters are shallower). Also, the rim is too piled up, and there‚Äôs no ejected rock or dirt sprayed out as you‚Äôd expect from an impact. Then, &lt;a href="http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/183537/galery/2/article"&gt;better pictures were posted&lt;/a&gt; and I could see immediately I was right; the crater simply doesn‚Äôt look real. It looks more like what someone &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; a crater should look like than what one actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that turns out to be the case: &lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;amp;prev=_t&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apollo.lv%2Fportal%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F183553&amp;amp;sl=lv&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;history_state0="&gt;geologists from Tartu University confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the crater is not from an impact, and &lt;strong&gt;they even found shovel marks around the edge&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always skeptical of reports like these (too bad &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/26/latvia.meteorite/index.html"&gt;CNN wasn‚Äôt&lt;/a&gt;, though, incredibly, &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1222990/Fiery-meteor-creates-50-foot-crater-Latvian-countryside.html"&gt;the Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; seems to have gotten this right; wonders never cease), but what really triggered my skeptalarm was &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD5MUSBOBK0"&gt;this YouTube video of the supposed crater from the impact&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Z5C-Lh3UfQ8%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt believe this video at all. Look at the crater: the rim just &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like it was dug; the grass just outside it isn‚Äôt disturbed at all. Wouldn‚Äôt a flaming meteor at least singe the ground? And if I didn‚Äôt buy the crater, I really super duper didn‚Äôt buy the flaming rock sitting in the center. Meteorites tend not to be hot on impact! They decelerate violently as they come in, compressing the air in front of them. That‚Äôs why they get hot. But that happens in a few seconds, and stops while the rock is still a hundred kilometers up. It falls at terminal velocity the rest of the way for several minutes before impacting the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the meteoroid (the name for the solid part of the meteor) is falling through ice-cold air for a while before it hits. That‚Äôs why smallish meteorites are not hot. In fact, many are found to be cold right after impact! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was almost completely positive the video was a fake right after seeing it, and I‚Äôm glad to see my instincts were correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was more reason to be suspicious, too. A rock a half meter for more across would make a fireball so intense that there would be &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of witnesses especially given that it was late afternoon when it happened. The media reports don‚Äôt indicate it was seen by many people. No pictures of the actual fireball came out, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now all of this makes sense because it‚Äôs a confirmed fake. So the only questions remaining are: why was this done? To promote tourism, as a joke, to sell tickets? And, of course, was &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2009/10/18/balloon-boy-charges-hoax/"&gt;Richard Heene&lt;/a&gt; involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip o‚Äô the Whipple Shield to Mihkel Kama and &lt;a href="http://www.starspace.lv/public/index.html"&gt;Anna from StarSpace&lt;/a&gt; who was the first to tip me off to the story in the first place, as well as let me know it was fake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These debates were recorded, and assembled into a film called &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114115179"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Collision&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;#39;t seen it, and I doubt that it will be showing in my small town theater, but I&amp;#39;ll be looking for it on DVD. This is obviously not a movie review, then‚Ä¶I just want to comment on one point Wilson throws out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It's not a question of whether we have faith, it's what we have faith in,"&lt;/span&gt; says Wilson. &lt;span&gt;"Christopher has faith in the role of scientific inquiry, rational inquiry. He has faith in that process. Christopher is as much a man of faith as I am."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I so detest that line of argument, that attempt at setting up a false equivalence, reducing all words to equal lies. If the only way you can support your beliefs is by claiming that all ideas, from Scientology and Young Earth Creationism to Ohm's Law and the theory of evolution, are equally matters of faith, then your only line of defense is to endorse ignorance and the pretense that everything we know is stupid. It is contemptible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sure, let&amp;#39;s ask what they actually have faith in. Pin the bastards down, I say, and let&amp;#39;s hammer out the details of their faith ‚Äî don&amp;#39;t let them retreat into woolly-headed platitudes like Karen Armstrong with vague claims that they revere transcendence, but find out what Christians really think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/survey-results-religious-beliefs"&gt;Sam Harris has done so, with a poll that asks atheists and believers what they &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; believe&lt;/a&gt;. The results are amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 65% of Christians believe angels really exist. Over 70% think the Bible is the most important book in the world. 75% think Jesus' execution atoned for our sins. Over 50% think the book of Genesis is a true account of our origins. 75% believe Jesus was literally born of a virgin. Over 70% literally believe in a Second Coming of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In virtually every case, atheists are nearly unanimous in rejecting all of those ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea whether Wilson even tried to support the actual beliefs of Christians in this movie, but it would be interesting and ridiculous to see him arguing for the truth of the existence of angels, placing it on an equal footing with belief in the Krebs Cycle. That&amp;#39;s basically what he&amp;#39;s claiming‚Ä¶it&amp;#39;s just that when you actually get them to explicitly state what it is they believe, they all sound like such clowns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/ask_em_what_they_really_think.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/X-LMhvL00NY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256572056840"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/yum_genetically_engineered_pla.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a070f34ca3573492</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Yum, genetically engineered plants!</title><published>2009-10-26T14:06:43Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T14:06:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/JAgnFav1KWo/yum_genetically_engineered_pla.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/yum_genetically_engineered_pla.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's a good science blog you can help: &lt;a href="http://www.biofortified.org/"&gt;Biofortified, a group blog on plant genetics and genetic engineering&lt;/a&gt; (and, by the way, Sb's recent addition, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tomorrowstable/"&gt;Pamela Ronald&lt;/a&gt;, is part of the team).

&lt;p&gt;To do so, though, is a little more cumbersome than simply clicking on an online poll, I'm sorry to say. You need to register with the contest site, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; click on an entry in an online poll.

The foliage is especially bright this year. We had a wet and cool summer which has historically translated into a very colorful and picturesque landscape. The smells of autumn are in full bloom. Home fireplaces have been lit, and there is this ‚Äòcrispness‚Äô to the air that is distinctive of a New England fall day. The sights and smells of autumn inevitably mean that Halloween is rapidly approaching. And for those of us in Connecticut, it is the time of year in which we help lead a parade of ghost-hunting activities in taking full advantage of the approaching October 31 festivities and amusements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut is sort of an epicenter of some of the world‚Äôs most renown ghost happenings and personalities (which are actually one in the same, when you get right down to it.) Connecticut and its ghost-related culture is famous for products such as The Warrens, Dudleytown, The Carousel Restaurant, The Union Cemetary, The Mark Twain House, the movie ‚ÄòA Haunting in Connecticut‚Äô (not to be confused with Christmas in Connecticut‚Äô or ‚ÄòA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur‚Äôs Court‚Äô), and we have dozens of other hotels, houses, and graveyards that have been featured prominently in books and on television. In a way, Connecticut is to ghosts around Halloween as New Mexico is to UFO‚Äôs around July 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what‚Äôs been going on in this neck of the woods this time of year? Plenty! For example, you can hook up with the folks at GHOST (Grim Hauntings Or Skeptic‚Äôs Truth) led by Barry Dillinger. A while back, &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=51"&gt;I interviewed Dillinger&lt;/a&gt; of creepyconnecticut.net, who organizes a team of local ‚Äúskeptical believers‚Äù when it comes to investigating ghosts and related fancies. &lt;a href="http://www.bristolpress.com/articles/2009/10/18/news/doc4ada76997e039628253804.txt"&gt;Barry‚Äôs been in the news in Connecticut this week&lt;/a&gt; (surprise surprise). Barry is a nice enough fellow, and he believes that he is engaging in a skeptical and critical approach to ghost hunting. He hasn‚Äôt found any evidence yet, but as soon as he does, he will share it with the world. He‚Äôll be out on the prowl this week as Halloween approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those wishing to take a tour of a haunted cemetery and The Noah Webster House, the folks at &lt;a href="http://www.noahwebsterhouse.org/hauntings.html"&gt;West Hartford Hauntings&lt;/a&gt; will provide you with guidance, stories, and whatever else their tour guides can come up with. For those that do not know, Noah Webster was one of Connecticut‚Äôs most famous residents, his name forever associated with dictionaries. A lifetime scholar, teacher, and mentor, his good name has been taken by the ghosting culture that has become saturated in Connecticut. For you see, if you were a famous resident of Connecticut in the 1700‚Äôs or 1800‚Äôs, your ghost is haunting your old stomping grounds. This is the template, and this is what our culture accepts and portrays as truth. I for one thinks there is actual paranormal activity associated with The Noah Webster House. Yes, I am sure that Noah Webster, ‚ÄúFather of American Scholarship and Education‚Äù, is rolling over in his grave knowing that his name and birthplace are the focus of such anti-critical thinking and anti-scholarly activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just in case enough decent people from history have not yet been thoroughly abducted by the local ghosting culture, let us not forget The Nathan Hale Homestead and the lecture that was given just yesterday, which was most appropriately titled: Is This Place Haunted? Folks calling themselves &lt;a href="http://www.ctpri.org/"&gt;CT-PRI&lt;/a&gt; lead a very thorough investigation of the Nathan Hale Homestead this month, and just hours ago, they revealed their findings. Prior to yesterday‚Äôs reveal, the head of this august collection of ‚Äúprofessional people with college degrees‚Äù proudly declared in a recent interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe are not scientists and do not claim to be. This is a very interesting field that cannot be approached fully by science.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having read this, I decided to give up looking for the report of their findings. It went from being somewhat amusing to somewhat depressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those are just a few of the many activities happening in Connecticut this week. Check your¬†favorite¬†search engine¬†for more Connecticut ghost-and-Halloween related activities, where people¬†who are easily impressed by ghost stories gather to remind themselves just how haunted they, rather than the locations, actually are. Sing it with me ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

Well, I pestered him to sit down with me for a video conversation to post here on &lt;em&gt;Skepchick,&lt;/em&gt; and despite a very busy schedule, he kindly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now,¬†most of you regular readers already¬†know how brilliant Dr. Tyson is, but he is also a great guy. He wasn‚Äôt trying to plug a book or anything like that. He simply sat down with me for an informal chat. The conversation was relaxed and unstructured, and¬†before we knew it, we had easily¬†used all the time he could spare us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I wish we had had more time, because we were just gettting warmed up,¬†and before I knew it,¬†the whole thing¬†was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it was¬†a true¬†pleasure to spend even a little time getting to know Dr. Tyson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following segments are the first two in a series of¬†seven videos chronicling our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

Does the $1.4 million they managed to raise reflect massive grassroots opposition to gay marriage?  No, no it does not.  It reflects the political and economic clout of two well-funded tax-exempt brainwashing hate groups:  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and the Catholic church.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland contributed $167,750, with various other churches contributing another $10,000 or so.  This doesn't seem like a large amount until one considers that it is more than all of the legitimate private donors combined.               &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wait, that math doesn't work out!  How is $167k more than half of $1.4 million?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, that's because the National Organization of Marriage, which some (including myself) &lt;a href="http://www.mormongate.com/"&gt;believe to be a Mormon front organization&lt;/a&gt;, contributed a whopping &lt;i&gt;$1.1 million dollars&lt;/i&gt;, in three separate donations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Worse yet, these Liars for Jesus have absolutely no reservations about telling flat-out lies in order to further their bigoted agenda.  The falsehoods in the famous Gathering Storm commercial are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_organization_for_marriage#.22Gathering_Storm.22_Advertisement"&gt;well-documented&lt;/a&gt;.  In the Yes On 1 campaign, they are claiming that priests who do not believe in gay marriage will not be allowed to refuse to perform a marriage ceremony for a same-sex couple, and could face a lawsuit or fines -- even though the bill &lt;a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_124th/billtexts/SP038401.asp"&gt;explicitly states&lt;/a&gt; that such is not the case&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  I mean, you know you've gone negative when there is &lt;a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Maine_Same-Sex_Marriage_People&amp;#39;s_Veto,_Question_1_(2009)#Controversy"&gt;an investigation by the Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; into whether you are telling dirty lies, and she comes back and confirms that you are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But wait, the opposition (the Good Guys) have raised even more money.  Surely, the majority of that money must have come from some sort of powerful special interest group on par with NOM?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Maine_Same-Sex_Marriage_People&amp;#39;s_Veto,_Question_1_(2009)"&gt;Nope&lt;/a&gt;.  Largest donor to No on 1:  The Human Rights Campaign (a pro-LGBT lobbying group) with a total contribution of $155,000.  Most of the money is coming from individual donors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That the Catholic and Mormon churches &lt;strike&gt;extort&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;tithe&lt;/strike&gt; extort&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and then use this money -- concealing the fact to boot, in the case of LD$, Inc. -- to promote hatred, tax-free...  the mind reels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;From the bill:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Sec. 5. 19-A MRSA ¬ß655, sub-¬ß3  is enacted to read:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.  &lt;b&gt;Affirmation of religious freedom&lt;/b&gt;.   This Part does not authorize any court or other state or local governmental body, entity, agency or commission to compel, prevent or interfere in any way with any religious institution's religious doctrine, policy, teaching or solemnization of marriage within that particular religious faith's tradition as guaranteed by the Maine Constitution, Article 1, Section 3 or the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. A person authorized to join persons in marriage and who fails or refuses to join persons in marriage is not subject to any fine or other penalty for such failure or refusal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's right, bigots, nobody is going to force you to stop treating other people like dirt.  You still have your God-given First Amendment right as a righteous white Christian to shit all over the Fourteenth Amendment rights of everyone else.  You just don't get to force &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; people to shit on those rights too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when has the truth ever gotten in the way of some good righteous religious hate speech?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yes, "extort" really is the right word.  You cannot enter a Mormon temple unless you have a temple recommend, which requires that you are fully up-to-date on your tithing.  Mormons aspire to get married in the temple.  You might think they'd give an exemption to the temple recommend requirement for family attending a wedding, but then, you'd think that because, unlike the church elders, you have human feelings.  So, if your son or daughter is getting married in the temple, if you want to actually &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; at their wedding, you must have paid the church ten percent of your gross income (Not net! They are very explicit about this...) for at least the past year, or else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yep.  That's extortion.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-2330699843634869562?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256569207858"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=20551">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6f1227f657517d74</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Education"/><category term="violence"/><title type="html">Looking to Blog Readers for Good Ideas to Reduce Teen Shootings</title><published>2009-10-26T14:32:09Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T14:32:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/looking-to-blog-readers-for-good-ideas-to-reduce-teen-shootings/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In the wake of the national publicity that accompanied the beating death of Chicago Public Schools student Derrion Albert, the issue of teen violence has come to the fore.

&lt;p&gt;The day after the Pew Research Center came out with the report that ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1386/cap-and-trade-global-warming-opinion"&gt;Fewer Americans See Solid Evidence of Global Warming&lt;/a&gt;,‚Äù President Barack Obama came to MIT to speak about America‚Äôs future in clean energy technology. Sitting in Kresge Auditorium before the speech was set to begin, concerned about the direction‚Äì-or lack thereof-‚Äìof domestic and international environmental policy, I hoped that Obama‚Äôs speech would provide daring new direction and a necessary mandate to move away from a fossil-fuel based economy. Rather, the speech was highly and falsely optimistic in these times of uncertainty regarding climate change policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama stood before energy scientists and environmental activists drawn primarily from research institutions in Cambridge and proudly claimed that those who believe that climate change is not an issue are being marginalized. And so it may seem to those of us ensconced in bastions of science and liberal thinking. But the significance of the timely Pew report cannot be understated: Rather than being marginalized, the percentage of Americans who think global warming is a very serious problem moved from 44% in April 2008 to 35% today; the percentage who believe it is not a problem increased from 11% to 17%. Worse still, only 36% of Americans believe the Earth is warming due to human activity, and a full 33% believe it is not warming at all. Obama would have done well to critically assess the pulse of America on climate change before so optimistically claiming that, for Americans, there is ‚Äúno question‚Äù that we must change our energy system because of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at MIT, Obama apparently forgot about the difference between technological solutions and political ones. Drawing on his infinite capacity for hope, he stated that it is simply a ‚Äúdangerous myth‚Äù that our political system is broken and cannot successfully address climate change. With this statement, I hoped that Obama would address the current quandary: As we inch closer to the Copenhagen talks, hopes for a comprehensive international climate agreement have been dashed, more than in part due to the inability for Congress to agree on a climate bill in time. Instead, he spoke straight to his audience and re-emphasized the ability for scientists at institutions like MIT to pioneer new frontiers in technology that can assist in addressing climate change. Technological solutions, however, mean nothing without a political infrastructure to support their implementation, and it is this political system that may be ill equipped to meet the political challenges posed by climate change. Indeed, it may be a more dangerous myth to have blind faith in the ability for our democratic process to address the problem in a timely enough manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama built his campaign on hope and optimism; both of these qualities are admirable and necessary. But the time may have come for our president to speak frankly to the public about the increasingly severe threats posed by climate change and the very real problem that our political system does not seem able to address many of those threats. Climate change is unlike any other problem faced by Americans before, because it has a timescale imposed by the Earth system that humans cannot adjust at will. It‚Äôs high time for Obama to be honest with Americans about these realities, and combine his optimism with a heavy dose of truth. Only a true understanding of the severity of the problem, presented by a popularly-elected leader, will induce Americans to think globally and seriously about climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just inspiring, awesome, and yes, this was all &lt;i&gt;undiscovered&lt;/i&gt; to him and subsequent scientists for centuries.  The ability to give him a single picture like this would have changed worldviews about our place in the Universe for centuries (no need to wait for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1929_hubble.php"&gt;Hubble&lt;/a&gt; to find that the Universe is full of galaxies).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like a table of galaxies, laid out, as it were, just for us.  And now the very views and perspectives that eluded some of the greatest minds for their entire lifetimes are just... here.  For you and me and everyone who wants to see them.

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.secular.org/"&gt;Secular Coalition for America&lt;/a&gt; began talking about getting non-religious students up on Capitol Hill.  It was a service the SSA wanted to offer students and it was a key reason we were eager to help form the SCA in the first place several years ago.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our thinking was: how amazing would it be to get our students positions as interns in Washington, D.C. over the summer?  What if they could work with the Secular Coalition and lobby alongside them?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it lead to a generation of non-theists eager to get involved in politics?  Perhaps even persuade them to run for office one day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian Right has been doing this for generations.  Just read this 2004 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; piece about the fundamentalist &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/08/us/college-for-the-home-schooled-is-shaping-leaders-for-the-right.html"&gt;Patrick Henry College&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of the nearly 100 interns working in the White House this semester, 7 are from the roughly 240 students enrolled in the four-year-old Patrick Henry College, in Purcellville. An eighth intern works for the president‚Äôs re-election campaign. A former Patrick Henry intern now works on the paid staff of the president‚Äôs top political adviser, Karl Rove. Over the last four years, 22 conservative members of Congress have employed one or more Patrick Henry interns in their offices or on their campaigns, according to the school‚Äôs records.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to get our own people ‚Äî rational, science-oriented, equal-rights-for-all-advocating people ‚Äî working in D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre finally ready to launch that program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want secular college students to apply for the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2840"&gt;Secular Coalition for America‚Äôs Capitol Hill Scholars Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
While we can‚Äôt guarantee that you‚Äôll land an internship on Capitol Hill, the Secular Coalition will work with you to get your resume and cover letter through the door to elected offices and do everything in our power to help you land a highly coveted internship on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applicants who are accepted for internships will then officially become part of our Capitol Hill Scholars Program, where we will offer you fantastic learning and networking opportunities and the tools and skills you need to be a nontheist advocate on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hope to offer a stipend for students who are part of the Scholars Program based on financial need.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were still in college, &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2840"&gt;I would be &lt;em&gt;jumping&lt;/em&gt; at this opportunity&lt;/a&gt;.  The chance to do something meaningful, the chance to advocate for issues I care about, the chance to make professional contacts?  Hands down, this would be a fantastic way to spend my summer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SSA and the SCA will be developing this program over the next few years, but there‚Äôs no better time to get involved in Washington.  It‚Äôs an exciting time to be an atheist for a variety of reasons, but the chance to get a seat at the table on Capitol Hill is one I never thought would come this soon.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of 1975, smallpox persisted only in the Horn of Africa. Conditions were very difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia, where there were few roads. Civil war, famine, and refugees made the task even more difficult. An intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in early and mid-1977. The last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox (Variola minor) was diagnosed in Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital cook in Merca, Somalia, on 26 October 1977.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/smallpox_gone.jpg" alt="smallpox_gone" title="smallpox_gone" width="300" height="302"&gt;In the 20th century, smallpox is estimated to have killed hundreds of millions of people. &lt;strong&gt;Hundreds of &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Imagine the United States ‚Äî the entire country, from the Pacific to the Atlantic ‚Äî empty, devoid of people, dead. Smallpox wiped out that many people with room to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, today, it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you think that is? Homeopathy? Detoxification? Thinking good thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. &lt;strong&gt;Vaccinations&lt;/strong&gt;. A global campaign was undertaken in 1950, and within 30 years smallpox was struck from the face of the Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/06/jenny-mccarthy-spreading-dangerous/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.antivaxxers.com/"&gt;Meryl Dorey&lt;/a&gt;, and all you antivaxxers and your ilk: got a response to this? Still want to claim vaccines don‚Äôt work? Still want to stop people from getting them? Do you want to see this happen to children all over the planet again (WARNING ‚Äì &lt;em&gt;SERIOUSLY!&lt;/em&gt; -&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Child_with_Smallpox_Bangladesh.jpg/190px-Child_with_Smallpox_Bangladesh.jpg"&gt;VERY DISTURBING IMAGE&lt;/a&gt;). Because if you are successful in your campaign to stop vaccinations, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll be facing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are perhaps the single greatest triumph of modern medicine. Yet a vocal minority willing to trash facts, spin the truth, and generally spout misinformation is putting not only themselves but you, me, and &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy anniversary, smallpox, gone these past 32 years. And may I add, &lt;em&gt;good damn riddance&lt;/em&gt;. May reason, rationality, and science-based medicine do the same for every other threat to the health and well being of the human race as well.&lt;/p&gt;

The princess was young and fair, and this drew the attention of a knight. Though the knight was strong, the princess loved him not.Enraged, the knight captured the princess and held her in his castle, and told her cruelly that they would soon be wed.The princess was not strong enough to escape the knight, though she tried many times. Still the knight kept her, guarded in his castle.But though the princess was not powerful strong, she was clever. She realized that while she may never be strong enough to defeat the cruel knight, surely there was someone else in the kingdom who was powerful enough to defeat the knight. But how could she find a champion?Feigning interest, the princess told the knight she wanted to create a perfume, whose wonderful scent would mark her wedding day. The knight eagerly supplied her with all she requested, and with that, the princess created a magic perfume.From the highest tower of the knight‚Äôs castle, the princess let her magic perfume be carried by the winds throughout the kingdom, knowing that strong men who caught the scent would be compelled to follow it back to the castle and challenge the knight...Male hermit crabs often get what they want by being bullies. Males of the species Pagurus filholi (pictured) attempt to monopolize mating access to females by guarding the females, often for several days. Females are not physically able to challenge the males, so what can they do to ensure that they have the opportunity to mate with the fittest males? Okamura and Goshima suggest that the females incite a riot among rival males by releasing pheromones into the water.This paper contains six short experiments. Several revolve around using ‚Äúpheromone water,‚Äù which is just water that an female unmated female had been kept in; the actual chemicals that might be involved in the signal are unknown. The authors also made simulacra of guarding pairs by using a live male, gluing a typical shell that a female might have, onto the male‚Äôs claw, which is apparently a pretty good visual imitation. To get the smell right, they stuffed the ‚Äúfemale‚Äù shell with cotton batting containing seawater or some variation of the ‚Äúpheromone water.‚ÄùIn the first two experiments, they show that more fights break out when a guarding pair of crabs, or a reasonable simulacrum thereof, is introduced into a collection of males than if a lone male is introduced. Males will normally fight, but if there are chemicals indicating there is a guarded female around, they will fight longer, which is the main evidence for a female pheromone that encourages male competition.The third experiment tries to ascertain which sensory cues the males are using to detect guarding pairs. If able to see, the males are more likely to be aggressive if there is also a pheromone cue in the water. They found no difference between sewater scent and putative pheromone, however, if the non-guarding males were blinded before the imitation guarding pair was introduced. The blinding of the males makes this experiment difficult to interpret, because they literally cut the eyes off. It would be a cleaner experiment if the effect was reversible (say, by temporarily painting the eyes with something opaque), so it could be tested if the same animals that did not respond when blinded would then respond if they could see. Also, there is an error in the text for this experiment: the words say an effect is not significant, but the statistics listed says it is.The crucial experiment is the fourth. When there is water from an unmated female is introduced into a tank, males fight longer than if sea water, or water from a mated female (one with eggs) is introduced into the tank.The last couple of experiments are ‚Äúdotting the Is and crossing the Ts‚Äù experiments. Experiment five tests responses of lone males to just the pheromone-containing water, and finds guarding of uninhabited shells increases when males are exposed to pheromone water compared to sea water. It seems that there is a greater response to pheromone water collected from a guarding pair than a female that had been guarded, but was not guarded at the time the water was collected. Again, it is a little difficult to interpret, because there are three treatments, the text is a bit ambiguous as two which treatments differ from the others.The final experiment shows that when fighting breaks out between males, the biggest males tend to win, and take over the ‚Äúguarding‚Äù position of the female. No surprise there, as body size is almost always the major factor determining fight outcomes in crustaceans.That there are so many short experiments makes me a little annoyed that the standard journal practice of separating methods and results means that there is much flipping back and forth between the two. It would be much more readable if each experiment was discussed in total, in on part of the text.This is a very interesting social system where it seems that the females are both powerless and powerful. They are powerless in the literal sense that they cannot resist being guarded by males. But they are powerful in the sense that they encourage and exploit male aggression, presumably in an attempt to ensure they are guarded by the highest quality males.ReferenceOkamura, S., &amp;amp; Goshima, S.

(The Amazon link is &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/50-Voices-Disbelief-Why-Atheists/dp/1405190469"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a very good book, and I recommend it for all of us godless ones ‚Äî or those who are considering abjuring the divine.¬† I even contributed a cover blurb, ‚ÄúThere are many ways to lose one‚Äôs faith, but all are enlightening, for a voice of disbelief is a voice of reason.¬† Blackford and Sch√ºkklenk have collected 50 stories that not only present the many arguments for atheism but also show that, contrary to popular belief, atheists are just as moral and humane ‚Äî if not more so ‚Äìthan the faithful.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blurb highlights one of the book‚Äôs great virtues: it‚Äôs far more than just a collection of stories about ‚ÄúHow I came to give up God.‚Äù Many of the writers describe the philosophical and empirical considerations that led them to atheism. Indeed, the book can be considered a kind of philosophical handbook for atheists.¬† And here are some of the people who contributed: Blackford and Sch√ºklenk themselves, Ophelia Benson, Michael Shermer, James Randi, Sean Carroll (the physics one), Victor Stenger, Anthony Grayling, Susan Blackmore, Peter Singer and Marc Hauser (one chapter), and Laura Purdy.¬† There is a lot of meat here, so buy the book!&lt;/p&gt;

was the "canid play bow". This   piece of doggie-language, exemplified in the photo on the right, is "a highly ritualized and stereotyped movement that seems to function to stimulate recipients to engage (or to continue to engage) in social play."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000353.html"&gt;mentioned it in a LL post&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, quoting from Marc Bekoff and Colin Allen, "&lt;a href="http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000156/00/199709001.html"&gt;Intentional     Communication and Social Play: How and Why Animals Negotiate and Agree to Play&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;From the intentional stance, if &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; believes that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; believes that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; desires       to play (third-order) it would seem that ideal rationality would also require       that&lt;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; believes that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has a belief (second-order). But from a Millikanian perspective this more       general second-order belief, if it requires &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to       have a general belief detector, may actually be more sophisticated than the       third-order belief which supposedly entails it. A general belief detector       may be much more difficult to evolve than a specific belief detector, for       the detection of specific beliefs may be accomplished by the detection of       correspondingly specific cues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;If this is correct, then on Millikan's account Jethro (Marc's dog) may be       capable of the third-order belief that (or, at least, a state with the intentional       content that) Sukie (Jethro's favorite canid play pal) wants Jethro to believe       that her bite was playful not aggressive, even though Jethro is perhaps limited       in his ability to represent and hence think about Sukie's second-order desires       in general.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And according to Marc Bekoff, "&lt;a href="http://cogprints.org/158/0/199709003.html"&gt;Play signals as punctuation: The structure of social play in canids&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Behaviour&lt;/em&gt; 132:419-429, 1995,  the sequence patterns of bows with other actions, observed in a study of young wolves, coyotes, and domestic dogs, suggests that for canids in general,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;signals such as the bow can reinforce ongoing social play when it is possible that it could be disrupted due to the aggressive, predatory, or sexual behavior of one of the interacting animals. [‚Ä¶] Play in canids (and in other animals) requires a mutual sharing of the play mood by the participants. This sharing can be facilitated by the performance of bows immediately before or immediately after an individual performs actions that can be misinterpreted [‚Ä¶]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'm adding "sharing of the play mood" to the list of inadequately investigated phenomena headed by "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003838.html"&gt;group glee&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;‚Ä¶ ¬†Why, amid all the thousands of flowers in the gardens of academia, are there no departments of Play Mood Studies?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bekoff concludes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In addition to sending the message &amp;quot;I want to play&amp;quot; when they are performed at the beginning of play, bows performed in a different context, namely during social play, might also carry the message &amp;quot;I want to play despite what I am going to do or just did ‚Äî I still want to play&amp;quot; when there might be a problem in the sharing of this information between the interacting animals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bekoff speculates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;How might information between sender and recipient be shared? It is possible that the recipient shares the intentions (beliefs, desires) of the sender based on the recipient's own prior experiences of situations in which she performed bows. In an important paper on human behavior that has yet to find its way into comparative ethological circles, Gopnik (1993, p. 275) has argued that " . . . certain kinds of information that comes, literally, from inside ourselves is coded in the same way as information that comes observing the behavior of others. There is a fundamental cross-modal representational system that connects self and other." Gopnik claims that others' body movements are mapped onto one's own kinesthetic sensations, based on prior experience of the observer, and she supports her claims with discussions of imitation in human newborns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The reference is to A Gopnik, "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/ccog.1993.1024"&gt;Psychopsychology&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Consciousness and Cognition&lt;/em&gt; 2(4): 264-280, 1993.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this background, I was interested and slightly puzzled to read this blog post by a dog trainer, Kelley Filson, "&lt;a href="http://blogs.dogtime.com/go-dog-training/2009/07/the-play-bow"&gt;The Play-Bow: Not Just A Cute Trick&lt;/a&gt;", 7/14/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Many of my clients dogs have a hard time playing with and interacting with other dogs.  These dogs often play well with well-known, "buddy-dogs" and demonstrates good play-skills in comfortable situations, but do poorly with new dogs or in new places. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;With work the dog can learn to meet and greet the novel dogs without being inappropriate, but there is often no play.  In these cases the dog-in-training often starts getting jumped by the other dogs (in a not so friendly way).  This happens after the Meet-&amp;amp;-Greet, because the dog-in-training sniffs a hello and then just stands there stiffly.  This is awkward and invites aggressiion - a sort of preemptive strike against the dog who is standing stiffly and giving everyone the willies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In these cases teaching a PLAY-BOW can bridge the gap between meeting and becoming friends.  It gives the dog-in-training something to do (besides standing awkwardly).  Furthermore, despite its trained-awkwardness it gives the other dogs something to do too - they can respond with more playfulness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Teaching a PLAY-BOW"? Why do some dogs need to be trained to produce this instinctual signal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most likely explanation, I guess, is that they know how to perform it, but not when to perform it. In particular, initiating or maintaining play with unfamiliar adults is perhaps not a natural reaction, except for animals in whom the behavioral effects of neoteny are especially strong.¬† Or maybe animals that are mostly "only dogs", raised without much conspecific company, are inadequately drilled in the &lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;"fundamental cross-modal representational system that connects self and other"?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, dogs are not the only ones who &lt;a href="http://www.counselingcoach.com/social-skills.htm"&gt;sometimes need help with this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;.¬† Unfortunately, not all forms of communicative training are equally effective: see, for example,¬† M.E. Herron et al., "&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2008.12.011"&gt;Survey of the use and outcome of confrontational and non-confrontational training methods in client-owned dogs showing undesired behaviors&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Applied Animal Behaviour Science&lt;/em&gt;, 117:47-54, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256561743207"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4762827614191702843.post-6036343131748890520">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/68f4f9b9d10ee4d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="British Chiropractic Association" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Alun Salt" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Ancient History" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The BCA and Ancient History</title><published>2009-10-26T11:55:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T11:55:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/10/bca-and-ancient-history.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="html">Just a quick link to this excellent &lt;a href="http://alunsalt.com/2009/10/13/the-extraordinary-research-of-the-bca/"&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; by Alun Salt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those followers of this Blog who enjoy reading about the British Chiropractic Association's misconceived libel case and their ongoing hapless press releases, Dr Salt's amusing examination of their claims as to the history of spinal manipulation will be a joy.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-6036343131748890520?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256560154729"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=5989">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/54a5a3607c27f4a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Hollywood director deep-sixes Scientology</title><published>2009-10-26T12:18:40Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T12:18:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/26/hollywood-director-deep-sixes-scientology/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported by &lt;a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/10/crash_director.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,¬† famous Hollywood director Paul Haggis (&lt;em&gt;Crash, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of our Fathers&lt;/em&gt;) has renounced a 35-year commitment to Scientology.¬† In a scathing ‚Äî and long ‚Äî letter written to the national spokesperson for Scientology (the letter appears in the &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt; article), Haggis faults the organization for supporting Prop. 8, the anti-gay-marriage bill in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you know, for ten months now I have been writing to ask you to make a public statement denouncing the actions of the Church of Scientology of San Diego. Their public sponsorship of Proposition 8, a hate-filled legislation that succeeded in taking away the civil rights of gay and lesbian citizens of California ‚Äì rights that were granted them by the Supreme Court of our state ‚Äì shames us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called and wrote and implored you, as the official spokesman of the church, to condemn their actions. I told you I could not, in good conscience, be a member of an organization where gay-bashing was tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that first conversation, back at the end of October of last year, you told me you were horrified, that you would get to the bottom of it and ‚Äúheads would roll.‚Äù You promised action. Ten months passed. No action was forthcoming. The best you offered was a weak and carefully worded press release, which praised the church‚Äôs human rights record and took no responsibility. Even that, you decided not to publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church‚Äôs refusal to denounce the actions of these bigots, hypocrites and homophobes is cowardly. I can think of no other word. Silence is consent, Tommy. I refuse to consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other accusations of Church malfeasance as well. These won‚Äôt surprise anyone who‚Äôs followed the history of Scientology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And though it may seem small by comparison, I was truly disturbed to see you provide private details from confessionals to the press in an attempt to embarrass and discredit the executives who spoke out. A priest would go to jail before revealing secrets from the confessional, no matter what the cost to himself or his church. That‚Äôs the kind of integrity I thought we had, but obviously the standard in this church is far lower ‚Äì the public relations representative can reveal secrets to the press if the management feels justified. You even felt free to publish secrets from the confessional in Freedom Magazine ‚Äì you just stopped short of labeling them as such, probably because you knew Scientologists would be horrified, knowing you so easily broke a sacred vow of trust with your parishioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How dare you use private information in order to label someone an ‚Äúadulteress?‚Äù You took Amy Scobee‚Äôs most intimate admissions about her sexual life and passed them onto the press and then smeared them all over the pages your newsletter! I do not know the woman, but no matter what she said or did, this is the woman who joined the Sea Org at 16! She ran the entire celebrity center network, and was a loyal senior executive of the church for what, 20 years? You want to rebut her accusations, do it, and do it in the strongest terms possible ‚Äì but that kind of character assassination is unconscionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only question is &lt;em&gt;why did it take him so long&lt;/em&gt;?¬† Although you may not consider Scientology a religion, it is classified as one by the government, and has all the trappings of a faith: a &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/28/which-theology-should-we-respect/"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt;, supernatural beings, and the like. But if you read about the organization (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; its own puffery), you‚Äôll find that it doesn‚Äôt seem much of a force for good, although, like many conventional faiths, it does manage to squeeze a lot of bucks out of its adherents.¬† Do those who say we shouldn‚Äôt criticize religions include Scientology among them? After all, we can‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that Xenu doesn‚Äôt exist!&lt;/p&gt;

This is an interesting study, and does for the first time show a  neurophysiological correlate to reported placebo decreases in pain reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, reporting of the study highlights, yet again, widespread misconceptions about the nature of placebo effects ‚Äì specifically that there are many placebo effects, not one placebo effect. Any reference to ‚Äúthe‚Äù placebo effect is therefore misleading ‚Äì it is a convenient short hand, but unfortunate given prevailing misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most people mean when they say ‚Äúthe‚Äù placebo effect is a real physiological effect that derives from belief in the effects of a treatment ‚Äì a mind-over-matter effect. However, the placebo effect, as it is measured in clinical trials, has a very specific operational definition. It is any and all measured effects other than a physiological response to the treatment itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This includes any physiological responses to belief in the treatment, but also a host of psychological factors such as reporting bias, confirmation bias, risk justification, and assessment bias. It also includes non-specific effects of being in a clinical trial ‚Äì people treat themselves better when they are being observed, when they are being reminded of their illness because of frequent attention, and when they are encouraged by the hope of benefit. Such things actually affect compliance with other treatments and healthy lifestyles ‚Äì in other words, people will be more compliant with other medications they may be on, and may eat better and exercise more, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These variables and others are the reason for double-blinding experiments. Without doubling blinding, these placebo effects will be mixed in with the physiological effects of the treatment, if any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also ‚Äì many people incorrectly conclude that ‚Äúthe‚Äù placebo effect cannot exist in small children or animals, but this is profoundly incorrect. Placebo effects result from observer bias as well ‚Äì from whoever is interpreting the effects of the treatment on an animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must also be pointed out that measured placebo effects differ greatly depending on the disease and the outcome being studies. The greatest effect is for pain, typically from 25-35%. This makes sense in that pain is a subjective experience and subject to a host of modifying factors, such as mood and expectation. But also, it has been known for a long time that there exists in the body natural opioids called endorphins that bind to receptors and inhibit pain, the same way the most powerful pain killers do. Therefore there is a known physiological mechanism by which mental effects could inhibit pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area where there is a strong placebo effect is any disease that is worsened from psychological stress, such as the risk of heart attacks. Any intervention, or just the act of being treated, that might reduce stress therefore has a known physiological mechanism by which disease can be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for other diseases, where there isn‚Äôt a known physiological mechanism, measured placebo effects are much smaller. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this is cancer survival.  Here we have an aggressive disease and a very definitive outcome ‚Äì death or survival. It turns out there is practically no placebo effect when it comes to cancer survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the real problem with conflating all placebo effects as if they were one giant mind-over-matter effect ‚Äì people think because there is a large and provable placebo effect for pain, there is therefore a large and provable placebo effect for everything, and that this is evidence for some mystical mental effect over the body (in the absence of known physiological mechanisms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the current study. What the researchers did was look at an experimental model of pain ‚Äì heat applied to the skin. They then compared an analgesic cream to a placebo cream, and subjects reported about 26% less pain even with the placebo cream (right in the middle of the typical placebo response to pain). This is nothing new, but they also looked at the spinal cords of the subjects and found that the placebo pain responders had a decrease in the signal in the pain pathways similar to the response to the actual painkiller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press is making it seem as if ‚Äúthe‚Äù placebo effect is finally proven ‚Äì typically missing all of the nuance of this issue. However, while interesting, this study does not really add much new to our understanding. We already knew about the placebo effect for pain, and the prevailing hypothesis is that it was due to endorphins, and therefore we would expect an actual decrease in pain signals in the spinal cord. This study confirms it ‚Äì but doesn‚Äôt change our thinking about it. Also, the study did not in any way investigate the mechanism of the decrease. We assume it is from endorphins, but that‚Äôs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to knock this study in any way ‚Äì just reporting about it. It is a nice proof of concept, and opens the way to further studies to look at which brain areas are involved in placebo effects for pain. It would also be interesting to see if there is any difference in brain activity between placebo responders and non-responders. This may even lead to ways in the future of optimizing pain placebo effects, or triggering them non-pharmacologically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to make these distinctions regarding the placebo effect because it is so widely misunderstood and this confusion is exploited to support all sorts of unscientific and even harmful medical modalities and interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256559022097"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1130">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b04644c37a02fa2c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="placebo effect"/><title type="html">‚ÄúThe‚Äù Placebo Effect Proven?</title><published>2009-10-26T12:06:40Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T12:06:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1130" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A recent study, as reported in &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17993-placebo-effect-caught-in-the-act-in-spinal-nerves.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;amp;nsref=online-news"&gt;the New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, purports to catch the placebo effect in the act using functional MRI scanning.

&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to make these distinctions regarding the placebo effect because it is so widely misunderstood and this confusion is exploited to support all sorts of unscientific and even harmful medical modalities and interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256558905799"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/the_public_option_omg_holy_cra.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e323052e20475ec2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Heatlh Care"/><title type="html">The Public Option ...

Scalp EEG showing sharp wave activity from left anterior temporal region.In the last post we learned a bit about hypergraphia, a compulsion to write that sometimes occurs in those with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). According to the late behavioral neurologist Norman Geschwind (reprinted in 2009; also see Devinsky &amp;amp; Schachter, 2009), hypergraphia is one in a cluster of interictal [between seizure]  personality traits in some TLE patients1 which can also include religiosity, hypermorality, aggressiveness, clinginess, increased emotionality, and sexual changes (mostly hyposexuality but also other alterations):Hyposexuality is the most common, but other kinds of sexual changes do occur. ... In England, Davies and Morgenstern went out and found, among the temporal lobe epileptics, several other patients who were transvestites. ... I‚Äôm sure that the great majority of transvestites don‚Äôt have temporal lobe epilepsy, but it‚Äôs interesting that for whatever reason it can cause this. Although I‚Äôve seen many women with temporal lobe epilepsy, someone called to my attention a phenomenon that I hadn‚Äôt observed before. The last four women I have seen have all been bisexual, which again is a rather striking finding.Sexual behavior preceding (auras) or during (automatisms) seizures is another story. The EEG traces in Fig. 1 above are from an epilepsy patient who experienced &amp;quot;sexual seizures&amp;quot; during which she engaged in somewhat purposeless &amp;quot;pseudointercourse&amp;quot; behavior, with no memory for the event afterward. Although the general consensus is that sexual automatisms are usually associated with seizure foci in the temporal lobes (Mascia et al., 2005), an influential earlier paper insisted the origin of &amp;quot;sexual seizures&amp;quot; was in the frontal lobes (Spencer et al., 1983).Changes in sexuality can also occur after strokes or due to brain tumors. Neurophilosopher Patricia Churchland drew attention to one of these case reports in a New Scientist article on free will and criminal responsibility:In 2003, the Archives of Neurology carried a startling clinical report [Burns &amp;amp; Swerdlow, 2003].  A middle-aged Virginian man with no history of any misdemeanour began to stash child pornography and sexually molest his 8-year-old stepdaughter. Placed in the court system, his sexual behaviour became increasingly compulsive. Eventually, after repeatedly complaining of headaches and vertigo, he was sent for a brain scan. It showed a large but benign tumour in the frontal area of his brain, invading the septum and hypothalmus - regions known to regulate sexual behaviour.After removal of the tumour, his sexual interests returned to normal. Months later, his sexual focus on young girls rekindled, and a new scan revealed that bits of tissue missed in the surgery had grown into a sizeable tumour. Surgery once again restored his behavioural profile to &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;.Figure 1 (Burns &amp;amp; Swerdlow, 2003). MRI scans at the time of initial neurologic evaluation: T1 sagittal (A), contrast-enhanced coronal (B), and contrast-enhanced axial (C) views. In A and B, the tumor mass extends superiorly from the olfactory groove, displacing the right orbitofrontal cortex and distorting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.This case raises the issues of diminished capacity and criminal responsibility. The man knew what he was doing was wrong -- intact capacity and moral knowledge -- but he could not inhibit his inappropriate sexual behavior. It&amp;#39;s hard to argue against the finding of diminished responsibility when staring at a gigantic brain tumor. But many other examples of impulsive sexual offenses (Langevin, 2006) aren&amp;#39;t nearly as obvious (e.g. after head injuries when the damage might not be visible on an MRI scan). How does society deal with them?A key factor is a change in behavior...Multidirectional disorders of sexual drive in a case of brain tumourThe next report is from Poland (Lesniak et al., 1972 -- before the days of MRI or even CT scans). This case history is even more disturbing and involves greater criminal offenses than the patient of Burns and Swerdlow (2003).A description and analysis of various disorders of sexual impulse are presented. They occurred gradually between the ages of 56 and 60 years in a man previously in good health. The disorders were as follows: harlotry, incestuous intercourse with his under-age daughter [used physical violence and threatened to kill her if she told], sodomy, hetero- and homosexual pedophilia, masochism [he demanded that his wife beat him with a club] with some symptoms of sadism, coprolalia and exhibitionism. [Also bestiality with cows and calves.] Pedophilia and exhibitionism [he fancied wearing a red ribbon around his exposed penis] were the counts of the man‚Äôs indictment. After twice-repeated forensic and psychiatric examination and observation, sexual psychopathy and male climacteric were also recognized; and the defendant was acknowledged to be responsible. In the course of further examination, the psychoorganic syndrome with symptoms of moria was recognized clinically. Further specialist examinations, especially by X-ray (pneumoencephalography) showed the presence of neoplasm (probably benign glioma or meningioma) situated at the basal paracentral part of the right forehead lobe [right orbitofrontal cortex again]. Its presence being acknowledged, the defendant was found irresponsible; due precautions and eventual neurosurgical treatment were proposed. It has been stressed that the appearance of the above disorders, especially in view of the age of the subject, must lead one to suspect an organic origin.During the trial (reminiscent of the proceedings against serial child killer and cannibal Albert Fish), expert witnesses for the prosecution found nothing organically wrong, and declared the defendant ‚Äúat the moment of committing the criminal acts he was charged with, had retained the ability to recognize the significance of these acts, whereas his ability to control his acts had been slightly restricted‚Äù. The defendant was found guilty, the defense appealed and a retrial was granted. He was placed under observation for 2 months at the Psychiatric Clinic in Cracow, when the authors became involved in his case:The neurological examination revealed a considerable bilateral impairment of smell [a tell-tale sign of bilateral orbitofrontal damage] and a marked inequality of the reflexes of...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs the same excuse used by &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/01/06/matthew-laclairs-speech-you-belong-in-hell/"&gt;evangelical teachers&lt;/a&gt; in public schools who feel the need to preach in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither person deserves to keep their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trevor Keezer&lt;/strong&gt; is whining because he wore a button reading ‚ÄúOne nation under God, indivisible‚Äù on his Home Depot work uniform.  For a year, barely anyone noticed.  (Which, for the record, doesn‚Äôt mean it was ok.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then, last month, when he started bringing his Bible to work, Keezer says his manager confronted him about the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I was told it had to come off, or I would be sent home. So they sent me home for six straight days without pay. And then today they terminated me,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Fishel, a spokesman for The Home Depot, said he could not comment on specific personnel issues, but added, ‚ÄúThe company‚Äôs dress code policy states that we do not allow noncompany buttons, regardless of their message or content.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs nothing controversial here.  There‚Äôs a dress code.  It‚Äôs not anti-Christian.  Keezer didn‚Äôt follow it.  They asked him to remove his piece of flair.  He didn‚Äôt.  He lost his job and he deserved to lose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure if he brought the Bible to read during his break time (completely fine) or to keep at his register (not fine), but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be relevant here.  The issue is his refusal to remove his button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Keezer said he preferred to wear his button because ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt have country without God. Every pin they showed me had no ‚ÄòGod‚Äô on it or anything.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ Keezer says, ‚ÄúIt never crossed my mind to take off the button because I‚Äôm standing for something that‚Äôs bigger than I am. &lt;strong&gt;They kept telling me the severity of what you‚Äôre doing&lt;/strong&gt; and I just let God be in control and went with His plan.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI want to be a voice for the rest of the Christians and for the citizens of this country to stand up for the country. You know, quit being told to sit down. Say what you want to say and don‚Äôt be afraid of the consequences,‚Äù he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management told him he would be fired.  He didn‚Äôt care.  If he wants to make a martyr of himself, so be it.  I‚Äôm sure there are private, Christian-owned businesses in which he‚Äôd be a great fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Home Depot did the right thing by getting rid of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you disagree, imagine if another worker wore a button reading, simply, ‚ÄúAtheist.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, even more provocative, ‚ÄúOne nation, under no god.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses have dress codes for a reason.  &lt;a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/oct/23/home-depot-worker-wears-under-god-button-more/"&gt;These commenters&lt;/a&gt; don‚Äôt seem to understand that.&lt;/p&gt;

Defensively speaking, Moir&amp;#39;s choice of words was astute. In judging moral responsibility, we adults focus almost exclusively on intention rather than outcome. Stated starkly, the person who deliberately attempts to kill an innocent, but fails, is judged as more evil than the person who accidentally kills an innocent. Now researchers have taken a taken a fresh look at how these moral processes develop in children. Classic studies by Piaget and others claimed to show that, in contrast to adults, young children focus on outcomes, not intentions. However, in their new work, Gavin Nobes and colleagues argue that children do focus on intentions, and that Piaget and others failed to take account of the influence of perceived negligence - that is, unintended actions that really ought to have been foreseen.Dozens of children aged between three and eight years, as well as adults, were presented with short, illustrated stories in which intentions and outcomes were systematically varied, being either positive or negative. To give you an idea, the stories involved bicycle crashes, dropped cups, and games of catch. Crucially, half the participants were told that the key protagonist had taken great care, whereas the other half were told that he or she had been careless - for example, stacking cups in one hand and not paying attention.When judging the acceptability of a protagonist&amp;#39;s actions and the punishment they deserved, both children and adults were principally influenced by the person&amp;#39;s intention. Intentions to commit bad actions were judged harshly regardless of the outcome. This contradicts Piaget&amp;#39;s classic work, which claimed to show that children focus on outcomes.Nobes team think the reason for the conflicting results has to do with negligence. They found that children tended to interpret bad outcomes as betraying negligence even when they&amp;#39;d been told that a person had been careful. It&amp;#39;s as if young children haven&amp;#39;t yet fully grasped that accidents can happen even when a person has been careful (the researchers point out this is an issue of the children&amp;#39;s practical, not moral, understanding). Therefore, when a bad outcome was combined with what they assumed was perceived negligence, the children tended to judge a person harshly, just as adults do when they think a person has failed to take due care. In Piaget&amp;#39;s and other earlier work there was no measure of negligence so such patterns would have just appeared as though the children were focusing on outcomes and ignoring intentions. &amp;quot;The findings indicate that the moral judgements of young children are influenced neither principally by outcome (as Piaget claimed) nor only by outcome and intention (as many subsequent researchers have assumed),&amp;quot; Nobes team concluded. &amp;quot;The intention-outcome dichotomy should be expanded at least to the intention-negligence-outcome trichotomy.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Children demonstrate surprisingly sophisticated and differentiated moral reasoning,&amp;quot; they added._________________________________Nobes G, Panagiotaki G, &amp;amp; Pawson C (2009).

Regular readers of this blog probably realize that I tend to live and die as a blogger by the maxim that if some is good more must be better. So I clobbered the topic with three posts in rapid succession. Now that that's out of the way, I can address topics that readers have been &lt;strike&gt;bugging me about&lt;/strike&gt; sending to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At or near the top of the list has to be a biased and poorly framed article that appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; this month. I tell ya, I've been a subscriber to &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; for at least 25 years, and for the first time ever I'm seriously tempted to let my subscription lapse when it expires early next year. In the 25 years I've been a subscriber, I've never seen such a credulous, irresponsible piece of "journalism" appear in &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm referring to the recent article by Shannon Brownlee and Jeanne Lenzer entitled &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200911/brownlee-h1n1"&gt;Does the Vaccine Matter?&lt;/a&gt; The article takes doubts about the efficacy of the seasonal flu vaccine, conflates them with an entirely different situation, namely the pandemic of H1N1 (a.k.a. "swine") flu that we are currently experiencing, mixes them with the cliched trope of the brave maverick doctor and scientist bucking the status quo and being reviled for it, and serves a steaming, stinking mess of confusion that puts the worst possible spin on the evidence. It's a perfect storm of obfuscation. Indeed, I can picture the pitch for the story to the editors of &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. "Conventional wisdom" found to be overoptimistic? Check. Brave maverick doctor fighting a lonely battle against scientific and medical dogma? Check. Scientific dogma overturned and a major public health strategy shown to be useless? Check. Well, not exactly. Only seemingly so as framed in the article. My guess, though, is that that last part of the pitch was indeed pitched that way, with the tagline, which I quote directly from the article:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/when_methodolatry_strikes_over_h1n1_influenza.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/when_methodolatry_strikes_over_h1n1_influenza.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/X39iYyuBuXg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256550260771"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/clock_quotes_456.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53ae2a9b20340aee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-10-26T08:53:51Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T08:53:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/K0T8sT1BMsE/clock_quotes_456.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/clock_quotes_456.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes only one person is absent and the whole world seems depopulated. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c7/c7s5.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, ‚Äúscience fiction is useful both for stimulating the imagination and for diffusing fear of the future.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the series is ongoing! Today I got an email from a fellow researcher for skeptical interviews and rather than end up writing my usual ‚Äònovel-length‚Äô response to a fantastic topic, I thought I‚Äôd blog it and get it out of the way. Besides, the response might help me organise my thoughts about the other research I‚Äôm doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their question was a two-parter and I have a few more recommendations for them at the end of this post, relating to other elements of reading and skepticism, which you might like to check out too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the consensus on the intersection of science fiction and skepticism/science? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What‚Äôs the research on the impact of science fiction films and biotechology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚Äú&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(N.B - fiction and its contribution to science understandings in general is something I‚Äôve touched upon in many previous posts on this site - &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/04/science-in-literature-meeting-of-much-needed-minds/"&gt;Science In Literature&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=218"&gt;The Specialness Of Species&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;a title="Permanent Link: Nothing In the ‚ÄòVerse Can Stop Me" rel="bookmark" href="http://podblack.com/?p=282"&gt;Nothing In the ‚ÄòVerse Can Stop Me&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=183"&gt;A Girl Called Ellie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and my all-time fave title - and &lt;a href="http://blog.nauka.bg/rss/?p=1342"&gt;blog anthology&lt;/a&gt; entry winner - &lt;a title="Permanent Link to Smart Bitches, Not Meerly Sex" rel="bookmark" href="http://podblack.com/2008/01/smart-bitches-not-meerly-sex/"&gt;Smart Bitches, Not Meerly Sex.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, here‚Äôs a government report on the influence of science fiction on science and technology education levels and attentiveness. From the USA‚Äôs Science and Engineering Indicators of 2002 - &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c7/c7s5.htm"&gt;Science Fiction and Pseudoscience:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thirty percent of those participating in the 2001 NSF survey said that they read science fiction books or magazines. (See &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/append/c7/at07-51.xls"&gt;appendix table 7-51&lt;/a&gt;.) The positive relationships that exist between reading science fiction and level of education, number of math and science courses completed, and attentiveness to science and technology are interesting, yet predictable. However, another finding is contrary to conventional wisdom. That is, there does not seem to be a gender gap: nearly equal percentages of men (31 percent) and women (28 percent) report that they read science fiction books or magazines. (See &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/append/c7/at07-51.xls"&gt;appendix table 7-51&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are 2006 indicators - I‚Äôll refer to them for the next question, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus about science fiction and skepticism/science, in my opinion, is that it also depends on the diverse experiences of the person in question (level of education, socio-economic standing, isolation, so forth) and whether you are getting scaffolding, support, opportunities to question and ongoing interaction - NOT just ‚Äòcommunication of an idea‚Äô through one lecture, text, what-have-you. To paraphrase Dr Ben Goldacre (on another topic, mind) -&lt;em&gt; ‚Äòit‚Äôs more complicated than that‚Ä¶‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a difference between interfering and supporting through provision of resources, role-modelling, opportunities for discussion and so forth. Yes, people (and children, of course) will greatly differ in their levels of ability - we all learn differently, for a start and will tend towards certain ways of picking ideas up. Therefore, the opportunity for a range of experiences, which will reflect the diversity of the audience, is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of an interview I did with &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/02/science-communication-and-education-michael-mcrae/"&gt;Mike McRae, science communicator&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competitions and resources such as worksheets, videos and books are fantastic, however if they don‚Äôt work with a [science] curriculum or have small pedagogical value due to the way they are constructed or implemented, then there is little hope a teacher will make use of them. In Australia especially, there has been a trend to create more consistent national frameworks across states when it comes to curricula. For any group interested in the education of youth in this country it is essential that they have some grasp of the cultural dynamics at work regarding this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:left" src="http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/2391/image0045t.jpg" alt="" width="174" height="232"&gt;For example, the very &lt;em&gt;worse &lt;/em&gt;advice I‚Äôve seen given in regards to ‚Äòtechniques that will encourage skepticism and or scientific literacy in children‚Äô was ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;do nothing&lt;/em&gt;‚Äú.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other extreme, I should point out one teacher‚Äôs concern that to pick-apart the science in science fiction movies might lead to viewers being &lt;a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-13805111_ITM"&gt;overly skeptical about any beneficial content in science fiction films&lt;/a&gt; at all and the &lt;a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-160813569/using-science-fiction-movie.html"&gt;importance of selecting your films well!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you don‚Äôt have to listen to just my view on that - because this kind of question (on my side of the planet!) led me to interview the likes of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=512182"&gt;Professor Leonie Rennie&lt;/a&gt; (episode #42 of the Skeptic Zone podcast)&lt;/strong&gt; in order to get some views regarding the influence of entertainment-based activities (museums, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/12/05/the-search-for-the-great-science-fiction-movie-or-i-am-doooomed/"&gt;science movie festivals&lt;/a&gt;, teaching of science via traditional and non-traditional means) on the understanding of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also shouldn‚Äôt forget that it‚Äôs not JUST science concepts that are being taught through science fiction. Ethics, diplomacy, history, conflict resolution - I am reminded of Star Trek: Next Generation, with its exploration of cultural relativism, duty vs motive, a great many philosophical concepts that were even drawn upon for a high-school course in my state. There‚Äôs quite a few science bloggers, from the Bad Astronomer to this &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2008/11/scientists_science_fiction_and.php"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A on Neurotopia over on Science Blogs (&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2008/11/scientists_science_fiction_and.php"&gt;‚ÄòScientists, Science Fiction, and the people who love them both‚Äô)&lt;/a&gt;, who talk about the love they have for science fiction and what it meant for them as scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions like ANU‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://cpas.anu.edu.au/"&gt;Center for the Public Awareness of Science&lt;/a&gt; exist, in order to investigate the intersection of science and societal interpretation of it. You‚Äôll find people have written dissertations on topics that look at the intersection of ‚Äòfiction‚Äô and science literacy, scientific understandings, enthusiasm towards science, and so forth. Some examples of their research include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://cpas.anu.edu.au/researchprojects/doctor_who"&gt;What work does ‚ÄòDoctor Who‚Äô do to promote the democratisation of science?&lt;/a&gt; Lindy Orthia is researching how the relationships between scientist and non-scientist characters are represented in the BBC television series Doctor Who.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest in this topic has historical precedence - &lt;a href="http://sffrd.library.tamu.edu/browse/63507/"&gt;A Study of the Effect of Science Fiction on Science Attitude of High School Science Students - &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://sffrd.library.tamu.edu/search/author/20315/"&gt;Leroy &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://sffrd.library.tamu.edu/search/author/20315/"&gt;Lindquist, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://sffrd.library.tamu.edu/browse/63507/"&gt; 1977&lt;/a&gt; and more recently, Freudenrich (2000) discussed how science fiction novels, TV programs and films were used in his physics classes. Brake and Thornton (2003) created a science and science fiction degree course at a Welsh university as ‚Äòa way of examining the relationship between science, technology and society‚Äô (p.37). Critics suggest that for the sake of drama, fact and fiction become blurred in such programs and it‚Äôs not made clear which is which (McKie, 2001). There may be missed opportunities to show how science deals with uncertainties (Rose, 2001), and yet analysing the science from the fiction in not only science but classes in other subjects (like English or studies of society), is a popular cross-curricular activity that should be supported (Allday, 2003).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this led to the interview with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/index.php?search_string=jennifer&amp;amp;Submit=Search&amp;amp;search=1"&gt;Jennifer Ouellette&lt;/a&gt; (episode #35 of the Skeptic Zone podcast)&lt;/strong&gt;, where you‚Äôll learn how the National Academy of Sciences has even &lt;a href="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/"&gt;dispatched emissaries to Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äúto help bring the reality of cutting-edge science to creative and engaging storylines‚Äù, which one imagines should include all those science fiction programs that get us all bothered when they completely screw up basic physics and play fast and loose with computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the likes of Richard Dawkins have started producing texts as well in response to what they see as a greater need for popular texts to investigate science accurately - I‚Äôve mentioned previously how &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/02/skeptical-books-for-children-part-two/"&gt;Stephen Hawkings has written a children‚Äôs book&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/oct/23/richard-dawkins-teenagers-illustrated-book"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The well-known scientist and atheist has struck a book deal for his first title for young adults, which will look to explode myths and legends about the natural world with science. Due out in autumn 2011, What is a Rainbow, Really? will take on topics including who the first man and first woman were, why there are seasons, what the sun is, how old the world is and why there are so many animals, first answering the questions with myth and legend, and then with ‚Äúlucid scientific explanations‚Äù.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmV_1kFCfVs"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmV_1kFCfVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that some of the comments for that video include grumbles about how &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúI thought it was totally absurd that he used the phrase ‚Äúbrought up to believe‚Äù concerning Harry Potter and mythical fantasy books. Religion is taught to children as being true. They are told this is how the world works. Harry Potter is taught as being entertainment. They are brought up to believe it is not true. No adverse effect. Kind of like how Dawkins advocates teaching the Bible in schools (as fiction) to? understand allusions in Western literature.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:left" src="http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/4266/image0036h.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="248"&gt;I guess my question is - is this going to be that much different to many of the other pro-science, non-fiction books out there? Just because Dawkins has written it? I‚Äôll reserve my comments until I‚Äôve actually read it, mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I‚Äôm still a little concerned about how few new books are coming to the attention of people interested in promoting critical thinking in general. Daniel Loxton alerted me to how &lt;a href="http://www.secular-homeschooling.com/008/books_for_critical_thinkers.html"&gt;Secular Homeschooling&lt;/a&gt; with ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Too Many Books Are Never Enough Books for Critical Thinkers&lt;/em&gt;‚Äú, has promoted the Junior Skeptic insert in Skeptic Magazine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúEach JS is a themed piece ‚Äî a thoughtful, informative, and deeply entertaining essay, broken up into bite-sized pieces for ease of reading but still a cohes&lt;span&gt;ive whole. The writing is age-appropriate without ever slipping into condescension. The authors assume, rightly, that simple and direct language is the best way to communicate with readers of any age.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the other books on their list hail from the 1990s‚Ä¶ which is a great pity. There‚Äôs many other &lt;img style="float:right" src="http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/7466/image0034w.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="270"&gt;recommendations that I‚Äôve made in the earlier blog entries in this series - a few new ones on the literature front, which particularly relate to teenage girls and have a pro-science bent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.penguin.com.au/lookinside/spotlight.cfm?SBN=9780702237256"&gt;‚ÄòLoving Richard Feynman‚Äô by Penny Tangey&lt;/a&gt; - I really enjoyed this! Australian book, some rather well-expressed mathematical concepts and a modern tale of a fifteen-year old finding the trials of her life can be supported by embracing her enthusiasm of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also suggest that you don‚Äôt judge a book by its ‚Äòblurb‚Äô - the novel &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vibes-Amy-Kathleen-Ryan/dp/0618995307"&gt;‚ÄòVibes‚Äô by Amy Kathleen Ryan&lt;/a&gt; has its main character thinking that she‚Äôs psychic‚Ä¶ however, her experiences then go onto demonstrate that her apparent ability may not be as paranormally-based as she thought!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs still plenty (as you can see from the pictures) of great new non-fiction general texts coming out - I recently won a copy of ‚Äò&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Science-Definitive-Visual-Adam-Hart-Davis/dp/1405322470/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1255357888&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Science: The Definitive Visual Guide&lt;/a&gt;‚Äò with many thanks to Science Punk; there‚Äôs also &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Book-Everything-Need-Century/dp/142620518X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1256548018&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;National Geographic‚Äôs The Knowledge Book&lt;/a&gt; that features in the first picture. All part of providing a range of stimuli, for what I see as a broader issue of general literacy for young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly‚Ä¶yes, there‚Äôs a secondly; this is only what I consider a rather brief investigation of the first part of what I was asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What‚Äôs the research on the impact of science fiction films and biotechology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public attitudes towards science related issues, in the 2006 Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding chapter, from the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c7/c7h.htm"&gt;US government Science and Engineering Indicators of 2006&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most Americans know little about genetically modified food and related issues. Although attitudes are divided, opposition to introducing genetically modified food into the U.S. food supply declined between 2001 and 2004. However, the vast majority of Americans       (and others) believe that genetically modified food should be labeled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opposition to medical research that uses stem cells from human embryos has declined. In 2004, 36% of those surveyed said they were opposed to this type of research, down from 51% in 2002.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most people have never heard of nanotechnology. Americans are somewhat concerned about the risks, but most believe the benefits will outweigh the risks. The biggest concern is loss of privacy from tiny new surveillance devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚Ä¶The Internet is the preferred source when people are seeking information about specific scientific issues. In 2004, 52% of National Science Foundation survey respondents named the Internet as the place they would go to learn more about a scientific issue such as global warming or biotechnology, up from 44% in 2001.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, I wrote about this in a blogpost called ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/02/silver-screen-science-slip-ups/"&gt;Silver Screen Science Slip-Ups&lt;/a&gt;‚Äú:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having taught GATTACA for several years, I was keen to attend a lecture held by &lt;a title="Biotechnology Australia" href="http://www.biotechnology.gov.au/index.cfm?event=object.showContent&amp;amp;objectID=0EEC9864-BF97-B4E4-B1E0F38EF54B7483"&gt;Biotechnology Australia&lt;/a&gt; last year, at the &lt;a title="WorldSTE 2007 held in Perth" href="http://www.worldste2007.asn.au/"&gt;Science and Technology Education World conference:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚Ä¶ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;how well are the science and social issues of cloning portrayed in box office hits such as The Island, Multiplicity, Star Wars: Attack of the Clones and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park? These movies have enormous reach and undoubted influence, and are therefore worth analyzing in some detail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This study looks at 33 movies made between 1971 and 2005 that address human reproductive cloning and it categorises the films based on their genre and potential influence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The movies were rated for scientific accuracy and their ‚Äúkey message‚Äù - whether the science or scientists are evil and the social implications of the cloning. Not surprisingly, they found that the most common message in the movies is that ‚Äúcorporations or scientists operate in their own interests and outside of regulation, and are willing to kill to cover up what they‚Äôve done.‚Äù Cloning is portrayed as unnatural, with the moral ‚Äúmess with nature and it will mess with you.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biotechnology Australia followed up with a second report, ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://www.biotechnology.gov.au/index.cfm?event=object.showContent&amp;amp;objectID=DE10D23C-0B36-FC64-9284A49B3DBD4BF7"&gt;Biotechnology at the Movies&lt;/a&gt;‚Äú, which looks at a wider range of movies, from &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Andromeda Strain&lt;/span&gt; (1971) to &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Children of Men&lt;/span&gt; (2006). If you‚Äôd like to &lt;a title="PFD report" href="http://www.biotechnology.gov.au/assets/documents/bainternet/cloning%5Fto%5Fthe%5Fmovies20060815090308%2Epdf"&gt;read the whole PDF&lt;/a&gt;, it‚Äôs really quite enjoyable to check out - &lt;a title="Biotechnology Australia" href="http://www.biotechnology.gov.au/index.cfm?event=object.showContent&amp;amp;objectID=B35A914C-DE3D-1A59-79F89FAA26F54E44"&gt;their conclusion?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThe study concluded that the science was, for the most part, seriously flawed, and that while the films may raise awareness, the quality of public debate on biotechnology is not generally enhanced by its depiction in films.‚Äù &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/02/silver-screen-science-slip-ups/"&gt;That particular blog-post&lt;/a&gt; also extends my answer to the first question, with more links on the influence of science fiction films on science understanding - including this discussion by Dr Brian Cox:&lt;/p&gt;

And what they&amp;#39;re learning is rather surprising: at least some early galaxies are almost as massive as otherwise similar galaxies in the present universe, yet they are much smaller in linear size, by a factor of five, thus much more compact.What time period are we talking about here? It&amp;#39;s not actually the time that the earliest galaxies formed, which was less than a billion years after the big bang. Instead, the time in question was around 3 billion years after the big bang. Although that&amp;#39;s roughly 10.7 billion years ago, many galaxies at that time were actually fairly mature, even old. This is because they had been around for more than 2 billion years, which is more than time enough for all their massive, hot, bright stars to have burned out long before. If these galaxies had depleted most of their star-forming material, not many new, hot, young stars could form. The rate of star formation might be as small as it is now in the Milky Way, only two to four solar masses worth per year, compared to thousands per year at the peak.Young stars include proportionately more massive stars, because it&amp;#39;s the massive ones that burn out quickly. Stars that are more than 2 billion years old have to be smaller. Smaller stars are also dimmer, cooler, and redder in color. (Recall the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram, which displays the relationship between luminosity and color.) Consequently, older galaxies that are no longer forming many new stars are also redder, and that&amp;#39;s how astronomers estimate roughly galaxy age, or at least the length of time since rapid star formation ceased.Certain events, such as collisions and mergers between galaxies can fire up rapid star formation again. So the correlation between color and age is not at all exact, but it&amp;#39;s still there.Another fact about galactic appearance is that the central part of any galaxy, even a spiral, is much brighter than the outer reaches, like the spiral arms (if any), simply because the central part of a galaxy contains most of the stars. So at the distances we&amp;#39;re concerned with here ‚Äì over 10 billion light-years ‚Äì all we can really observe with existing optical telescopes is the central part of a galaxy. To a first approximation, then, very distant galaxies look ellipsoidal in shape, even if they&amp;#39;re really spirals.For the time period we&amp;#39;re interested in, 3 billion years after the big bang, the redshift of light we see from objects at that time (denoted by z) is about 2.2. (See here for a fuller explanation.) The definition of redshift means that the wavelength of light emitted at z~2.2 is stretched by a factor of z+1~3.2. So visible light, with a wavelength of about 400 to 700 nanometers is shifted to 1.3 to 2.2 microns, in the near infrared. Although this kind of infrared light can be studied by ground-based spectroscopy, the best optical imagery has to be done from space-based instruments, which makes the job a lot harder.With all that as background, the newly published result we&amp;#39;re concerned with is really pretty simple. It has confirmed that a certain galaxy, named 1255-0, at z=2.186 is about a third as massive (~2√ó1011M‚äô) as the Milky Way and similar galaxies in our neighborhood at the present time, even though its central region is much smaller, with a radius of about 2500 light years. Consequently, stars in the central region of 1255-0 are packed much more closely together. This observation raises two distinct problems: First, most existing models of galaxy formation do not predict that typical galaxies of that age will be so compact. Second, no galaxies of that sort seem to exist in our general neighborhood, so at least some of them presumably evolved from galaxies like 1255-0 ‚Äì and it&amp;#39;s not clear how that could happen.Here&amp;#39;s the research abstract:A high stellar velocity dispersion for a compact massive galaxy at redshift z = 2.186Recent studies have found that the oldest and most luminous galaxies in the early Universe are surprisingly compact, having stellar masses similar to present-day elliptical galaxies but much smaller sizes. This finding has attracted considerable attention, as it suggests that massive galaxies have grown in size by a factor of about five over the past ten billion years (10 Gyr). A key test of these results is a determination of the stellar kinematics of one of the compact galaxies: if the sizes of these objects are as extreme as has been claimed, their stars are expected to have much higher velocities than those in present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we report a measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion of a massive compact galaxy at redshift z = 2.186, corresponding to a look-back time of 10.7 Gyr.Note that the research isn&amp;#39;t the first to identify very massive but compact galaxies at z~2. Rather, it&amp;#39;s new in that it has confirmed the estimate of mass by a new method, and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s significant.You see, there are basically two different ways, at present, to estimate the mass of a very distant galaxy. One method relies on a plausible assumption, that stars less than 2 billion years old, except for the very youngest, have fairly well-known distributions of mass and luminosity. And so, from the total luminosity of the galaxy that we can observe, we can form a good estimate of the total mass of stars. This is sometimes called the &amp;quot;photometric&amp;quot; mass. This sort of measurement is what has been used to infer that a number of galaxies at z~2 may have been very massive in spite of being small in extent. As suggested above, this observation raises at least two problems, so astronomers would like to measure mass in a different way, just to be sure. Besides, perhaps the assumptions about the mass and luminosity distributions of the stars in such galaxies could be wrong.Fortunately, there is another type of observation that can lead to good mass estimates, but it is much more difficult to make. This involves measuring the &amp;quot;dispersion&amp;quot; of velocities of stars in the galaxy. That is related to the distribution of stellar velocities. But since we can&amp;#39;t distinguish individual stars at that distance we certainly can&amp;#39;t measure their velocities (by very slight differences in stellar redshifts from the redshift of the galaxy as a whole).Even though the measurement is difficult to make in practice, it&amp;#39;s simple to describe. One simply looks at the width of a few absorption lines in the galaxy&amp;#39;s spectrum. If the lines are wide, it means that individual stars have substantially different velocities, including a certain proportion which are quite large. This is, basically, the meaning of &amp;quot;dispersion&amp;quot;.From the relative number stars with high velocities one can infer the total mass. This yields what is called the &amp;quot;dynamical&amp;quot; mass of the galaxy. What the present research found is simply that the dynamical mass of 1255-0 is pretty close to the known photometric mass.Why is it that lots of high-velocity stars indicates a substantial mass? Just fairly basic physics, based on two of Newton&amp;#39;s laws. (If you&amp;#39;re a physicist, you learned this a long time ago, so it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;obvious&amp;quot;.) The first is Newton&amp;#39;s law of gravitation, which is F=G√óM√óm/r2. This describes the gravitational force (F) between two objects having masses M and m separated by a distance r. G is a certain constant called, of course, the gravitational constant. This can be applied to a galaxy with mass M and one of its stars, with mass m, where r is the distance from the star to the center of mass of the galaxy.The other law is Newton&amp;#39;s second law of motion, which says F=ma. F is, again, the gravitational force of the galaxy, m is the mass of a particular star, and a is the acceleration of the star due to the force. (F and a are actually &amp;quot;vector&amp;quot; quantities, of couse, meaning they have a direction in 3-space.) You can think of the acceleration of an object as a way of measuring the force acting on it.Putting the two laws together, we find that for any particular star its accleration will satisfy a = G√óM/r2, so the star&amp;#39;s mass doesn&amp;#39;t matter at all, only the mass of the galaxy. Just as in our own galaxy, almost all stars are in orbit around the center of mass of the galaxy, so a star&amp;#39;s velocity, as seen from far away, varies periodically in a predictable way, deducible from acceleration (which is the rate of change of velocity).From calculations that are routine (at least for a physicist) one thus obtains a good estimate of the mass of a galaxy from the distribution of velocities of its stars, which in turn is deducible from the dispersion of spectral lines.There is one additional complication: matter in any form other than what makes up stars, most especially dark matter. But the present research shows that the mass as estimated photometrically (where any nonluminous...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a post about Markovian queueing theory. But hang on, don‚Äôt run away.¬† It isn‚Äôt so hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea came from my recent experience.¬† On Friday 23 October, I was supposed to have a kidney removed at the Royal Marsden Hospital.¬† At the very last minute the operation was cancelled.¬† That is more irritating than serious.¬† A delay of a few weeks poses no great risk for me.¬† .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/royal-marsden-vs.jpg" alt="Royal Marsden Hospital"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cancellation arose because there was no bed available in the High Dependency Unit (HDU), which is where nephrectomy patients go for a while after the operation.¬† Was this a failure of the NHS?¬† I think not and here‚Äôs why&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reaction of a neighbour to this news was to say &amp;quot;that‚Äôs why I have private insurance&amp;quot;.¬† Well, wrong actually. ¬† For a start, at the Marsden private patients and NHS patients get identical treatment (the only difference on the NHS is that &amp;quot;you don‚Äôt get hot and cold running margaritas at your bedside&amp;quot;, my surgeon said).¬† And secondly,¬† the provision of emergency beds poses a really difficult problem, which I‚Äôll attempt to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bed provision raises a fascinating statistical question.¬† How many beds must be available to make sure nobody is ever turned away?¬† The answer, in principle, is an infinite number.¬† In practice it is more than anyone can afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HDU has eleven beds but let‚Äôs think about a simpler case to start with.¬† If patients arrived regularly at a fixed rate, and each patient stayed for a fixed length of time. there would be no problem.¬† Say, for example, that a patient arrived regularly at 10 am and 4 pm each day, and suppose that each patient stayed for exactly 46 hours.¬† It‚Äôs pretty obvious that you‚Äôd need four beds.¬† Each bed could take a patient every two days and there are two patients per day coming in. Allowing two hours for changing beds, all four beds would be occupied for essentially 100 percent of the time, actually 95% = 46 hours/48 hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random arrivals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem arises because patients don‚Äôt arrive regularly and they don‚Äôt stay for a fixed length of time.¬† What happens if patients arrive at random and stay for a random length of time?¬† (We‚Äôll get back to the meaning of ‚Äòrandom‚Äô in this context &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/#calcs"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;.)¬† &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose again that two patients per day arrive on &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt;, and that each patient stays in the HDU for 46 hours &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt;.¬† So the mean arrival rate, and the mean length of stay in the HDU are the same as in the first example.¬† When there was no randomness, four beds coped perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with random arrivals and random length of stay the situation is very different.¬† With four beds, if a queue were allowed to build up, the average number of patients in the queue would  be 21 and the average length of time a patient would spend waiting to get a bed would be 10.5 days.¬† This would be an efficient use of resources because every time a bed was vacated it would be filled straight away from the queue.¬†The resources would be used to the maximum possible extent:, 95%.  ¬† But it would be terrible for patients. The length of the queue would, of course, fluctuate, as shown by this distribution (see below) of the queue length. Occasionally it might reach 100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/qtp1-inf.jpg" alt="$ beds, infinite queue" width="500" height="305"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;The histogram shows the total number of people in the system.The first five bins (red) represent the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 beds being occupied. All the rest are in the queue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you can‚Äôt queue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a High Dependency Unit or an Intensive Care Unit you can‚Äôt have a queue.¬† If there is no bed, you are turned away.¬† In the example just described, 91% of patients would have to wait, and that‚Äôs impossible in an HDU or ICU.¬† The necessary statistical theory has been done for this case too (it is described as having zero queue capacity).¬† Let‚Äôs look at the same case, with 4 beds, mean time between arrival of patients, 0.5 days, mean length of stay 1.917 days (46 hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case there is no queue so the only possibilities are that 0, 1, 2, 3 or all 4 beds are occupied.¬† The relative probabilities of these cases are shown on the right (they add up to 100% because there are no other possibilities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/qtp1-0-fig1.jpg" alt="Bedd occupancy didtribution"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the pressure on the unit, the randomness ensures that beds are by no means always occupied.¬† All four are occupied for only 29% of the time and the average occupancy is 2.7 so the resources are used only 68% of the time (rather than 95% when a queue was allowed to form).¬† Worse still, there is a 29% chance of the system being full, so you would be turned away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how many beds do you need? Clearly the more beds you have, the smaller the chance of anyone being turned away.¬† But more beds means more cost and less efficiency.¬† This is how it works out in our case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/qtp1-0-full-vs-beds.jpg" alt="full vs beds, no queue" width="500" height="277"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the chance of being turned away below 5%, rather than 29%, you‚Äôd have to double the number of beds from 4 to 8.¬† But in doing so the beds would not be in use 68% of the time as with 4 beds, but for only 47% of the time.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Looked at another way, if you try to increase the utilisation of beds, above 50 or 60%, then the rate at which patients get turned away goes shooting up exponentially.¬† &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/qtp1-0-full-vs-util.jpg" alt="full vs util queue=0" width="250" height="156"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn‚Äôt inefficiency.  It is an inevitable consequence of randomness in arrival times and lengths of stay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A real life example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McManus &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. (2004) looked at all admissions to the medical‚Äìsurgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a large, urban children‚Äôs hospital in the USA during a 2-year period.  (&lt;em&gt;Anesthesiology&lt;/em&gt; 2004; 100:1271‚Äì6. &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/mcmanus-stochastic-beds-2004.pdf"&gt;Download pdf&lt;/a&gt;).¬†Their Figure 2 shows the monthly average rejection rates mostly vary between 10 and 20%, so there is nothing  unusual in there being no bed available in the private US medical system.¬† For a period the rate of rejection reaches disastrous values, up to 47%. This happens, unsurprisingly, at times when the utilisation of beds was high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mcmanus-fig2-s.jpg" alt="McManus Figure 2" width="500" height="317"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observed relationship (McManus, Fig. 3) is very much as predicted above.with a very steep (roughly exponential) rise in rejection rate when the beds are in use for more than half the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mcmanus-fig3-s.jpg" alt="McManus Figure 3" width="500" height="343"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="calcs"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to do the calculations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the message without reading this section. It‚Äôs included for those who want to know a bit more  about what we mean when we say that patients arrive at random rather than at fixed intervals, and that durations of stay in the unit have random rather than fixed durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Consider the durations of stay in the unit. They are variable in length and the usual way to represent variability is to plot a distribution of the variable quantity. The best known sort of probability distribution is the bell-shaped curve known as the Gaussian distribution. This is shown at the top of the Figure (note that pdf stands for probability density function, not portable document format).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/distributions.jpg" alt="distributions.jpg" width="500" height="608"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every sort of variability is described by a symmetrical bell-shaped curve. Quite often distributions with a positive skew are seen, like the middle example in the Figure.¬† The distribution of incomes in the population have this sort of shape. Notice that more people earn less than average than earn more than average (the median is less than the mean). This can happen because those that earn less than average can‚Äôt get &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; less than average (unless we allow negative incomes), whereas bankers can earn (or at least be paid) a great deal more than average. The most frequent income (the peak of the distribution) is still smaller than the median.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extreme form of a positively-skewed distribution is shown at the bottom. It is called the exponential distribution (because it has the shape of a decaying exponential curve). If this described personal incomes (and we are heading that way) it would mean that the most frequent income was zero and 63.2% of people earn less than average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this last, rather unusual, sort of distribution that, in the simplest case, describes the lengths of random time intervals. This is getting very close to my day job. If an ion channel has a single open state, the lengths of individual ion channels is described by an exponential distribution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation of an exponential distribution of durations is what would be predicted for a memoryless process, or Markov process. In the case of an ion channel, memoryless means that the probability of the channel shutting in the next microsecond is the same however long the channel has been open, This is exactly analogous to the fact that the probability of throwing a six with a die is exactly the same at each throw, regardless of how many sixes have been thrown before.
  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Markov.jpg" alt="AA Markov"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrei A. Markov, 1856-1922&lt;br&gt;
Founded the study of stochastic processes: the Markov chain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the simplest definition of a random length of time. For those who have done a bit of statistics, it is worth mentioning that if the number of events per unit time is described by a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"&gt;Poisson distribution&lt;/a&gt;, then the interval between events are exponentially-distributed. They are different ways of saying the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lengths of stays in ICU in the McManus paper were roughly exponentially-distributed (right). The monthly average duration of stay ranged from 2.4 to 5.5 days, and average monthly admission rates to the 18 bed unit ranged from 4.6 to 6.2 patients per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mcmanus-fig1-vs.jpg" alt="McManus Fig 1"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monthly average percentage of patients who were turned away because there were no vacant beds varied widely, ranging from 3% up to a disastrous 47% &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A technical note and an analogy with synapses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs intriguing to note that, in the simplest case, the time you‚Äôd spend waiting in a queue would have a simple exponential distribution (plus a discrete bit for the times when you don‚Äôt have to wait at all). The time you have to wait is the sum of all the lengths of stay of the people in front of you, and each of these lengths, in the case we discussing, is exponentially-distributed. If the queue was constant in length you can use a mathematical method known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution"&gt;convolution&lt;/a&gt; to show that the distribution of waiting time would follow a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution"&gt;gamma distribution&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of distribution that goes through a peak, and eventually becomes Gaussian for long queues), However the queue is not fixed in length but its length is random (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution"&gt;geometrically-distributed&lt;/a&gt;). It turns out that the distribution of the sum of a random number of exponentially distributed times is itself exponential. It is precisely this beautiful theorem that shows why the length of a burst of ion channel openings (which consists of the sum of a random number of exponentially-distributed open times, if you neglect the time spent in short shuttings) is, to a good approximation itself exponential, And that explains why the decay of synaptic currents is often close to following a simple exponential time course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; The calculations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculations for these graphs were done with a set of Excel add-in functions, Queueing Toolpak 4.0, which can be &lt;a href="http://apps.business.ualberta.ca/aingolfsson/qtp/download.htm"&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;. If this had been a paper of my own, rather than a blog post written in one weekend, I‚Äôd have done the algebra myself, just to be sure, The theory has much in common with that of single ion channels. Transitions between different states of the system can be described by transition rates or probabilities that don‚Äôt vary with time. The table, or matrix, of transition probabilities can be used to calculate the results, And if you want to know about the algebra of matrices, you could always apply for &lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/matrix.htm"&gt;our summer workshop&lt;/a&gt;.  There are&lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/dcpics.html"&gt; some pictures from the workshop here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it is quite impossible for anyone who was around in the 60s to hear the name of a Russian mathatician without thinking of Tom Lehrer‚Äôs totally unjustified slur on another great Russian mathametician, Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky.  If you‚Äôve never heard ‚ÄòPlagiarize‚Äô, you can &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNC-aj76zI4&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;hear it on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.  Sheer genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the size of the unit matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section was added as a result of a comment, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2369"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;, from a statistician&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance one might think that if we quadruple the number of beds to 16 beds rather than 4, and we also quadruple the arrival rate to 8 rather than 2 per day, then the arrival rate per bed is the same and one might expect everything would stay the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you say, it doesn‚Äôt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If queueing was allowed, the mean queue length would be only slightly shorter, 18,7 rather than 20.9, but the mean time spent in the queue would fall from 10.5 days to 2.3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the more realistic case, with no queuing allowed, the rejection rate would fall from 29.4% to 15.5% and bed utilisation would increase from 68% to 81%. The rejection rate seems to fall roughly as the square root of the number of beds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly there is an advantage to having a big hospital with a big HDU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stochastic processes quite often behave unintuitive ways (unless you‚Äôve spent years developing the right intuition).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">DC&amp;#39;s Improbable Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256542950830"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/33612a943705bc76</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Paper Trail</title><published>2009-10-26T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/columbiathesis.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Did Barack Obama's thesis for Columbia University, entitled "Aristocracy Reborn," note that America's founding fathers "did not allow for economic freedom"?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256539417477"><id gr:original-id="http://amontenegro.blogspot.com/2009/10/grasping-extracellular-matrix-location.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d1e5f94507c3d76</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Grasping The (extracellular) Matrix, Location, location, location! and more in my picks of the week from RB</title><published>2009-10-26T01:15:39Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T01:15:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/piD6Y4iCzSY/grasping-extracellular-matrix-location.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://amontenegro.blogspot.com/2009/10/grasping-extracellular-matrix-location.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Another week has gone by and some very interesting molbio blog posts have been aggregated to Researchblogging.org.

If coffee keeps you awake, diluted coffee should cure insomnia. The less coffee, the stronger the effect. You can even dilute away all the molecules of coffee: the water will remember it. To figure out which remedies work for which symptoms, homeopathy has its own experimental process called "proving." They have a number of healthy people take a remedy and report all the symptoms they experience for an undetermined period of time, including things like "dreams of robbers." Then they list all these symptoms in a book so you can look up the ones that match your own symptoms to choose a remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just read a hilarious account of a proving at&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.interhomeopathy.org/index.php/journal/entry/trituration_proving_of_the_light_of_saturn/"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;www.interhom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;opathy.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Be it from imbibing the atmosphere within the bubble of woo-friendly southern California or taking a crash course at the University of Google and, through the &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=140"&gt;arrogance of ignorance&lt;/a&gt;, concluding that they know more than scientists who have devoted their lives to studying a problem, celebrities believing in and credulously promoting pseudoscience present a special problem because of the oversized soapboxes they command. Examples abound. There‚Äôs Bill Maher promoting &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2180"&gt;anti-vaccine pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1251"&gt;germ theory denialism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1868"&gt;cancer quackery&lt;/a&gt; on his show &lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/"&gt;Real Time with Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt; and getting the &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,4388,A-note-about-the-Richard-Dawkins-Award-being-presented-to-Bill-Maher-this-weekend,Josh-Timonen"&gt;Richard Dawkins Award&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org/schedule"&gt;Atheist Alliance International&lt;/a&gt; in spite of his antiscience stances on vaccines and what he sneeringly calls ‚ÄúWestern medicine.‚Äù Then there are, of course, the current public faces of the anti-vaccine movement, Jenny McCarthy and her boyfriend Jim Carrey, the former of whom thinks it‚Äôs just hunky dory (or at least doesn‚Äôt appear to be the least bit troubled) that her efforts are &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=194"&gt;contributing to the return of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; because she apparently &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=439"&gt;thinks that‚Äôs what it will take&lt;/a&gt; to make the pharmaceutical companies change their ‚Äúshit‚Äù product (her words), and the latter of whom &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fire_marshall_bill_discusses_vaccines.php"&gt;spreads conspiracy theories about vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=139"&gt;contempt on people suffering from restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, there‚Äôs the grand &lt;em&gt;macher&lt;/em&gt; of celebrity woo promotion, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=497"&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/a&gt;, who routinely promotes all manner of medical pseudoscience, be it ‚Äúbioidentical‚Äù hormones, the myth that vaccines cause autism (even hiring Jenny McCarthy to do a blog and develop a talk show for her company Harpo Productions), or other nonsense, such as Christiane Northrup urging &lt;em&gt;Oprah&lt;/em&gt; viewers to &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/06/7613/"&gt;focus their &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt; to their vaginas for better sex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, last week the latest celebrity know-nothing to promote health misinformation released a brand new book and has been all over the airwaves, including &lt;em&gt;The Today Show&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/em&gt;, and elsewhere promoting it. Yes, I‚Äôm talking about Suzanne Somers, formerly known for her &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=10"&gt;testimonial&lt;/a&gt; of having ‚Äúrejected chemotherapy and tamoxifen‚Äù for her breast cancer, as well as her promotion of ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=497"&gt;bioidentical hormones&lt;/a&gt;,‚Äù various exercise devices such as the Thighmaster and all manner of supplements. Her book is entitled &lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307587466" rel="nofollow"&gt;Knockout: Interviews with Doctors Who Are Curing Cancer‚ÄìAnd How to Prevent Getting It in the First Place&lt;/a&gt;. It is described on the Random House website thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Knockout&lt;/em&gt;, Suzanne Somers interviews doctors who are successfully using the most innovative cancer treatments‚Äìtreatments that build up the body rather than tear it down. Somers herself has stared cancer in the face, and a decade later she has conquered her fear and has emerged confident with the path she‚Äôs chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now she shares her personal choices and outlines an array of options from doctors across the country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;without chemotherapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;without radiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes, even without surgery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTEGRATIVE PROTOCOLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combining standard treatments with therapies that build up the immune system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;METHODS FOR MANAGING CANCER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;outlining ways to truly live with the diease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since prevention is the best course, Somers‚Äô experts provide nutrition, lifestyle, and dietary supplementation options to help protect you from getting the disease in the first place. Whichever path you choose, Knockout is a must-have resource to navigate the life-and-death world of cancer and increase your odds of survival.  After reading stunning testimonials from inspirational survivors using alternative treatments, you‚Äôll be left with a feeling of empowerment and something every person who is touched by this disease needs‚Ä¶HOPE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first found out about Somers‚Äô book about a month and a half ago and was fortunate enough (I think) that one of my readers who had a review copy of the book sent me a chapter list. The reason I wanted a chapter list was because I was really curious just who these doctors were whom Somers had interviewed. In particular, back then I predicted (and hoped) that one of the doctors would be one whom we‚Äôve met before. It was. Can you guess which one? Think about it. What major study did I blog about in the middle of September? What form of cancer quackery has been covered so ably by Kimball Atwood since the very beginning of this blog? No, no, you don‚Äôt have to go back to the archives and search. I‚Äôll tell you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez. He‚Äôs the second featured doctor who is ‚Äúcuring cancer,‚Äù right there in Somers‚Äô book in Chapter 6!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs right, one of these doctors who are ‚Äúcuring cancer‚Äù is a quack (in my opinion, of course) whose ‚Äúprotocol,‚Äù which includes 150 supplement pills a day topped off by a couple of coffee enemas per day, was recently shown to be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_gonzalez_protocol_worse_than_useless.php"&gt;worse than useless for pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; and, indeed, based on a recent study, far worse than conventional treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, it was incredibly bad timing and bad luck on Somers‚Äôs part to have one of the subjects she lionized in your book to have his protocol shown to be not just worthless, but likely actively harmful, a mere two months before the release of her book. In case there are any journalists who might be interviewing Somers and are interested in more than a puff piece that lets her promote her book, I list all the posts on Science-Based Medicine that have discussed the rank pseudoscience that is the Gonzalez protocol because, as many of you have figured out, I‚Äôm never satisfied with a hammer to smack down a form of woo when going nuclear is so much more fun:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this bad timing appears to have had no effect whatsoever on the publicity blitz of an actress who every day tries to live down to the character she played on &lt;em&gt;Three‚Äôs Company&lt;/em&gt; back in the 1970s or on the questions asked of her by interviewers. Somers has been all over the media this week, and I‚Äôve seen nary a challenging question stronger than pointing out that some of the doctors featured in Somers‚Äô book have gotten in trouble with their state medical boards, much less a much deserved question about Nicholas Gonzalez. Instead we‚Äôve thus far been treated to cliched, credulous headlines like &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33387002/ns/health-cancer/"&gt;Suzanne Somers questions chemo in new book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/WireStory?id=8866956"&gt;Somers‚Äô New Target: Conventional Cancer Treatment&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33347291/ns/today-today_health/"&gt;Suzanne Somers works to ‚ÄòKnockout‚Äô cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The article circulating about her book &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33387002/ns/health-cancer/"&gt;on the AP wire begins:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than a year after the former sitcom actress frustrated mainstream doctors (and cheered some fans) by touting bioidentical hormones on ‚ÄúThe Oprah Winfrey Show,‚Äù she‚Äôs back with a new book. This one‚Äôs on an even more emotional topic: Cancer treatment. Specifically, she argues against what she sees as the vast and often pointless use of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somers, who has rejected chemo herself, seems to relish the fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs get one thing straight here. It is most definitely &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as implied by various articles about Somers, in any way amazing that Somers is still alive after having ‚Äúrejected chemotherapy.‚Äù As I explained at the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=10"&gt;dawn of this blog&lt;/a&gt;, Somers had a stage I tumor with a favorable prognosis. If Somers is going to play the gambit of repeating, ‚ÄúI rejected chemotherapy and tamoxifen and I‚Äôm still alive‚Äù and attributing her survival to the alternative medicine woo she chose instead, perhaps now is the time to go into more detail than I‚Äôve ever gone into before about her case. Well, not quite. I did go into quite a bit of detail in my talk at the Science-Based Medicine Conference at TAM7 in July. After all, I did the research; so I might as well get some more use out of it and spread it beyond the 150 or so people who heard my talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prelude by flashback: Suzanne Somers‚Äô breast cancer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for my talk at TAM7, I searched for all the information I could find that was publicly available about Suzanne Somers‚Äô diagnosis of breast cancer back in 2000. For your edification, I‚Äôve also uploaded the slides from my presentation relevant to Suzanne Somers‚Äô breast cancer diagnosis as a &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/dhg-tam7-somers.pdf"&gt;PDF file&lt;/a&gt;. Suffice it to say, there is a great deal of misunderstanding of breast cancer in Somers‚Äô testimonial. In this case, I don‚Äôt actually blame Somers all that much for her misunderstanding, because it is a very common misunderstanding that clearly derives from a misunderstanding of the difference between using chemotherapy for primary treatment of cancer versus adjuvant treatment of cancer. In early stage breast cancer, which can be surgically removed for cure, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are in general used as &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; therapies that decrease the risk of recurrence of the cancer after surgery. That‚Äôs what adjuvant therapy is, extra therapy that improves a patient‚Äôs odds of surviving after a primary treatment. In the case of early stage breast cancer, the primary treatment is surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I can find from publicly available information on the Internet (I‚Äôve never read one of Suzanne Somers‚Äô books), at age 54 Somers was diagnosed with a breast cancer that was treated by lumpectomy (excision of the ‚Äúlump‚Äù or tumor) and a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, the latter of which was negative for tumor cells in the SLN, plus radiation therapy. For those not familiar with the SLN procedure, it is a procedure that developed in the 1990s to determine whether a woman‚Äôs breast cancer has spread to the axillary lymph nodes (the lymph nodes under the arm) without actually removing all of the axillary lymph nodes. Before the advent of SLN biopsy, the standard of care was to do an axillary dissection (removal of all the lymph nodes under the arm) on the side of the tumor in order to determine if and how many of the lymph nodes are positive for cancer. This is critical information, because the single most powerful prognostic indicator for potentially curable breast cancer (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, breast cancer that has not spread beyond the axillary lymph nodes to the rest of the body, such as bone, liver, or lung) is the presence of metastases in the axillary lymph nodes and, if they are present, how many. Unfortunately, as less invasive means of treating breast cancer were developed, such as lumpectomy, the part of the operation that carried the most morbidity was the axillary dissection. Consequently, as science-based physicians are wont to do, during the 1990s surgeons tried to find a way to get the same information (are the lymph nodes positive or negative) with a less morbid procedure and thus reserve axillary dissection only for patients who do have lymph nodes with breast cancer metastases in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the SLN biopsy was developed as a strategy to decrease the possibility of the most feared complication of axillary dissection, &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MIT/content/MIT_7_2x_Lymphedema_and_Breast_Cancer.asp"&gt;lymphedema&lt;/a&gt;, and still get the necessary information regarding lymph node positivity or negativity. Basically, an SLN biopsy is preformed by injecting both a radioactive dye and a blue dye (usually Lymphazurin Blue) into the breast. The dyes are then taken up in the lymphatics and head towards the axilla, where they lodge in one or more lymph nodes. This is (these are) the sentinel lymph node(s). The concept behind the procedure is that the sentinel node is the first lymph node a tumor cell that broke off from the tumor and got into the lymphatics will ‚Äúsee‚Äù and lodge in. In other words, the dye mimics the pathway that tumor cells take to metastasize to the axillary lymph nodes. If the sentinel node is negative, it‚Äôs an accurate indication that the rest of the lymph nodes are negative, and in general no further surgery is needed. Women are identified as node negative without removing all the axillary lymph nodes. Best of all, the risk of lymphedema from the procedure very, very small, far smaller than it is for axillary dissection (removing all the lymph nodes). Since the purpose of axillary dissection was far more diagnostic (to find out if the lymph nodes are contain tumor and, if so, how many), this is a good thing. On the other hand, if the SLN contains tumor, then axillary dissection is needed. In fact, far fewer women now undergo the procedure than in the past, and it is even coming under question whether a woman with a positive SLN truly needs a full axillary dissection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I mention this? Because I want readers to understand that Somers underwent, as far as I can tell, standard surgery for a favorable, estrogen receptor-positive stage I cancer. She also underwent radiation, although she has stated in the past and now states in &lt;em&gt;Knockout&lt;/em&gt; that, if she had it all to do over again, she would not have opted for radiation. Be that as it may, she has been trumpeting proudly for a number of years that she rejected chemotherapy and tamoxifen and has done quite well. This claim, although true, says nothing about whether he decision to eschew those adjuvant therapies was a good one and even less about whether the woo she pursued after that had anything to do with her survival. As I described so long ago, however, surgical excision is curative for most small breast cancers. Radiation therapy reduces the risk of local recurrences (recurrences in the breast), and chemotherapy and antiestrogen therapy (like Tamoxifen) reduce the risk of systemic recurrences (recurrences elsewhere in the body). In other words, chemotherapy and radiation are ‚Äúicing on the cake‚Äù after surgery. Indeed, there is a website known as &lt;a href="http://www.adjuvantonline.com"&gt;AdjuvantOnline.com&lt;/a&gt; that allows physicians to calculate the estimated risk of recurrence and the estimated benefit of chemotherapy and, if appropriate, antiestrogen therapy. Given when Somers had her cancer diagnosed (2000) and because I know that she had a stage I tumor, i entered data for her assuming a tumor between 1-2 cm in size, mainly because most tumors under 1 cm would not warrant adjuvant chemotherapy. Here is a blowup of the key slide from my talk where I showed the results I got when I entered the known information about Suzanne Somers‚Äô tumor into AdjuvantOnline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/4040985477/" title="Somers2a by David SBM, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2730/4040985477_be938d6be6.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Somers2a"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Click for a larger image.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, based on what we know from publicly available sources, Somers had an 88.6% chance of living 10 years without any chemotherapy or Tamoxifen. Chemotherapy provides a survival advantage of 2.5%; tamoxifen, 2.5%; and combination therapy, 4.1%. In other words, eschewing chemotherapy and tamoxifen increased Suzanne Somers‚Äô odds of dying of her cancer within 10 years by around 4%, not a huge number. As I‚Äôve explained before, although the benefit of chemotherapy and tamoxifen for early stage breast cancer is around 30% on a relative basis, but it‚Äôs only around 4% or 5% on an absolute basis. You may think that‚Äôs not very much, but, I assure you, the vast majority of women are willing to undergo chemotherapy and hormonal therapy for that extra insurance. Indeed, I would point out that surveys I have seen have revealed that a majority of women would still opt for chemotherapy even if it provided only a 1% absolute survival benefit. Moreover, for more advanced tumors, that relative benefit generally stays around 30% or so, meaning that, as the risk of dying from cancer goes up, the absolute benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy goes up as well. Be that as it may, I‚Äôve laid out this information to point out that testimonials like Somers‚Äô are not particularly impressive if you know something about breast cancer. I also mention it to point out that, even though it‚Äôs a bad idea for Somers to be pumping herself full of ‚Äúbioidentical hormones,‚Äù the favorable nature of her tumor means that she can get away with it. Even if it increased her risk of recurrence by 10 or 20%, the odds of survival would still be overwhelmingly in her favor, adjuvant chemotherapy and tamoxifen or not, thanks to her friendly neighborhood surgeon. So when you see a &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33387002/ns/health-cancer/"&gt;passage like this&lt;/a&gt; about Somers, remember what I‚Äôve just told you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosed with breast cancer a decade ago, she had a lumpectomy and radiation, but declined chemotherapy, as she did more recently when briefly misdiagnosed with pervasive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said before, Somers‚Äô misunderstanding of the role of adjuvant therapy in breast cancer is somewhat understandable. It is a concept that can be difficult to communicate this to patients under the best of circumstances, and the absolute benefit of chemotherapy in treating a stage I ER(+) cancer is relatively small. Moreover, treatment paradigms change with new scientific evidence. Most women these days with a stage I ER(+) tumor would undergo &lt;a href="http://www.oncotypedx.com"&gt;Oncotype DX¬Æ&lt;/a&gt; testing, and the results of that testing would guide the decision of whether chemotherapy is recommended or not. Oncotype DX did not exist in 2000, and adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended for the vast majority of women with a stage I breast cancer with a tumor greater than 1 cm in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somers‚Äô second testimonial, however, is not as forgivable as the first, which is actually only somewhat forgivable, given how aggressively Somers has used her own testimonial to promote ‚Äúalternative‚Äù medical treatments such as mistletoe extract (which may have some anti-tumor activity but the evidence is very weak‚Äìmore on that perhaps in a future installment). It reveals such a profound ignorance of what she herself is recommending to women for their ‚Äúhealth‚Äù that, as a breast cancer surgeon dedicated to providing only the best science-based surgical and medical care to my patients, I must call her out for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knockout: Suzanne Somers‚Äô ‚Äúwhole body cancer‚Äù scare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not yet have my promotional copy of &lt;em&gt;Knockout&lt;/em&gt;, although, I‚Äôm assured, it‚Äôs on the way. I had debated whether to wait until I had read it to write about the book, but then last week I saw this interview with Ann Curry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size:11px;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:#999;margin-top:5px;background:transparent;text-align:center;width:425px"&gt;Visit msnbc.com for &lt;a style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999!important;font-weight:normal!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com"&gt;Breaking News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507" style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999!important;font-weight:normal!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important"&gt;World News&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072" style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999!important;font-weight:normal!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important"&gt;News about the Economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also pointed out to me that Chapter 1 of &lt;em&gt;Knockout&lt;/em&gt; is available online at the Random House website. It‚Äôs entitled &lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307587466&amp;amp;view=excerpt"&gt;A Cancer Story‚ÄìMine&lt;/a&gt;. I read it and was appalled at the degree of misinformation being discussed right there in the very first chapter of the book, so much so that I started to doubt whether it was such a good idea of me to get a copy of the whole book and do a review on it. Still, I‚Äôm made of fairly stern stuff, and Somers is out there promoting the hell out of this book; so I feel that it‚Äôs my duty to look critically at the story she begins her book with. Suffice it to say, after I read Chapter 1, I was left shaking my head that anyone would listen to Suzanne Somers about cancer or any other health issue, so deep is the ignorance and so strong the distrust of ‚ÄúWestern medicine.‚Äù  Somers starts out her book by describing a cancer scare. Specifically, she describes an incident in which she was brought to the hospital with what sounds like an anaphylactic reaction of some sort and was misdiagnosed with what she calls ‚Äúfull body cancer.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go on, let me say right here that I do not mean to denigrate or otherwise downplay the seriousness of what happened to Somers, nor do I mean to cast doubt on the veracity of her story. At the very least, Somers appears to believe what she is saying, and it is quite possible that she was misdiagnosed with widespread metastasis from her breast cancer. I also don‚Äôt want to under estimate how much it probably scared her. Imagine yourself having survived breast cancer and then, eight years later, being admitted to a hospital for something else and being told that you had widespread metastases. It‚Äôs a horrible thing, if it really happened the way Somers said it happened, and it‚Äôs the sort of experience that would terrify anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color me somewhat skeptical, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain elements of Somers‚Äô story sound a bit fishy. First off, Somers declines to identify the hospital. Right at the outset, I wondered why that is and can guess at a couple of likely reasons. First, perhaps she‚Äôs worried about being sued. Of course, if you‚Äôre a celebrity and the truth is on your side you probably don‚Äôt have much worry about being sued. In such a case, it‚Äôs far more likely that the entity suing would get the worst of it, at least as far as negative publicity. More likely, Somers knows that, whatever hospital she had been admitted to and whatever doctors had cared for her, patient confidentiality and HIPAA law prevent the hospital and doctors from discussing her case‚Äìor even admitting that Somers was ever a patient. Indeed, neither the hospital nor any of the health care professionals involved with Somers care can discuss her case without her explicit permission. Their hands are completely tied, and Somers can write and say whatever she wants without fear that anyone will contradict her. That‚Äôs why it disturbs me that no one who has interviewed Somers yet has asked her a handful of very obvious‚Äìand inconvenient‚Äìquestions based on the anecdote in Chapter 1, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At what hospital were you hospitalized and when?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who were your doctors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will you release some of your medical records and allow your doctors to speak about your hospitalization?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are questions that need be asked in addition to questions about Somers‚Äô support for Nicholas Gonzalez, whose pancreatic cancer ‚Äúprotocol‚Äù was recently shown to be worse than useless, but I have yet to see anyone ask her these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on to Chapter 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wake up. I can‚Äôt breathe. I am choking, being strangled to death; it feels like there are two hands around my neck squeezing tighter and tighter. My body is covered head to toe with welts and a horrible rash: the itching and burning is unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash is in my ears, in my nose, in my vagina, on the bottoms of my feet, everywhere ‚Äî under my arms, my scalp, the back of my neck. Every single inch of my body is covered with welts except my face. I don‚Äôt know why. I struggle to the telephone and call one of the doctors I trust. I start to tell him what is happening, and he stops me: ‚ÄúYou are in danger. Go to the hospital right now.‚Äù I knew it. I could feel that my breath was running out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat, to me Somers‚Äô symptoms sound like an allergic reaction to something or an anaphylactic reaction. It could be something else (more later), but the first thing that comes to mind is an allergic reaction. Indeed, upon hearing this story, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if one of the many supplements that Somers takes on a routine basis was the cause. Did she start any new supplements recently? Certainly I‚Äôd wonder about that. (Again, more on that later; my speculation may well have been correct, just not in the way I thought at first.) Regardless of the initial cause, it certainly sounded as though the E.R. docs at whatever hospital Somers was brought to thought she was having some sort of allergic reaction. Based on that, they treated her appropriately with Benadryl, Albuterol, and steroids. Even someone as medically ignorant as Somers realized the most likely diagnosis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say to the doctor, ‚ÄúIt seems to me that I‚Äôve either been poisoned or am having some kind of serious allergic reaction to something. I mean, doesn‚Äôt that make sense? The rash, the strangling, the asphyxiation. Sounds classic, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know. A CAT scan will tell us. I really recommend you do this,‚Äù the doctor says. ‚ÄúNext time you might not be so lucky ‚Äî you might not get here in time. You were almost out.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read this part of the story, I was puzzled, and certainly Somers didn‚Äôt initially give enough information for me to hazard a particularly educated guess about why her doctor ordered a CT scan. After all, a CT scan is not generally the test of choice for diagnosing the cause of anaphylaxis or respiratory distress, which is what it sure sounds as though Somers was being treated for. On the other hand, maybe doctors saw a mass on chest X-ray (quite likely, as we will soon see). They may also have suspected a pulmonary embolus (PE), for which chest CT has supplanted the older test previously to detect PE, namely the V-Q scan. There may have been other findings on physical examination that suggested that a CT scan might be indicated. (There almost certainly were.) Again, initially, at least, Somers doesn‚Äôt give us enough information to judge. She does, however, engage in typical pseudoscientific thinking. While acknowledging that those evil pharmaceuticals had saved her life, still she can‚Äôt help but attack them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am now dressed in a blue hospital gown, and so far I‚Äôve been reinforced by three rounds of oxygen and albuterol. I‚Äôm starting to feel normal again. Drugs have been my lifesaver this time. This is what they are for. Knowing the toxicity of all chemical drugs, I‚Äôve already started thinking about the supplement regime and detox treatments I‚Äôll have when I get out of here, to get all the residue of pharmaceuticals out of me. I‚Äôm hopeful this will be the one and only time I have to resort to Western drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, whenever you hear an alt-med maven say ‚ÄúWestern medicine‚Äù (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2180"&gt;shades of Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt;!), what that alt-med maven is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; referring to is science-based medicine. As for supplements, if they have anything in them that does anything physiological, they contain ‚Äúchemical drugs.‚Äù There is no difference between ‚Äúchemical drugs‚Äù found in pharmaceuticals and ‚Äúchemical drugs‚Äù found in supplements, other than that the drugs found in supplements are adulterated with all sorts of stuff. There is no magical difference between the two. They both contain chemicals, and the body responds to chemicals through its biochemistry. Nothing makes supplements magically immune to the laws of physics and chemistry. Moreover, ‚Äúdetox‚Äù treatments are completely unnecessary quackery. Somers apparently doesn‚Äôt realize it, but her  body is more than capable of ‚Äúdetoxing‚Äù away those evil ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù pharmaceuticals through its own amazing abilities. Somers appears to think that ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù pharmaceuticals somehow leave their taint behind. Maybe she thinks the cells in her body have a ‚Äúmemory‚Äù in the same way that homeopaths claim that water has ‚Äúmemory‚Äù and that the taint has to be somehow purged, just as a Catholic believes that confession purges sins or certain Muslim sects think that self-flagellation will purge them of their sins. It really is religious thinking more than anything else for Somers to think that she was somehow ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù by ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù pharmaceuticals and needed to have that ‚Äúcontamination‚Äù purged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress. So what did the CT scan find? This, apparently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have very bad news,‚Äù he continued. My heart started pounding, like it was jumping out of my chest. ‚ÄúYou have a mass in your lung; it looks like the cancer has metastasized to your liver. We don‚Äôt know what is wrong with your liver, but it is so enlarged that it is filling your entire abdomen. You have so many tumors in your chest we can‚Äôt count them, and they all have masses in them, and you have a blood clot, and you have pneumonia. So we are going to check you into the hospital and start treating the blood clot because that will kill you first.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know that Somers did not, in fact, have cancer. (Otherwise, it would not have been a misdiagnosis.) So what she did have, I‚Äôll get to shortly. In the meantime, let‚Äôs take a look at what Somers says about her oncologist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oncologist comes into my room. He has the bedside manner of a moose: no compassion, no tenderness, no cautious approach. He sits in the chair with his arms folded defensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got cancer. I just looked at your CAT scan and it‚Äôs everywhere,‚Äù he says matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúEverywhere?‚Äù I ask, stunned. ‚ÄúEverywhere?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúEverywhere,‚Äù he states, like he‚Äôs telling me he got tickets to the Lakers game. ‚ÄúYour lungs, your liver, tumors around your heart ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never seen so much cancer.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the oncologist who saw Somers first was a world-class jerk. It‚Äôs quite possible. Not every doctor has a good bedside manner, and some have a horrendous bedside manner. Sadly, some of them are oncologists, even though, if there‚Äôs a specialty that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; demands a good bedside manner, it‚Äôs that of medical oncologist. On the other hand, as physicians we have to remind ourselves all the time that what we think we have said to the patient is not always how the patient has heard it and how we come across to the patient is not always how we have, in fact, come across to the patient. Maybe the oncologist was that uncaring, maybe not. We have no way of knowing because all we have is Suzanne Somers‚Äô report. Maybe it‚Äôs also true that the other oncologist who saw her was somewhat less of a jerk but just as quick to jump to a conclusion prematurely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the lung cancer doctor enters the room. Maybe he has better news. But no‚Äîhe says, ‚ÄúI just looked at your CAT scan, and you have lung cancer that has metastasized.‚Äù He is nicer, more thoughtful. ‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôm going to think about this,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs something else, but this sure doesn‚Äôt look good. I‚Äôll be back tomorrow.‚Äù Leslie takes out pen and paper and is making notes. She will continue to do this the entire week, writing down everything everyone is saying. Thank God, because when you are stunned and on medication, things get foggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day one is almost over. The most shocking, devastating day of my life, our life! I know the facts: when you have lung cancer and it has metastasized to your liver, heart, abdomen, and all over your body, you have at most two months‚Äîmaybe only two weeks or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a possible bit of perspective, I‚Äôll point out that not too long ago I had to relearn the lesson of how my perception of what I say to a patient may not always jibe with the patient‚Äôs perception of what I said. A while back, I saw a patient with breast cancer in her hospital room, a woman I had operated on the day before. I thought I had calmly laid out the situation, reassured her that her tumor was treatable, and told her that she might not need chemotherapy. About an hour later I got a frantic page from the floor. The patient was in tears, and the family was in an uproar. I don‚Äôt know how I had done it, but I had somehow given this patient the impression that her situation was hopeless and that she was going to die. When her family arrived to take her home she was crying. Apparently she had interpreted my telling her that she might not need chemotherapy (mainly because of her age and tumor characteristics) as telling her that it was pointless to treat her more. I relearned a valuable lesson that day, one I (and, I daresay, most doctors, no matter how experienced) need to relearn periodically, namely that patients don‚Äôt always interpret what I tell them the way I think they will and that sometimes how I view a conversation with a patient may be very different than how the patient viewed the conversation. Fortunately, I was able to reassure everyone and correct the misconceptions that had been left, but I did not feel too good about my bedside manner that day. In fact, the rest of that day I felt like the most insensitive, idiotic doctor in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe Suzanne Somers‚Äô oncologist was indeed a flaming jerk. That would be the worst case for ‚ÄúWestern medicine‚Äù in this story, and it is not nearly as uncommon as I‚Äôd like to admit for a physician to have the personality of a paper cup or the bedside manner of bully. Besides, it‚Äôs easier to assume that that is how the oncologist in question treated Somers. Even so, in that case, I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry that Somers‚Äô oncologist treated her badly. There‚Äôs no excuse for that. I‚Äôd also tell her simply to go and get another oncologist or go back to her regular oncologist, which she ultimately did. One nasty doctor does not invalidate ‚ÄúWestern medicine,‚Äù nor does the occurrence of a misdiagnosis, even one apparently this spectacular. In any case, it‚Äôs quite possible that there was a bit of Somers hearing things one way when her doctors weren‚Äôt telling it the way she interpreted them as telling her. The reason I say that is because Somers goes on and on, mainly in interviews but also in the book, about how, over six days, doctors told her she needed chemotherapy. As someone who has dealt with medical oncologists every day for over 10 years, that part of her story just didn‚Äôt seem very likely to me. The reason is that, in general, oncologists are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; reluctant to administer chemotherapy to a patient in the absence of a definite tissue diagnosis proving that they have cancer, be it metastatic cancer or any cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be doubly true in a case like what Somers describes in her book, particularly given that she had one oncologist thinking that she had lung cancer, not a recurrence of her breast cancer. In any case, widespread cancer could be a recurrence of her breast cancer (especially given Somers‚Äô proclivity to pump herself full of ‚Äúbioidentical hormones‚Äù after having been treated for an estrogen receptor-positive cancer), but in a 63-year-old woman, there are lots of other possible malignancies. Chemotherapy would be used for breast cancer might not work very well against, say, colon cancer or ovarian cancer, both of which are other likely possibilities in a woman of Somers‚Äô age. Another reason I seriously question whether doctors were pushing hard for chemotherapy in a mere six days is because, if they truly thought she had such a massively widespread recurrence of her breast cancer, particularly an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, all treatment would be palliative. We can‚Äôt cure most metastatic solid tumors, and the first rule in treating stage IV disease is usually the classic ‚ÄúFirst, do no harm.‚Äù Thus, oncologists usually tend to do the minimum possible that it takes to relieve symptoms and (hopefully) slow the progression of the tumor. Most likely, if this was indeed metastatic breast cancer, an oncologist would have chosen to treat Somers first with an anti-estrogen drug, probably an aromatase inhibitor (no tamoxifen if she had blood clots causing that much  trouble!) and then seen how she did. In the case of a woman who has ER(+) cancer recur as stage IV disease, that is almost always the first option. In such cases, chemotherapy is usually reserved for the case when antiestrogen therapy fails. Indeed, if the cancer was truly as widespread as Somers reports, chemotherapy might not even be used at all if the likelihood of success is tiny; in such cases, hospice would be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, the very first thing that any competent oncologist would demand before initiating chemotherapy is a tissue diagnosis, either from a needle biopsy or other tissue, to prove that there was cancer and to identify the type of cancer, so that the correct chemotherapy could chosen. Cancer chemotherapy is not like antibiotic therapy. In the case of infectious diseases, it is not uncommon to begin an antibiotic empirically based on the most likely organisms to be causing the infection and then to tailor the therapy to whatever organism(s) can be identified by cultures. Oncologists, on the other hand, are incredibly reluctant to treat metastatic cancer empirically, particularly cancer that appears to have recurred eight years after the original diagnosis of a stage I tumor. Such cancer might very well be a different cancer from a different organ, and the chance of doing harm with chemotherapy for no benefit is too great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs why I thought right away that there‚Äôs something very fishy about Somers‚Äô story. It just doesn‚Äôt add up very well. What I suspect to have happened is that perhaps the oncologist did have a conversation about a probable need for chemotherapy, and, like my conversation with my postoperative patient, Somers saw the conversation differently from how her doctors did. She probably viewed various ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios or ‚Äúif this is recurrent breast cancer, then you will need this‚Äù conversations as ‚Äúpressuring‚Äù her to take chemotherapy. If her oncologist wasn‚Äôt particularly warm and fuzzy or patient, she might have been even more likely to interpret his recommendations that way. Or perhaps her oncologists were incompetent enough to pressure her to take chemotherapy without a diagnosis of biopsy-proven cancer. Who knows? Even if the latter is true, it still doesn‚Äôt excuse Somers‚Äô horrible ignorance that becomes manifest later in the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Somers did get a biopsy. She describes it in her interview above, ‚ÄúThey cut into my neck and went in and took a piece of my lung, a piece of one of the so-called tumors around my heart turned out it was not cancer at all.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll admit that my first guess, sarcoidosis, was dead wrong. Given the symptoms of skin lesions, shortness of breath, and, apparently, ‚Äútumors around the heart‚Äù (which could indicate either pericardial involvement, or, more likely enlargement of the paratracheal nodes), I didn‚Äôt think it too unreasonable a first guess. (Besides, in the cases in &lt;em&gt;House, MD&lt;/em&gt;, sarcoidosis almost always appears on the differential diagnosis list.) However, never having lived in the southwest, having forgotten my medical school learning about common fungal infections, and being what I self-deprecatingly like to call a dumb surgeon, I didn‚Äôt consider what turned out to be the real diagnosis right away, namely &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/valley-fever/DS00695"&gt;valley fever&lt;/a&gt;, or, as it‚Äôs known by its official name, coccidioidomycosis. Indeed, the description of the most severe disseminated form of coccidioidomycosis matches Somers‚Äô presentation quite well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most serious form of the disease, disseminated coccidioidomycosis occurs when the infection spreads (disseminates) beyond the lungs to other parts of the body. Most often these parts include the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord (meninges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs and symptoms of disseminated disease depend on which parts of your body are affected and may include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nodules, ulcers and skin lesions that are more serious than the rash that sometimes occurs with other forms of the disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painful lesions in the skull, spine or other bones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painful, swollen joints, especially in the knees or ankles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meningitis ‚Äî an infection of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord and the most deadly complication of valley fever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here‚Äôs the kicker. Take a look at these two (out of several) &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/valley-fever/DS00695/DSECTION=risk%2Dfactors"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for the most severe form of coccidioidomycosis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakened immune system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone with a weakened immune system is at increased risk of serious complications, including disseminated disease. This includes people living with AIDS or those being treated with steroids, chemotherapy or anti-rejection drugs after transplant surgery. People with cancer and Hodgkin‚Äôs disease also have an increased risk.&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Older adults are more likely to develop valley fever than younger people are. This may be because their immune systems are less robust or because they have other medical conditions that affect their overall health.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These&lt;/em&gt; are risk factors for the serious disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Most people who contract coccidioidomycosis are either asymptomatic or exhibit relatively mild symptoms. Indeed, valley fever often presents as a flu-like illness from which people recover rapidly. Many people, in fact, are unaware that they‚Äôve ever had coccidioidomycosis until there‚Äôs either an abnormality on chest X-ray done for another reason or they have a positive skin or blood test. It‚Äôs very much like histoplasmosis right here in the Midwest. So why did Somers get such a serious case? It‚Äôs a legitimate question, given how she represents her regimen of supplements, bioidentical hormones, and various other woo as a highly effective path to rejuvenation and health that she recommends to her readers. Let‚Äôs see. Somers is 63, but apparently in good health. She also takes all sorts of supplements which, or so she claims, ‚Äústrengthen the immune system.‚Äù But her immune system was obviously not strong enough to prevent her from getting disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Why didn‚Äôt all those supplements ward off the fungus? For someone who takes handfuls of supplement pills every day and makes millions of dollars selling woo to ‚Äúboost the immune system,‚Äù Somers sure doesn‚Äôt appear to have a particularly strong immune system, as it failed miserably to protect her from a severe infection due to an endemic fungus that usually causes only mild disease or any symptoms at all but almost killed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility presents itself. As we know from her previous books and appearances on &lt;em&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/em&gt;, Somers takes boatloads of ‚Äúbioidentical‚Äù hormones. She &lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307237255"&gt;promotes them as a fountain of youth for women&lt;/a&gt;. One wonders if any of her various supplements or bioidentical hormones were somehow adulterated with corticosteroids, which suppressed her immune system, one does. Or at least I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One need wonder no more. Right there, in Chapter 1 of her book, is a highly plausible, highly likely explanation for why Somers became as ill as she did from coccidioidomycosis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Day 5&lt;/em&gt;. Dr. Oncologist comes into my room. Now, you would think he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúWell, sometimes it‚Äôs good to be wrong.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it great that you don‚Äôt have cancer?‚Äù But no. He walks in, doesn‚Äôt sit down, just looks at me and says angrily, ‚ÄúWell, you should have told me you were on steroids.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am flabbergasted. I don‚Äôt know what to say to him; I am so stunned by his lack of compassion that I just stare at him. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am not on steroids. I would never take steroids. But because he is stuck in old thinking and so out of touch with new medicine, he has no clue and doesn‚Äôt understand cortisol replacement as part of the menopausal experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know where to begin with him. He‚Äôs too arrogant to listen to a ‚Äústupid actress,‚Äù anyway. So much of his attitude with me has been the unsaid but definite ‚ÄúSo you think all your ‚Äòalternatives‚Äô are going to help you now, missy?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why steroids would have anything to do with being misdiagnosed with full-body cancer, I can‚Äôt guess. But we still don‚Äôt know what has gone wrong in my body. We still have to find out what caused me to end up in the ER.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Emphasis mine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs incredibly hard at this point not to go even beyond Mark Crislip-grade acid sarcasm at the &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=140"&gt;arrogance of ignorance&lt;/a&gt; on display. Here we have a woman who is apparently taking cortisol as part of her ‚Äúbioidentical hormone‚Äù cocktail, and this woman &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;does not know that each and every one of those estrogens she is taking is a steroid hormone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. More importantly, Somers apparently does not know that cortisol is a &lt;em&gt;corticosteroid&lt;/em&gt; (‚Äùcortico,‚Äù get it?), the very same kind of steroid that is routinely used by us evil reductionist practitioners of ‚ÄúWestern medicine‚Äù as an anti-inflammatory and immunsuppressant. When used that way by us evil pharma shills, cortisol is known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;hydrocortisone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is‚Äìgasp!‚Äìa &lt;em&gt;pharmaceutical&lt;/em&gt; concoction! It‚Äôs also ‚Äúbioidentical,‚Äù too, proving once more that ‚Äúbioidentical‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúrisk-free.‚Äù Indeed, hydrocortisone is often included as one of the drugs in immunusuppressive protocols used to prevent the rejection of organ transplants. Given that Somers has said that she takes enough ‚Äúbioidentical‚Äù estrogens to recreate the hormonal milieu of a woman in her 20s (in other words, far more estrogens than a 63 year old woman would ever have or need), it‚Äôs not beyond the pale to wonder whether she similarly takes a significant dose of hydrocortisone (sorry, &lt;em&gt;cortisol&lt;/em&gt;) as part of her brew of ‚Äúbioidenticals,‚Äù particularly in light of her having fallen seriously ill due to an organism that usually causes mild disease in immunocompetent hosts. Yes, valley fever can sometimes be a bad disease in immunocompetent hosts, but being immunocompromised for whatever reason is still a significant risk factor for disseminated disease or the reactivation of quiescent disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading Somers‚Äô story in Chapter 1, I shook my head in disbelief that Random House apparently didn‚Äôt have better editors who could have told Somers that she had just written something incredibly contradictory and just plain dumb when she wrote that didn‚Äôt take steroids in the context of writing how she castigated her oncologist for ‚Äúnot understanding‚Äù the role of cortisol in her menopause treatments. Also, based on Somers‚Äô (or her ghostwriters‚Äô) own words in Chapter 1 of her book, I think I have discovered the most likely explanation for Somers‚Äô contracting disseminated coccidioidomycosis. True, it could be that she was just unlucky and getting old, given that age is indeed a risk factor for disseminated disease, but one can‚Äôt ignore all the supplements she was taking. One can‚Äôt ignore that Somers was apparently taking cortisol as part of the cocktail of ‚Äúbioidentical hormones‚Äù to recapture her youth. It is thus very reasonable to wonder whether the reason that Somers became so ill last year was &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; she had been chronically dosing herself with cortisol and suppressing her very own immune system. Worse, Somers doesn‚Äôt even understand that cortisol &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a steroid and an immunosuppressant and therefore can‚Äôt accept or admit that this is a possibility. Indeed, that misunderstanding is leading her to view her misdiagnosis as clear evidence supporting her worldview that ‚ÄúWestern medicine‚Äù is hopelessly flawed, chemotherapy rarely works, and the ‚Äúalternative‚Äù medicine doctors whom she interviews can actually cure cancers that ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù medicine cannot. Even worse still, Somers is successful enough to be able to parlay her suspicion into a highly lucrative career, and her promotion of dubious, unproven, and even ineffective medical treatments for cancer may well result in cancer patients who might be saved eschewing science-based medicine and endangering their lives. At least, that is what I fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A panoply of unproven treatments and what‚Äôs to come&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said before, I plan on looking at &lt;em&gt;Knockout&lt;/em&gt; and writing a more formal review once I get my copy to read. That‚Äôs why this post is labeled ‚ÄúPart 1.‚Äù However, so incensed was I at the rank pseudoscience and dangerous misinformation being promoted relentlessly over the past week by a woman who is apparently utterly ignorant of what a steroid hormone is or that steroids are immunusuppressive that I decided to do this post now, while Somers‚Äô media blitz is still at its height. I concluded that an antidote to Somers‚Äô promotion of nonsense such as the Gonzalez protocol needed to be provided in clear, concrete, unequivocal terms was needed &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, that someone needed to express his opinion &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; that pseudoscience such as the Gonzalez protocol is quackery, particularly given the limp, woo-friendly response of Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. His article, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/10/23/commentary.brawley.cancer.treatment/"&gt;Somers‚Äô cancer advice is risky&lt;/a&gt;, appeared on CNN.com. In it Dr. Brawley practically bent over backwards to be conciliatory, calling Somers a ‚Äúwonderful actress‚Äù (she‚Äôs not and never has been), writing that he is ‚Äúnot critical of the concept of alternative and complementary medicine‚Äù (I am) and that ‚Äúopen-mindedness to other ideas is how we advance conventional medicine‚Äù (apparently his mind is so open that his brains threaten to fall out), even going so far as to invoke the hoary old alt-med examples of aspirin being derived from tree bark or vincristine being derived from a plant as though pharmacognosy were the same thing as herbalism. It‚Äôs not. Moreover, I wanted to provide a handy-dandy resource for journalists who may be interviewing Somers or people who may be seeing her at book signings or promotional events, hoping against hope that skeptics will ask her why she doesn‚Äôt think a steroid like cortisol &lt;em&gt;wouldn‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; predisopose her to disseminated coccidioidomycosis or why she thinks that Dr. Gonzalez is ‚Äúcuring cancer‚Äù when a clinical trial was published a mere two months before her book was released that showing clearly that his protocol is worse than useless and that pancreatic cancer patients undergoing conventional therapy live three times longer than those undergoing the Gonzalez protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guy can hope, can‚Äôt he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, here‚Äôs a chapter list, which will give you an idea of what you have to look forward to when I get around to reading the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Doctors Who Are Curing Cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 5:  Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D.&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 6:  Nicholas Gonzalez, M.D.&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 7:  Burton Goldberg&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 8:  Julie Taguchi, M.D.&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 9:  James Forsythe, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventing Cancer Before it Starts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 10: Russell Blaylock, MD&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 11: Steve Haltiwanger, MD&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 12: David Schmidt&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 13: Jonathan Wright, M.D.&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 14: Steven Sinatra, M.D., F.A.C.C., F.A.C.N.&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 15: Michael Galitzer&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 16: Cristiana Paul, M.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most names I actually don‚Äôt know, but some names stand out, such as Dr. Burzynski, whom we haven‚Äôt yet discussed much on this blog but should (reviewing this book will give me just that opportunity), and Dr. Blaylock, who is best known for videos like this about H1N1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Ifb9ivm3gq0%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll spare you parts 2 and 3 of Dr Blaylock‚Äôs video. You get the idea, and if you are masochistic enough top want to view them, you can easily find them on YouTube. Suffice it to say, showing up on Alex Jones‚Äô Prison Planet TV is not exactly a way to burnish one‚Äôs scientific credentials. Jones‚Äô websites, &lt;a href="http://www.infowars.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Infowars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Prison Planet&lt;/a&gt;, are repositories of conspiracy craziness on par with David Icke‚Äôs lizard people, including 9/11 Truthers, ‚ÄúNew World Order‚Äù conspiracy theorists (including, of course, the Illuminati and the Rothschilds), and a heaping helping of anti-vaccine and alt-med conspiracy mongering. In fact, Dr. Blaylock isn‚Äôt too far from David Icke‚Äôs rant about how the swine flu vaccine is &lt;a href="http://www.davidicke.com/content/view/25191" rel="nofollow"&gt;a plot by the Illuminati&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such are Suzanne Somers‚Äô ‚Äúdoctors who are curing cancer.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that, whatever her intentions, whether they be to help people or make money or both, Somers is unwittingly promoting dangerous cancer ‚Äúcures‚Äù that are anything but cures. They are treatments that are anything but science-based, as well. Just as Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, and Bill Maher are promoting anti-vaccine pseudoscience to the nation and Oprah Winfrey is providing an unmatchable soapbox for all manner of promoters of woo, Somers is taking advantage of her position to bash conventional medicine and promote non-science-based medicine, most likely raking in the cash hand over fist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People may well die as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/study_cell_phone_cancer_link_D1uu62C2zscTFCnzQTeZwO"&gt;Study: Cell Phone Cancer Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking, $30 million study into cell phones has found a link between long term use and &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/t/Brain_Tumors"&gt;brain tumors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/t/World_Health_Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; is about to reveal that its decade-long investigation has found the devices can lead to cancer ‚Äî and the internationally-respected body will soon issue a public health message with its findings, London‚Äôs Daily Telegraph reported today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion goes against years of assurances by cell phone companies and scientists that cell phone use is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last month, Sen. &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/t/Arlen_Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt; (D ‚Äì Pa) organized Senate hearings to examine health implications of talking on-the-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title="CAN YOU KILL ME NOW? -- A groundbreaking, 10-year study will show that long-term cell phone use can lead to brain tumors." src="http://www.nypost.com/rw/nypost/2009/10/24/news/photos_stories/032301CellPhones3EL203707--300x300.jpg" alt="CAN YOU KILL ME NOW? -- A groundbreaking, 10-year study will show that long-term cell phone use can lead to brain tumors." width="300" height="300"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;elizabeth lippman/N.Y. Post&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAN YOU KILL ME NOW? ‚Äî A groundbreaking, 10-year study will show that long-term cell phone use can lead to brain tumors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO‚Äôs Interphone investigation‚Äôs results showed, ‚Äúa significantly increased risk‚Äù of some brain tumors ‚Äúrelated to use of mobile phones for a period of ten years or more,‚Äù the Telegraph reported today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study‚Äôs head, Dr. Elisabeth Cardis, said, ‚ÄúIn the absence of definitive results and in the light of a number of studies which, though limited, suggest a possible effect of radiofrequency radiation, precautions are important.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project carried out studies in 13 countries, talking to tumor sufferers as well as healthy cell phone users, It interviewed 12,800 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results will be officially published before the end of the year, according to the Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect example of how some in the media misuse science to make headlines, while at the same time spreading misinformation.¬† Notice that the article is &lt;em&gt;citing research which hasn‚Äôt even been published yet!&lt;/em&gt; So, if the research isn‚Äôt yet published for scrutiny, how in blazes do the morons at NY Post know what the research says?¬† I always thought that a good journalist was supposed to check their facts before reporting a story, not the other way around.¬† Apparently, the folks at the NY Post live in an alternate universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, some other tidbits that pop up in this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; It references a ‚Äúsignificantly increased risk‚Äù of cellphone use causing cancer ‚Äì but what does ‚Äúsignificantly increased risk‚Äù even mean?¬† Is it a higher risk by 50%, 10%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.0001%?¬† The fact that this info isn‚Äôt even reported just fuels wild speculations that ‚Äì despite any &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; evidence ‚Äì whatever it is, it‚Äôs really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; I also want to make particular note of this paragraph in the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study‚Äôs head, Dr. Elisabeth Cardis, said, ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;In the absence of definitive results&lt;/strong&gt; and in the light of a number of studies which, &lt;strong&gt;though limited, suggest a possible effect of radiofrequency radiation&lt;/strong&gt;, precautions are important.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the head of the study states that the results are &lt;em&gt;not definitive&lt;/em&gt;, and the studies which are there (she refers to them as ‚Äúlimited‚Äù, which is science-speak for ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have enough research to support a solid claim‚Äù) &lt;em&gt;suggest&lt;/em&gt; only a &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; effect.¬† And this is the research heading the study saying this, but she‚Äôs a scientist ‚Äì the goofballs who wrote the NY Post headline are not scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Lastly, there‚Äôs this part of the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project carried out studies in 13 countries, talking to tumor sufferers as well as healthy cell phone users, It interviewed 12,800 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve got a bad feeling about this.¬† From what this states, it seems the study is based upon interviews with people.¬† Interviews?¬† As far as medical studies go, that‚Äôs pretty thin stuff, folks.¬† It‚Äôd be much more convincing if someone could actually provide some kind of clear-cut evidence of a physical mechanism by which cellphone radiation can cause cancer.¬† The problem is ‚Äì &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/electromagnetic-fields-cancer-myths/"&gt;for reasons I‚Äôve outlined in an earlier blog post&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì no such mechanism exists that can be studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôll be interesting to see what comes out at the end of the year when the actual study is published, and I‚Äôm wondering how close to reality the NY Post‚Äôs depiction of the study will be.¬† I‚Äôm going to guess now: not much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the end, this is a classic case of sloppy journalism which, though it might grab some people‚Äôs attention with the scary sounding headline, ultimately serves to spread fear &amp;amp; ignorance of science.¬† Way to go, NY Post!¬† I give you a grade of FAIL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Five days a week I'm a news junkie. On weekends I take a complete break. Come Monday morning, I'm again ready for the news, catching up on whatever happened over the weekend. The first thing that slapped me in the face Monday morning, even before the every-five-minute repeat of the weather, was this story: a local woman had died after traveling to Arizona to participate in somebody's idea of a sweat lodge ceremony. After keeling over from excessive heat (possibly literally biting the dust), she was taken to a hospital and later died. Authorities stated homicide charges were pending....&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rather like their &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=192282495574"&gt;planned unofficial response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a call to all non-believers and advocates for freedom of speech to join us in a global co-ordinated minute of prayer with the aim of inundating God (in this context, the Christian god, God, as distinct from the Greek god, Zeus, the Egyptian god, Ra etc etc) with so many useless prayers that it causes his divineness to go offline as as result of our own DDOS ('Divine' Denial of Service).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The prayer minute will be at exactly 8pm (Eastern Standard Time) &amp;amp; 9am (Greenwich Mean Time) on Sunday 8 November 2009.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Please join us in this important task, with any luck it will take God a while to get back online, ensuring us at least a few days of godless peace. It will also give the Westboro Baptist Church some much needed time to catch up on paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I won't be able to join in, because whatever I have planned for that time, whatever it may be, will be far more interesting and productive than babbling to an invisible man. I'm pretty sure I won't be needed, though; I understand all modern prayers are first funneled through a 110 baud modem, then passed further upstairs by telegraph, then pony express riders gallop it over to the Pearly Gates, and then a rewritten version is passed on to a team of long-dead Sumerian scribes for transcription into cuneiform on wax plates, and then and only then is it in a format that a bronze age patriarchal deity can understand. I don't think it'll take much to swamp the celestial bandwidth (which actually explains a lot, if you think about it.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/the_atheists_revenge.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tAUO8moZmKM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256523930630"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/time_for_them_to_eat_their_own.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a920283408c907b3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Time for them to eat their own</title><published>2009-10-26T00:46:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T00:46:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/aI_b20DaWzU/time_for_them_to_eat_their_own.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/time_for_them_to_eat_their_own.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Somehow, this &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,569121,00.html"&gt;story is just too cliched&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pastor Marc Grizzard claims the King James version of the Bible is the only true word of God, and that all other versions are "satanic" and "perversions" of God's word.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On Halloween night, Grizzard and the 14 members of the Amazing Grace Baptist Church will set fire to other versions of the scripture, as well as music and books by Christian authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book burning, sectarian intolerance, and &lt;i&gt;overalls&lt;/i&gt;? Good grief, man, that is just playing to the stereotype of the southern good ol' boy. Every educated Southerner is cringing at what you're doing to their image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do wonder what Pastor Grizzard thinks of &lt;a href="http://www.alternet.org/belief/143396/an_atheist%27s_review_of_the_book_of_genesis_illustrated_by_a_legendary_comics_artist/?page=entire"&gt;this version&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/time_for_them_to_eat_their_own.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/aI_b20DaWzU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256519080206"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10614446.post-3911485758164145225">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b62f1deb401c5811</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The 122nd Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle: A committee meeting</title><published>2009-10-26T00:14:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T00:14:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2009/10/122nd-meeting-of-skeptics-circle.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Orac)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Circular Reasoning</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256518716664"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=7096">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/65c26065af4dd2e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asperger's Syndrome"/><category term="Autism Organizations"/><category term="Crime"/><category term="Epidemic"/><category term="Safety"/><category term="tennessee"/><category term="United Kingdom"/><category term="wales"/><title type="html">Asperger‚Äôs Defense; ASD in Tenn.</title><published>2009-10-26T00:55:50Z</published><updated>2009-10-26T00:55:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/aspergers-defense-asd-in-tenn/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;‚Äôs Erica Westly¬†takes an interesting look at &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2233313/"&gt;the increasing incidence of Asperger‚Äôs as a legal defense&lt;/a&gt;, citing the¬†recent headline case of British computer whiz Gary McKinnon, who hacked into¬†almost 100 U.S. government and NASA computers after becoming obsessed with the United States covering up UFO contact. ‚ÄúCriminal defendants in the United States have been using similar tactics with varying degrees of success in recent years,‚Äù Westly writes. ‚ÄúIn fact, it‚Äôs not all that rare for criminal defendants with Asperger‚Äôs to argue for leniency in cases of computer fraud, sexual misconduct, and murder. Three years ago, the defense even made its way into an episode of ‚ÄòBoston Legal.‚Äô‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Elsewhere in the U.K., a 20-year-old Wales man who‚Äôs admitted to encouraging a 12-year-old boy with Asperger‚Äôs to engage in sexual activity on a cam has been allowed to &lt;a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/10/25/pervert-who-groomed-boy-online-still-allowed-to-use-internet-91466-25007211/#"&gt;continue using the Internet for work&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The first in a series of reports examining public services for ASD infants, children and youth in Tennessee, by the Comptroller of the Treasury‚Äôs Offices of Research and Education Accountability (OREA), is out: &lt;a href="http://www.comptroller1.state.tn.us/Repository/RE/AutismPart1Sources.pdf"&gt;‚ÄúAutism in Tennessee: Part 1 ‚Äì An Introduction to Issues and Data Collection&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.comptroller1.state.tn.us/Repository/RE/AutismPart1Sources.pdf"&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt;,‚Äù provides an overview of autism as a disability, a review of associated laws, and includes autism data collection and prevalence estimates. Subsequent reports to be released in the series will review public education and health care services as they relate to autism in Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of children and youth receiving autism-related special education services in Tennessee more than tripled from approximately 1,293 to 4,019 between 2001 and 2007. The report also points out that it is difficult to obtain accurate, reliable information on who receives autism-related services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennessee officials say it might be good to go the route of other states, most recently New Jersey, to create autism registries.&lt;/p&gt;

Sean Hannity's ...  feigns dismay at the idea that Christians don't have any signs up in the NYC Subway system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to imagine the outrage, because it isn't happening. There are pro-Christian signs all over the NYC subway system. It shouldn't take too much to ask one of his underlings about this kind of thing before he makes this kind of statement. But, this is another example of how he likes to fan the flames of a nearly non-existent "culture war" being waged by what his cohort Bill ORLY refers to as the "Secular Progressives."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least Davis has the good sense to not &lt;em&gt;admit&lt;/em&gt; to believing such absurd things.  Regardless of what he says on tape, he could have simply lied, said ‚ÄúNo, those are not my beliefs,‚Äù and move on with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how do we shame those people who believe in reincarnation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or those people who believe that Heaven or Hell are actual places?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or those people who believe that a god created the world in a week, that Adam and Eve were actual people, or that Jesus came back to life after being killed and has any ability to cleanse us of sins now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs all the same degree of delusion.  The only difference is we‚Äôre more used to hearing whatever mythology is adopted by the people around us.&lt;/p&gt;

I illustrated from an early passage about &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001628.html"&gt;renowned Harvard professor of symbology Robert Langdon&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival at the Washington Dulles Airport: the &lt;u&gt;Falcon&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;2000EX&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;corporate&lt;/u&gt; jet, the &lt;u&gt;soft&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;leather&lt;/u&gt; seats in the &lt;u&gt;luxurious&lt;/u&gt; interior, the &lt;u&gt;cold&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;January&lt;/u&gt; air, the &lt;u&gt;white&lt;/u&gt; fog on the &lt;u&gt;misty&lt;/u&gt; tarmac, the &lt;u&gt;middle-aged&lt;/u&gt; woman with &lt;u&gt;curly&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;blond&lt;/u&gt; hair under &lt;u&gt;stylish&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;knit&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;wool&lt;/u&gt; hat who babbles boringly to him about his own choice of attire, and then: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; Mercifully, a &lt;u&gt;professional-looking&lt;/u&gt; man in a &lt;u&gt;dark&lt;/u&gt; suit got out of a &lt;u&gt;sleek&lt;/u&gt; Lincoln Town Car parked near the terminal and held up his finger. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(No, I don&amp;#39;t know which finger.)  Well, by a weird coincidence (truth is stranger than even very strange fiction), last night I myself was flown into Dulles Airport at the invitation of people I have not met.  And guess what‚Ä¶&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I didn't come in on a corporate jet (though I did upgrade my scheduled flight from economy to a sort of extra-legroom enhanced economy, and that helped).  And I wasn't actually greeted planeside by a personal greeter in a stylish knit wool hat.  But I'm here to do a trial video-recording of a lecture on grammar for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Teaching_Company"&gt;The Teaching Company&lt;/a&gt;, and (as my Language Log colleague John McWhorter promised) they treat their professors very well.  As I emerged from the hell of the Dulles baggage hall (and my god, it was third-world chaos in there), I noticed, mercifully, holding up not a finger but a sign saying "GEOFFREY PULLUM", there was a &lt;u&gt;professional-looking&lt;/u&gt; man in a &lt;u&gt;dark&lt;/u&gt; suit, and yes, he had a Lincoln Town Car parked near the terminal!  Whoa, I'm Professor Robert Langdon, arriving at the nation's capital in a professionally-driven limo!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know, I couldn't help noticing that it was &lt;b&gt;sleek&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Dan said.  That is the problem with his over-use of attributive modifiers, of course.  He tells us things we knew. Lincoln Town Cars are always sleek.  That's the whole point of them.  Sleek things to park near terminals so that professional-looking men in dark suits can collect professors and senators in them.  That's what they are.  There aren't any chunky, boxy little Lincoln Town Cars, like glassed-in 1948 Studebaker pickup trucks.  Sleekness is of the very essence, and we all know that.  The modifier served no purpose at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should add that my visit is so far going much better than Robert Langdon's visit to Washington in &lt;i&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/i&gt;.  He is whisked to the Capitol to give a lecture, but it is a total bust (there is nobody there; it was a trick to get him to come to Washington), and almost immediately he encounters the severed hand of a beloved friend and mentor in the middle of the floor of the Capitol rotunda.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been much luckier.  No mutilated mentor.  And I am quite sure that there is no modifier-bestrewed, hideously tattooed, multi-disguised, Arabic-named, masonically-inducted, revenge-driven, symbolic clue-dropping, sadistic torturer tracking my every move in or under the city‚Ä¶  Wait a minute, there&amp;#39;s someone at the door.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs why I have mixed feelings about Lisa Miller‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/219009"&gt;latest column in &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.¬† Miller, the magazine‚Äôs religion editor, has been a consistent critic of New Atheism and, what‚Äôs worse, a &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/215180"&gt;fan of Karen Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, showing a fatal susceptibility to wooly-headed apologetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, Miller tells us that she‚Äôs tired of atheist arguments against God, dismissing a debate betweeen Christopher Hitchens and pastor Douglas Wilkins as ‚Äútwo middle-aged white men talking. ‚Äù (Really! Imagine how Miller‚Äôs hackles would rise if someone characterized a debate between Margaret Downey and Ann Coulter as ‚Äútwo middle-aged white women talking.‚Äù)¬† But before explaining why she wants to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù from such debates, Miller gets in a gratuitous lick at the NAs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three charismatic men‚ÄîHarris, Richard Dawkins, and Hitchens (who is a NEWSWEEK contributor)‚Äîhave not just dominated the conversation, they‚Äôve crushed it. And so they‚Äôve become celebrities. Together they‚Äôve sold more than 3 million books worldwide, which suggests they may be in this for more than just our edification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um. . . is it &lt;em&gt;civil&lt;/em&gt; to impute to Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens such base motives? (Likewise, is it civil to denigrate them as ‚Äúmiddle-aged white men‚Äù? ) And how on earth does selling so many books prove that these guys did it for the money?¬† I‚Äôm sure that Harris, for one, had no idea how well &lt;em&gt;The End of Faith&lt;/em&gt; would sell.¬† My best guess is that the main reason these guys wrote their books is that &lt;em&gt;they wanted to spread their ideas&lt;/em&gt;. If an atheist used this kind of argument, she‚Äôd be immediately chastised for being shrill and militant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what apparently galls Miller the most is about the Three Horsemen is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this version of the conversation has gone on too long. We have allowed three people to frame it; its terms‚Äîsubmitting God to rational proofs and watching God fail‚Äîare theirs . . . The whole thing has started to feel like being trapped in a seminar room with the three smartest guys in school, each showing off to impress ‚Ä¶ whom? Let‚Äôs move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can this mean but that the atheists have &lt;em&gt;won&lt;/em&gt;?¬† For here Miller tacitly admits that there are no ‚Äúrational proofs‚Äù of God.¬† So when she says that we should move on, does she mean that we can all agree there‚Äôs no rational basis for faith? Not on your life.¬† She thinks that we‚Äôve simply taken the wrong tack: we need to look at faith as &lt;em&gt;poets&lt;/em&gt; rather than scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other voices out there, and other, possibly more productive ways to frame a conversation about the benefits and potential dangers of religious faith. In 2003 the historian and poet Jennifer Hecht wrote &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doubt: A History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, an exhaustive survey of atheism. She advises readers to investigate questions of belief like a poet, rather than like a scientist. ‚ÄúIt is easier to force yourself to be clear,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúif you avoid using believer, agnostic, and atheist and just try to say what you think about what we are and what‚Äôs out there.‚Äù Hecht is as much of an atheist as Hitchens and Harris, she says, but she approaches questions about the usefulness of religion with an appreciation of what she calls ‚Äúparadox and mystery and cosmic crunch.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear stuff like this, you know that the goal posts have suddenly shifted.¬† In this case they‚Äôve moved from the truth of religion to its ‚Äúbenefits and dangers.‚Äù¬† Well, at least Miller admits that you can get some of those benefits by secular means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week Harvard‚Äôs humanist chaplain Greg Epstein comes out with &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Without God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a book arguing that people can have everything religion offers‚Äîcommunity, transcendence, and, above all, morality‚Äîwithout the supernatural. This seems to me self-evident, yet the larger point is important. We need urgently to talk about these things: ethics, progress, education, science, democracy, tolerance, and justice‚Äîand to understand the reasons why religion can (but does not always) hamper their flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may be wrong, but haven‚Äôt the NAs, especially Sam Harris, been talking about this all along?¬† Harris devotes a fair chunk of his book to the human needs that religion meets, and how they can be met by secular activities like meditation.¬† Dawkins has devoted his pen ‚Äî and some of his ill-gotten gains! ‚Äî to showing how we can be good without God.¬† And Hitchens has detailed the numerous ways that faith hinders democracy, tolerance, and justice. What, then, is ‚Äúthe larger point‚Äù that we‚Äôve all missed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Miller could devote a few words to explaining why you don‚Äôt need faith to be moral, a position that doesn‚Äôt seem so ‚Äúself-evident‚Äù to many Americans.¬† Now &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; would be doing her readers a service!

I have about 16 slots every morning for returning patients (fewer if I have new patients booked, which I usually do).  I usually schedule, counting new and old patients, 12 patients every morning.  If I were to cut my appointment slots down to 10 minutes instead of 15, I could really pack 'em in, and I may have to do that some day, but with the 15 minute slots, I can usually squeeze in people who want to walk in because they're sick.  There's only so much that can be done to control the flow; if someone has chest pain, I'm going to be running late from then on.  If everyone is well, I'll be right on time.  &lt;/p&gt;

If I have 12 slots booked, and just two people with the flu want to be seen, I'm either going to squeeze them into the middle of the schedule or tack them onto the end.

The genetic code of an organism contains huge amounts of data, and the potential for a greater understanding of how it works at an intracellular level, and whole centers and genome sequencing factories now exist to fill this need. While most of the sequencing is still done using a modified and more efficient version of Sanger&amp;#39;s original dideoxy method, next-generation sequencing machines are starting to emerge that can achieve what is imaginatively named massively parallel sequencing. Massive amounts of DNA can be sequenced in parallel, and we&amp;#39;re talking MASSIVE amounts of DNA. Illumina/Solexa machines can sequence hundreds of thousands of DNA molecules all in parallel.The basic Sanger sequencing method is shown below (image taken from the Science Creative Quarterly, which also has a very good description of the process for those more interested in DNA sequencing)There is a catch in massively parallel sequencing however. Sequencing works by breaking a large DNA molecule down into smaller &amp;#39;reads&amp;#39;. Each read is then sequenced and they can be stuck back into the right order (with varying accuracy) once all the reads have been completed. Sanger sequencing (diagram above) can produce reads up to 1000 base pairs long. NextGen sequencing is lucky if it manages 350 base pairs. They tend not to be quite as accurate as well.What they are is cheap. Which gives geneticists an important tool; large numbers of short genome reads generated at very low cost. While these NextGen techniques are being improved, and there are many people looking into making them more effective for de novo gene sequencing, they are also being put to use in other areas, where the ability to sequence large numbers of short genomic sequences at low cost is hugely beneficial.The most obvious areas are those where you don&amp;#39;t need a particularly long sequence, such as  when you just need to find the site of origin of a particular length of DNA. This is particularly useful for looking at transcribed portions of the DNA (those parts that are actually turned into proteins). Sequencing short bits of the transcribed RNA copy (that is used to make the protein) allows this to be compared to the original DNA sequence to find where the DNA corresponding to the protein is and, possibly more importantly, concrete evidence that it is being transcribed. In this situation the short reads aren&amp;#39;t a problem, although there are still issues with the accuracy.Another application is to look for novel small RNAs. These are small sections of RNA which regulate gene expression. They are discovered fairly recently (in plants originally) so there&amp;#39;s quite a lot of excitement about them. As they&amp;#39;re only small the length of the reads are not a problem. Pyrosequencing (a form of NextGen sequencing) was used to discover the Piwi-interacting RNAs, which are linked to transcriptional silencing in germ line cells.NextGen sequencing also has a role in protein coding gene annotation. Protein-coding genes can be quite long, and would require several reads from NextGen techniques, but the low cost of these methods means that they are starting to be used for annotating protein coding regions. Integrating them with paired-end sequencing (which allows the reads to be re-connected more easily) removes some of the problems are shorter reads, and novel techniques are continually being explored to increase the accuracy.NextGen machines are also starting to be used more for metagenomics, which works by taking random soil or water samples and sequencing every bit of DNA you can find, regardless of which organism it comes from. A metagenomics project in the Sargasso Sea (strangely enough most of these projects tend to take place in warmer climates...noone appears to do metagenomics in, say, iceland) produced over 1.2 million unknown gene sequences. These are suspected to be from &amp;#39;unculturable&amp;#39; bacteria, which for some reason just don&amp;#39;t grow in the lab, and metagenomics has revealed a huge number of these bacteria within the ecosystem.If you want a novel genome sequenced your best bet is still to send it down to the Sanger Centre and be very polite to everyone who works there, but the growth of cheaper machines with massively parallel sequencing provides a whole range of new applications. Even if NextGen machines never quite reach the accuracy and read length of Sanger machines, there are still many areas in science to which they provide a large benefit.---MOROZOVA, O., &amp;amp; MARRA, M.

&lt;p&gt;I try to collect data on my blog life in order to help me write a blog more targeted to my audience, although I am not necessarily sure there is any trend in the data.  Still, I keep collecting data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways I collect data is by using a link shortener that maintains a record of the number of clicks each link gets.  I like &lt;a href="http://su.pr/"&gt;http://su.pr&lt;/a&gt;.  This morning though I looked at my data and saw this:&lt;/p&gt;

The first one that was funded on Thursday was the awesome Invertebrates in my Tank project that will provide lots of kids with the opportunity to explore one of our favorite subjects: marine inverts! The Inverts in my Tank card is the 6 of Spades ‚Äî The Slipper Snail, Crepidula fornicata.Classification for the Atlantic Slippersnail  KingdomAnimalia  PhylumMollusca  ClassBivalvia  OrderOstreoida  FamilyPectinidae  GenusChlamys  SpeciesC. islandicaI pulled this card for several reasons. First it has the cutest little veliger larvae. Second, it is all over the place here in Long Island Sound. And lastly, it is a prime example of a reproduction strategy that is comparatively rare in the animal world in general, but much less so in molluscs: protandrous sequential hermaphroditism. You may recall Dr. M&amp;#39;s recent post, &amp;quot;Who likes protandric hermaphrodites?&amp;quot;, in which he described the strategy, while reporting new findings about Idas washingtonia, a deep-sea clam.Like I. washingtonia, the Atlantic Slippersnail (Crepidula fornicata), is a protandric sequential hermaphrodite. While they strongly resemble limpets externally, and are often called slipper limpets, they are indeed gastropods that are common inhabitants of the sub‚Äì to intertidal area of New England rocky coasts where they are often found in stacks, like the one pictured, from 3 to 20 individuals. Unfortunately, they are also an invasive species becoming all too common in areas outside its native range, where their filter feeding capabilities may negatively affect native and aquacultured filter feeding molluscs.As Dr. M described in his post, many protandrous sequential hermaphrodites change sex based on size. A prevailing theory (the size-advantage hypothesis) predicts that a species will change its sex at a particular size that allows the individual higher reproductive success. Generally, this means smaller Atlantic Slippersnails are males and larger ones are females. It is energetically expensive for females to produce large, energy‚Äìrich eggs. It is very common in the marine realm that older, larger females produce more eggs of larger size and higher quality with resultant higher success rates. For guys to produce sperm is a comparatively inexpensive expenditure of energy. Even a wee lad can produce enough sperm of suitable quality to reproduce successfully. (Whether or not a female will have him, of if his sperm can out compete a larger male&amp;#39;s sperm, is a different issue.)C. fornicata follows this trait ‚Äî for the most part. When the planktonic veliger larvae metamorphose and settle to the bottom, they are attracted to chemical cues produced by the adults. This guides most settling juveniles to land on, or very near, existing individuals or stacks. They then make their way (ever slowly) to the top of the stack and mature into young males. In paternity studies the oldest, largest males (sometimes the same size as females) are responsible for the majority of the viable larvae from females in the stack (upwards of 83% of larvae coming from one father). Younger males further up the stack do have some successes, though, and the more males (and more larger males) in a stack the more sperm competition appears to play a significant role in each individual&amp;#39;s success and the less dominant the dominant male becomes. At a certain point these large dominant males may be better off as females sharing the reproductive success among a few females instead of many highly competitive males.If a settling juvenile misses the chemical cues or for some other reason does not stack onto an existing individual or group, it will mature through a very brief male phase then become female, hopefully attracting juveniles from the next batch to settle on to it. Given that there are solitary (small) post settlement females and that some older males in a stack are as big as their female stackmates, size is clearly not the sole cue for sex change in C. fornicata. There is some plasticity in the change and social interaction appears to play a strong role on the size of the individual undergoing sex change.You can probably see why sequential hermaphroditism is such an interesting area of study. There are several general hypotheses, but there are also so many individual variations on those general themes, that it seems we will never run out of study material!And now a word for our Challenge this monthIf you have contributed to the Oceans in the Classroom Challenge - Thank you so much!! These posts and previews are for you! You have helped the Ocean Bloggers make a difference in at least 300 kids&amp;#39; lives. (More considering many projects have reusable multi-year assets!)If you have not yet given to the Donors Choose Oceans in the Classroom Challenge, please consider giving today. I know times are tough. I am a grad student with a family to feed. Believe me, I get how tough it is. Still every amount is welcome and appreciated. For my family&amp;#39;s donation it means I have to brown bag it for two weeks. But you know, that&amp;#39;s a small price to pay in exchange for knowing that we are exposing hundreds of kids to the science of the ocean. There is even a kindergarten class project in there - Commotion in the Ocean. Talk about a great time to open a kid&amp;#39;s mind to the ocean and science!! If 25 readers give just $10 each, we&amp;#39;ll help a dedicated young teacher expose 18 high poverty area kindergarten kids to science and the ocean.There is a chance, still, to get an additional $2,000 dollars of matching finds donated by HP, but it will only happen if we can get to $2,000 donated from the Ocean Bloggers readers today. It won&amp;#39;t be easy, but it&amp;#39;s a great chance to really increase our impact! Please give to the Challenge!ReferencesProestou DA, Goldsmith MR, &amp;amp; Twombly S (2008).

Crumb&lt;/a&gt;.¬† Creator of Fritz the Cat and Mr. Natural, Crumb worked out his neuroses in public (see the movie &lt;em&gt;Crumb&lt;/em&gt; for the backstory), becoming immensely popular among hippies having a penchant for the grotesque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crumb has now become pretty mainstream, publishing his newer pieces in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;and showing his work in galleries, where it fetches high prices.¬† His latest production is an illustrated book of the Bible, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Genesis Illustrated&lt;/em&gt;. It‚Äôs reviewed in&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/books/review/Hajdu-t.html?ref=books"&gt; today‚Äôs New York Times &lt;/a&gt;by David Hadjou, a professor at Columbia University‚Äôs School of Journalism and music critic for &lt;em&gt;The New Republic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn‚Äôt the Crumb you‚Äôd expect from his earlier work in Zap Comics.¬† Crumb does it straight, without exaggerated grotesqueries, women with large rumps, or the like.¬† A sample is below, and you can see another &lt;a href="http://documents.nytimes.com/excerpt-the-book-of-genesis-illustrated-by-r-crumb#p=1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.¬† I‚Äôve seen larger excerpts, and clearly Crumb has made a serious effort to turn the Bible into graphic art rather than a religiously-themed comic. ¬† Dismissing the book &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; as a mockery of religion is a big mistake. As Hadjou says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crumb‚Äôs book is serious and, for Crumb, restrained. He resists the temptation to go all-out Crumb on us and exaggerate the sordidness, the primitivism and the outright strangeness (by contemporary standards) of parts of the text. What is Genesis about, after all, but resisting temptation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadjou goes on to praise the book. But at the end of his review he can‚Äôt resist one little zinger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all its narrative potency and raw beauty, Crumb‚Äôs ‚ÄúBook of Genesis‚Äù is missing something that just does not interest its illustrator: a sense of the sacred. What Genesis demonstrates in dramatic terms are beliefs in an orderly universe and the godlike nature of man. Crumb, a fearless anarchist and proud cynic, clearly believes in other things, and to hold those beliefs ‚Äî they are kinds of beliefs, too ‚Äî is his prerogative. Crumb, brilliantly, shows us the man in God, but not the God in man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always helps to truckle to the faithful ‚Äî something that‚Äôs becoming house policy at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, I was a bit disappointed by Crumb‚Äôs book, not because it‚Äôs not engrossing or artistic, but because when I read a book, whether it be &lt;em&gt;Genesis&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Middlemarch&lt;/em&gt;, I always conjure up visual¬† ‚Äî and auditory ‚Äî images of the scene. (Think about this when you‚Äôre reading a novel.¬† Are you imagining what things &lt;em&gt;look like&lt;/em&gt;?) And, as expected, my images and sounds never comport with those of other people.¬† That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt like the movie &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; (Gollum was pretty faithful to my imagination, but the depilated, rarely-hungry hobbits let me down), and thought that the animated versions of &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; were dire (Charlie Brown didn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; right).¬† And, it‚Äôs still the Bible, so Crumb‚Äôs imagination, so wild and bizarre in his earlier pieces, is constrained by a text that we already know well. ¬† In the end, I can‚Äôt imagine who Crumb saw as his audience for this book.¬† I doubt that it will be bought by the faithful, although it‚Äôs currently &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-Genesis-Illustrated-R-Crumb/dp/0393061027"&gt;#8 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and reviewer Greta Christina considers it &lt;a href="http://www.alternet.org/belief/143396/an_atheist%27s_review_of_the_book_of_genesis_illustrated_by_a_legendary_comics_artist/?page=entire"&gt;a ‚Äúmust-read‚Äù for atheist&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

As expected, of course, some Christians are upset about this. Their reaction is no surprise. The inanity of their reaction is also no surprise. For a beautiful example of a truly stupid response, &lt;a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2009/10/24/hannity-god-ad/"&gt;you can rely on Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine the outrage if a Christian group put pro-God ads in the New York City subways? What outrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine it, because as that link points out, there have been multitudes of pro-God ads there for years. I was also familiar with seeing them all over the place in the Philadelphia subways when I lived there, and I can describe perfectly the &amp;quot;outrage&amp;quot; they generated. Look in a mirror, roll your eyes, and sigh‚Ä¶that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That link also points out that Sean Hannity doesn't know, because he never rides the NY subway system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the Arizona COR video. Watch that and imagine Sean Hannity's outrage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the poor guy has been publicly spanked. The NY Times published short letters of rebuttal from &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/books/review/Letters-t-THEFACTOFEVO_LETTERS.html?_r=1"&gt;Dan Dennett and Philip Kitcher&lt;/a&gt;, and then published online &lt;a href="http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/letters-scientists-respond-to-our-review-of-richard-dawkinss-greatest-show-on-earth/"&gt;another dozen letters&lt;/a&gt;. That last link is more of a mixed bag, with some good replies and some strangely skewed ones‚Ä¶but it&amp;#39;s all fun anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all the letters are necessarily short.

With all the anti-vaccination craziness out there, I was worried no one would show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, no need to worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend went yesterday and waited for four hours with thousands of other people.  From a public health perspective, perhaps it would have been better to have multiple smaller centers to avoid exposure, but people did not wait inside in crowded rooms, but outside in the wind.  That's probably better, but who knows.  At a time when mass vaccination is needed, and the public health infrastructure of this country is a chaotic hodge-podge of local, state, and federal institutions, it's amazing anyone gets a vaccine on time at all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm happy the first round of vaccination was popular, not so happy that we had to crowd thousands of people together during a pandemic to do it.  Still, it's a net good---people crowd anyway, and if they do it for vaccination, great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the anti-vaxers may be loud, but the public doesn't seem to be lapping it up.  If we are very, very lucky, we may be able to blunt this pandemic a bit.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/10/good_newsbad_news_long_lines_f.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/0GOjQ8YGMMk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256490391862"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=17576">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c406142fa6a3c558</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Advertising"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Those Offensive Atheist Billboards</title><published>2009-10-25T16:56:51Z</published><updated>2009-10-25T16:56:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/25/those-offensive-atheist-billboards/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atheistcartoons.com/?p=1850"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.atheistcartoons.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/thesign1.jpg" title="OffensiveAtheistAd" width="500" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a no-win situation if atheists are trying to make peace with certain Christians.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the ads evoke outrage in some areas.  The ads get media coverage.  All of it helps let other atheists know they‚Äôre not alone out there, and that‚Äôs the value and beauty of all the advertising campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disney is offering a full refund to anyone who bought a Baby Einstein DVD between 2004 and 2009 and who is not satisfied. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The move comes after a consumer group threatened to sue because it didn‚Äôt believe the educational DVDs for infants have any effect on intellect. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/children_shealth/6425271/Disney-offers-millions-of-parents-Baby-Einstein-video-refunds.html"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Baby Einstein line of videos, flashcards, books and DVDs, which also    include Baby Mozart, Baby Shakespeare and Baby Galileo spin-offs, is    estimated to be worth more than ¬£120 million a year in Britain and the US,    where it represents 90 per cent of the baby media market. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs ‚ÄòBaby Einstein‚Äô? Or more accurately, what &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; it based upon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, take a look at a study of college students and a test on whether Mozart‚Äôs music could create a lasting increase in IQ - just a quick hit on the &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/mozart.html"&gt;Skeptic‚Äôs Dictionary, you can soon see how it was debunked&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the studies were extrapolated to extend to babies - even though minimal beneficial effect on the adults was only on average ten to fifteen minutes! The possibility of negative rather than beneficial effects exists too - &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1650352,00.html"&gt;a delay in language development in children is one purported factor.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/children_shealth/6425271/Disney-offers-millions-of-parents-Baby-Einstein-video-refunds.html"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; article also reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aric Sigman, a psychologist and author of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remotely Controlled, a book    about how television is ruining lives, welcomed Disney‚Äôs offer: ‚ÄúThis    is a really important symbolic act by a multinational company,‚Äù he    said. ‚ÄúIt shows what many of us have been saying for a long time, that    the virtual life cannot beat real life when it comes to language acquisition    in children. None of these videos or educational TV shows, including those    on the BBC, can rival or supplant babies talking and listening to parents.‚Äù &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, other research done since hasn‚Äôt been able to replicate the study‚Ä¶ although I recently found a M.Ed proposal at my University which planned to replicate it. I didn‚Äôt, however, find a final, completed degree on the topic. When flipping through the proposal, I noticed how light it was on science papers in general, delving more on how music was a popular extra-curricular activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the popularity of the notion of these classical CDs being so useful in an educational setting that the Governor of Georgia and even Florida required classical music being played to toddlers - I recall my own head of department at a school lauding the notion that we should play ‚ÄòBaroque music‚Äô to students, even though I kept asking ‚Äò‚Ä¶ what for?‚Äô&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurotopia (Version 2.0)&lt;/strong&gt; have a great blog entry called ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2008/12/einstein_was_smart_but_could_h.php"&gt;Einstein was smart, but could he play the violin?&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù which looks at the paper on PLos: Forgeard et al., 2008 - ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Practicing a musical instrument in childhood is associated with enhanced verbal ability and nonverbal reasoning&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the question is: did they do me any good? Does playing ‚ÄòBaby Mozart‚Äô really do anything, and is anything achieved by starting your child on Suzuki when they are 2, other than the pain and misery of your child, and possibly an eventual love of music? Can it, perhaps, make me SMARTER?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the whole blogpost to see how the difference between just listening and actually playing is studied, and what the unanswered questions are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the Mozart Effect, if you‚Äôd like to know more about how the claims of ‚ÄòBaby Einstein‚Äô products were successfully challenged (my earlier blog post on &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/03/skeptical-books-babies-and-einstein-dont-do-dvds/"&gt;Babies and Einstein Don‚Äôt Do DVDS&lt;/a&gt;) -¬† &lt;a href="http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/news/playingdice.htm"&gt;Commercial Free Childhood&lt;/a&gt; reported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚Ä¶While we were washing dishes, taking showers, checking e-mail, our budding baby Einsteins were glued to a video, as indispensible as diapers and bottles. ‚Ä¶ At one point, it was estimated one in three American children had watched a Baby Einstein video, or one of the competing products, such as So Smart and Brainy Baby and Baby Prodigy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How could we have been so gullible?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just last week, Baby Einstein stopped billing its videos as educational, following a formal complaint from a U.S. advocacy group that the Disney-owned company was making ‚Äúfalse and deceptive‚Äù claims that it can give babies a leg up in learning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚Ä¶The company removed promotional claims such as the one saying the Baby Wordsworth DVD ‚Äúfosters the development of your toddler‚Äôs speech and language skills‚Äù and Numbers Nursery will ‚Äúhelp develop your baby‚Äôs understanding of what numbers mean.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it‚Äôs not going to nor can it guarantee you‚Äôll be smarter, get you more attention at pre-school or even ensure a future as ‚Äòthe kid most likely to reform ABBA‚Äô. But at least now you know that Disney will give your parents their money back.&lt;/p&gt;

Why? Because they had reprinted journalist Simon Singh‚Äôs article about chiropractic, which said that in the UK they were making bogus claims about how chiropractic can cure all manners of ills such as asthma and colic in babies, when it‚Äôs been shown it cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got that? This chiropractor, Joseph Ierano, complained against them because of someone else‚Äôs article! Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/announcements/chiropractors-complaint-against-australian-skeptics-dismissed/"&gt;the HCCC just told the Skeptics they have dismissed the complaint&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôd love to report that, amidst howls of laughter, they said that Ierano‚Äôs complaint has no merit, his arguments were totally wrong, and not only has chiropractic &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=59"&gt;been shown in many studies to have no efficacy against diseases like colic and asthma&lt;/a&gt;, it in fact &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=316"&gt;can be a very dangerous practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, however, it was dismissed because the Australian Skeptics group is not a health care provider, and is therefore not in the jurisdiction of the HCCC. So it was a technicality. That‚Äôs still good news, since the AS is not in any trouble, but as they say in that link above, they wish this could‚Äôve been used by the HCCC as a larger scale means to investigate and publicly discuss the inefficacy of chiropractic in these cases. Too bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a lot of publicity coming from this whole thing, since the British Chiropractic Association sued Simon Singh for libel due to his original article, instead of simply providing evidence that their claims were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; bogus (and when they finally did try to support chiropractic, their claims were woefully off-target). &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/04/the-peculiar-case-of-simon-singh/"&gt;The blogosphere erupted with support for Singh&lt;/a&gt;, as did a lot of mainstream press soon thereafter. A very cynical eye indeed has been turned to the practice of chiropractic of late. It‚Äôs long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I have read ‚Äî including studies done by doctors as discussed in such books as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trickortreatment.com/"&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Science-Ben-Goldacre/dp/000728487X/?tag=bs0b-21"&gt;Bad Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî chiropractic‚Äôs only claim for helping is that there is some marginal evidence it can relieve lower back problems, but that‚Äôs it. It doesn‚Äôt cure toothaches, or anything carried by germs, or really anything else (excluding the placebo effect, which can be provided in any of number of other ways that don‚Äôt involve actual physical manipulation). And when the neck is manipulated, chiropractic can have serious side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a health care practitioner, but with what I know now, I would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; go to a chiropractor. Some of them may understand the limitations of their practice, but clearly far too many do not. If you have some sort of health issue, go to your board-certified physician and ask them what they think of alternative practices, and ask them to be blunt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre talking about your &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; here, folks. Don‚Äôt hand it over to someone who may not have a clear grasp of what their so-called alternative medicine can ‚Äî and cannot ‚Äî do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256488456942"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/todays_sunday_bible_reading_ez.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7ba69dca1fdcaaf1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Today's Sunday Bible Reading Ezekiel 25:17</title><published>2009-10-25T17:17:04Z</published><updated>2009-10-25T17:17:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/Y8w1qq2DU7Y/todays_sunday_bible_reading_ez.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/todays_sunday_bible_reading_ez.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Fd4VSkj0Wks%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But they tend to accumulate and can actually fill up your hard drive.  Most Linux distros have automatic log file management for common system logs, but if you are running something on your server that keeps a log not thusly covered, you may have to manage that log file by yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could have a cron entry that simply deletes the log files in question every week or so, but then you lose the benefits of having a log file to begin with.

And (returning to phonology) Julian Bradfield (who normally studies things like fixpoint logic and concurrent programming, and teaches operating systems and programming, in Edinburgh's &lt;a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/"&gt;School of Informatics&lt;/a&gt;) gave a &lt;a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/events/lcircle/abs/bradfield09.html"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; on the phonology and phonetics of the utterly spectacular Khoisan language sometimes known as "Taa" but more usually referred to (at least by those who can pronounce the voiceless postalveolar velaric ingressive stop [k!] followed by a high tone [o] and a nasalized [o], which Julian can) as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taa_language"&gt;!X√≥√µ&lt;/a&gt; (the ASCII spelling is !Xoon).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This language, Julian quietly remarked, &amp;quot;knocks Dinka into a cocked hat&amp;quot; ‚Äî by which he meant that the Nilotic languages of the Dinka group, such as Thok Reel, have less complex systems of vowel contrasts (despite the 3-way length contrasts of Dinka et al.). Vowels in !X√≥√µ can be plain, murmured, pharyngealized, epiglottalized, or nasalized, and some of the vowels can combine some of these effects.  There seem to be at least 31 vowel phonemes in the East !X√≥√µ dialect. Plus !X√≥√µ has a consonant system so world-famously complex that its very existence suggests there is something wrong with our phonological theories.  And Julian suggested a way to reduce the apparent complexity very dramatically. It was exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Linguistics and English Language program of which I am the head advertised what we believe may be the first job in the history of the world to be explicitly advertised as &lt;a href="http://linguistlist.org/jobs/get-jobs.cfm?JobID=69760&amp;amp;SubID=234094"&gt;Lecturer in Language Evolution&lt;/a&gt;. Yet more excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all so exciting that I was almost reluctant to throw my things into a suitcase and rush to the airport on a trip to Washington DC, where I am now.  About 17 hours from Edinburgh (one on the plane to Heathrow; many hours of waiting around in Heathrow&amp;#39;s Terminal 5 sneaking laptop power from unobserved electrical outlets near gates with no current flight departure; seven hours on the plane to Dulles Airport; much waiting in chaotic baggage area) was decidedly dull compared to being back at work.  Though when I got out of customs and immigration at Dulles, there was one thing that happened that was sort of exciting, in fact almost sort of creepy‚Ä¶  I wish I had time to tell you about it.  Maybe later on, OK?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/oct/23/richard-dawkins-teenagers-illustrated-book"&gt;finally have more details&lt;/a&gt; about what that book will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Due out in autumn 2011, &lt;em&gt;What is a Rainbow, Really?&lt;/em&gt; will take on topics including who the first man and first woman were, why there are seasons, what the sun is, how old the world is and why there are so many animals, first answering the questions with myth and legend, and then with ‚Äúlucid scientific explanations‚Äù.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I remember seeing something like that at the Creation Museum this past summer‚Ä¶:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/photo-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/photo-1.jpg" alt="photo-1" title="photo-1" width="550" height="733"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm guessing Dawkins‚Äô book will be just a bit more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad the title leaves something to be desired.  (Though it does sound like something Dawkins would say‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.richarddawkins.net/articleComments,4492,Transworld-Acquires-A-New-Book-By-Richard-Dawkins-,UPDATE-Press-Release---booktradeinfo,page1#426477"&gt;Says Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
‚ÄúOf course that is not my title. It was just the title of the sample CHAPTER that Dave McKean and I showed to the publishers. Somebody, somewhere, decided to make that the ‚Äòworking‚Äô title of the whole book. As for the real title, that will require much discussion and agonizing. Suggestions welcome.&lt;br&gt;
Richard‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book‚Äôs illustrator will be &lt;strong&gt;Dave McKean&lt;/strong&gt;, who‚Äôs previously worked with &lt;strong&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/strong&gt;.  It‚Äôll be published by Transworld, part of the Random House Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No word yet on what Dawkins‚Äô advance is, but like his other works, this is sure to be a popular seller so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see something in the million-dollar-or-more range.&lt;/p&gt;

But it is uncommon &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/a_merger_in_the_offing_for_big.php"&gt;when those corporations are church denominations&lt;/a&gt;. The Catholic Church is in talks with the Anglican Church to essentially buy them out. This may have something to do with a growing schism in the Anglican Church wherein conservative reactionaries aren‚Äôt happy with the church‚Äôs liberalizing its policies on women and gays, I think particularly that the church is acknowledging their rights to exist. So who better to unite with against this common enemy of women and gays than the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;

You think you have everything you ever wanted, every consumer good imaginable and then something pops up and you are left open-mouthed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I felt recently when I came across (no pun intended) &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/10/femimint-hygiene-mints"&gt; vagina fresheners&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I‚Äôm afraid you read that right. Mints that feed into the Va-jay-jay to give it a tangy flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve linked before to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090928172536.htm"&gt;this study &lt;/a&gt;which shows that having a low opinion of one‚Äôs fanny-fu-far is bad for women‚Äôs sexual health (for Americans: fannies are ladies front-bottoms and we snigger whenever you use the word, heh). And yet we have to put up with jokes about fishy smells and frankly creepy, unnecessary products designed to feed off women‚Äôs insecurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as poonanie mints people have invented &lt;a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3948257.html"&gt;deordorising tampons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.summerseve.com/Spray.asp"&gt;vaginal deodorant &lt;/a&gt;(is it just me or do fragrances called 'tropical rain' and 'island splash' seem inappropriate?), &lt;a href="http://pointlessbanter.net/2009/09/02/vaginal-wipe-disgusting-or-thoughtful/"&gt;wipes &lt;/a&gt;(links to blog asking if vag wipes are a sign of politeness) and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/obstetrics_gynaecology_and_contraception/A626910.aspx"&gt;douching &lt;/a&gt;(this is a link to the Science Museum, ftmfw). All of these things are invented and marketed to make you feel like you need something other than soap and water to be clean and healthy. You don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This impacts on women‚Äôs health because if they always think that the pink clink stinks then they are less likely to notice changes which may signify infection or seek help and advice (similarly &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090629100643.htm"&gt;vibrator use &lt;/a&gt;actually increases sexual health). Plus being self-conscious of your wookie effects your enjoyment of oral sex which instead should be savoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing peculiarly smelly about women‚Äôs bits. Any enclosed area that gets sweaty gets wiffy ‚Äì male as well as female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back off with the fish jokes, everyone knows the hairy clam tastes of milk and honey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That guru's name is James Arthur Ray. ¬†I had never heard of Mr. Ray until a couple weeks ago when reading news of deaths in a sweat lodge incident at a New Age spiritual retreat in Sedona, Arizona. ¬†That incident had resulted in 18 injuries requiring hospitalization and the deaths of two people. One of the injured lay in a coma at a hospital in Flagstaff due to multiple organ damage and would later succumb to those injuries for a total of three deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Ray is notably one of the principle teachers behind "The Secret", a 2007 film and bestselling book by Rhonda Byrne which asserts that the key to personal success is in harnessing a set of mysterious universal laws, including the infamous "Law of Attraction." Ray leads his own organization, "James Ray International", which sells books and hosts events centered around his teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;One of those events is the annual 5-day "Spiritual Warrior" retreat which costs many of its participants over $9,000 to attend. ¬†That may seem like a steep price for a retreat, but because Ray preaches that one "gets what they give" the $9,000 is likely seen by its participants as a bargain towards meeting one's personal goals.</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Reed Esau)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256446960420"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/the_open_laboratory_2009_-_the_44.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/24a92f21184368a8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="OpenLab09"/><title type="html">The Open Laboratory 2009 - the submissions so far</title><published>2009-10-25T04:57:16Z</published><updated>2009-10-25T04:57:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/ylCJrxJvvwU/the_open_laboratory_2009_-_the_44.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/the_open_laboratory_2009_-_the_44.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="OpenLab logo.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/OpenLab%20logo.jpg" width="448" height="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This application, US Patent Application 20090265214, is titled Advertisement in Operating System, and covers exactly what the title implies; namely an operating system that is capable of displaying a variety of advertisements to users. You are likely to have heard of the first listed inventor, Steven Jobs, the CEO and co-founder of Apple Computer, Inc. While it is difficult to know the purpose and strategy behind a patent application, the attorneys at Fish &amp;amp; Richardson in Minneapolis, Minnesota, who drafted and filed the patent application certainly did a very good job describing just about every conceivable feature and alternative that could coincide with the displaying of advertisements to users of an operating system. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On that date, us ‚Äòmuricans will set our clocks back an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those in Europe, though, European Summer Time ends now. I‚Äôm writing this at 18:00 my time, which is already past midnight in England. At 01:00 you set your clocks back an hour. I have checked some online clocks, and they are confused ‚Äî or maybe I am, who knows ‚Äî on what time it is right now. So my advice is to wait a while. Of course, since it‚Äôs late there, by the time you read this it‚Äôll most likely be Sunday morning.  So when you wake up and read this, make sure you set your clocks accordingly. That‚Äôll make it easy on everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not interesting&lt;/strong&gt;: The poll was crashed by atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not interesting&lt;/strong&gt;: Atheists won, and the poll overwhelmingly swung in our favor (Most respondents said, ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù God doesn‚Äôt exist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2695559/Theres-no-God-say-96-in-web-poll-sting.html?OTC-RSS&amp;amp;ATTR=News"&gt;This is news to anybody&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
More than 88,000 responded to the posters and adverts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But embarrassingly the poll on the Christian website backfired with a massive &lt;strong&gt;96 PER CENT&lt;/strong&gt; insisting there was no God ‚Äì and only three per cent saying they did believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha chiefs last night blamed a web sting for the response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesman Mark Elsdon-Dew added: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is indicative of people‚Äôs faith in this country.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the accuracy factor may be off‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I‚Äôll settle for the amusement factor.&lt;/p&gt;

Crudely speaking, our actions can be divided into those that are automatic and driven by the environment and those that are initiated volitionally, as an act of will. In an intriguing new study, Todd Horowitz and colleagues claim to have recorded the relatively sluggish time taken for free will to be enacted. Their finding could help explain our natural tendency to search visual scenes via apparently random, haphazard attentional shifts, rather than using our conscious will to search more strategically. The fact is, our volitional control is simply too slow, rendering a deliberate, ordered approach ineffective.The researchers found that deliberately controlling eye movements when searching for a particular image in our field of vision takes about three times as long as letting the same process happen &amp;#39;automatically&amp;#39;. The conscious mind is thus not only limited in terms of capacity, but it is also a lot slower than automatic control. We save a lot of energy and time by processing most sensory information on a subconscious level - but this creates complications for understanding ourselves and the social world. As a political scientist interested in psychology, I immediately wonder how much processing of political cues (broadly understood) goes entirely unnoticed by us. More importantly, in what ways does this efficient, automatic processing impact our conscious thought processes about political issues? Maybe we &amp;#39;feel&amp;#39; what our preferred answer to a political question is and then move to justify it with tailor-made theories, just as we tend to do for moral decisions? There are so many interesting questions here...Horowitz TS, Wolfe JM, Alvarez GA, Cohen MA, &amp;amp; Kuzmova YI (2009). The speed of free will.

CFI‚Äôs own Independent Investigations Group (IIG) is going strong, attracting new members including myself and working on up to a dozen applications for their own $50,000 dollar challenge. The up-coming issue of The Skeptical Inquirer will feature a four page spread¬†on¬†the IIG. Reading it will hopefully start a firestorm of new investigative teams that also want to make a difference. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It‚Äôs like Hollywood Squares for crackpots. I have spent a good part of my life performing the kind of things these cuckoos are attempting to foist off as real, so most of it is just another bad magic act to me. Still, I‚Äôm amazed at the line up of ‚Äútalent.‚Äù Such things as using a ‚Äúsender‚Äù and receiver‚Äù to identify playing cards goes at least as far back as the 1840‚Äôs and a Scottish guy¬†named¬†John Henry Anderson; ‚ÄúThe Wizard of the North.‚Äù¬†CFI‚Äôs so-called paranormal applicants might as well be doing the Bra Trick. That routine would certainly be more colorful and entertaining than some of the claims being pitched to the IIG.¬†If you think the latest ‚ÄúBalloon Boy‚Äù incident shows how desperate people can be to get attention, watch out‚Ä¶¬†that fiasco was¬†only the tip of the iceberg. Expect to see lots of other people stepping up to the plate. There are more starving crazies out there in woo-land than¬†ever before and after talking to a few of the IIG crew, many of us agreed that &lt;em&gt;we are indeed in &lt;strong&gt;The Golden Age¬†of the Con. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:430px"&gt;&lt;img title="IIG" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/IIG1.jpg" alt="That&amp;#39;s me second from the left, second row from the front at a recent IIG meeting." width="420" height="225"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s me second from the left, second row from the front at a recent IIG meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting I attended last Saturday, there were more than enough investigations to keep¬†my mentalist¬†mind overwhelmed for the three and a half hour meeting. With over¬†40 people in attendance, many of whom I was happy to say are¬†not only¬†bright, enthusiastic and¬†vocal, but also ready to hit the streets for the skeptical cause. The¬†existence of a ¬†powerful hands -on group that I had no idea was¬†already working &lt;strong&gt;Ambush Skepticism&lt;/strong&gt; was quite impressive to listen to and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without spilling any of the beans that are being lined up, I think I can safely say without compromising the goals set that everything from therapeutic and healing touch, UFO contacts, x-ray vision, dowsing, telepathy, aura reading and several other completely over-the-top claims are all on the boards not just for serious investigation, but counter attack in-your-face interventions as well. It was inspiring¬†to see that many in the group have already staged some strong &lt;strong&gt;Guerrilla Skepticism&lt;/strong&gt; events, stings and public demonstrations showing clearly what can be done if you have¬†a little¬†nerve and willpower to stand up and make a noise. I‚Äôm looking forward to putting my own talents to good use with this committed task force. If you think skeptics are sitting around wringing their hands and whining, ‚Ä¶think again. These folks are damn serious about doing something and doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:430px"&gt;&lt;img title="IIGII" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/IIGII.jpg" alt="Chatting about woo with the CFI." width="420" height="264"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatting about woo with the CFI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;With Bernie Madoff¬†on one end of the criminal spectrum and Sylvia Browne still hanging around at the other, we can all look forward to a lot of hard work if we are to pull America out of the grip of real economic terrorism. Where &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;all that money go Bernie? Can you say 50 billion? I would need more space than this blog line could handle to put in all the zeroes needed to cover all the money that‚Äôs gone missing in the last five years, and that‚Äôs not evencounting billions in cash that the Pentagon flew into Iraq straight from Federal Reserve vaults via military transports, and for which there has been little or no accounting. We‚Äôve been scammed. We are getting scammed right now and if we don‚Äôt at¬†least take a¬†shot at the lower rungs on the con artist ladder like Coffey, Browne and Lisa Williams, et al; we will have nothing to blame but ourselves when we see their ilk running for office in the next election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:140px"&gt;&lt;img title="images" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/images9.jpg" alt="Bernie: the Icon of The Con" width="130" height="78"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernie: the Icon of The Con&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;We can‚Äôt always expect to getin the court rooms or on the front lawns of the Big Guys who are out there taking the big chunks out of our¬†tax dollars and laughing their way to the bank, but with¬† ¬†local grassroots groups like IIG, people with vision and a need to¬†act up against the more accessible frauds we see daily on our street corners can be an effective way to start at the bottom and work up. Taking a stand works. I have seen the proof in IIG‚Äôs documented files. It‚Äôs happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Groups like CFI‚Äôs IIG are actually &lt;strong&gt;DOING SOMETHING &lt;/strong&gt;about the insane bizarro-world we are all trying to navigate our way through. They are notjusttalking the talk, they are actively walking the walk and they are coming to a street near &lt;em&gt;YOU&lt;/em&gt;¬† Mr. Coffey, Browne, Moon ‚Ä¶or whoever. This is no mere pipe-dream or idle threat. It‚Äôs a traveling reality show in the making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to Force One activities which are continuing, I‚Äôm again¬†pleading for everyone who has read or been involved with this blog to get up off their arses and get involved with something in your own community. We can‚Äôt wait for The Skeptologists any longer. That dog don‚Äôt hunt. As I have said; there‚Äôs no money in the truth. Money = Power and that‚Äôs the end of that tale. Take action or face the consequences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you see for yourself that there are crowds of like-minded individuals searching to¬†align themselves with people just like you, you will bond with an underground¬†movement that cannotbe seen on CNN or Fox¬†news. It‚Äôs growing like flowers in concrete¬†with anger, determination¬†and intention.¬†Plus this kind of activism is¬†fun too! Laughter is¬†good medicine. ¬†When you can laugh and see the humor in what‚Äôs passing for news and information these days and share those moments with others, it‚Äôs the beginning of a healthy healing process.¬†CFI also hosts a ‚ÄúSkepticalDrinking‚Äù¬†group at a local pub and the scene is looking like it‚Äôs getting too big for the room. People are getting rowdy and it looks like it could spill into the streets at any moment. Right on! If you aren‚Äôt already working with a group to irritate, subvert or downright squelch those¬†little pockets of nonsensical woo in your burg, there‚Äôs no better time to start one up of your own than right now.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AND BTW:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you don‚Äôt think that just one person can make a difference, think twice. The picture below shows Sterling Gerbic Forsyth, a young lad who with a few friends literally¬†&amp;amp;quot;took to¬†the streets&amp;amp;quot; to protest a Scientology fest last weekend. The Scientologists got so irritated that they found it necessary to throw rotten fish guts in the bushes near the protesters in a vain effort to keep them away. It didn‚Äôt work.¬† Yeah Sterling!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="STERLING" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/STERLING.jpg" alt="STERLING" width="221" height="166"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And More Good News:&lt;/strong&gt;Susan Gerbic-Forsyth, (Sterling‚Äôs mon) sent me the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI just noticed that &lt;strong&gt;Sylvia Browne‚Äôs &lt;/strong&gt;only support site is not listed when you search for her, nor is it coming up on the Wikipedia page.¬† It was gosylvia.com I think?¬† It was hosted ot Sylvia‚Äôs son Christopher‚Äôs girlfriend (who is totally supported by Sylvia and also¬†gives readings for half the price).¬† I wonder if the girlfriend and Christopher have broken up?¬† Or maybe they just got tired of deleting all the negative comments from their forum. Maybe banning people who spoke out against Sylvia was just too time consuming? From Robert Lancaster‚Äôs site: &lt;a href="http://www.stopsylvia.com"&gt;www.stopsylvia.com&lt;/a&gt;: Both pro-Sylvia sites are down.¬† I love the opening line of the second site‚Ä¶the only blog‚Ä¶to defend‚Ä¶Sylvia;¬† Love it!¬† The ONLY BLOG and it is no longer hosted! GoSylviaBrowne.com ‚Äì &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúAn online community devoted to sharing stories, validations and faith.‚Äù Evidently created in response to this site: In Sylvia‚Äôs Defense‚Ä¶ ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe only blog whose sole purpose is to defend the mission, message, and practices of a well-intentioned spiritual teacher, psychic Sylvia Browne. Because we‚Äôre all allowed a fair trial.‚Äù &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;So are we making a difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You bet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With the hypothesis of autism being caused by the MMR vaccine alone or in combination with thimerosal in shambles (from the petitioners‚Äô point of view), she has motivation to search out another hypothesis of causation to bring before the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).&lt;/p&gt;

He holds a patent (US patent # 6,586,600) on benzenediethanethiol (BDT) environmental chelators, &lt;a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/169"&gt;one of which [N,N‚Äô-bis (2-mercaptoethyl)isophthalamide] &lt;/a&gt;is being marketed by Boyd Haley (also from the University of Kentucky) as &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/168/"&gt;‚ÄúOxidative Stress Relief‚Äù (OSR)&lt;/a&gt; and is touted to be a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for autism, specifically treating the putative mercury toxicity widely assumed (but never shown) to cause autism. Dr. Haley is marketing OSR as a ‚Äúdietary supplement‚Äù, even though it is not a substance found in food (or nature) and has not been adequately tested for safety as a drug. &lt;a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/fda_haley_osr_notification.pdf"&gt;The FDA has objected to this&lt;/a&gt;, but the DSHEA prevents them from being able to prevent Dr. Haley from marketing this¬†compound as a ‚Äúsupplement‚Äù, so long as he calls it a ‚Äúsupplement‚Äù.¬†Dr. Atwood‚Äôs role in the marketing of ‚ÄúOSR‚Äù is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;„ÄÄ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wakefield:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;A¬†British gastroenterologist who has published a¬†famous (infamous?)¬†&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; linking the measles vaccine strain (found in the MMR vaccine) to¬†autism. Unfortunately,¬†that hypothesis has not¬†been supported by independent data, with¬†his ‚Äúlandmark‚Äù¬†paper being marred by the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15016483"&gt;withdrawal &lt;/a&gt;of most (ten of thirteen) of the authors on that paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Facing a &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm#gmc"&gt;General Medical Council investigation&lt;/a&gt;¬† in the UK, Dr. Wakefield moved to the US, eventually settling at ‚ÄúThoughtful House‚Äù in Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the many of the authors‚Äô past history, it seems odd that this paper doesn‚Äôt mention the word ‚Äúautism‚Äù even once. That‚Äôs right - the word appears for the first time in the acknowlegments (in ‚ÄúAutism Research Institute‚Äù, one of their funding sources). Even with that apparent oversight, it seems apparent that the focus of this research¬†is probably¬†on linking hepatitis B vaccine ‚Äì with or without thimerosal ‚Äì to autism. So, now that we have a picture of most of the authors, let‚Äôs move on to the introduction of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction ‚Äì setting the stage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question the authors felt compelled to answer in their introduction was why they were studying thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine, given that this formulation hasn‚Äôt been available in the US since 2001. Their explanation was that thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines are still available in ‚Äúdeveloping countries‚Äù, where they are needed because refrigeration isn‚Äôt as widely available as in the US. This is an important question for the authors to answer, because their research is moot, otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;„ÄÄ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the study starts to show some ‚Äúquirks‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the authors don‚Äôt mention it, this study appears to be an extension of a study that has been underway for some time. It is amazingly similar to a study mentioned in a &lt;a href="http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2008/webprogram/Paper3028.html"&gt;2008¬†abstract&lt;/a&gt;. This is not - by itself - an issue; what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an issue is that while the number of treated animals remained the same (13) the number of control (untreated) animals¬†more than¬†doubled (from¬†3 to 7)¬†since that abstract and the number of reflexes tested went from 18 to 13 (see also &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/05/some_monkey_business_in_autism_research.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this could explain why the ‚Äúrandomization‚Äù and the control treatment in this study was so‚Ä¶.eccentric. The authors make an off-hand mention of the unusual way they randomized their subjects, calling it ‚Äúsemi-random‚Äù. The rhesus macaque infants were grouped into ‚Äúpeer groups‚Äù that were less than four weeks apart in age ‚Äì apparently sequentially. The infants were given either a thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine (they had to add the thimerosal themselves) or ‚Äì and here‚Äôs one of the¬†‚Äùquirky‚Äù parts ‚Äì either no injection or an injection of saline (control). In this paper, three of the control animals received no injection at all and four received a saline injection - further evidence that the additional control animals were added only &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the 2008 abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another¬†‚Äùquirky‚Äù part of the methods is their mention of each newborn being assessed by a ‚ÄúSimian APGAR‚Äù [sic] (NOTE: the ‚ÄúApgar‚Äù score was developed by Virginia Apgar, MD in 1952 ‚Äì the term is a proper name, not an acronym). This is odd because they never mention these Apgar scores again. Although they mention that the birth weights and gestational ages were similar between the treatment and control groups, they never, ever, mention the Apgar scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infant macaques were evaluated for¬†the time it took them to develop ceretain reflexes: root, snout, suck, auditory startle, grasp (hands and feet, since macaques can grasp with their feet), clasp (hands and feet), auditory orienting, visual orienting (near and far) and visual following (near and far) ‚Äì a total of thirteen reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final¬†‚Äùquirky‚Äù thing¬†about the methods is their choice of Laura Hewitson (‚ÄùLH‚Äù) to perform the neonatal assessments &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[NOTE: as a reader pointed out, the neonatal assessments were done by "L.A.H." rather than "L.H." - my bad for not noticing that "Lisa A. Houser" was the "L.A.H." in question]&lt;/span&gt;. By their own admission, ‚ÄúL.A.H.‚Äù has no prior training or education that would make her a good choice for this job. In fact, she required training to be able to carry out the assessments. Perhaps it would have been better to hire one of her trainers to carry out the evaluations ‚Äì this would have made the comparisons made at the beginning of the study comparable to those made later. As it was, we have no way of knowing where ‚ÄúL.A.H.‚Äù was on her ‚Äúlearning curve‚Äù when each group was assessed. This is critically important because it is pretty clear that a second control group was added much later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the authors devoted almost a full paragraph to describing ‚ÄúL.A.H.‚Äôs‚Äù training is indicative of how vulnerable they felt on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two important points to note before we leave the methods section - one is that the assessments were performed ‚Äú..always daily‚Ä¶‚Äù (an odd choice of words). Remember that ‚Äì ‚Äú‚Ä¶always daily‚Ä¶‚Äù. The second is that there were 13 reflexes studied in this study, where there were 18 reflexes studied in the 2008 abstract. These points will be important later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results ‚Äì the meat of the paper:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the authors emphasize that the birth weights and gestational ages of the treatment and control groups were similar. Once again, they fail to mention anything about the Simian Apgar scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups on only three (3) reflexes (root, p=0.004; suck, p=0.002 and snout, p=0.03) and claim that startle (p=0.11) and grasp hand (p=0.07) ‚Äúapproached significance‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, neither the methods nor the results mention any correction for multiple comparisons. After all, with a cutoff of p&amp;lt;=0.05 and 13 comparisons, there is a 48% probability that at least one of them will be ‚Äúpositive‚Äù (have a p-value less than 0.05) just by chance. If, in fact, they had originally looked at 18 reflexes, that probability rises to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then did Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of the results (see &lt;a href="http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/stsurvan.html#rcox"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a brief explanation) . This technique makes the assumptions that there is a proportionality between the ‚Äúhazard function‚Äù (the mathematical function that describes the ‚Äúhazard rate‚Äù) and the log-linear function of the independent variables (covariates). It also assumes that the relationship between the covariates and the hazard function does not depend on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cox analysis showed a relationship between exposure (to both hepatitis B vaccine and thimerosal, since they were administered together) and delayed root and suck reflexes, but not for snout. When they added gestational age as a covariate, they found a significant main effect of gestational age on visual follow far, which did not have a statistically significant independent difference between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, they found contributions of gestational age and ‚Äúexposure‚Äù to the differences they saw in the time to acquire the reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be a good time to discuss the reflexes themselves. Human infants generally have the same reflexes (although they aren‚Äôt as dexterous with their feet), most of them (esp root, snout, suck, startle and grasp) present at birth. In humans, they are collectively referred to as ‚Äúprimitive reflexes‚Äù. It seems odd that human infants, who are generally ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the newborns of other animal species in their acquisition of motor skills, should have these reflexes at birth when the macques do not. I would appreciate any input from people who have experience working with primates on what this might imply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table 2 gives the mean time-to-criterion (the time it took the infant macaques to meet the ‚Äúcriterion‚Äù level of skill in that reflex) for all thirteen reflexes. One nit-picking detail I must point out is that even though the evaluations were done once a day, they show the results as means, using fractional days. This is deceptive (and very commonly done, yes I know) because it gives the impression of much higher precision than was attained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if one of the little macaques attained ‚Äúcriterion‚Äù in their suck reflex an hour (or even a minute) after the evaluation, they would have been ‚Äúscored‚Äù as having taken a full day longer to reach ‚Äúcriterion‚Äù. This gives a particular ‚Äúgraularity‚Äù to the data and adds to the potential error. In the example given above, the difference between the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; time to reach ‚Äúcriterion‚Äù and the &lt;em&gt;measured&lt;/em&gt; time would be almost 24 hours - more if the interval between evaluations was longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another odd bit in this study is their graph of the results (figure 1), which shows that the evaluations were done¬†at irregular intervals and not as¬†described in the ‚Äúmethods‚Äù section (‚Äù‚Ä¶always daily‚Ä¶‚Äù). There were, in fact, several intervals that &lt;em&gt;exceeded&lt;/em&gt; 24 hours and also many¬†that were &lt;em&gt;less than&lt;/em&gt; 24 hours.¬†¬†It may just be that their description in the ‚Äúmethods‚Äù section was poorly worded, but it gives the impression of sloppy work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion ‚Äì explanations, rationalizations and excuses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll let you read the authors‚Äô discussion for yourself, but I will include a few ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;‚ÄúOur study design does not enable us to determine whether it is the vaccine per se, the exposure to Th [sic ‚Äì thimerosal], or a combination of both, that is causing the observed effects [note: absolutely true ‚Äì this is one of the main flaws of their design] None-the-less [sic], the developing brain is considered the most vulnerable organ to mercury exposure‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After admitting that they couldn‚Äôt distinguish between the vaccine and the thimerosal ‚Äì because of their own poor experimental design ‚Äì they turn right around and say, in essence, ‚ÄúBut we know it was the mercury‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;‚ÄúAlthough the basis for the effect of birth weight is not known, it is plausible that lower birth weight infants are more susceptible to what may be a dose-dependent toxicity of Th [sic ‚Äì thimerosal] or some other HB [sic ‚Äì hepatitis B] vaccine component, such as aluminum.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With absolutely no data to support this conjecture, the authors throw out aluminium as a potential vaccine-related toxin. It is important to note that there was no citation given to support this idea. It is telling that they do not consider what aspects of their study design might have led to these inexplicable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict of interest statement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most papers, this is pretty dry and uninteresting and as I‚Äôm not a person to ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/when_you_dismiss_every_scientific_study.php"&gt;dismiss out of hand&lt;/a&gt;‚Äú¬†a study because of potential conflicts of interest, I usually don‚Äôt give them a great deal of weight.¬†[section removed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[NOTE: as mentioned above, the neonatal assessments were performed by "L.A.H" - "Lisa A. Houser", so the conflict of interests statement is not incorrect, however much it may "whitewash" the previous actions by Drs. Wakefield and Scott.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;„ÄÄ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study raises more red flags than a Kremlin¬†May Day parade¬†in the old Soviet Union. It appears that control subjects were added &lt;em&gt;post hoc&lt;/em&gt; and that unproductive reflexes were dropped from the data. One of the authors ‚Äì the ‚Äúanchor‚Äù author ‚Äì has been implicated in research and ethical misconduct and is awaiting adjudication. Other authors have significant personal conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these are methodological problems. Apart from that,¬†the study also has some serious flaws in its conclusions - even if we assume their methods produced good data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there appears to be no attempt to correct for multiple comparisons. In fact - as mentioned above - there appears to have been an attempt to ‚Äúprune‚Äù the data set. Since I doubt that they would have eliminated data that supported their point, I can only surmise that these data were ‚Äúunproductive‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second ‚Äì and most fatal for this study ‚Äì is that there was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an increase in human infants who were late to suck, root, etc. following the introduction of neonatal hepatitis B vaccination in 1991. Given that the ‚Äúuptake‚Äù of this vaccine at birth was close to (and often exceeded) 90%, an effect of this magnitude would have been noted.¬†Nor is there a difference between the US ‚Äì which has continued hepatitis B vaccination at birth ‚Äì and the UK ‚Äì &lt;em&gt;which almost never gives the hepatitis B vaccine at birth&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äì in developmental delay or autism prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the authors ‚Äì or their supporters ‚Äì might argue that this delay would only be seen in a small number of human infants and so wouldn‚Äôt be seen against the background of the larger population. However, if &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; study could find a difference with only twenty subjects, it should be rampant in the general human population, if it is a real effect. Since the results of this study do not correlate to what we see in the human population - which has received the same exposure - it seems¬†unlikely that it is relevant to human infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this study was irrelevant from the moment it was published. At least, from a &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, from the perspective of people facing the demolition of their argument¬†that the MMR vaccine - with or without thimerosal - caused autism in their children, finding evidence - even spurious evidence - that a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; vaccine might be to blame could be &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; relevant. Could &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; be the explanation behind the study design and the curious¬†collection of authors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we‚Äôll know soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;

You think you have everything you ever wanted, every consumer good imaginable and then something pops up and you are left open-mouthed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I felt recently when I came across (no pun intended) &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/10/femimint-hygiene-mints"&gt; vagina fresheners&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I‚Äôm afraid you read that right. Mints that feed into the Va-jay-jay to give it a tangy flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve linked before to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090928172536.htm"&gt;this study &lt;/a&gt;which shows that having a low opinion of one‚Äôs fanny-fu-far is bad for women‚Äôs sexual health (for Americans: fannies are ladies front-bottoms and we snigger whenever you use the word, heh). And yet we have to put up with jokes about fishy smells and frankly creepy, unnecessary products designed to feed off women‚Äôs insecurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as poonanie mints people have invented &lt;a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3948257.html"&gt;deordorising tampons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.summerseve.com/Spray.asp"&gt;vaginal deodorant &lt;/a&gt;(is it just me or do fragrances called 'tropical rain' and 'island splash' seem inappropriate?), &lt;a href="http://pointlessbanter.net/2009/09/02/vaginal-wipe-disgusting-or-thoughtful/"&gt;wipes &lt;/a&gt;(links to blog asking if vag wipes are a sign of politeness) and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/obstetrics_gynaecology_and_contraception/A626910.aspx"&gt;douching &lt;/a&gt;(this is a link to the Science Museum, ftmfw). All of these things are invented and marketed to make you feel like you need something other than soap and water to be clean and healthy. You don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This impacts on women‚Äôs health because if they always think that the pink clink stinks then they are less likely to notice changes which may signify infection or seek help and advice (similarly &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090629100643.htm"&gt;vibrator use &lt;/a&gt;actually increases sexual health). Plus being self-conscious of your wookie effects your enjoyment of oral sex which instead should be savoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing peculiarly smelly about women‚Äôs bits. Any enclosed area that gets sweaty gets wiffy ‚Äì male as well as female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back off with the fish jokes, everyone knows the hairy clam tastes of milk and honey.&lt;/p&gt;

But it is still a very nice gesture for the &lt;a href="http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org"&gt;Military Religious Freedom Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been nominated for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who nominated them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The nominator of MRFF for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize is identified as a Senator from a foreign nation, which is an ally of the United States, and the only Christian legislator in the upper chamber of that country‚Äôs national parliament.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why were they nominated?  You can see &lt;a href="http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/press-releases/nobel_letter.html"&gt;the redacted letter&lt;/a&gt; sent to the Nobel committee here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a title="View Nobel Letter on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/21356987/Nobel-Letter" style="margin:12px auto 6px auto;font-family:Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:14px;line-height:normal;font-size-adjust:none;font-stretch:normal;display:block;text-decoration:underline"&gt;Nobel Letter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs one key excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the years since its founding, MRFF has been contacted, reached out to and retained by nearly 15,000 active duty United States marines, soldiers, sailors, airmen and veterans, 96% of whom, amazingly, are actually Christians of various denominations.  These Christian armed forces clients of MRFF find themselves targeted by power wielding fundamentalists, superior to them in the military chain of command, who do not consider Catholics or mainstream Protestants to be ‚Äútrue Christians.‚Äù  The remainder of MRFFs clients consists of a galaxy of non-Christian, religious minorities such as Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists, Wiccans, atheists and agnostics and many others.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can argue there are people and groups more deserving of the Nobel Prize, but it‚Äôs hard to deny the importance of a group that watches over improper use of religion in the armed forces.&lt;br&gt;

About 600 Anglican middle-managers are in talks with the Catholic Church to rip up their theological roots (which, it turns out, aren't all that important) and rejoin the old establishment. This could get interesting, since many of those Anglican priests are married; will Catholicism suddenly change course and allow a privileged subset of their priests enjoy sex? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has to wonder why so many Anglicans are suddenly jumping ship. It might be because Pope Palpatine has wonderful charisma, or because his mastery of the ways of the Force has compelled them to obey‚Ä¶but no, it&amp;#39;s neither of those things. Would you believe it&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8323607.stm"&gt;because the Anglicans are insufficiently misogynistic and homophobic&lt;/a&gt;? The Anglicans are considering opening up their church hierarchy to women and gays, and the cranky reactionary wing is &lt;i&gt;freaking out&lt;/i&gt; and threatening schism.  And realizing that woman-fearing, gay-hating old farts have a natural home in the bosom of the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a charming prospect: the Anglicans, already little more than a mild force for promoting weak tea in the world, will become even feebler, while the Catholics will become a little bit more evil with the absorption of the nastier elements of Anglicanism. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/a_merger_in_the_offing_for_big.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/NH8nYHPoH2I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256407996386"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MentalIndigestion/~3/iiQT9jgYYGQ/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d5d3b21813b4b9b1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Bug eat bug‚Ä¶</title><published>2009-10-24T12:14:40Z</published><updated>2009-10-24T12:14:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/wcqtS77Crv0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MentalIndigestion/~3/iiQT9jgYYGQ/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">AS if it‚Äôs not hard enough at the bottom of the food chain, being cannibalised by your own bottom-dwelling compatriots must add insult to injury.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methodolatry&lt;/em&gt;:  The profane worship of the randomized clinical trial as the only valid method of investigation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my readers have e-mailed me about a recent article in &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200911/brownlee-h1n1"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; by Shannon Brownlee and Jeanne Lenzer, two reporters whose particular bias is that we as a nation are "over treated." That may be true, although not to the extent that Brownlee, at least, seems to think, and her article on swine flu was truly execrable. Moreover, "methodalatry" perfectly describes one of my complaints about the "evidence-based medicine" paradigm. So I'm really glad that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/10/journalists_sink_in_the_atlant.php"&gt;revere took it on and demolished it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had actually planned on blogging about this article. However, it's a long article, with many, many shortcomings. The whole Suzanne Somers thing seemed to take on a life of its own and crowd out my chance at blogging the Brownlee article. I may have to rectify that situation for Monday. revere covered a lot, but he didn't cover one aspect of the article that bothered me even more in as much detail as I want to. On the other hand, he made my task easier by covering a lot of the issues of vaccine efficacy. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you might also want to read &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2040"&gt;Mark Crislip's article on flu vaccine efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, which, although not directly written in response to Brownlee's article, does address many of the shortcomings in its analysis of H1N1 vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_atlantic_methodolatry_and_pandemic_s.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/4KjftKzmgHE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256405829345"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/minnesotans_need_a_public_opti.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c32170eb4fa1b363</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Minnesotans Need A Public Option</title><published>2009-10-24T18:07:16Z</published><updated>2009-10-24T18:07:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/ar9GInbuNmI/minnesotans_need_a_public_opti.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/minnesotans_need_a_public_opti.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/minnesotans-need-a-public-option"&gt;So go sign the petition. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/minnesotans_need_a_public_opti.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/ar9GInbuNmI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256405829344"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/ufos_on_quiche_moraine.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f5cd0ddebcdbb849</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">UFO's on Quiche Moraine</title><published>2009-10-24T17:54:47Z</published><updated>2009-10-24T17:54:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/wff16FosLGM/ufos_on_quiche_moraine.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/10/ufos_on_quiche_moraine.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Among a certain class of people, the term "Rumsfeldian" is used to describe a style of leadership that prizes bureaucratic turf-protecting, dissent-quashing through barely concealed intimidation, an inflated sense of self-importance, and the inability to incorporate possible long-term consequences into the decision making process.  This class consists primarily of policy wonks, especially the left-leaning ones I interact with daily at the Humphrey Institute, and we are referring to former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.  There is, however, another context where you will hear "Rumsfeldian" being bandied about, and that is in conjunction with his famous quote during a press conference on Feb. 12th, 2002:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodolatry&lt;/strong&gt;:  The profane worship of the randomized clinical trial as the only valid method of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you have e-mailed me and other SBM bloggers about a recent article in &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200911/brownlee-h1n1"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; by Shannon Brownlee and Jeanne Lenzer, two reporters whose particular bias is that we as a nation are ‚Äúover treated.‚Äù That may be true, although not to the extent that Brownlee, at least, seems to think, and her article on swine flu was truly biased and painful to read. Moreover, ‚Äúmethodalatry‚Äù perfectly describes one of the complaints we at SBM have about the ‚Äúevidence-based medicine‚Äù paradigm. So I‚Äôm really glad that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/10/journalists_sink_in_the_atlant.php"&gt;revere took it on and demolished it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hero of &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; article, Tom Jefferson clearly has an agenda about flu vaccines. Indeed, he has such an agenda that he was invited to the National Vaccine Information Center‚Äôs vaccine conference in early October. The NVIC is the oldest and biggest antivaccine organization there is. Either he didn‚Äôt know that, in which case he‚Äôs clueless, or he didn‚Äôt care. In any case, it was clear that he was invited there because of his stance on flu vaccination, and he was even &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1723"&gt;going to be awarded the NVIC ‚ÄúCourage in Science‚Äù Award&lt;/a&gt;. To his credit, Jefferson backed out when he found out that he would be sharing the stage with Andrew Wakefield, who was to be given the NVIC ‚ÄúHumanitarian Award.‚Äù He was appropriately horrified. Still, he should never have accepted in the first place, given that the NVIC clearly wanted to coopt him and use his gadfly status to make its anti-vaccine stance seem reasonable and science-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs just one reason why I don‚Äôt take Tom Jefferson particularly seriously anymore. I tend to agree with revere that Jefferson is drifting perilously close to crank territory with respect to flu vaccines. Indeed, ‚Äúmethodolatry‚Äù is an awesome term to describe his approach. Actually, it‚Äôs a great term to describe some of the Cochrane scientists responsible for analyzing the efficacy of mammography screening, as well; their conclusions and methods rather remind me of Jefferson‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you might also want to reread (or read for the first time if you haven‚Äôt read it already) &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2040"&gt;Mark Crislip‚Äôs article on flu vaccine efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, which, although not directly written in response to Brownlee‚Äôs article, does address many of the shortcomings in its analysis of H1N1 vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should say that I have to give a kudo to the author for trying to set up a scientific experiment to see what would happen, but the experiment itself is so hopelessly flawed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact it‚Äôs so wrong it‚Äôs hard to know where to start. The lack of double blinding. The single blinding still being able to influence the testers. The fact that all the testers were believers, and able to influence each other. The starting supposition that a) homeopathy works, and 2) astrology works (when &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=50"&gt;neither&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html"&gt;does&lt;/a&gt;). A lack of clear results predicted so that conclusions (either negative or positive) could be drawn. The very subjective observations. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs clear from the article that the homeopath/astrologer means well, and is actually curious about all this. I wonder if there is any reliable way to take that curiosity, that well-meaning intention, and redirect it toward science? If there is ‚Äî besides slowly¬†and methodically banging the drum of reason ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to know. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people who believe in things like homeopathy and astrology and all that really are naturally curious, intelligent people, but somewhere down the line they strayed off the narrow path that winds its way through reality, and it would be nice to find a good way to nudge them back in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer usually goes like this:¬† ‚ÄúYes, many of the genes that would have been eliminated now persist.¬† I am myopic, and wouldn‚Äôt have been a good hunter. Genes for nearsightedness are undoubtedly accumulating in our species. So in some respects we are genetically degenerating. But so long as there are sources of mortality ‚Äî and the genetic variation to resist them ‚Äî we will continue to evolve.¬† In Africa, for instance, thousands of children die yearly from infectious diseases. It‚Äôs highly likely that genes for resistance to those diseases are becoming more numerous.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this answer is speculative, based on evolutionary theory.¬† There‚Äôs not a lot of evidence about whether and how fast the human species is changing.¬† But a new paper in &lt;em&gt;The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; goes one step further: it not only demonstrates genetic variation for sources of mortality, but shows that that variation is correlated with reproductive output.¬† If both of these hold, then we must be evolving.¬† The paper goes on to predict how much genetic change for several traits that &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; will experience over the next ten generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is by Byers et al. (see reference below), and should be online this week. (Thanks to Steve Stearns for letting me see a galley proof.)¬† There has already been a flurry of publicity ‚Äî one example is &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091019162933.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî and there will be more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample population included about 5,000 women from the famous ‚ÄúFramingham heart study,‚Äù a survey begun in 1948, with the individuals sampled every four years for a variety of physical and traits (weight, height, age at first reproduction, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, etc.).¬† Since the individuals measured are now on the senior side, the original sample population (now past reproduction) has produced their allotment of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us a basis for detecting natural selection.¬† The underlying rationale is that we look for a correlation between an individual‚Äôs traits and the number of children she produced.¬† If we find one, and there is genetic variation for the trait, we can reasonably assume that natural selection is acting on it, and we can see what type of natural selection by seeing how variation in the trait is associated with variation in offspring number.¬† If, for example, higher cholesterol is associated with lower reproductive output (as it might be if cholesterol is associated with heart disease that strikes before reproduction is finished), then we can assume that there is natural selection against higher cholesterol. If we know how much variation in people‚Äôs cholesterol is based on variation in their genes (a proportion called &lt;em&gt;heritability&lt;/em&gt;, which ranges between zero and one), we can then calculate how we expect the trait to change in the future.¬† That is, we can see if we‚Äôre evolving, and predict how much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying method, developed by quantitative geneticists such as my old mate Russell Lande, involves looking at several traits, any or all of which may be subject to selection.¬† These traits may have some ‚Äúgenetic correlation,‚Äù that is, genes affecting one trait might affect another. (For example, genes for higher weight might raise blood pressure as a byproduct).¬†¬† These correlations can be measured using data on the observed variation in the traits and the degree to which this variation is passed from one generation to the next (the heritability of the traits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you calculate all these correlations and then multiply them by the amount of selection that &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to act on each trait (this has to be discounted using the correlations), you can estimate the degree of genetically based change you expect each generation: that is, the amount that each trait will change over one generation by natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several traits did indeed appear to be undergoing selection.¬† From the amount of this selection, we can predict the percentage change in the trait that we expect to see after ten more generation of reproduction (roughly 300 years from now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt;: going down.¬† Projected to drop 3.6% in ten generations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight&lt;/strong&gt;:¬† going up a tad, projected to increase 1.4% in ten generations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Height&lt;/strong&gt;:¬† we‚Äôre getting shorter projecting a drop of 1.3% (2.1 cm) in ten generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systolic blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;:¬† Going down, as predicted. Projected to drop 1.9% in ten generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age at menopause&lt;/strong&gt;:¬† Going up; projected to rise 1.6% (0.8 years) in ten generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age at first reproduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Going down. Projected to drop 1.7% (from 26.18 to 25.74 years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So women, at least, are getting shorter,¬† stouter, and reproducing earlier and over a longer period of time.¬†¬† This is evolutionary change.¬† Based on this study, we can tentatively say, with more assurance than I used to, that yes, our species is still evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are two important caveats to this study, both of which were recognized by the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.¬† The ‚Äúinheritance‚Äù of the trait includes not just genetic inheritance, but cultural inheritance.¬† Humans pass not only their genes to their offspring, but aspects of culture that may mimic a genetic inheritance.¬† For example, parents who eat a lot may induce their kids to eat a lot, and some of the correlation of weight between parents and their kids may be due not to shared genes, but to shared food.¬† Parents who for cultural reasons have their kids early may induce their own kids to produce grandchildren early.¬† As the authors say, ‚ÄúWe are not able to differentiate the effects of genes and culture with these data.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of a problem, because the evolutionary projections are based on assuming that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of inheritance is genetic.¬†¬† It‚Äôs hard to get around, since distinguishing genetic from cultural inheritance involves difficult work using data from adopted children or twins raised together versus apart.¬† Nevertheless, we can probably assume that some selection is acting on these traits, discounted by the degree to which parent/offspring resemblance reflects cultural similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.¬† The predictions may be hard to verify, because they assume that the environments of our species ‚Äî that is, the environments that are relevant to each trait ‚Äî will remain constant over the next few generations. Cholesterol is predicted to drop from 224 to 216 mg/100 ml blood over the next ten generations, but this assumes that diet is constant.¬† If people stop eating fatty foods, the drop may be even steeper because of this dietary change.¬† Conversely, if people flock even more frequently to fast-food joints,¬† the predicted drop may be negated by an increased intake of burgers and fries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problems mean that one has to be a bit careful about not only predicting the degree of selection, but also testing those predictions in the future. Yesterday Stearns was on NPR‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/program/archives/200910235"&gt;Science Friday&lt;/a&gt;, discussing how the authors deal with the conflation of culture/environment and genes, and why the prediction of increasingly plump women may not be what it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regardless of the caveats, the study of Byars et al. is based on a good idea, and makes a reasonable case that selection is indeed acting in our species.¬† One would, of course, like confirmation from other datasets, but since the Framingham study is unique, this may be hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thaddeus Schwartz&lt;/strong&gt;, the founder of Secular Life, had this to say about the billboard (via email):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
‚Ä¶ hopefully it will bring awareness that there are positive communities who are non-religious doing good in the community. Our primary objective is to bring together as many like minded non-religious people as possible, spending less time on divisive labels and rather concentrating on the broadly shared characteristic of being non-religious and thus Secular.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money for the billboard comes only via donations, so if you‚Äôd like to pitch in for more billboards in an area that could use it, feel free to &lt;a href="http://www.mindoverdogma.com/"&gt;send them a few bucks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Nick&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

At dusk you bring your jack-o‚Äô-lantern to the park, admire the other lanterns, and then the pumpkins are lit, then launched into the &lt;a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/attractions/harlem-meer.html"&gt;Harlem Meer&lt;/a&gt;. You walk around the lake oohing and aahing over the sight of thousands of jack-o‚Äô-lanterns flickering over the dark water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;div style="width:459px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/halloweencard21.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/10/halloweencard21.jpg" alt="Image Courtesy of Dover Publications" width="449" height="680"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image Courtesy of Dover Publications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago the Sail was canceled because of a gusty wind, so last year we were happy and excited to be going. Today we buy our pumpkins; we‚Äôll carve late in the afternoon when Alex gets home from his recreation program and Ned from sib shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year Alex seems to look forward to Halloween, and it‚Äôs satisfying to see him moving in step with everyone else. Autism seems so often like a private celebration. We don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs laughing at, or why. We can‚Äôt make him eat the way we do, although he‚Äôs gotten much better about tasting things (and finding, amazingly, that he likes some of them). My sister bought me Little Miss Matched socks last year, and Alex seized on them with delight. They fit him, so I let him wear them, but it started an unshakable belief for him that socks must &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time of year seems so filled with things that people do to bind together in the darkening days, that autism in the family can weigh more heavily. Alex is not looking forward to pumpkin pie or post-Thanksgiving shopping (though he will be happy to see cousins and a foil-wrapped chocolate turkey). There‚Äôs no Hanukkah or Christmas countdown for him, though he‚Äôs mighty happy to see those wrapped gifts. But if he‚Äôs anticipating the coming season, we don‚Äôt know. And he‚Äôs not telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm glad to know that there is a holiday he seems to know is coming, to be celebrated with miniature pumpkins and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt seem to cue in on trick-or-treating but he‚Äôll be thrilled to get some chocolate, and he‚Äôll enjoy, as we all do, the excitement and thrill of being up late, and walking through the dark night, when who knows what will happen?&lt;/p&gt;

Here is what he said and my response:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I guess I'm as much puzzled that you could read something like &lt;i&gt;Signature in the Cell&lt;/i&gt; and still believe--believe as you do, that is. Minimally, I don't see how you can be so assured when, minimally, the materialists are a LONG way away from even beginning to give an adequate response to the information problem. On THIS matter, at least, if we allow our commitment level to be commensurate with the evidence--though this principle is pragmatically impossible to enjoin at all levels--then "you still puzzle me" as to how you can think that, somehow, you're the exception--the only one who goes with the evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, thanks for the implied concern of puzzlement. -:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I responded:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If this DNA evidence you speak of is enough to believe then what about most of those people who accept Scientology (Nightline did an expose of them the last two nights) and who know nothing about it? Must they then read about it to believe? And why do most scientists not believe even though they know of this evidence? And then there's &lt;i&gt;Hume's Stopper&lt;/i&gt;. No, you do not believe because of that &lt;i&gt;Signature &lt;/i&gt;book, and you know it, because you believed &lt;b&gt;BEFORE&lt;/b&gt; ever reading it or anything of an apologetical nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You asked me how sure I am right. There is no good positive evidence for Chrstianity, of that I'm sure (historical evidence is poor evidence and your God should have known this). There is only negative evidence, known as the god of the gaps. I am so sure I'm willing to risk Pascal's Wager on it. I'm sure in what I deny, that's for sure. I'm not all that sure about what I affirm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm doing the best I can to reach brainwashed people like I once was. We need an intervention, but it can't be done face-to-face with people who love them and care for them, since most people they know are believers themselves. All I can do is write and edit books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Spoken in a hiss] You'll have no rest from me and my minions Bruhaaaahaaa.

&lt;p&gt;If you'll notice, I dressed up for the occasion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of things I find humorous as I look back at the video -- PalMD and I decided to share a beer and glass of wine.¬† PalMD drinks his beer out openly, enjoying the comfort of his pseudo-pseudonymity. I realized however, as soon as I put on my mask, that I wasn&amp;#39;t going to be able to drink my wine. So, you&amp;#39;ll see me trying to get around the mask, trying to drink my wine through a straw.¬†¬†Amazingly awkward, guys. But, it&amp;#39;ll at least show you the value I put on that glass of wine last night. Also, I think in the video that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground"&gt;PalMD&lt;/a&gt; admits that &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/"&gt;PhysioProf&lt;/a&gt; is usually right. Whoa!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for the record, I did NOT start the atheist talk. It was not me, little muffins. I was but a moving target.....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/10/dr_isis_and_palmd_on_bloggingh.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/iLSvdQk-PZ8" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256398063571"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/weekend_diversion_conservation.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e790dfa871ca5e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random Stuff"/><title type="html">Weekend Diversion: Conservation of Energy (drinks)</title><published>2009-10-24T15:59:05Z</published><updated>2009-10-24T15:59:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/10/weekend_diversion_conservation.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, I like to showcase some new music to you, or at least music that's new to me.  But this week, I heard an old favorite for the first time in a long time.  You're probably familiar with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Femmes"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/a&gt;, but you may not have heard anything other than &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aljlKYesT4"&gt;Blister in the Sun&lt;/a&gt; from them.  That's not a bad song, but it isn't their best.  Take a listen to &lt;a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/violent_femmes/add_it_up.html"&gt;Add It Up&lt;/a&gt; below and see if you agree:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/10/weekend_diversion_conservation/21%2520Add%2520It%2520Up.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who know me personally might know I have a taste for Mike Judge, including his very funny movie Idiocracy.  One of the funniest parts of Idiocracy was their all-pervasive energy drink, Brawndo:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Tbxq0IDqD04%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, look out, Brawndo!  Because here comes a possibly superior (fictional) product, &lt;b&gt;Powerthirst!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/qRuNxHqwazs%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is Oreo, who lives on the coffee-and-tea farm and biological reserve of &lt;a href="http://www.andescloudforest.org/"&gt;Los Andes&lt;/a&gt;, on the side of the volcano Atitl√°n.¬† Oreo is one of the few cats in Guatemala who has his own bed, but he prefers to lie on a lap, or bask before the traditional wood stove while the cook makes tortillas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/oreo-096.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Oreo 096" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/oreo-096.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="Oreo 096" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what would Guatemala Caturday be without a felid weaving?¬† Here‚Äôs a cat-themed &lt;em&gt;huipil&lt;/em&gt; (I suspect it‚Äôs a jaguar):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs always taxis when you don‚Äôt need them and never police or ambulance. Maybe that‚Äôs just today that I feel that angry about it, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve observed before. I presented on a panel about coincidences, so I really should know better. I clearly don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were dots of red paint, on the path, in the rain. I thought as I walked looking at them that it was a lot more than someone who had a leaking paint-tin and it reminded me of a sudden nosebleed a kid had, which I once saw in the city. They freaked out, must have been their first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was standing outside the news agency, with her arm dripping red stripes. And I went, ‚Äò!! Did you hurt yourself? What happened?‚Äô and she screamed into the news agency for someone to get the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I thought someone attacked her. I thought that the first step was to stop the bleeding and so I took off my jumper thinking I could use it as a tourniquet at least, and she said no. She just didn‚Äôt want the mess on the floor. She didn‚Äôt like the pattern of the blood, apparently. She didn‚Äôt want me to touch her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was another lady walking past, who said (of all things) that she was a student of phlebotomy. I didn‚Äôt know exactly what phlebotomy involved, but I knew it had something to do with veins. I wrote it down later, ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;phleb&lt;/em&gt;-something‚Äô so I wouldn‚Äôt forget. She said that on her course there were two police officers, because they were learning it for drug testing. She said that much later though. But I remember that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phlebotomy-student tried to help too, firstly by insisted on stemming the bleeding - but the lady said again, no, she didn‚Äôt want that. I said she needed a chair and that we‚Äôll clean up the floor for her? Asked if I could take her bag? And I thought she said ‚ÄòCan you take my &lt;em&gt;raisins&lt;/em&gt;?‚Äô&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then she &lt;span&gt;handed&lt;/span&gt; me the &lt;span&gt;razor&lt;/span&gt; blade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got her a chair, at the cafe, out of the rain. The newsagency called police, the cafe apparently called the ambulance later. Freaking cafe people, especially the servers, just staring. I brought sweet tea as it was all I could think of since she didn‚Äôt want a bandage. The snotty server didn‚Äôt seem to realise that it was for shock. Doesn‚Äôt anyone do sodding First Aid anymore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, what &lt;em&gt;idiots&lt;/em&gt; would let their child wander up to us in the middle of all this and start asking why she was bleeding and not take her away from all the blood? Phlebotomy-student just turned and looked at the parents and said ‚Äòare you &lt;em&gt;helping &lt;/em&gt;here??‚Äô and they got the point and finally left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nurse was walking past at the time, at some time, maybe five minutes after and she came over. It all happened at 6.25 - my watch is five minutes fast. If they call me, I must remember that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nurse sat with her and talked to her. Later the nurse said that she said that she had done it before, she was all alone and no friends and that the voices told her to kill herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had towels in the back of my car, parked near the cafe. Someone said I ‚Äôsure had a lot of towels‚Äô but I didn‚Äôt say anything about Douglas Adams. I had them left over from the gym, from dance class, all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all mopped up the blood off the ground and put the towels under where her arm was - as she kept saying she didn‚Äôt want a mess on the floor. At one point I misheard and tried to dab her hand and she said no, she did not want to be touched. So I spread the towels more on the floor, underneath her arm, instead. The nurse was dabbing her other hand. She drank the tea. Got a cigarette and smoked. The nurse got her a coffee too - of course, the sodding cafe were quite willing to take money as they stared at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the nurse got a bandage later, the chemist apparently sort of stared at her too when she said it was an emergency. I think we were both really unimpressed with the shopkeepers around there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood gelled - I didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôd do that, like stalactites. It was getting colder, but I don‚Äôt think that was why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Phlebotomy-student said that she had just started studying and that it was only today that she learned blood can do that. I said I had once written 3000 words on cutting behavior once, for a Psychology assignment. Two of us, doing meta-analysis as we stood in the evidence of her life as she tried to end her life. My shoes were getting soaked, I think it was mostly rain. I hope it was rain. You couldn‚Äôt tell much anymore, everything was running pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was weird, we were both calm and just going through steps. Clean the blood again. The rain was getting most of it by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood in the rain and watched taxis go frickin‚Äô past. I waited to wave the police or ambulance down, so they knew which cafe it was out of the handful that are on that street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the police came the wrong way up the one way street so I wouldn‚Äôt have seen them anyway and they had a prisoner in the back and had to figure out what to do but at least they had plastic gloves and I was kicking myself because I have those in my car as well but I only brought out towels. I am useless, I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They put the car racks around her as there were nosy kids about and people are just sodding rude and just stand and sneer or stare. Then the ambulance arrived and they used the bandage the nurse got and they took my and Annika‚Äôs details (she was the Phlebotomy-student) and then they took her away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to the nurse before she left, thanked her too. Her name was Susan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put my towels in the bin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Athon would have known what to do. And he would have known why blood does that. He would have known immediately that phlebotomy was the science of blood. And he would have had his damned mobile phone on him rather than leaving it at home, and he wouldn‚Äôt have relied on a bunch of cafe shop owners who just stared. At least the newsagency gave us tissues to start the blood mopping when it started and then got a proper bucket and mop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One shop, out of four in the vicinity, who did something other than stare. Three people on the street who did something. Guess what, Darley and Latane, you‚Äôre right again. Bastards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt want my orange juice anymore - it feels like it has blood in it and I had a shower and I think my coat needs to go to the cleaners and I don‚Äôt know what to do about my shoes and I‚Äôm going to bed now even though I‚Äôm hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

This linguistic stereotype is often used as the basis of comic-strip humor, frequently in the context of shopping, as in this Foxtrot strip from a few years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FoxtrotCute.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FoxtrotCute.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And (with a twist) in this Preteena from 6/24/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/PreteenaCute.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/PreteenaCute.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact, the word &lt;em&gt;cute&lt;/em&gt; really is used much more often by women than by men, in modern American culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In a  study based on a sample taken in 2004 (and described in "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004701.html"&gt;What men and women blog about&lt;/a&gt;", 7/8/2007), &lt;em&gt;cute&lt;/em&gt; was the tenth most feminine word (as quantified by information gain), after &lt;em&gt;hubby, husband,¬† adorable, skirt, boyfriend, mommy, yummy, kisses,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gosh&lt;/em&gt;. But male bloggers in that sample still used &lt;em&gt;cute&lt;/em&gt; with a frequency of 83 per million words ‚Äî it&amp;#39;s just that the female bloggers used it with a frequency of 232 per million words ‚Äî  about 2.8 times more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a large corpus of American English telephone conversations, the apparent femininity of &lt;em&gt;cute&lt;/em&gt; was somewhat greater, at least as measured by the ratio of female use to male use ‚Äî it was used 974 times in 15,685 female conversational sides, and only 214 times in 12,589 male conversational sides, for a ratio (corrected to account for the different numbers of conversational participants) of about 3.65. In comparison, the corrected ratio for &lt;em&gt;shopping&lt;/em&gt; was only 3.01, and &lt;em&gt;pink&lt;/em&gt; was only 2.12. (These transcribed conversations were mostly  collected in 2003, but a significant minority were collected in 1990-91.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, cute was the most female-associated adjective among several candidates that I tried:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The raw ratios of counts are multiplied by 12589/15685 in the column labelled "corrected ratio", in order to get the ratio of rates per conversation. The average number of words per conversational side was &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003607.html"&gt;nearly the same for the sexes&lt;/a&gt;, with men being about 6% talkier, so to get per-word ratios, another small correction would be needed, which would raise the corrected ratio for &lt;em&gt;cute&lt;/em&gt; to about 3.87.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gender divergence was greater for several nouns, with &lt;em&gt;husband&lt;/em&gt; being more than 15 times commoner in the women's speech, and &lt;em&gt;wife&lt;/em&gt; about 5 times commoner in men's speech:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Update ‚Äî Kenny Easwaran asks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[W]as there any interesting difference in use of these words based on the gender of the other conversational participant? It seems plausible that "cute" may be used more often with a female conversational partner than with a male one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="text-align:center" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;female interlocutor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;male interlocutor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;female speaker&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;762 in 10784&lt;br&gt;
(7.06 per 100)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;212 in 4901&lt;br&gt;
(4.33 per 100)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;male speaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;103 in 4901&lt;br&gt;
(2.10 per 100)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;111 in 7688&lt;br&gt;
(1.44 per 100)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, when a female speaker had a female conversational partner, there 762 instances of &lt;em&gt;cute &lt;/em&gt;in 10,784 conversations, for a rate of 7.06 cutes per 100 conversations. And so on‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So indeed, both women and men tended to use "cute" somewhat more often when talking with a woman than when talking with with a man.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256383364726"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=5856">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/11cc1b3b31c38a66</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Jesus ‚Äòn‚Äô Mo ‚Äòn‚Äô Karen Armstrong</title><published>2009-10-24T10:43:10Z</published><updated>2009-10-24T10:43:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/24/jesus-n-mo-n-karen-armstrong/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again the mysterious &lt;a href="http://www.jesusandmo.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus and Mo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; artist proves him/herself a diligent reader of the atheistic blogosphere.  Earlier this week the ever-slippery Karen Armstrong, whose continued writing career proves that you can fool some of the people all of the time, published a &lt;a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/19/god_0?page=full"&gt;musheaded defense of religion&lt;/a&gt;. (For a decisive takedown of this piece, see&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/the_zombies_will_sup_on_karen.php"&gt; P.Z.‚Äôs post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read Armstrong‚Äôs piece to see the breathless &lt;em&gt;hauteur&lt;/em&gt; with which she claims to know exactly what God is.¬† Like Robert Wright, she deliberately uses the word ‚ÄúGod‚Äù when she means ‚Äúthe &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of God,‚Äù so that her readers can move seamlessly from the notion of God to the reality of The Bearded One himself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is only since Sept. 11, 2001, that God has proven to be alive and well beyond all question ‚Äî at least as far as the global public debate is concerned. With jihadists attacking America, an increasingly radicalized Middle East, and a born-again Christian in the White House for eight years, you‚Äôll have a hard time finding anyone who disagrees. Even The Economist‚Äôs editor in chief recently co-authored a book called God Is Back. While many still question the relevance of God in our private lives, there‚Äôs a different debate on the global stage today: Is God a force for good in the world? . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; is also &lt;em&gt;Homo religiosus&lt;/em&gt;. As soon as we became recognizably human, men and women started to create religions. We are meaning-seeking creatures. While dogs, as far as we know, do not worry about the canine condition or agonize about their mortality, humans fall very easily into despair if we don‚Äôt find some significance in our lives. Theological ideas come and go, but the quest for meaning continues. So God isn‚Äôt going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Milgrom PhD, MARH, MRHom, FRSC, entitled:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAM, Free Speech, and the British Legal System: Overstepping the Mark?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The introduction to the article is &lt;a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2009.0422"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;. I also have been provided with a pdf of the original article by two kind sources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this seeming venture into legal scholarship, Dr Milgrom has made it possible for one to assess his basic competence as a scholar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By basic competence, I mean an ability to correctly state the relevant facts and materials, and an ability to properly use footnotes, sources, and evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, the title and the content of both the abstract and the article affirm this article is intended to be taken seriously as a contribution to the discussion of law. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Indeed he expressly states in the abstract that he is examining defamation law and freedom of expression, and is exploring the ramifications of the tension between the two.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, one must quickly note even with the title that there is no such thing as a &lt;em&gt;British&lt;/em&gt; legal system; what Dr Milgrom is seeking to discuss is the &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt; law of libel (shared only with Wales; Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own legal systems).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving on from the title, we come to the initial sentence of the abstract:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The British Chiropractic Association recently won a libel case against the science writer and CAM "skeptic" Dr Simon Singh for publishing an article in a British newspaper in which he accused them of promoting "bogus" treatments."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is, of course, factually incorrect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA has not won a libel case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, sometimes abstracts can be hasty summaries, and so we should look at what the article actually says on this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After setting out (in a significantly incorrect way, as we will see below) the legal case of the BCA, Dr Milgrom writes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The judge agreed with this argument, awarding the BCA substantial damages."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is more incorrect than the statement in the abstract, and it is wrong in that:&lt;br&gt;- there has not been an award of substantial damages;&lt;br&gt;- there has not been an award of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; damages;&lt;br&gt;- there has not been the award of any legal remedy;&lt;br&gt;- there has not been a judgment of the court which would give rise to the award of any legal remedy;&lt;br&gt;- there has not even been a full trial of the case for which there can be a judgment;&lt;br&gt;- a full trial has not even been listed; and&lt;br&gt;- the case is still at the preliminary stage, which is adjourned pending the outcome of Simon Singh's appeal of the ruling on meaning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Dr Milgrom's factual assertion here is a basis of his article, then his error rather undermines the article as a whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Dr Milgrom did not just make this careless factual error, he rested it on the authority of a footnote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The footnote purports to be a British Chiropractic Association online document and this &lt;a href="http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/default.aspx?m=1&amp;amp;mi=1"&gt; URL&lt;/a&gt; is given.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you will see, the URL does not lead to any particular press release, but the BCA's press release on the ruling in the preliminary hearing is &lt;a href="http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/gfx/uploads/textbox/Singh/Press%20Statement%2007%2005%2009.pdf"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will see that the BCA press release states that the case is ongoing, the the trial is yet to be concluded, and that the ruling was on meaning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will also note that there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; mention of damages, let alone substantial damages. Although the press release itself contains errors, it is either correct or silent on the points which relate to Dr Milgrom's assertion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So Dr Milgrom's entirely incorrect factual statement is attributed in a (vague) footnote to a source which in turn does not support and actually counters the statement made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, in addition to this crucial error, the remainder of the article contains a number of mistakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example is the supposed description of the BCA's case which precedes the howler about substantial damages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here Dr Milgrom writes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"...the BCA went to court, arguing that the term "bogus" constituted a slur on the character of chiropractors, because it implies chiropractors are knowingly mendacious".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is incorrect, for if the BCA had adopted this stance the libel claim could not have even been launched.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA's case is (necessarily) that Simon Singh defamed the BCA itself. The BCA is a legal person as a corporation and, as such, has a reputation which can be protected by the English law of libel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Simon Singh was instead attacking chiropractic generally, and his "slur" was against unnamed and unidentifiable chiropractors, then the BCA would not actually have a case to bring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, Dr Milgrom has (unwittingly) set out one part of Simon Singh's defence: that the meaning of the original Guardian article does not defame the BCA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr Milgrom's other mistakes in this four page article include repeatedly confusing the law of defamation with the law of privacy; incorrectly stating that privacy law may lead a court to impose "severe financial penalties" - even though penalties are matters for criminal and regulatory law, and not the laws of privacy and libel; wrongly stating four senior barristers to be High Court judges (including Simon Singh's own QC); and even implying that the BCA case itself is a privacy case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One can only speculate as to why Dr Milgrom wrote and submitted such a thoroughly inaccurate and unscholarly article purporting to be a scholarly discussion of the tension caused by defamation law and of its ramifications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is also disappointing and concerning that the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine&lt;/em&gt; allowed such an article to be published without basic fact checking or, it would seem, arranging adequate peer review by anyone familiar with the legal case being discussed or having an elementary understanding of English defamation law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, whatever the motives and practices which led to this article being placed into the public domain, it serves in my view to discredit the scholarly pretensions of Dr Lionel Milgrom and the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As always, please use a name; purely anonymous comments will not be published.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-9178672282540534275?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256371022408"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=17545">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ffce1d103d3f0227</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">I Would Enjoy Reading This Version of the Bible</title><published>2009-10-24T06:42:30Z</published><updated>2009-10-24T06:42:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/24/i-would-enjoy-reading-this-version-of-the-bible/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;amp;id=1678"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So some of you know that I am currently back in graduate school working towards a PhD in Religious History. This affords me lots of opportunity to read fascinating books and contemplate interesting ideas, unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt often afford me much time to actually write about any of them, either here or at my own blog. However, the other day I was reading about the history of Methodism in America and came across an interesting paragraph that made me wonder about a few things that I really wanted to run by you all here. Speaking of the struggles over slavery among Methodists in the mid-nineteenth century, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Story-American-Methodism-Methodists-Relations/dp/0687396417/"&gt;Frederick Norwood&lt;/a&gt; writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn slavery we have a clear case of the unavoidable mingling of church history and economic history. Try as they would to stay out of secular affairs, churchmen were caught up in events. Slavery, slave revolts, and the underground railroad pressed in upon the church as powerfully as upon business and finance. Churchmen might claim to stay out of politics ‚Äì but they could not.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me first just say that I very much support the separation of church and state. I don‚Äôt want any government dictating to people what they have to believe, nor do I want any religious groups trying to legislate their own morality on others. I am especially angered and embarrassed by the political agenda and actions of the Religious Right who are explicit about their desire to ‚Äútake back America for God.‚Äù On this issue, I stand united with the atheists here for the continued separation of church and state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Norwood‚Äôs account of the abolitionist movement among Methodists 150+ years ago reminded me once again that sometimes things are not quite so cut and dried. You see, while I support the separation of church and state, I also strongly support numerous other social justice causes ‚Äì e.g. racial reconciliation, the abolition of modern slavery, fair wages and fair trade, environmental protection, active international peacemaking, Third World debt reduction, immigration rights, women‚Äôs rights, GLBT rights, etc. ‚Äì and actively encourage other Christians and churches to do the same, not just as an add-on to their faith, but as an essential component of it. According to my own personal understanding of Christianity, these sorts of things are inseparable from the meaning of the gospel. However, these issues are also inherently ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù. I can‚Äôt get involved in these issues without stepping onto the turf of ‚Äúthe State‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course I can do this as an individual citizen with no problem, but what about as a pastor? (I no longer lead a church community, but I did for three years, and often faced this dilemma.) Am I crossing a line by encouraging my members to actively engage with these issues? Should a church community take up a social cause, abolishing modern slavery or supporting GLBT rights for example, that directly involves influencing the legislative process? Is that blurring the line between church and state too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, does it make a difference to you that my faith leads me to support ‚Äúliberal‚Äù or ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù social causes, versus ‚Äúconservative‚Äù ones? I mean, I‚Äôm still attempting to ‚Äúimpose my own religious morality‚Äù on society ‚Äì it just so happens that my particular religious morality leads me, for instance, to support rights for GLBT folks rather than restrict them. But should that make a difference? Does the ‚Äúwall of separation‚Äù only protect us from religious opinions we don‚Äôt happen to like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before any of you answer too quickly in favor of the church staying completely out of politics regardless of the issue, stop and consider the historical examples. Do we tend to applaud and affirm the numerous churches who just stood on the sidelines of the slavery issue and refused to take a stand way back then? Or fast-forward to the Civil Rights era ‚Äì would most of us have preferred that Martin Luther King Jr. had just kept his mouth shut, since, after all, he was speaking and acting as a religious leader out of a religious motivation (don‚Äôt forget that the organization he founded was called the Southern &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; Leadership Conference)? Do we tend to look favorably on the many, many other church leaders who just stood by in that fight and refused to stand with MLK because he was just ‚Äútoo political‚Äù? Was it okay for them to avoid speaking out for justice by hiding behind ‚Äúseparation of church and state‚Äù?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to take an even more extreme example, what about Nazi Germany? I am currently taking a class on the life and theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor who was among a handful of clergymen that actively took a stand against the Third Reich, and who eventually ended up being executed in a prison camp for participating in a plot to assassinate Hitler. Do we say that Bonhoeffer did the right thing by getting involved in ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù, or should he have just stayed out of it, as so many other churchmen did back then? Don‚Äôt we typically condemn the church (Lutheran, Catholic, whatever) for not having the courage to speak out against Hitler and his genocide against the Jews when they had the chance? But of course, for them to do so, as Bonhoeffer did, would have required a suspension of any kind of separation of church and state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess that‚Äôs my question ‚Äì in your opinion, is the separation of church and state an absolute principle, or do exceptions apply for matters of social justice? And if the latter, then where do we draw the line? How much involvement is too much, and when is it not yet nearly enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, when I was a pastor this was a question I had to deal with on a regular basis. I have my own thoughts on it, but my mind is in no way settled on the issue, so I would be very much interested to hear yours as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AutismNews/doctors-drop-parents-vaccinate/story?id=8894999"&gt;ABC News &lt;/a&gt;reports that doctors have begun ‚Äúfiring‚Äù parents who decline to have thier children vaccinated. One California mom,¬†who‚Äôs oldest child has been diagnosed with autism¬†said her doctor said¬†the presence of her and her child was ‚Äútoo much of a liability.‚Äù Doctors are apparently feeling more compelled to say ‚Äúno‚Äù back to anti-vaccine parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue surfaced this at the annual American Academy of Pediatrics meeting in Washington, D.C. Presenter Dr. Gary Marshall said there are some cases when it‚Äôs ethical and legal to refuse to continue to see, or treat, a child, especially if parents and the physician will never see ‚Äúeye-to-eye‚Äù on a specific issue. Stipulations for such situations include written notice that the doctor will no longer treat the children and giving parents at least 30 days to find another physician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides in this debate continue to bet very heavily that they‚Äôre right. Regarding this new issue, I feel the parents have thought this matter through with the full attention of their minds and hearts, but I must wonder if the doctors can say the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did an interesting (at least as far as the composition of the audience went; I‚Äôm just assuming they enjoyed it) presentation earlier this week at the Laurelmead residence in Providence, R.I. The event was set up by a former professor of mine ‚Äî a sweet guy, and I‚Äôm delighted to be back in touch with him and his wife after all these years ‚Äî and attracted some 30 senior residents of Laurelmead. I usually speak to teachers, parents, future sped teachers, and other professionals, and had never had an audience like this one. Some were grandparents wondering how to interact with their autistic grandchildren and some were just plain curious about a family lifestyle that‚Äôs making more and more headlines. I thank them for their attention, and I hope they found¬†the presentation helpful and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks too to Vox readers who were saddened to hear we‚Äôd not be doing this blog after November 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats to the Phoenix-based Southwest Autism Research &amp;amp; Resource Center (SARRC), a non-profit working to advance research and provide support for individuals with autism and their families, which has secured a $100,000 grant as the winner of the 2009 Arizona Benefits grant, funded by health benefits company Humana Inc. With the award, SARRC will create GardenWorks, a community-based program designed to engage individuals with ASDs in developing and sustaining a revenue-producing co-op garden. SARRC hopes to teach gardening and landscaping skills those with ASDs can use for work, while community members will be encouraged to mentor those individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

By Arthur Crew Inman. Edited by Daniel Aaron.&amp;quot;HYPERGRAPHIA&amp;quot;, a film currently in production......is a narrative feature recounting the true story of the notorious Boston eccentric and recluse Arthur Crew Inman (1895-1963) and of &amp;quot;THE INMAN DIARY&amp;quot; he created. Published by Harvard University Press, Inman&amp;#39;s gargantuan diary is one of the great literary curiosities of our age, a sprawling memory piece of more than 17 million words. A black comedy of epic proportions, the screenplay is a tightly wound biographical journey with documentary elements drawn from the extensive Inman Collection at Harvard. Historical scenes evoking world events of the first half of the 20th century (stock footage, news headlines, period movie montages) will be integrated with events from the entire 68 years of Inman&amp;#39;s life and a good deal of human history in between, - a sort of March of Time with Arthur Inman as self-appointed narrator.Hypergraphia, the behavior is defined as an overwhelming urge to write, often associated with the manic phase of bipolar disorder and with temporal lobe epilepsy (as one in a cluster of symptoms). Influential behavioral neurologist Norman Geschwind described the personality changes that can be observed in persons with temporal lobe epilepsy in a series of lectures1 and papers from the 1970s and 80s (reviewed in Devinsky &amp;amp; Schachter, 2009). He viewed these changes as:...resulting from a stimulating lesion in the limbic system. This neurobiology accounted for the overarching increased interictal [time between seizures] emotionality that underlay the increased religious interests, hypergraphia, increased aggression, increased moral and philosophical concerns, viscosity, and seriousness (lack of humor). Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky is the classic example (see Crime and  Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, etc.). According to Geschwind,Dostoevsky typified many personality features of the temporal lobe epileptic‚Äîtremendous concern about moral details, many of them small details, extremely pedantic, he was angrily impulsive, an impossible person to live with in every way, and extremely aggressive, even toward people who had befriended him. Yet he was also deeply emotional and despite these negative personality traits, many of those close to him felt a strong emotional bond.From Dostoevsky, by Richard Freeborn. Also see Dostoevsky&amp;#39;s Doodles, an exhibit held at the Harriman Institute.In 1974 Waxman and Geschwind (reprinted in 2005) described copious writing and temporal lobe seizures in a series of patients:The phenomenon of hypergraphia, or the tendency toward extensive and, in some cases, compulsive writing, in temporal lobe epilepsy is described in seven patients, in each of whom there was electroencephalographic demonstration of a temporal lobe focus. Unusually detailed and strikingly copious writing was evidenced in each patient. Six patients provided documentation of their extensive writing, which often was concerned with religious or moral issues. A seventh patient claimed to have written extensively, but refused to exhibit his writings. Aggressiveness, religiosity, and changes in sexual behavior in temporal lobe disorders have been described previously. The hypergraphia of temporal lobe epilepsy appears to be part of a specific behavioral syndrome of special interest because of its association with dysfunction at specific anatomic loci.Did Arthur Inman have temporal lobe epilepsy? It seems his hypergraphia might have been more psychiatric in nature, driven by a combination of obsessive-compulsive behavior, grandiosity, self-loathing, and paranoia.From The Inman diary.Inman was also an extreme hypochondriac. A series of &amp;quot;thirty-four eminent doctors&amp;quot; (plus his long-time osteopath) could find nothing physically wrong with him. However, a 1988 article in The Atlantic explored the possibility that Inman did indeed have temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE):As for Inman, clearly he had many, if not all, of the traits of the behavior syndrome. On a questionnaire designed by [neuropsychiatrist David] Bear and the psychologist Paul Fedio to determine the extent to which the syndrome is present in patients, Inman scores well within the range of people with TLE and substantially above the control groups. The questionnaire was filled out for Inman separately by Bear and by Libby Smith, one of the editors of The Inman Diary. Smith, who spent seven years reviewing the unabridged diary and interviewing scores of people who knew its author, had never heard of TLE. Both she and Bear gave Inman high marks in nearly all of the eighteen traits listed on the questionnaire. ... &amp;quot;Compulsive attention to detail,&amp;quot; for example, describes Inman&amp;#39;s need to make lists and keep to rigid schedules. His childlike charm and tendency to fly into rages translate into high scores in several categories: &amp;quot;dependence,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;deepening of all emotions,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;humorlessness,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;paranoia.&amp;quot; And his effort to chronicle his era demonstrates his &amp;quot;grandiosity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sense of personal destiny.&amp;quot;Read more at HYPERGRAPHIA INMAN DIARY blog.Footnote1 A 1974 lecture from Geschwind&amp;#39;s course at Harvard Medical School (on The Neurology of Behavior) was reprinted in the journal Epilepsy &amp;amp; Behavior...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

And that was NOTHING compared to what‚Äôs about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears the state of Michigan is about to lead the nation‚Ä¶&lt;a title="News story" href="http://news.msu.edu/story/7022/"&gt;in dropping all its Extension Service funding&lt;/a&gt;.¬† It would become the ONLY state to not have Extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone who works in Agriculture, this is just‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apocalyptic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs the only word I can come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn‚Äôt about just ending consulting services to farmers. Michigan Extension runs the &lt;a title="Actually, for the entire midwest" href="http://ncrcrd.org/WhoWeAre.aspx"&gt;Economic Development Programs&lt;/a&gt; for many counties. They run &lt;a href="http://bfi.fcs.msue.msu.edu/"&gt;breastfeeding&lt;/a&gt; workshops and the &lt;a href="http://snap-ed.fcs.msue.msu.edu/"&gt;state‚Äôs supplemental nutrition programs&lt;/a&gt;.¬† They train childcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do a &lt;a title="A list of said important stuff" href="http://anrcom.msu.edu/Budget/ProgramsinJeopardy/tabid/108/Default.aspx"&gt;lot of really important stuff&lt;/a&gt; that we need when the state‚Äôs &lt;a title="depression level in some areas" href="http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2009/10/unemployment_rate_continues_to.html"&gt;employment rate is the highest in the nation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few bullet points from an &lt;a href="http://anrcom.msu.edu/Budget/QuickFacts/tabid/89/Default.aspx"&gt;official MSU website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every county, every legislative district, will be affected by the elimination of MAES and MSUE funding. &lt;strong&gt;These are outreach programs that make a significant impact on people‚Äôs lives&lt;/strong&gt;. From babies to seniors, urban, suburban or rural, people of all communities will feel the impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;236,000 Michigan youth and 27,000 volunteers would face the elimination of 4-H programming, &lt;strong&gt;making Michigan the only state without 4-H youth development¬†programming.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2008, MAES and MSUE funds generated a &lt;strong&gt;total economic impact for the State of Michigan of $1.062 billion&lt;/strong&gt;.¬†This would be gone. For every $1 provided by the state, MAES and MSUE generate another $2.33 for research and extension work in Michigan. This income would be lost, with much of it going to other states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a story to tell about how you have benefited from Michigan Extension, the Michigan Experiment Station System, or other related parts of MSU, &lt;strong&gt;please contact your legislators ASAP!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The core idea of the symposium is to mark these dual anniversaries by discussing Darwin's work (its impacts, legacies, etc) from a range of disciplinary perspectives crossing the sciences, humanities, arts, and social sciences, and to use that opportunity as an occasion for thinking about the kinds of knowledge projects and practices that can emerge when we traffic those disciplinary divides. A complete program schedule is available &lt;a href="http://www.fhi.duke.edu/programs/panels-symposia-conferences/darwin-across-the-disciplines/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/darwin_across_the_disciplines.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/bgfdZdZwZgQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1256339892643"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/blog_pick_of_the_month_-_only.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5c7928b966d55aba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Blog Pick of the Month - only a week left</title><published>2009-10-23T23:53:35Z</published><updated>2009-10-23T23:53:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/8hYmZfWx1SQ/blog_pick_of_the_month_-_only.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/blog_pick_of_the_month_-_only.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The October winner &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/tag/blog-pick-of-the-month/" title=""&gt;will be announced&lt;/a&gt; on the 1st of November.

commerce and scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While exploring this new exhibition, visitors will watch live silkworms&lt;br&gt;
spinning cocoons, wander through a replica of a lively night market,&lt;br&gt;
encounter life-sized camel models, explore the ancient skills of papermaking&lt;br&gt;
and metalwork, and track the "stars" using a working model of an Arab&lt;br&gt;
astrolabe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children will also become world travelers, collecting special stamps in Silk&lt;br&gt;
Road "passports" issued to them at the exhibition entrance.  On Sunday&lt;br&gt;
afternoons, guests will be treated to live performances brought together by&lt;br&gt;
the Silk Road Project, founded in 1998 by cellist Yo-Yo Ma.&lt;/p&gt;

DBS is the use of high-frequency electrical current to alter the function of specific areas of the brain. Originally developed for Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease, over the past five years DBS has been used experimentally in severe clinical depression, OCD, Tourette&amp;#39;s syndrome, alcoholism, and more.Reports of the effects have frequently been remarkable, but there have been few scientifically rigorous studies, and the number of psychiatric patients treated to date is just dozens. So the true usefulness of the technique is unclear. How DBS works is also a mystery. Even the most basic questions - such as whether high-frequency stimulation switches the brain &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; - are still being debated.Recent data from rodents sheds some important light on the issue: Antidepressant-Like Effects of Medial Prefrontal Cortex Deep Brain Stimulation in Rats.   The authors took rats, and implanted DBS electrodes in the infralimbic cortex. This area is part of the vmPFC. It&amp;#39;s believed to be the rat equivalent of the human region BA25, the subgenual cingulate cortex, which is the most common target for DBS in depression. The current settings (100 microA, 130 Hz, 90 microsec) were chosen to be similar to the ones used in humans.In a standard rat model of depression, the forced-swim test, infralimbic DBS exerted antidepressant-like effects. DBS was equally as effective as imipramine, a potent  antidepressant, in terms of reducing &amp;quot;depression-like&amp;quot; behaviours, namely immobility.This is not all that surprising. Almost everything which treats depression in humans also reduces immobility in this test (along with few things which don&amp;#39;t treat it). Much more interesting is what did and did not block the effects of DBS in these rats.First off, DBS worked even when the rat&amp;#39;s infralimbic cortex had been destroyed by the toxin ibotenic acid. This strongly suggests that DBS does not work simply by activating the infralimbic cortex, even though this is where the electrodes were implanted.Crucially, infralimbic lesions did not have an antidepressant effect per se, which also rules out the theory that DBS works by inactivating this region. (Infralimbic lesions produced by other methods did have a mild antidepressant effect, but it was smaller than the effect of DBS. This may still be important, however.)What did block the effects of DBS was the depletion of serotonin (5HT). Serotonin is known to its friends as the brain&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;happy chemical&amp;quot;, although it&amp;#39;s a bit more complicated than that. Most antidepressants target serotonin. And rats whose serotonin systems had been lesioned got no benefit from DBS in this study.So this suggests that DBS might work by affecting serotonin, and indeed, DBS turned out to greatly increase serotonin release, even in a distant part of the brain (the hippocampus). Interestingly this lasted for nearly two hours after the electrodes were switched off.Depletion of another neurotransmitter, noradrenaline, did not alter the effects of DBS.Overall, it seems that infralimbic DBS works by increasing serotonin release, but that this is not because it activates or inactivates the infralimbic cortex itself. Rather, nearby structures must be involved. The most likely explanation is that DBS affects nearby white-matter tracts carrying signals between other areas of the brain; the infralimbic cortex might just happen to be &amp;quot;by the roadside&amp;quot;. Many researchers believe that this is how DBS works in humans, but this is the first hard evidence for this.Of course, evidence from rats is never all that hard when it comes to human mental illness. We need to know whether the same thing is true in people. As luck would have it, you can temporarily reduce human serotonin levels with a technique called acute tryptophan depletion This reverses the effects of antidepressants in many people. If this rat data is right, it should also temporarily reverse the benefits of DBS. Someone should do this experiment as soon as possible - I&amp;#39;d like to do it myself, but I&amp;#39;m British, and all the DBS research happens in America. Bah, humbug, old bean.There&amp;#39;s a couple of others things to note here. In other behavioural tests, infralimbic DBS also had antidepressant-like effects: it seemed to reduce anxiety, and it made rats more resistant to the stress of having electrical shocks (although only slightly.) Finally, DBS in another region, the striatum, had no antidepressant effect at all. That&amp;#39;s a bit odd because DBS of the striatum does seem to treat depression in humans - but the part of the striatum targeted here, the caudate-putamen, is quite separate to the one targeted in human depression, the nucleus accumbens.Hamani, C., Diwan, M., Macedo, C., Brand√£o, M., Shumake, J., Gonzalez-Lima, F., Raymond, R., Lozano, A., Fletcher, P., &amp;amp; Nobrega, J.

(A very nearby lake ‚Ä¶ the current configuration of the lake suggests that the volcano may have actually been beneath the lake at the time of the eruption).  &lt;/p&gt;

But donations given by Sunday are going to be matched by Hewlett-Packard.  There are two great projects I'd love to get funded by Sunday, and I can't see any reason why we can't do it.  If enough of us give a couple of bucks, we can get there in no time. Some donors have been freakishly generous, but a whole lot of 2 dollar donations can add up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

Being able to write coherently can make the difference between a good job and none at all.  Right now, there's about $220 left to go, and the Gates Foundation is matching!&lt;/p&gt;

They will use it to construct stories and create comic books, a very cleaver way to help kids learn English.  There's $272 left to go.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog gets around 2500 hits per day.

(See photo on right, from left to right) Author Max Brooks (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/World-War-Oral-History-Zombie/dp/0307346609"&gt;World War Z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zombie-Survival-Guide-Complete-Protection/dp/1400049628"&gt;The Zombie Survival Guide&lt;/a&gt;) moderated the evening.  On the panel were director/writer &lt;a href="http://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0001681/"&gt;George Romero&lt;/a&gt;, Epidemiologist &lt;a href="http://www.mathstat.uottawa.ca/%7Ersmith/"&gt;Robert Smith&lt;/a&gt;? (yes, his name has the question mark in it, no error there), and &lt;img src="javascript:void(0);" alt=""&gt;Medical Psychologist &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5286145/a-harvard-psychiatrist-explains-zombie-neurobiology"&gt;Dr. Steven Schlozman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SuHz_vq4LhI/AAAAAAAAAII/29lsIa1q0XQ/s1600-h/Survival-of-the-Dead-NOT.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:left;width:213px;height:132px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SuHz_vq4LhI/AAAAAAAAAII/29lsIa1q0XQ/s320/Survival-of-the-Dead-NOT.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The film, inspired by the classic western &lt;a href="http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0051411/"&gt;THE BIG COUNTRY&lt;/a&gt;, is legendary director George Romero's most recent installment in his zombie canon.  An allegory for the senselessness of war and a commentary on human nature, the film focuses on two feuding families on an island off the cost of the US after a zombie apocalypse.  Ideology on whether or not the zombies should die or be kept undead separates the two warring factions, however simple hatred for each other is what fuels their fighting at its root.  The film ultimately asks its audience to consider at what point we lose focus on why we fight and have war for war's sake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SuIMNjXm4-I/AAAAAAAAAIo/tbPPJqlZTlc/s1600-h/IMG_9610.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:252px;height:168px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SuIMNjXm4-I/AAAAAAAAAIo/tbPPJqlZTlc/s320/IMG_9610.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After the film, University of Ottawa's Dr. Robert Smith? and Harvard's Dr. Steven Schlozman spoke on the general "science" of zombies.  As it turns out, Dr. Smith? taught us, the only way to defeat the zombie pandemic is to hit it hard, repeatedly, and with increasing force.  Dr. Schlozman gave insight on why teenagers make bad choices and how their brains bare certain similarities to those of zombies - a real "ah ha" moment to parents in attendance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SuIM5lCEzLI/AAAAAAAAAI4/QtTbCldO5VQ/s1600-h/IMG_9609.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:226px;height:151px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SuIM5lCEzLI/AAAAAAAAAI4/QtTbCldO5VQ/s320/IMG_9609.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The night truly proved that there are teaching moments in every film.  From a flesh tearing zombie movie, the audience gained fun insight into the nature of viral spread and the best strategies to stop epidemics as well as a unique look into the inner workings of the human brain and psychology.  The scientists entertained as they educated and the audience laughed as they learned, which is at the heart of everything The Exchange hopes to achieve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all, the evening thrilled and enthralled, the perfect way to kick off a series of film screenings to be hosted by The Exchange.  Stay tuned for our next big event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/bAPABAYczkE%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-4509266339399281355?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let me define what I mean by skeptical inquiry, atheism and political philosophy. Skeptical inquiry, in the classic sense, pertains to the critical examination of evidential claims of the para- or super-normal. This means not just ghosts, telepathy, clairvoyance, UFOs and the like, but also ‚Äî for instance ‚Äî the creationist idea that the world is 6,000 years old. All these claims are, at least in principle, amenable to scientific inquiry because they refer to things that we can observe, measure and perhaps even repeat experimentally. Notice, of course, that (some) religious claims do therefore fall squarely within the domain of scientific skepticism. Also in this area we find pseudohistorical claims, such as Holocaust denial, and pseudoscientific ones like fear of vaccines and denial of global warming. Which means of course that some politically charged issues ‚Äî like the latter two ‚Äî can also pertain properly to skeptical inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;So far, so good.¬† But then he goes on to assert that the atheist position is not one that derives from ‚Äúskeptical inquiry‚Äù:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, let us turn to atheism. Once again: it is a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt;, not a scientific position. Now, I have argued of course that any intelligent philosopher ought to allow her ideas to be informed by science, but philosophical inquiry is broader than science because it includes non-evidence based approaches, such as logic or more broadly reason-based arguments. This is both the strength and the weakness of philosophy when compared to science: it is both broader and yet of course less prone to incremental discovery and precise answers. When someone, therefore, wants to make a &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; argument in favor of atheism ‚Äî like Dawkins and Jerry Coyne seem to do ‚Äî he is stepping outside of the epistemological boundaries of science, thereby doing a disservice both to science and to intellectual inquiry. Consider again the example of a creationist who maintains in the face of evidence that the universe really is 6,000 years old, and that it only &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; older because god arranged things in a way to test our faith. There is absolutely &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; empirical evidence that could contradict that sort of statement, but a philosopher can easily point out why it is unreasonable, and that furthermore it creates very serious theological quandaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm baffled.¬† But let‚Äôs be clear about what atheism is.¬† I‚Äôll call ‚Äúweak sense atheism‚Äù the position that, I think, most atheists hold.¬† It is this:¬† ‚ÄúThere is no convincing evidence for God, so I withhold belief.‚Äù¬† This can be further refined, as Dawkins does in &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;, into the statement, ‚ÄúThere could be lots of evidence for God, but none has appeared. Therefore I think it improbable that God exists.‚Äù¬† This is the stand that informs the atheist bus posters that read, in part, ‚ÄúThere probably is no God.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second form of disbelief, which I call ‚Äústrong sense atheism,‚Äù is the flat assertion, ‚ÄúI &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; there is is no God.‚Äù¬† Note that this elides a bit into the ‚Äúprobably-no-God‚Äù position, depending on how strong you think the evidence is.¬† The existence of suffering in the world, for example, convinces many, but not all, that there is not a &lt;em&gt;beneficent&lt;/em&gt; God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I don‚Äôt know &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; who is a strong-sense atheist.¬† Even Dawkins, as I recall, is a ‚Äú70% probability‚Äù man ‚Äî he thinks it pretty improbable that God exists, but adds that he can‚Äôt disprove the existence of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kinds of gods. I‚Äôm pretty much on board with him. ¬† You‚Äôd be a fool to say that you know &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; that there is no being up there at all, including one that doesn‚Äôt interfere in the workings of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let‚Äôs take weak-sense atheism (WSA) as the default stance.¬† In its very weakest, ‚Äúno-evidence-for-God‚Äù sense, WSA is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; scientific.¬† After all, what is science but the claim that one needs empirical evidence before accepting something as a reality? When one says, ‚ÄúI see no evidence for a god, and therefore refuse to accept his/her/its reality,‚Äù one is saying nothing different from, ‚ÄúI see no evidence for the view that plants have feelings, and therefore I don‚Äôt accept the idea that they do.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the ‚Äúprobabilistic‚Äù form of WSA?¬† That‚Äôs equally scientific.¬† If there &lt;em&gt;could be&lt;/em&gt; evidence for a phenomenon, but repeated investigations fail to give that evidence, one becomes less willing to accept that phenomenon. In this sense, being a WSA is no different from making a perfectly scientific claim like this: ‚ÄúI think it pretty improbable that the Loch Ness monster exists.‚Äù After all, if there were a giant reptile trapped in the Loch, presumably you could find it.¬† And people have tried. They‚Äôve looked underwater with cameras, hung around the lake trying to photograph it, and conducted sonar and satellite investigations.¬† Nothing has turned up.¬† In all probability, the Monster is a myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these searches, is it then a ‚Äúphilosophical position‚Äù to say that it‚Äôs highly unlikely that Nessie exists? I don‚Äôt think so.¬† It‚Äôs an evidence-based position ‚Äî in other words, a scientific one.¬† Similarly, the god that many people believe in, who is said to be beneficent, answer prayers, heal the sick, come back from the dead, and the like, is contradicted by evidence: the failure of prayer and spiritual healing, the existence of inexplicable evil, and so on.¬† There are a million ways that a theistic god could have shown itself to us Earthlings, but it hasn‚Äôt happened.¬† There is no more evidence for a world-touching God than for the Loch Ness Monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course we can‚Äôt refute, or find any evidence for or against, the existence of a purely deistic, hands-off God.¬† In this sense, saying that ‚ÄúGod certainly does not exist‚Äù &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a philosophical position.¬† But that‚Äôs not the most common form of atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not a philosopher, so maybe Massimo‚Äôs argument is more subtle than I perceive.¬† But I see my own non-acceptance of a deity as a purely scientific stance.¬† I believe it was Bertrand Russell who was asked, ‚ÄúBut what if you‚Äôre wrong about your atheism? What if you die and find yourself before God, who asks you why you didn‚Äôt believe?‚Äù Russell‚Äôs reply was, ‚ÄúNot enough evidence, Lord; not enough evidence.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;______________&lt;/p&gt;
