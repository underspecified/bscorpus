Marcus Raichle, who had initially discovered the default brain network, has a new review article in TICS, that argues that brain activity should be understood as primarily an intrinsic and proactive process rather than a reflexive or reactive process.

He bases this argument on the fact that resting brain consumes 20 % of body’s More &amp;gt;Rating: 0.0/10 (0 votes cast)

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Elia Ben-Ari of the &lt;a href="http://eliabenari.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;To Be Determined&lt;/a&gt; blog to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Elia Ben-Ari pic2.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Elia%20Ben-Ari%20pic2.JPG" width="336" height="448" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;Thanks for asking! I was born in Israel, came to the U.S. with my parents when I was two years old, and grew up mainly in suburban Long Island, New York. I went to graduate school at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where I learned to say y'all and met my wonderful husband. He and I have lived, worked, and played in the Washington, DC, area for the past 21 years--first in Maryland and now in Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a science writer and editor, focusing on the life sciences. Throughout my somewhat checkered career, I've always worked at communicating science clearly and accurately and, I hope, engagingly. I especially enjoy stories where science and the humanities intersect. I love learning new and cool things about biology and following the ups, downs, ins and outs (and gossip) of the science journalism world. I'm a somewhat shy extrovert and have learned that staying connected with people is crucial for my happiness and well being. As for my scientific background, I have an A.B. in biochemistry from Brown University and a Ph.D. in pharmacology from UVA. Signal transduction--that is, how cells convert signals from the outside to events inside the cell--was probably my first true love in science. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The farther along I got in grad school, the less convinced I was that I wanted to be a scientist. But, being stubborn, I finished my Ph.D. and mostly don't regret it. Like most people who've switched from doing science to writing about it, my interests were way too broad for me to be happy focusing on a tiny little area of research. I also was that annoying person who'd point out spelling errors and typos in other people's posters when they put them up in the hallway before going to a meeting. Writing my dissertation was a breeze compared to finishing up the lab work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way I got the idea that I might like being a science writer and conveying my enthusiasm for science to nonscientists, though I wasn't sure exactly what that involved. I applied for a science journalism fellowship but wasn't selected. So I decided to take a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Cancer Institute and see how that went. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years into a three-year postdoc, I was miserable. My husband encouraged me (that's putting it mildly) to quit complaining and find a job that I liked. I was incredibly lucky to land a job through an ad I saw in Science as Meeting Reviews Editor at a start-up cell and molecular biology journal, The New Biologist. I was nervous about leaving the lab, but have never looked back. We had a wonderful managing editor, Ruth Kulstad, who mentored me and taught me to edit less timidly. I invited scientists to write reviews of interesting meetings and worked with them in editing their reviews. I got to travel to a few scientific meetings and write about them, including one in the Swiss Alps, on signal transduction. It was a great first job. A year after I started, the journal went under and the five staffers were handed our severance packages. That was my introduction to the real world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Elia Ben-Ari pic1.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Elia%20Ben-Ari%20pic1.JPG" width="336" height="447" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;It's been more of a meander than a trajectory. After getting laid off from my first job in publishing and making lots of cold calls to network, I managed to convince some folks at the National Institutes of Health that I could write about science for the general public. As a science writer and public information officer for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), one of the smallest NIH institutes with one of the longest names, I learned a great deal about science and health communications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After five or so years at NIAMS and a couple of years as Deputy Director (i.e., low-level manager) of the public information office, I was ready for a change, and wanted to try my hand at science journalism. Energized by attending the &lt;a href="http://sciwrite.org/sciwrite/sciwrite.html" title=""&gt;Santa Fe Science Writing Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, I started searching for a job and was hired as Features Editor at &lt;a href="http://www.aibs.org/bioscience/" title=""&gt;BioScience&lt;/a&gt;, a monthly biology journal that has nothing to do with biomedical science.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of latitude at BioScience, and wrote about subjects ranging from &lt;a href="http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/bisi.1999.49.5.353" title=""&gt;elephant communication&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-55438506/better-than-thousand-words.html" title=""&gt;botanical illustration&lt;/a&gt; (one of my favorites), to &lt;a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25276000_ITM" title=""&gt;geomicrobiology&lt;/a&gt;. (Note: Most of the original articles/PDFs with illustrations are behind a paywall.) Another feature story I particularly enjoyed working on was about one of my favorite authors, &lt;a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-27549430_ITM" title=""&gt;Wallace Stegner, and his role in the conservation movement&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. One of the best parts of the job was talking to scientists about their work, and I always gathered way too much information for my stories. I also enjoyed working with the freelancers who wrote for the journal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at BioScience I applied for the &lt;a href="http://www.mbl.edu/sjp/" title=""&gt;Marine Biological Laboratory's science journalism fellowship&lt;/a&gt; in environmental science and was thrilled to be accepted. Thus followed a fun and stimulating week in Woods Hole, doing hands-on science that was very different from the lab work I was used to (I'd never had to don hip waders before), and talking science writing and journalism with other writers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left BioScience after some changes at the journal and decided to try my hand at freelancing. That was longer ago than I care to admit. As a freelancer I've done a wide range of writing and editing for various audiences (are you sensing a theme here?), including straight journalism and work for nonprofits and several NIH institutes. I wrote a couple of stories for the now-defunct health section of the Washington Post, and still write occasionally for BioScience. I helped the NY-based Alliance for Lupus Research launch a quarterly newsletter for its constituencies, wrote all the content for the newsletter, and did other writing for the organization. I wrote a short piece about &lt;a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1169/is_2001_August-Sept/ai_76817707/" title=""&gt;microbial biofilms&lt;/a&gt; for National Wildlife, and interviewed two malaria researchers visiting from Mali for a story I wrote for an NIH publication. Those are just a few of the highlights that spring to mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still trying to figure out what I want to be when I grow up. Meanwhile, my goal in my work remains to communicate clearly and accurately about science, and to do so as engagingly as possible. I also want to keep honing my writing skills, and maybe explore new forms of writing such as the personal essay. I want to continue learning new things and keep up with biology, new technologies, and the ever-changing landscape of science communication and journalism. And stay young forever, of course. But if I can't do that, I want to age gracefully. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the work front, at the moment I have a freelance contract to write part-time for the National Cancer Institute's Office of Communications and Education. I've been writing various materials for the public, which go up on the Web at &lt;a href="http://cancer.gov/" title=""&gt;cancer.gov&lt;/a&gt;. And I may soon have more work for another NIH institute. I'm hoping I'll still have time and energy to do some freelance journalism, and perhaps I'll decide to focus more on that again in the future. I'm open to new and interesting opportunities. I've also just become a board member for the DC Science Writers Association. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work is important, but it's not my life. I have too many other interests: spending time with my husband, friends, and family (and our cat, Minou), yoga, photography, reading (mainly fiction), theater, travel, cooking, cross-country skiing, getting outdoors and enjoying nature. I could go on. I often describe myself as a dabbler, but someone I know said I was a Renaissance woman, which sounds so much better, don't you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a dabbler--er, I mean Renaissance woman--I'm interested in just about everything related to science communication, including the use of the Web as well as more traditional media. I hope the Web will help in communicating science more effectively and engagingly to a larger public, because I think that's critical for an enlightened society. So many issues that we face in the world are related to science, and not enough people have the basic knowledge to understand those issues. If I can contribute to that knowledge in some small way, I'll be pleased. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came home from ScienceOnline2010 feeling reenergized and excited about communicating science, and decided to start a blog, which I called &lt;a href="http://eliabenari.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;To Be Determined&lt;/a&gt;. But I'm still figuring out how to keep up with it and what to write about. I don't see it as a central part of my work right now. It's more of an opportunity to experiment with my writing, which I mentioned is a goal, and perhaps show off some of my photos, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got hooked on Twitter about a year ago, after attending a panel discussion on social media for science writers at a DC Science Writers Association event. (As you know, I tweet as &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/smallpkg" title=""&gt;@smallpkg&lt;/a&gt;.) I then wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1525/bio.2009.59.7.19" title=""&gt;story on scientists and Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for BioScience, and that's what led me to you, Bora, and ultimately to the ScienceOnline2010 meeting. I view Twitter as being more for my professional side, and find it great for keeping up with what other science writers and people in the journalism and writing worlds are doing and saying, getting links to interesting blog posts and articles that I might not find otherwise, and connecting with all sorts of interesting people. I use Facebook mainly for social purposes, though I've posted links to some of my blog posts on Facebook as well as Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, all the online activity is a bit of a mixed blessing, though I see it as a net positive that is necessary for keeping up with the times and with my field. I love finding interesting, clever, or thought-provoking blog posts and stories about science and medicine. I enjoy being active on Twitter and Facebook and keeping up with people and events that way, but they can be a time sink and a great way to procrastinate on getting my writing assignments done. I try to contribute to Twitter when I can, rather than just lurking there, and I enjoy having an online persona via Twitter. I just wish I could get by on less sleep so I could spend more time online and get more work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favorites? Have you discovered any cool science blogs by the participants at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure, but I think the first science blogs I read may have been on the NY Times website. I started reading a lot more blogs after I began using Twitter. Many of the blogs I read are written by people who were at the conference, and I tend to dip in and sample sporadically and as time permits. I hate to name favorites, but some that I enjoy and find thoughtful are Ivan Oransky's &lt;a href="http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Embargo Watch&lt;/a&gt;, Gary Schwitzer's &lt;a href="http://www.healthnewsreview.org/blog/" title=""&gt;HealthNewsReview&lt;/a&gt;, Ed Yong's &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Not Exactly Rocket Science&lt;/a&gt;, DeLene Beeland's &lt;a href="http://sciencetrio.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Wild Muse&lt;/a&gt;, David Kroll's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/" title=""&gt;Terra Sigillata&lt;/a&gt;, David Dobbs's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/" title=""&gt;Neuron Culture&lt;/a&gt;, and of course your &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" title=""&gt;A Blog Around the Clock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What were the best aspects of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best aspects for me were meeting new and interesting people, the mix of participants from different fields, and the "un-conference," participatory nature of the sessions. I've rarely felt so comfortable chiming in at a meeting. It was also great meeting people whom I'd known only via Twitter until then. And as I mentioned, all the talk about blogging inspired me to start my own blog. The conference also gave me renewed energy for being a science communicator and participating in that community. As for next year, I think it will be a challenge to include as many people as possible while maintaining the relatively intimate nature of the conference. And who knows, I may even come up with an idea for a session for ScienceOnline2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_35.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/xGNV3_TO62I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271261084560"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=13869">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/54787fd543f4b6a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Neil deGrasse Tyson"/><title type="html">Neil Tyson sounds off NASA</title><published>2010-04-14T14:00:19Z</published><updated>2010-04-14T14:00:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/YytveoAllCs/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/14/neil-tyson-sounds-off-nasa/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My old friend Neil &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o"&gt;has something to say&lt;/a&gt; about NASA and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 12, 1961: Yuri Gagarin becomes the first man in space. That was 49 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 14, 1970: An oxygen tank disrupts on Apollo 13, causing a series of catastrophic malfunctions that nearly leads to the deaths of the three astronauts. That was 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 12, 1981: The first Space Shuttle, &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt;, launches into space. That was 29 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t yet born when Gagarin flew, and I was still too young to appreciate what was happening on board Apollo as it flew helplessly around the Moon instead of landing on it. But I do remember breathlessly awaiting the Shuttle launch, and I remember thinking it would be the next phase in our exploration of space. I was still pretty young, and hadn’t thought it through, but I’m sure had you asked me I’d have said that this would lead to cheap, easy, and fast access to space, and by the time the 21st century rolled around we’d have space stations, more missions to the Moon, and maybe even to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I hadn’t thought it through. Of all these anniversaries, that one is the least of the three we should celebrate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t get me wrong; the Shuttle is a magnificent machine. But it’s also a symbol of a political disaster for NASA. It was claimed that it would be cheap way to get payloads to space, and could launch every couple of weeks. Instead, it became frightfully expensive and couldn’t launch more than a few times a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a political problem. Once it became clear that NASA was building the Shuttle Transport System, it became a feeding trough. It never had a chance to be the lean space machine it should’ve been, and instead became bloated, weighted down with administrative bureaucracy and red tape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than that, though, to me it symbolizes a radical shift in the vision of NASA. We had gone to the Moon six times — seven, if you include Apollo 13 — and even before the launch of Apollo 17 that grand adventure had been canceled by Congress, with NASA being forced to look to the Shuttle. Ever since then, since December 1972, we’ve gone around in circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there’s a lot to be said for low Earth orbit. It is a fantastic resource for science, and I strongly think we should be exploiting it even more. But it’s not the goal. &lt;em&gt;It’s like walking halfway up a staircase, standing on your tiptoes, and admiring the view of the top landing.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep walking up those stairs. In 1961, the effects of space travel were largely unknown, but Yuri Gagarin took that chance. He was followed by many others in rapid succession. Extrapolating from his travels, by now there should be a business making money selling tours of the mountain chains around Oceanus Procellarum by now. Of the three anniversaries, looking at it now, Gagarin’s is bittersweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970 Apollo 13 became our nation’s &amp;quot;successful failure&amp;quot;. A simple error had led to a near tragedy, saved only by the experience, training, guts, and clever thinking on their feet of a few dozen engineers. They turned catastrophe into triumph, and now, four decades later, we can’t repeat what they did. Think on this: when the disaster struck their ship, the crew of Apollo 13 were over 300,000 kilometers from Earth.  Apollo 13 may have been a successful failure, &lt;em&gt;but it’s a failure we can’t even repeat today if we tried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written quite a bit about NASA’s future, including &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/02/01/president-obamas-nasa-budget-unveiled/"&gt;my support of Obama’s decision to cancel Constellation&lt;/a&gt;, the program that includes the next series of big rockets to take people into space. That may seem contradictory on its surface, but I support the decision because, in my opinion, Constellation was over budget, behind schedule, and had no clear purpose. The idea of going back to the Moon is one I very much strongly support, but I get the impression that the plan itself is not well-thought out by NASA. The engineering, sure, but not the political side of it. And it’s the politics that will always and forever be NASA’s burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a political decision to cancel Apollo. It was a political decision to turn the Shuttle from a space plane to the top-heavy system it is. It was a political decision to cancel the Shuttle with no replacement planned at all (that was done before Obama took office, I’ll note). It was a political decision that turned the space station from a scientific lab capable of teaching us how to live and explore space into the hugely expensive and bloated construction it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA needs a clear vision, and it needs one that is sturdy enough to resist the changing gusts of political winds. I’m hoping that Obama’s plan will streamline NASA, giving away the expensive and &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; duties it needs not do so that private industry can pick them up. The added money to go to science, again in my hopes, will spur more innovation in engineering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And NASA needs a goal. It needs to put its foot down and say &amp;quot;This is our next giant step.&amp;quot; And this has to be done hand in hand with the politics. I understand that is almost impossible given today’s political climate, where statesmanship and compromise has turned into small-minded meanness and childish name-calling on the Congress floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m old enough to remember when NASA could do the impossible. That was practically their motto. Beating the Soviets was impossible. Landing on the Moon was impossible. Getting Apollo 13 back safely was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the three anniversaries, Apollo 13 is the one we should be celebrating. I’ll gently correct what Gene Kranz said that day: failure really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an option, but not an &lt;em&gt;acceptable&lt;/em&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, at this very moment, those feats are all impossible once again. But for a time, they were not only possible, &lt;em&gt;we made them happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to do the impossible once again. &lt;/p&gt;

And &lt;b&gt;millions&lt;/b&gt; of Catholics worldwide appear to be demanding just that; the Vatican is under unprecedented pressure to make amends, modify its repellant ways, maybe usher in a true reformist pope in the wake of one of the ugliest "holy" leaders in recent history.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word I put in boldface is why the Catholic church will eventually be able to shrug this off as if nothing happened.  Even if 11 million Catholics angrily demand reform, that will mean &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church#Membership"&gt;99% of them&lt;/a&gt; are happy to keep on paying tithes to child rapists and their protectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if we are wildly optimistic and hope that this scandal will bring about the effective death of Catholicism in the United States and Europe, this hateful villainous institution will certainly retain its grip on Central and South America, where they may actually have some success convincing people that the &lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2010/04/even-associated-press-cant-be-neutral.html"&gt;problem is homosexuality&lt;/a&gt; rather than child rape.  And while currently only about 1/8th of the total number of Catholics in the world hail from Africa, this monstrosity is making rapid inroads there by infiltrating their self-destructive dogma on the backs of supposed humanitarian programs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, Catholicism is not in danger.  As Morford observes, millions of Catholics are voicing their outrage... but who fucking cares?  It will only be when &lt;i&gt;hundreds of millions&lt;/i&gt; of Catholics are sick of being told right and wrong by self-serving sadists that there will be any chance of meaningful reform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best we can realistically hope for is to reduce the influence of the Vatican over Western politics.  That's it, really.  This beast cannot be killed, but at least maybe we can protect our own children from it's claws, even as we watch helplessly as this abomination claims countless new victims in the developing world.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-4270021998246057905?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271259091072"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23378">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/83bbf41ba32e9aa0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Christian Conservative Pharmacy Closes Due to Lack of Customers</title><published>2010-04-14T15:00:42Z</published><updated>2010-04-14T15:00:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/14/christian-conservative-pharmacy-closes-due-to-lack-of-customers/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Divine Mercy Care Pharmacy in Fairfax, VA &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/12/AR2010041204107.html?hpid=news-col-blog"&gt;closed down last month&lt;/a&gt; because of a lack of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t help that there were two other pharmacies within walking distance.  But why are those pharmacies still in business while this one is closing its doors?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well… check out what the Christian pharmacy didn’t sell, courtesy of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/12/AR2010041204107_pf.html"&gt;Petula Dvorak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;… no birth control pills, no condoms, no porn, no tobacco and even no makeup…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes little sense to make another stop to fill a prescription across the street for moral reasons, especially considering that Kmart is probably a regular shopping place for even the most devout Christians…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The biggest negative was that convenience factor,” [Divine Mercy Care president John T.] Bruchalski said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the right reaction?  Do we laugh because they had to shut down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.  But we can spread the message that health providers shouldn’t decide what services they provide based on their religious preferences.  Not because of “conscience clauses,” but because it’s just bad for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ron Lindsay&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/sometimes_the_market_works/"&gt;makes a very good point&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Allowing health care workers to pick and choose among the services they will provide may not only set a dangerous precedent… but it also could result in denial of access to needed health care. &lt;strong&gt;In the instance of the Virginia pharmacy, there were obviously competing pharmacies available to provide the services patients desired. That may not be true in rural, isolated communities.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are places where pharmacies like this one are the only available option.  How scary is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, though, I’m not shedding any tears over the loss of this particular business.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;As for the bus tours, [Sal] Russo said “they work for us. It’s a great vehicle to go to a lot of places and get a lot of people involved and engaged. I am proud of what we do. Who else goes out there and motivates people and insinuates involvement and activity and actually is making a difference in what is going on?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It surprised me to see Mr. Russo taking credit for &lt;em&gt;insinuating&lt;/em&gt; something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant OED gloss for &lt;em&gt;insinuate&lt;/em&gt; is "To introduce tortuously, sinuously, indirectly, or by devious methods; to introduce by imperceptible degrees or subtle means".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary has "To introduce or otherwise convey (a thought, for example) gradually and insidiously".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merriam-Webster online has glosses of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 a : &lt;/strong&gt;to introduce (as an idea) gradually or in a subtle, indirect, or covert way &amp;lt;insinuate doubts into a trusting mind&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;b :&lt;/strong&gt; to impart or suggest in an artful or indirect way : imply &amp;lt;I resent what you&amp;#39;re insinuating&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 : &lt;/strong&gt;to introduce (as oneself) by stealthy, smooth, or artful means&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encarta has "to hint at something unpleasant or suggest it indirectly and gradually" or "to introduce yourself gradually and cunningly into a position, especially a place of confidence or favor".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that Mr. Russo would characterize his actions as "devious", "insidious", or "covert". Instead, he seems to have used &lt;em&gt;insinuate&lt;/em&gt; to mean simply &lt;em&gt;initiate&lt;/em&gt;. I looked around for other evidence of an &lt;em&gt;insinuate=initiate &lt;/em&gt;trend, but didn't find anything much, except for a completely different malapropism &lt;em&gt;insinuate=intimate&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;quot;H20 soluble liniment enhances a comfort as well as ease of insinuate activity…&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The political issue under discussion is the role of Russo, Marsh, and Associates in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_Express#Tea_Party_Express"&gt;Tea Party Express &lt;/a&gt;bus tours and various other "Tea Party" branded activities.  And as usual, we need to note that the word-substitution might have been the reporter's (or a spelling-corrector's) rather than the source's.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — I&amp;#39;m persuaded by Mr. Fnorter&amp;#39;s suggestion in the comments that the intended word might have been  &lt;em&gt;instigate&lt;/em&gt; — note that there was a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22insinuate%7Cinsinuates%7Cinsinuated%7Cinsinuating+revolution%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai="&gt;flap last year&lt;/a&gt; when Maxine Waters apparently said that Castro "insinuated revolution to kick out the wealthy", which seems to be a similar malapropism.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271256242091"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4daa13678a3f9ec2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Randi Speaks! ... on World Homeopathy Awareness Week.</title><published>2010-04-14T14:33:16Z</published><updated>2010-04-14T14:33:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/949-randi-speaks-on-world-homeopathy-awareness-week.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Well, it’s &lt;a href="http://www.worldhomeopathy.org/"&gt;World Homeopathy Awareness Week&lt;/a&gt;, and James Randi’s getting into the spirit of the thing with a video, viewable below.

But the attempt needs to be made anyway.  For one thing, it's the right thing to do.  For another thing, whatever excuse is made to prevent prosecuting the Pope for his role in the cover-up, that will expose a deep hypocrisy and a shocking injustice for all the world to see.  It will force the ICC and/or the gov't of the UK to in essence say, "We don't prosecute the Pope, ever."  If you can force them to come right out and say that, that's a victory for secularism -- after all, you can't have a public debate to change that which hasn't even been revealed.  Dawkins' and Hitchens' effort may not succeed in bringing the Pope to justice, but it will allow a public conversation to take place that was impossible before.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-5476986338578407433?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271254876152"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=31251">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6baabc529e5aa69c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="photography"/><title type="html">FREAK Shots: If They're Paying Me to Take Them ...</title><published>2010-04-14T13:45:56Z</published><updated>2010-04-14T13:45:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/freak-shots-if-theyre-paying-me-to-take-them/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">What's wrong with the second bag of chips?</summary><author><name>By FREAKONOMICS</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271254547793"><id gr:original-id="http://promega.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/titanic-and-lusitania-lessons-in-time-tragedy-and-survival/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/583ae66158ee2bb1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Titanic and Lusitania: Lessons in Time, Tragedy and Survival</title><published>2010-04-14T09:10:17Z</published><updated>2010-04-14T09:10:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/3yAW4NO9nyw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://promega.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/titanic-and-lusitania-lessons-in-time-tragedy-and-survival/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Ninety-eight years ago today, the R.M.S Titanic hit an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean and sank, taking with her 1,517 passengers and crew, and cementing her place in history forever.  Three years later on May 7, 1915, the R.M.S.

Dastrup and colleagues (2010) used a driving simulator task  in which the job was to maintain a set distance behind a lead vehicle (LV) displayed on the computer screen. The job was to stay abut two car lengths (given as 18 meters) behind the LV while accelerating to 55mph. My  Google U conversion calculation makes 55 mph out to be about 25 meters / sec. I would therefore estimate the closing time between the cars as about 0.4-0.5 seconds, depending on car length and how much space you assume between these lengths.  Thereafter the LV changed speed as depicted in the Figure 2 from the paper. 

The horizontal line sits at the 55 mph point and you can see that the speed of the LV varies up to about 59 mph and down to about 51 mph with the maximum change taking place over about 18-20 seconds. .  As with most of the literature on cognitive function in abstinent MDMA users the biggest challenge (and limitation) is that Ecstasy consumers also tend to use a wide range of other recreational drugs, many of which might have lasting effects on their own. Consistent with the better studies on the topic, this study used 

four groups of drivers: abstinent MDMA users, abstinent THC users, abstinent alcohol users, and non-drug using controls

Another problem with human user studies in general is that nobody has been exposed to exactly the same amount or variety of recreational drugs. So the researchers have to devise somewhat reasonable criteria to minimize contributions from other drugs while accepting that &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; populations are essentially impossible to find. Additional criteria and limits for the groups were given as:

MDMA poly substance users: These individuals used MDMA ≥5 times in the last three years, and may have used THC &amp;gt;10 times. They may have occasionally used drugs other thanMDMAand THC, but &amp;lt;30 times in their lifetime. The amount of any other drug use could not exceed that in which MDMA was used. For example, someone who used MDMA 10 times, but used THC 20 times, or

cocaine 30 times was excluded.

THC poly substance users: These individuals used THC ≥10 times in the last three years, but never used MDMA. Other drug use was

&amp;lt;30 times in their lifetime and did not exceed the number of times

they used THC.

Alcohol users: These individuals never used MDMA. They may have tried THC or other drugs, but only a few times (&amp;lt;6 times) in their lifetime. Alcohol use in this group was ≥6 alcoholic drinks per week. To control for tobacco use, we attempted to recruit equal number of participants who used alcohol and tobacco (&amp;lt;20 cigarettes per week) and who used alcohol but not tobacco (&amp;lt;1 cigarette per week).

Non-drug users: These individuals were similar to the alcohol users with respect to MDMA, THC or other drug use. The last time they used any drug (except alcohol or nicotine) was ≥12 months prior

to the study. The alcohol use in this group was ≤5 alcoholic drinks

per week.

If experience is any guide, some readers will want to kvetch about the impurity of the study populations. This is an inescapable feature of human subjects investigations (the design, not the kvetching). Where possible we&amp;#39;d like to follow up findings with controlled studies in laboratory animals performing much simpler behavioral tasks that share some critical feature such as velocity tracking or responding quickly and accurately to stop/go signals. That way the drug exposure would be both known and identical within a group. In my view, the combination of human and nonhuman studies gives us the quickest way to determine if a given substance to which humans are exposed leads to acute or lasting behavioral problems. 

There were several key parameters of the subjects&amp;#39; driving performance measured including coherence (are they tracking the speed changes of the LV), average following distance, delay (how long after the LV changes does the subject require to adjust speed) and gain (under/overshooting the changes of the LV- i.e. slowing too much or speeding up too much). Examples are given in Figure 3 which depicts three individuals&amp;#39; performance on the task relative to the LV speed. 

The only group results that were significantly different were in the delay and following distance parameters. MDMA (2.36 sec) and THC (2.2 sec) groups responded more quickly than did the ALC (3.1 sec) and control (3.4 sec) groups to changes in the LV speed. The MDMA users selected a much shorter following distance (91 ft) than did the THC (140 ft),  ALC (121 ft) and control (155 ft) groups. In both cases the differences were present even when statistically adjusting for age- and sex-related differences in performance of the task. 

So how to interpret theses findings? Well, responding more quickly to speed changes seems like a good thing when it comes to driving. Following more closely than you are supposed to seems like a bad thing. So are abstinent MDMA and THC users better drivers? Or is the MDMA group impaired relative to all other groups? 

One way to think about the tradeoff is as stated in the Discussion of the paper:

While all participants traveled approximately 55mph (80 ft/s), the MDMA drivers showed a mean 1.04 second shorter delay than non-drug using comparison drivers (leaving 83 more feet to respond) but drove 64 feet closer to the LV. Although abstinent MDMA users drove closer to the LV, they compensated for the risk of driving close by reacting quickly to the LV velocity changes.

To make a similar comparison, the THC group had 96 more feet in which to respond but only drove, on average, 15 feet closer, than did the control subjects. Remember, these are not people who are acutely intoxicated. There are only about three obvious hypotheses once we conditionally credit the group effects as specific to the groupings. First,  that the populations who self-select into these drug use conditions start off with altered risk-tolerance and attentiveness to driving. Second, it could be that the users are made that way via brain changes induced by their drug taking- some sort of toxicity. As it happens one reasonably well-populated  and productive areas of research on human drug users focuses on both pre-existing and drug-induced traits of impulsivity and risk tolerance.  Third, it could be that drug experienced individuals intentionally compensate for any real or perceived performance deficits they&amp;#39;ve noticed in their own driving by altering their attentiveness, riskiness or both. 

The more attentive / risk tolerant nature of the abstinent MDMA users&amp;#39; driving phenotype in this study is interesting to consider in the light of recent political efforts to ban cell phone use when driving. Those discussions have pointed to a few studies showing the detrimental effect of such distraction on one&amp;#39;s ability to react to changing circumstances. Drivers are also poor at cell phone use showing that the issue here has to do with the limits of your (39/40 of you anyway) brain allocating attention to multiple tasks. 

The point is, of course, that real world driving is a more demanding situation than is posed by the simulator used in this study of abstinent drug users. The next step will be to examine performance in a more multi-tasking type of situation. It may be that that MDMA and THC groups still perform faster...or perhaps they are already at the limit and additional cognitive demands overcome whatever compensations they have made.

It’s a feat that stretches your imagination of how one animal could exert that much control over the nervous system of another.

As it happened, I cam across a paper that might just go one better. Another insect is the victim (an ant, this time), but the Svengali isn’t another animal. It’s a fungus.

The fungus is Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, here pictured growing out of a very, very dead ant. Andersen and colleagues wanted to test one of Richard Dawkins’ famous ideas: that the idea of the “extended phenotype.” After infection, how precise is the ant’s subsequent change of behaviour? And can it be shown that this actually benefits the infecting agent in a way much greater than chance?

This fungus infects an ant species (Camponotus leonardi) that lives high up in the forest canopy, many meters above ground. But the corpses of infected ants were in very precise locations that were very different from the location of the ants in the colony: 

Jaws clamped into the vein of a leaf

Close to the ground (but not on it)

On the north-northwest side of a tree

It’s so precise, you almost can’t help but imagine the inside of the head of an ant, with a fungus sitting behind a steering wheel. The authors were able to show that this position was particularly advantageous to the fungus by moving the corpses of the ants to different locations, which quickly resulted in the bodies being lost to the wild.

The authors also did some detailed analysis of how the fungus spread through the ant’s body after the ant died. This is fascinating stuff, I’m sure... to a mycologist. But one key point is that the fungus can’t start reproducing until some days or weeks after the ant has died.

For me, this raises so many interesting neurobiological questions. Some seem fairly easy to explain, in principle; ending up on the north side of a plant is probably due to changing the animal’s response to light. The final “death bite” of the ant into a leaf seems particularly tricky to explain. What chemicals are the fungus releasing into the ant’s brain that is leading the ant to such specific locations, and perform such exacting behaviours?

And if all of that wasn’t enough specificity: there’s a few other ant species in the are (Polyrhachis spp.) that the fungus can infect, but rarely does. When those animals are infected, their corpses are found significantly higher in the trees than the preferred species. This hints that the fungus can’t control this ant species so well as the one it usually infects. Is this a difference in the brains of the ant, where the fungus infects, the cocktail the fungus produces, the immune response of the hosts, or something else?

Answering some of these neurobiological questions may be a bit tricky. Ants aren’t the easiest things to do neuro on – very small. But there will be some great questions for the masochistic scientist tilling to do it.

&lt;p&gt;Anil Dash is a &lt;a href="http://dashes.com/anil/about.html" title=""&gt;pioneer blogger&lt;/a&gt; (and of course &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/anildash" title=""&gt;twitterer&lt;/a&gt;) and the very first employee of &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/" title=""&gt;Six Apart&lt;/a&gt;, the company that built blogging platforms including MoveableType (which is used by Scienceblogs.com) and Typepad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before ScienceOnline2010, Anil made an official announcement that he will be leading &lt;a href="http://expertlabs.org/" title=""&gt;Expert Labs&lt;/a&gt; (also on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/expertlabs" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) which is a new project funded by &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/" title=""&gt;AAAS&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate feedback by the experts (including scientists, of course) to the Obama Administration and other government officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2009/1118expert_labs.shtml" title=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.observer.com/2009/media/dash-dc-tech-guru-will-head-govt-incubator-digitize-democracy" title=""&gt;early media coverage&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/11/anil-dash-crowdsources-social-networks-to-inform-public-policy/" title=""&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; is much better) , an &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2009/media/1118expert_labs_anil_transcript.pdf" title=""&gt;interview with Anil (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2009/media/1118expert_labs_interview.shtml" title=""&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, Anil got this job due to writing &lt;a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2009/08/the-most-interesting-new-tech-startup-of-2009.html" title=""&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; stating that the executive branch of the federal government of the United States was the "Most Interesting New Tech Startup of 2009". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of his session was for Anil to get feedback from the leaders of the science and Web community on how to make Expert Labs work the best it possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is all ready to go and the President - through Anil - needs you to act! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="unclesam.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/unclesam.jpg" width="336" height="448" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you - the scientists, engineers, physicians and other experts out there. It is time to use the online tools to give feedback to the Administration about the great challenges in science and technology and how to tackle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first, get informed, of course! Go to &lt;a href="http://expertlabs.org/" title=""&gt;ExpertLabs&lt;/a&gt; and look around. Read the &lt;a href="http://promo.aaas.org/expertlabs/grandchallenges.html" title=""&gt;AAAS explanation&lt;/a&gt;, then go to the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/grand-challenges-request-information" title=""&gt;White House site&lt;/a&gt; (and/or the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse" title=""&gt;White House Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;) and send in your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go to Twitter and  retweet and reply to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/whitehouse/status/12060530167" title=""&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; (just click &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/?status=@whitehouse&amp;amp;in_reply_to_status_id=12060530167&amp;amp;in_reply_to=whitehouse" title=""&gt;on this link&lt;/a&gt; and you are ready to go). If your thoughts take more space - post them on your blog or elsewhere online and tweet the link to it as a reply to that tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The White House is looking for scientists to help determine what Grand Challenges in science &amp;amp; technology should be a priority for our future. The President has identified a list of eight or so, but if you know of more, or think your area of expertise could inspire a great challenge, make sure your voice is heard!

&lt;p&gt;The good news is, giving feedback couldn't be easier; You can simply submit your suggestion via Twitter by replying to @whitehouse, or email challenge@ostp.gov. &lt;b&gt;Part of the goal here is to show the White House that using social networks to get our feedback can be effective.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to find out more about the effort or the technology behind it, the AAAS project Expert Labs has an explanation on their site at &lt;a href="http://expertlabs.org" title=""&gt;http://expertlabs.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ipXx_4I5l0" title=""&gt;a YouTube video about it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/5ipXx_4I5l0%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x006699%26color2%3D0x54abd6%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, please participate yourself, and ask your friends and colleagues to do the same. And also help spread the word online and offline, using whichever communication channels you are comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a

href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/no-conflict-between-science-and-faith/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If, as Francisco Ayala, the National Center for Science Education, and many accommodationists insist, there isn ‘t a conflict between science and faith, then they need to explain why Bruce Waltke, a professor at Florida’s Reformed Theological Seminary, was forced to resign after appearing in a BioLogos video that not only espoused harmony between faith and science, but also criticized those Christians who deny evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/04/09/video"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Higher Ed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Milton, president of the seminary’s Charlotte campus and  interim president of its Orlando campus, where Waltke taught, confirmed  that the scholar had lost his job over the video. Milton said that  Waltke would “undoubtedly” be considered one of the world’s great  Christian scholars of the Old Testament and that he was “much beloved  here,” with his departure causing “heartache.” But he said that there  was no choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton said that the seminary allows “views to  vary” about creation, describing the faculty members there as having “an  eight-lane highway” on which to explore various routes to  understanding. Giving an example, he said that some faculty members  believe that the Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;yom&lt;/em&gt; (day) should be seen in Genesis  as a literal 24-hour day. Others believe that &lt;em&gt;yom&lt;/em&gt; may be  providing “a framework” for some period of time longer than a day. Both  of those views, and various others, are allowed, Milton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  while Milton insisted that this provides for “a diversity” of views, he  acknowledged that others are not permitted. Darwinian views, and any  suggestion that humans didn’t arrive on earth directly from being  created by God (as opposed to having evolved from other forms of life),  are not allowed, he said, and faculty members know this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked if  this limits academic freedom, Milton said: “We are a confessional  seminary. I’m a professor myself, but I do not have a freedom that would  go past the boundaries of the confession. Nor do I have a freedom that  would allow me to express my views in such a way to hurt or impugn  someone who holds another view.” Indeed he added that the problem with  what Waltke said was as much his suggestion that religion will lose  support over these issues as his statements about evolution itself. (The  statement of faith at the seminary states: “Since the Bible is  absolutely and finally authoritative as the inerrant Word of God, it is  the basis for the total curriculum.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we can resolve this conundrum by telling the Reformed Theological Seminary that their faith isn’t “proper.”  Sounds like a job for Peter Hess.&lt;/p&gt;

Even simple games can teach them about strategy and competitiveness, as well as winning and losing. So, what about cheating? You might think it’s harmless to let you child skip ahead a few spaces in Candyland or have an extra turn at Operation, but is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hasbro.com"&gt;&lt;img title="candy-land" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/candy-land-300x191.jpg" alt="Candy Land" width="300" height="191"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Hasbro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After toddlerhood ends, it’s time your youngsters start to learn about playing by the rules. Though it may seem difficult to watch your five-year-old lose at Uno or Sorry!, in the long-run, it’s the best thing for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she tries to cheat, gently remind her that it’s against the rules and move on. After a few slip-ups, you child will quickly learn about fairness and cheating, and this is a skill that they can carry on into other areas of their life as they grow up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you allow your kids to cheat at fun games and other activities at home, they won’t be able to draw the line when it comes to more serious subjects – like schoolwork.&lt;/p&gt;

Starting in the early 1990s and continuing to today, there has been a steady rise in the number of children diagnosed with autism. Prior to 1990 the estimates of &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20021231/cdc-autism-rates-higher-than-thought"&gt;autism prevalence were about 3 per 10,000&lt;/a&gt;. The most recent estimates from the CDC and elsewhere now have the number at about &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1374"&gt;100 per 10,000, or 1%. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burning question is – why are the rates increasing steadily? There are those, particularly in the anti-vaccine community, who conclude that the increase in prevalence is a real biological effect – an epidemic – and is evidence for an environmental cause (which they believe is vaccines, even though the scientific evidence does not support this position). However, the evidence strongly suggests that the rising prevalence of autism is largely an artifact of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=95"&gt;broadening the diagnosis and increased surveillance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the data cannot rule out a small true increase in autism prevalence. Some hypothesize that increasing maternal and paternal age are contributing to the incidence of autism, but I will leave that question for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study now adds significant support to the surveillance hypothesis – Ka‐Yuet Liu, Marissa King, and Peter S. Bearman from Columbia University, &lt;a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/651448"&gt;publishing in the American Journal of Sociology&lt;/a&gt;, report that the risk of being diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) correlates with social proximity to another family with a child with an ASD diagnosis. For those interested in this topic, the full paper is worth a read. While it gets technical at times, the authors do an excellent job of reviewing this topic in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize their key points – they begin by reviewing the history of the autism diagnosis. They point out that historically, in the 1950s and 60s, the diagnosis of autism was stigmatized by psychogenic theories of causation (the infamous “refrigerator mothers”). But then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With hindsight, we can recognize that autism was increasingly destigmatized through the mobilization efforts of Bernard Rimland and the National Society for Autistic Children (NSAC), whose work refuted psychogenic theories of autism and set the stage for the research program that would identify autism as a neurological disorder (Dolnick 1998).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, prior to the 1970s parents actually mobilized their resources to avoid an autism diagnosis, and instead to seek a diagnosis of mental retardation (MR). This was not only to avoid stigma – the diagnosis of MR was attached to more public resources, while autism was left out in the cold. Then, this situation began to flip. Increasingly after 1990 ASD lost its stigma and became increasingly attached to access to public resources. Parents then began marshaling their resources to obtain an ASD diagnosis, rather than an MR diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu et al discuss that this interpretation of the history of ASD makes a number of predictions, and they sought to test those predictions. They are not the first to do so, and others have demonstrated (which they review) that as ASD diagnoses increased &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/117/4/1028.pdf"&gt;there was diagnostic substitution&lt;/a&gt; – other related diagnoses, such as MR, decreased. Autism prevalence has increased uniformly in all age groups. If an environmental cause was at work, younger age groups should have disproportionately increased. When the same diagnostic criteria are applied autism &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15930062?ordinalpos=12&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;incidence is largely stable over time&lt;/a&gt;. Increasing caseloads of ASD &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19737791?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3"&gt;correlate with times when the diagnostic criteria are expanded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study authors now go further – looking at the pattern of ASD diagnoses sociologically. They hypothesized that if the increasing rate of ASD is due to sociological, rather than biological, factors then proximity should play a role. That is exactly what they found – a child who lives 250 meters from another child who has been diagnosed with autism is 42% more likely to be diagnosed, and if they live between 250 and 500 meters of another child, they have a 22% increased chance of being diagnosed. Basically, being close to a family with an ASD child provides access to information that allows other parents to more efficiently mobilize their resources to seek an ASD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because obtaining an ASD diagnosis is not always easy or automatic. Many ASD children, on first presentation to a pediatrician, are not diagnosed. Some doctors are more likely to make the diagnosis than others. And school systems may delay diagnosis as well. Parents who therefore pursue a diagnosis more aggressively are more likely to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, an infectious agent would also spread through proximity, so they tested this possibility by looking at specific features that should differ. For example, the sociological spread hypothesis predicts that the proximity effect should be greatest at the milder end of the spectrum. More clear cut cases are likely to be diagnosed regardless of parental resources or effort, while milder cases will be highly dependent on these factors. They found that the proximity effect existed only among the milder end of the spectrum, and was absent for more severe children. They also found that the effect obeyed school districts – so proximity across a school district demarcation did not confer increased chance of having an ASD diagnosis. Further, they found that children with an ASD diagnosis had similar referral sources to other ASD children with proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this points to the fact that parents obtain information from other parents in their neighborhood about which doctors to see, what questions to ask, and how to interface with the school system most effectively to obtain an ASD diagnosis and the increased services that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study adds powerful evidence to the conclusion that the increasing incidence of autism is largely due to sociological factors rather than a true increase in the incidence of autism. This does not rule out a true increase also hiding in the data, but rather demonstrates that sociological factors are a significant contributor. This study must also be put into the context of the many other studies supporting the conclusion that the dramatic increase in ASD is due largely to increased surveillance and expanded diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also not previously aware of the extent of the effect that social stigma has played. Previously parents avoided an autism diagnosis and sought an MR diagnosis, while today the situation is reversed, and the evidence shows the diagnostic substitution we would expect to be the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another prediction of the sociological hypothesis is that eventually autism incidence should level off – once diagnoses are saturated. We are probably getting close to that point now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this also means that scientists are justified in focusing their research efforts on characterizing the genetic risks and causes of ASD. Further, calls for a shift in emphasis to environmental causes based upon the premise that there is an autism epidemic are not valid in light of this research. This does not mean that environmental contributors should not be explored – it is often practical to cover all the bases in medical research – but a significant shift in resources is likely not justified.&lt;/p&gt;

I guess it's something he's never experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/04/12/chopra041210.DTL"&gt;Chopra has a little story to tell&lt;/a&gt;. It seems colobus monkeys have discovered that eating charcoal absorbs some of the irritating toxins in their diet, so the monkeys have been chowing down on the stuff for several generations. This is cool and clever, but not at all surprising — organisms adapt and take advantage of their environment all the time. But Chopra being Chopra has to put a very weird spin on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He argues that the behavior isn&amp;#39;t genetic, because it&amp;#39;s too recent — not quite right, novel mutations have to arise sometime, but in this case I agree with him that it isn&amp;#39;t likely to be genetic, because it spread more rapidly through the population than genes do. Then he claims that it can&amp;#39;t have been by chance, because, he claims, monkeys don&amp;#39;t eat random stuff. There, of course, he&amp;#39;s wrong — it&amp;#39;s practically a hallmark of monkeys that they are curious and try all sorts of things. What he then tries to do from this fallacious exclusion, though, is leap to an amazing conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we are witnessing is an intelligent discovery on the part of creatures who stand far below Homo sapiens on the evolutionary chain, and that discovery is being passed on from mother to child without genetic adaptation. To me, this means that quite a blow has been struck for intelligence being innate in the universe. It suggests that evolution itself has never been random but is guided by the principle of intelligence -- not "intelligent design," which is a red herring supplied by religious conservatives. The intelligent universe is a cutting-edge idea, not a throwback to scripture. As a theory, it gives us a much more elegant explanation for many things that are clumsily explained by falling back on randomness to explain every new development in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monkey discovers new material in its habitat, charcoal left by human fires. Monkey eats some. Monkey discovers it has soothing effect on its guts. Monkey eats more, more monkeys watch and learn, habit spreads through population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it. That's the simple story. From this, Chopra invents this bizarre idea that an intelligent universe is pushing clever ideas into monkey brains, and is guiding 'evolution'. It's a crazy claim spun out of a fairly straightforward observation of entirely natural behavior by some monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chopra doesn't know what evolution is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, evolutionary theory refuses to abandon the notion of random selection, and geneticists cling stubbornly to the doctrine of random mutations to explain why new things appear in the unfolding story of life. We all have a stake in this argument, however. Seeing the red colobus evolve before our eyes cannot be denied. It didn't happen randomly, and their new discovery represents a quantum leap forward in their survival. There's much to think about here, since we want to know how early humans made their first discoveries and passed them on to us. Rather than saying that a larger brain made intelligence possible, why not say the opposite, that intelligence dictated a larger brain so that it could expand? Life moves forward inexorably, no one doubts that. Now it's up to us to explain the hidden forces behind evolution, in hopes that we can tap those forces and guide our own future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colobus story is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; an example of evolution at all — it involves no changes in, or transmission of, heritable traits in a population. It is explainable entirely in terms of simple behavioral plasticity, and requires no intervention by an external intelligence, challenges absolutely nothing in evolutionary theory, and doesn&amp;#39;t demonstrate any hidden forces. If he were to try and present such a fable at a scientific meeting, he&amp;#39;d be laughed out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only mystery here is why newspapers like the San Francisco Chronicle continue to publish his drivel. Is someone under the misapprehension that he is a respected or even credible thinker? He's a loon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--It&amp;#39;s the 30th Anniversary of the Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube, and the USA Science &amp;amp; Engineering Festival is planning a You CAN Do the Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube tournament in Washington, D.C., October of 2010. Teams from Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia are eligible to compete. Here&amp;#39;s a video from the first You CAN Do the Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube tournament held this spring in San Diego.

&lt;p&gt;Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube creator Professor Erno Rubik will receive a Lifetime Science and Math Education Achievement Award from the Festival, for creating a tool that teaches students perseverance as well as fractions, ratios, algebra and geometry. Rubik, a Hungarian professor, is coming to the USA Science &amp;amp; Engineering Festival for his first public appearance at a student competition in more than two decades. You CAN Do the Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube winners will receive their awards from Rubik.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The You CAN Do the Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube competition will be held on the National Mall during the final two days of the USA Science &amp;amp; Engineering Festival, which runs from Oct. 10-24, 2010. Competition details include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;* Deadline to Sign-Up&lt;/b&gt;: Deadline for the USA Science &amp;amp; Engineering Festival&amp;#39;s You CAN Do the Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube contest is May 31, 2010&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;* Eligibility&lt;/b&gt;: Teams from Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C. and West Virginia can enter the tournament. There are two competition age brackets: Elementary and middle school students and high school students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;* Tournament Format&lt;/b&gt;: Teams will be competing for the fastest time to solve 25 Rubik's Cubes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   &lt;b&gt;* Schedule&lt;/b&gt;: The Preliminary Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube Tournament is Thursday, Oct. 21, 2010 at the National Electronics Museum and six finalists will compete for the championship on Saturday, Oct. 23, 2010 on the National Mall at the USA Science &amp;amp; Engineering Festival Expo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;* Prizes&lt;/b&gt;: Prizes ranging from $100-$1,000 in education grants will be awarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty years after its introduction to America, more than 350 million Rubik&amp;#39;s Cubes have been sold worldwide. It is used as an educational tool in 50 states, thousands of K-12 schools and hundreds of Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs of America as well as the YMCA&amp;#39;s after-school programs. The new You CAN Do The Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube initiative is a U.S. campaign aimed at teaching youth how to solve the Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube as they learn skills such as team work and problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;

Actually, he's an old "friend" of many skeptical blogs, both here on ScienceBlogs and around the blogosphere. In fact, it's a man so steeped in only the finest quantum woo that I once coined a name for it: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/deepak_chopras_wooful_whine.php"&gt;Choprawoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we're talkin' Deepak "Quantum Consciousness" Chopra! He's back and woo-ier than ever in--where else?--that repository of woo, quackery, and anti-vaccine lunacy, The Huffington Post in an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/a-little-boost-for-immort_b_525989.html"&gt;A Little Boost for Immortality&lt;/a&gt;, which, as he usually does, he &lt;a href="http://www.intent.com/deepakchopra/blog/little-boost-immortality"&gt;posted to his own blog&lt;/a&gt;. It's definitely primo grade A Chopra, which means that it's a full frontal assault on science, reason, and his readers neurons. It's yet another apologia for immortality. Now, it would be fine if he had simply argued that on the basis of faith he believes that there is life after death. However, deluding himself that he's a "man of science," Chopra keeps trying to produce "scientific proof" that there is life after death. The results have always been embarrassing. Predictably the results this time are equally embarrassing, perhaps even more so. He begins, annoyingly enough, by once again abusing information theory:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_return_of_the_living_chopra_woo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_return_of_the_living_chopra_woo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/JbNRjG7kOxk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271243998109"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23368">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/400c297f3ee128a1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="FFRF"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Behind the Scenes: FFRF’s Dan Barker on The Daily Show</title><published>2010-04-14T11:00:47Z</published><updated>2010-04-14T11:00:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/14/behind-the-scenes-ffrfs-dan-barker-on-the-daily-show/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, about a month ago, the &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org"&gt;Freedom From Religion Foundation&lt;/a&gt;’s co-president &lt;strong&gt;Dan Barker&lt;/strong&gt; appeared on &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt; to talk about the group’s campaign to fight the &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/01/28/atheist-group-blasts-postal-service-mother-teresa-stamp/"&gt;Mother Teresa stamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current issue of &lt;em&gt;Freethought Today&lt;/em&gt;, Dan &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DailyShow.pdf"&gt;explains what happened behind-the-scenes&lt;/a&gt; (PDF):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you saw me representing the Freedom From Religion Foundation on that silly segment of “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” on March 8, you might wonder what the heck we were thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very nice self-described atheist staffer called to say they were interested in doing a segment about our complaint to the U.S. Postal Service that the Mother Teresa stamp scheduled to be released this summer violates postal regulations against honoring predominantly religious figures. When we learned the interview would be conducted by “correspondent” Jason Jones, we realized they were planning one of those comic segments in which they lampoon the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old adage is that any publicity is good publicity. Annie Laurie, as a “Daily Show” aficionado, knew of course that the fake news segments don’t aim to please, they just take aim. She told them we might agree if they would do the taping at our office — thinking that way FFRF visuals and messages would survive the editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we polled the FFRF office, our mostly young staff said “Yes!” Annie Laurie still had reservations and I had mixed feelings (mostly positive — I’m such a ham), but even 83-year-old President-Emerita Anne Gaylor voted yes. Then they told us that Jason Jones was going on vacation so the only way was for one of us to fly to New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agreed to do it because it would at least give FFRF and the issue some attention. Besides, I was excited to see “The Daily Show” studio, meet the staff and watch how they do their jobs. They flew me to New York City in mid-February (first-class on the return flight), and put me up in a nice Manhattan hotel, so it was a bit of an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annie Laurie loaded me down with FFRF T-shirts, books, bumper stickers, hats and magnets. When I showed these to the writer and producer (Miles Kahn and Asaf Kastner), I asked if there were any ethical concerns with the media accepting gifts. “You seem to be confusing us with a real news outfit,” Asaf said as he grabbed the materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the staff seemed sympathetic with FFRF — in fact, they told me that half of them are atheists and that the writers agreed with our complaint — but before they could snatch up the goodies, Miles told them to wait until after the taping because he might want to use some of it for B-roll and cutaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a nice talk with Jon Stewart. Well, not a talk. We didn’t even meet. Jon said “Hi, guys!” as he passed quickly through the lunch room where we were talking. He was probably too nervous to meet me in person. So I’m counting that as a talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miles showed me the huge studio where the show is taped, but my interview wasn’t conducted there. We went down to the basement where two cameras were set up in what amounts to a hallway next to the restrooms. Jason and I sat facing each other with a camera behind each of us. It was eerie down there with the main lights off and the spots aimed at us. A couple of times we had to stop and start over because footsteps could be heard above us. “Is someone taking dance lessons in the stairwell?” Miles yelled. The writers and producers sat close by, monitoring the entire conversation, which lasted almost two and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had given Jason about 30 questions to ask, which covered virtually my entire life history — why I left the ministry to become an atheist, the difference between atheism and agnosticism, the purposes and activities of the Foundation, the views of the Founding Fathers, the meaning of the First Amendment and much more. More than an hour passed before we even got to the topic of Mother Teresa. (I supposed the editors would later be combing through that material for any useful or funny comments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They treated me with respect and dealt with the issues in a serious matter, though it was obvious Jason was fishing for the joke. I eventually told him I thought the writers were the real brains of the show, and he said, “That’s true. I’m just an actor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were talking about FFRF’s billboard campaign, Jason looked up and said, “When my 3-year-old daughter saw your Heathens’ Greetings billboard, she broke into tears. What am I supposed to tell her about that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your 3-year-old daughter can read?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She is very smart,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does she know what the word ‘heathen’ means?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She is very smart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, you tell your daughter that America has a richness of viewpoints, all of which are protected by the Constitution.” (I am reconstructing these comments from memory. It was a long interview.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What if I pulled out a gun and shot you in the stomach right now? Would you cry out to God?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would cry for medical help,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no medical help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, there are atheists in foxholes,” I replied, and told him about the time Annie Laurie almost died the day our daughter was born, when we never once thought of praying to a deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finally got around to the issue, Jason held up a large image of the stamp of Mother Teresa in her nun’s habit, and said, “So this is your big complaint?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is one of many issues we are complaining about,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This!?” he said, keeping the stamp in view, staring at me blankly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Foundation makes many complaints,” I said. “It’s not our most important issue and we are not taking legal action over it, but it does represent the kind of state-church violation our members are concerned about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wouldn’t quit. He probably asked me that same question five times, holding up the stamp. “This?” We went back and forth for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is how you want to convince the world to become atheists?” he said, thrusting the stamp closer to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said. “This complaint is aimed at the Post Office. But it doesn’t hurt the world to learn the truth about how a mediocre woman is being transformed into a saint for purely religious reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again he asked, “So this is what you are complaining about?” holding up the stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally said, “Yes, this is one of many issues the Foundation is concerned about.” Then I realized that he was fishing for the word “Yes.” Sure enough, when the segment aired, they cut it at the comma so it looked like I said “Yes!” — this is the Foundation’s big issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explained that our complaint to the Postal Service is based on the violation of its own guidelines for commemorative subjects. For starters, Mother Teresa was not an American citizen. She was not born in this country, nor did she reside here, pay taxes or vote in the U.S. (although she did come here, not to any of her own clinics, for first-class medical treatment when she was ill). The Post Office, however, has justified this exception by pointing out that President Bill Clinton made Mother Teresa an “Honorary American.” When I mentioned that fact, Jason said, “Is there nobody he won’t bang?” (They didn’t use that line in the final segment!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff seemed genuinely interested in the factual claims about Mother Teresa. I held up Christopher Hitchens’ book The Missionary Position as one example that documents the inferior quality of her clinics, her lack of financial accountability and her cozy association with corrupt politicians such as Haiti’s “Baby Doc” Duvalier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned how she pleaded with the court for leniency in the sentencing of convicted financier Charles Keating because he was a good man who had given her $1.25 million, and how when the court asked her to return that stolen money, she declined to reply. We don’t know where that money went, but we do know that she spent millions to build new convents named in her honor and increase her religious order while she spent considerably less on real charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mother Teresa did some good,” I agreed, “but her real genius was as a powerful PR machine for the population policies of the Roman Catholic Church.” In her Nobel Prize acceptance speech, she was more concerned about condemning legal abortion than feeding the hungry. What did she actually do for world peace? Soon after that speech she went to Ireland to tell them that their best hope for peace was for everyone to return to the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Daily Show” staff seemed surprised and sincerely interested when I spoke about the documentation of shoddy “medical” practices at her clinics. They asked me to repeat the story about how the nuns at her hospital for the dying (which has posted the words “Today I am going to heaven” on the wall — some hospital!) were secretly baptizing all patients, including Hindus and Muslims, pretending to be cooling their foreheads with a wet cloth while performing the religious ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jason held up the stamp of Martin Luther King Jr., I countered that he was honored for leading the civil rights movement, not for religion, and besides, he was an American. With Mother Teresa, it was the other way around: Her charity work was secondary to her religious mission, and she said so many times. Her small Calcutta orphanage, she said, was a front line in the fight against abortion and birth control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason asked me about all of that, and more, but none of it got into the final segment. They showed the Martin Luther King Jr. stamp on the air, but not my response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we jumped into a taxi and followed the camera crew van to the main General Post Office (ZIP code 10001) at 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Avenue and 33&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Street, where we spent about half an hour taping various scenes, some of which made the cut. It’s hard to see, but I’m actually reading Hitchens’ book with the photo of Mother Teresa on the cover, standing on the steps of that huge stately building with its famous inscription: “Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One scene which didn’t make it: Jason and I walking casually down the steps and he asks, “So what are you asking your members to do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are asking them to write letters of complaint to the Post Office,” I reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stops and stares at me and says, “Letters to the Post Office?” Then he backs off and says, “You’re in on it!” As I stand there, he turns and runs away from me, hopping over the railing in the distance (accidentally banging his shin in the process). I thought that was very funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of passersby stopped to watch, thinking we were filming a movie. As we were leaving, one of their young interns told me, “This is the funnest day of work I have ever had in my life!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they didn’t use most of that outdoor footage. They decided to turn the skit into a “Dan Brown Da Vinci Code conspiracy theory” spoof and filmed a lot of other movie-like scenes, leaving little chance for my stellar acting to impress the Academy. Perhaps if I had been more of a nutcase during the interview, they would have kept the focus on FFRF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw the final segment, I was surprised to hear myself using the word “conspiracy.” That was one word I was definitely planning to avoid. I remember Jason pestering me for a long time about the “Catholic conspiracy” to get Mother Teresa on a U.S. postage stamp. Although it is no secret that the Catholic Church does have a lot of influence, we don’t know what, if any, strings were pulled to get it to happen. In one sense, all religions are conspiracies, and I must have said something about that, using “conspiracy” with a lower-case “c.” Sure enough, they got that line into the final cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see how they did it. After the interview, they had us remain seated for about 20 more minutes while they fed Jason a bunch of lines to repeat and questions to ask, telling me to remain silent and not reply. They were clearly planning to do some creative editing. It’s not hard to make the answer to one question sound like an answer to another question. I later met one of the editors and said, “So, I bet you are the one with the real power here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s right,” he said. “If I want, I could make you say ‘I… like… altar…boys.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The segment ended up more of a spoof of Dan Brown’s books than of our group, although the apparent guilt by association was plainly intentional. A few disappointed viewers wrote to say, “Didn’t you know that would be a setup?” (My sister-in-law, Nancy, a library administrator, couldn’t stop laughing over the silly “conspiracy montage” when my beaming, lit-up face pops up suddenly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the end, most of the comments we received were positive. Any exposure to freethought, state-church separation, and criticism of religion — even light-hearted poking fun at ourselves — is welcome in our faith-drenched world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the taping, Asaf thanked me for being such a good sport. He and I both know that FFRF would have wanted a more serious airing of the issues, but we also know that comedy is comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you very much again for your patience and for participating in the process,” he said in an e-mail. He also mailed us several photos, including one I’d brought along of the entire FFRF staff, signed by Jason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we win our National Day of Prayer lawsuit, perhaps they will call us again. There is certainly nothing funny about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. Is there?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, if you are searching for ‘The One’ or ‘Channel 7’s Psychic Show’ and want to know what it was REALLY like behind the scenes and how absurd the experience was? You’re in the right place. Enjoy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The One is on Channel 7, Tuesdays at 7.30pm. &lt;a href="http://skeptics.meetup.com/163/boards/thread/5027217"&gt;There was even a Meetup in Sydney to herald in the show!&lt;/a&gt; Saunders phoned me after the group’s screening in Sydney to remind me that the fabulous blogger &lt;a href="http://flopearedmule.net/2008/07/andrew-daddo-is-no-harry-houdi.html"&gt;Flop-Eared Mule was in the studio for some of the recordings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this will most certainly be a viewer’s review of the TV Show ‘The One’, but you must check out &lt;a href="http://flopearedmule.net/2008/07/andrew-daddo-is-no-harry-houdi.html"&gt;her blog&lt;/a&gt; for the inner sanctum sanatorium! She even recommends the &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2007/11/john-edward-jam.html"&gt;Psychic Show Bingo Game&lt;/a&gt; for your additional viewing pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar with live-blogging? Check out &lt;a href="http://blandcanyon.blogspot.com"&gt;Bland Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. That woman deals out the kind of justice that &lt;em&gt;Australia’s Next Top Model &lt;/em&gt;deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the wonders of&lt;em&gt; teh intertubes&lt;/em&gt;, you can get all the dish about what these so-called psychics fish for our entertainment purposes. And fishy they certainly already are, by the conclusion of the first hour.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Did their name sound like ‘una’? Anyone got an ‘una’?…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.wallsend.net/Fishing%20on%20Solway.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="182"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode one begins with, well, with what looks like the members of a Baroque prog-rock group, standing on a hill, filmed via helicopter. Booming music, multiple angles dizzily circling them… Could it be… &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_Fire"&gt;Arcade Fire&lt;/a&gt; are touring??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no. It’s just &lt;a href="http://au.tv.yahoo.com/b/the-one/8/judgerichard-saunders"&gt;Australia’s Next Top Want To Be Recognized As A Psychic&lt;/a&gt; – or ‘ANTP’ for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll be doing the Catwalk-Cold-Reading challenges, a few Go-Sees (for lost children) whilst host Andrew Daddo throws copies of the horoscope section from Vogue, screaming that they’re a disgrace to the profession if they &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; eat ectoplasm again. Don’t want no dead people coming over from the other side saying ‘&lt;em&gt;tch, cellulite &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_panty_line"&gt;VPL&lt;/a&gt;, honey….&lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Whilst Daddo strikes a pose as if there’s nothing to it (big feature globe screen behind him, which I hope will roll forward during a particularly cringe-worthy cold-reading session and squish someone, à la ‘&lt;em&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark&lt;/em&gt;‘) – we are apparently going to be privy to people who will ‘&lt;em&gt;showcase their abilities in a way you never have seen before’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Straight face. Serious show.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We brought the best of the best together’ says Andrew Daddo! Apparently the call went out and they had tests – &lt;em&gt;can they identify sealed photos? Pinpoint a hidden person? Diagnose a medical history by just looking? &lt;/em&gt;Yes indeed, ‘…not everyone believes’, which is probably a good thing considering that you didn’t specify &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; these tests were conducted or how a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeND2djUnZ4"&gt;magician / mentalist can quite easily demonstrate one such trick on YouTube.&lt;/a&gt; But eh, let’s see how it goes now that they’re on the telly. Besides, I was getting kind of nauseated with all the blurred footage of extreme-closeups of eyes, hands, noses and wiggly fingers waving bits of mystical paper about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;To be as balanced as possible, we have two judges from each side of the spectrum…&lt;/em&gt;‘ – uh, no you don’t, Daddo. Richard Saunders the “Skeptic” indicated that he’s clearly in the middle of any ’spectrum’ regarding belief in psychics. He has an open mind and hopes that the psychics can show something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daddo&lt;/strong&gt; – ‘You want to believe?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saunders&lt;/strong&gt; – ‘I’d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to believe.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, Stacey Demarco, the ‘&lt;a href="http://themodernwitch.blogspot.com/2008/07/wowbig-reaction-and-it-hasnt-even.html"&gt;author and teacher of metaphysics’&lt;/a&gt;. She’s the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; judge. Daddo does an odd little roll-of-the-eyes and ‘woooo!’ whistle in her introduction, before Stacey says with passion that ‘&lt;em&gt;I already &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; that we live in a world where there are psychics with incredible abilities and I have &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; doubt that you’re going to see that over the next few weeks&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There is no funny. Got it?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daddo leaves it at that. What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; that about close-mindedness again? Don’t ask me what he meant by &lt;em&gt;‘one is born to believe, one is born to question’…&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href="http://podblack.wordpress.com/2008/04/27/women-and-superstitions-part-two/"&gt;as if a variety of influences&lt;/a&gt; isn’t going to play a part in the makeup of both of these people… &lt;strong&gt;Oh, &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; On with the show!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potentially super-seven flash their verbal CVs and home-towns in superimposed background. Some really aren’t suitable for their characters, such as one woman who proudly outs herself as a witchcraft practitioner, whilst a backdrop of a &lt;em&gt;church&lt;/em&gt; floats ominously in the background… yike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each contestant doesn’t just toot their own horn around the medium’s table – everyone comes with a personal ‘guarantor’ of some sort, either a client or friend who bangs on about ‘&lt;em&gt;yes, YES, they’re so REAL&lt;/em&gt;!’ but whether having your own fan-club of one for The One is part of the package, isn’t entirely made clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I got turned into a newt! And they made me better!’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;]&lt;img src="http://www.affordablehousinginstitute.org/blogs/us/Holy_grail_witch_burn_small.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="155"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helicopters! Potential hypothermia! A little girl once went missing in the wild Australian bushland! We’ve all heard it in the news before, with big thanks to our rescue volunteers and services who answer the call. Yet mother-of-once-lost-child tells us (with heartfelt hugging of her blonde now-found-cherub), how she would have accepted any help, &lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; a psychic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could&lt;/em&gt; psychics find a boy? With only fifteen minutes on the clock, a personal belonging of the kid as a ‘talisman’ and a setting of typical rough Australian bush? Snakes, &lt;a href="http://www.austmus.gov.au/factsheets/trapdoor_spiders.htm"&gt;trapdoor spiders&lt;/a&gt;, dingoes, dropbears and hoopsnakes not included, ’cause it’s a family-show. Although one of the ANTP’s recognises that plowing headfirst into a grass-tree whilst looking isn’t the &lt;em&gt;smartest&lt;/em&gt; thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saunders nods as he agrees that he was involved in the setting up of this first test, which features a child-actor rugged up in so many hypothermia blankets that he’s practically ready for the oven at gas mark 4. &lt;strong&gt;Game on ANTP’s to find him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[In fact, the child actor looks oddly like a baby Daddo, all seriousness and intent - they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; need to find me! And bring me my toys! &lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;! When it comes to Daddo's, they produce them en mass out here; part of our effort to encourage improved research into cloning.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first up to bat is a woman named Rayleen. She dresses like Trinity from the Matrix and claims that &lt;em&gt;‘her medium work involves working with the police… missing persons and murder cases’&lt;/em&gt;. Which ones? Because you’d think that the criminal element of your home town would want a serious word with you by now… friendly-like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; challenge should be a doddle, yes? ‘Trinity’ is off into the bush like a bat in… well, a lot of fashionable black leather. Thank hades she didn’t wear the Manolo Blahniks, would have been bugger on the insteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Game over.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/4936/img6293yr9.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="228"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh! It’s &lt;em&gt;Pacman Psychics&lt;/em&gt;! A little yellow arrow tracks the ANTP’s staggering around in in the shrub! Especially the nasty dripping tap sound that accompanies the visuals. I start to wonder if this is so much about finding the kid as finding the loo. Especially when the kid is placed &lt;em&gt;four minutes&lt;/em&gt; from the starting point. You’d even have enough time to share a few rounds on his Nintendo DS Lite before the bell went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interspersed with the hilarity are several shots of the kid, looking bored as hell in his sleeping bag as people squark about waving maps. Somebody, think of the children. Don’t give his toys to people who act mad…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A weather forecast pops up with the presenter pointing out that he has a better chance with foretelling the future… tch, everyone’s a &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daddo&lt;/strong&gt; – So, Stacey, Richard – what are the realistic chances…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stacey&lt;/strong&gt; begs to excuse the obvious fuck-ups – “&lt;em&gt;it’s thick bushland, wet, miserable, out of comfort-zone… it’d be HARD!&lt;/em&gt;” Um, because scenarios in Australia involving lost kids are regularly going to involve being disorientated in a nice friendly crèche surrounded by The Wiggles and Vegemite sandwiches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard&lt;/strong&gt; actually reveals that the whole thing is set up so the boy ‘&lt;em&gt;can’t be more than 15 mins away from the starting location’&lt;/em&gt; In fact – he’s about &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; minutes away, isn’t he, from where they start? I suspect that the area they have isn’t as dramatically huge as it seems to be…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The final tally:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trinity&lt;/strong&gt; – she’s got a &lt;em&gt;vision&lt;/em&gt;. She’s going to have to hurry – but she hurries off into the wrong direction and despite being certain that she’s been given ‘clear signs’… nup. Damn, Neo is going to be pissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason, who happens to be a Rekki Master who uses ‘remote viewing’ – let’s face it, he’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kurgan"&gt;The Kurgan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. What is it with big black leather and psychics?&lt;strong&gt; The Kurgan&lt;/strong&gt; runs. He bolts. He’s in fact doing a hell of a lot of movement for the time he’s been given and is quite lightfooted for such a big lad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chess piece talisman he was given is apparently &lt;em&gt;pulling&lt;/em&gt; him. GPS is now standard for chess pieces? He finds the kid behind the log with three minutes left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, we all know HIS catchphrase…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img56.imageshack.us/img56/8505/200pxkurgan1ou4.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘He found the boy by running around for fifteen minutes,’ sums up &lt;strong&gt;Richard&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Saunders&lt;/strong&gt;. He indeed covered a great deal of ground. Is this going to be a common pattern for those who find the kid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitchell takes the challenge next and he’s already discovered that talking to the camera is a pretty nifty way to connect to the viewers – quirky and charming! He’s clarivoyant and clair.. clair… okay, he’s an &lt;strong&gt;Éclair&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Éclair&lt;/strong&gt; does a rather logical thing, although he justifies it as a kind of &lt;em&gt;spiritual message &lt;/em&gt;he received – he gets to the highest vantage point he can to survey the area. But getting up that high took… um 14 mins. And his time was up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda is also a clairi… clairsenti… cloury… clari-ecdysiast… look, she’s says she’s got the same abilities as &lt;strong&gt;Éclair&lt;/strong&gt; does, right? What is it with these people who can putter out technical terms without taking a breath? Must be &lt;em&gt;metaphysical&lt;/em&gt;… She has a teddy talisman. Her spirits told her to follow the pull in her heart, so she starts running… and diving into the shrubbery. And yes, yes… she’s got a feeling… yes… it appears ooh, she’s off in the stomach. So, Amanda, aka &lt;strong&gt;Poster Girl for Tylenol&lt;/strong&gt; starts grabbing the greenery as she sobs about frustration whilst time ticks away. No show, no go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tch! &lt;strong&gt;Richard Saunders&lt;/strong&gt; ISN’T getting excited by all of this! &lt;strong&gt;Daddo&lt;/strong&gt; calls him out for rolling his eyes at yet &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; wild goose chase. Oh, come on Daddo, there hasn’t even been a reasonable ANTP impersonation of Steve Irwin, by holding the kid up by the leg yelling &lt;em&gt;‘Croikey! Look at this little bugger!’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, this is Richard keeping a straight face… honest…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/9438/img6290kk5.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="227"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, Charmaine. Even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; black leather. Become quite a cliche for this show, they must have seen a market for it – heh.  Apparently there’s ‘&lt;em&gt;nothing else she would want to do more.&lt;/em&gt;..’ than run around the shrubberies looking like a bat out of hell with ‘head and heart conflicts’ whilst looking for lost things. Therefore, she is the &lt;strong&gt;Headless Chook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headless Chook&lt;/strong&gt; is a stressed little firebrand, realising that she made a ‘dire mistake’. Yes, because you’re freaking tripping &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; too. She’s running. She’s fretting! She’s… out of time. But because she covered so much ground with that running… she nearly found the kid and was about ten meters from him by the end of it. The crew clean up the feathers and call for the next ANTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezio – he calls himself the &lt;strong&gt;Spiritual&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Postman&lt;/strong&gt;. And better yet, he’s got the kid’s mobile phone in his hand. Unfortunately, even with a telecommunication device, his ‘life-force, vibe’, it just ain’t working. He makes some wacked statement about how he hopes the boy ‘is found &lt;em&gt;before any harm comes to him&lt;/em&gt;‘ – er, he’s not really lost. He did know that, didn’t he? This is a &lt;em&gt;game?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She D’Montford&lt;/em&gt; – okay, officially &lt;em&gt;wackiest&lt;/em&gt; name for any of them. She did some divination. She did some spiritualism. She did the &lt;strong&gt;Hokey-Cokey&lt;/strong&gt; and turned around, and says that the kid is near &lt;em&gt;burnt trees&lt;/em&gt;. But it’s frickin’ Australia, and every tree in natural bushland is pretty much guaranteed flammable! So &lt;strong&gt;Hokey-Cokey&lt;/strong&gt; walks through forest areas that all show signs of burn-off… thankfully not setting fire to things as she goes… and walks smack into the kid within about seven minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Following their sleeps the men were allowed to eat freely and consumption was recorded. Subjects also wore actimeters to measure physical activity and the men were also polled as to feelings of hunger, pleasantness of food, cravings and sensation of sleepiness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Total physical activity was effectively the same whether sleep deprived or not and if anything showed a trend towards greater activity in the sleep deprived state. There was no difference in feelings of hunger, perceived pleasantness of food, or cravings. Not even remotely surprisingly, when sleep deprived subjects felt sleepier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what difference was found? When sleep deprived people ate a whole lot more. On average they ate 20% more calories the day after a poor night sleep than the day after a good one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of why this might occur other studies have found the hunger hormone ghrelin to be elevated following sleep deprivation which may explain things physiologically. To explain the physiology the authors &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63854120100409"&gt;speculated to Reuters&lt;/a&gt; that perhaps a heightened drive to eat following sleep deprivation would reflect an aim to store calories in the longer days of summer where nights are shorter and food more plentiful, prior to a long, hard, dark winter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottom line? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sleeping better may help you with your weight management efforts and certainly is something all physicians and allied health professionals should assess in a weight management screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver="&gt;Brondel, L., Romer, M., Nougues, P., Touyarou, P., &amp;amp; Davenne, D.

This parasitoid wasp serves for its young by hunting cockroaches as food. But it doesn't serve the cockroach to the offspring in pieces. No, it first performs brain surgery on the 'roaches to render them docile and then lays an egg onto the pacified animal from which a larva will hatch which then burrows into the cockroach to eat it from the inside, without any countermeasures of the cockroach. If you don't believe me, believe the History channel:What does the wasp do to the cockroach brain to so pervasively change the way it works? Last week, Ram Gal and Frederic Libersat came a step closer to answering this question. They report in the journal PLoS One that The animal searches for specific brain regions with its stinger to inject its mind-altering venom. Insect brains have a hole in the middle, where the first part of its gut, the esophagous pases through. The part of the brain that  is above the esophagous is called the supraesophageal ganglion and the part below is called the subesophageal ganglion. The researchers already knew that one target for venom injection was the supraesophageal ganglion from a previous study. For the new study, one of their experiments was to have wasps sting cockroaches in which the experimenters had removed the subesophageal ganglion. They found that the duration of the sting was extended to over three minutes, where usually it only lasts for less than 40 seconds. Maybe the wasp kept searching for the missing ganglion before it gave up?To further test if indeed the subesophageal ganglion may be the target of venom injection, the researchers injected both Procaine, a local anestetic and wasp veonom which they had milked from the animals, into the cockroach subesophageal ganglion. The result was the same for cockroaches injected with venom or with Procaine: both substances, when injected into the subesophageal ganglion, rendered the 'roaches docile, greatly reducing their spontaneous and elicited walking distances. Moreover, the researchers recorded that neural activity in the subesophageal ganglion was greatly reduced in stung and procain injected animals, compared to controls. Interestingly, injecting the substances into the supraesophageal ganglion did not have any dramatic effects, raising the question of why the animal stings there as well. The authors discuss this as follows: The exact role of the SupEG in the venom-induced manipulation of the  cockroach motor behavior remains, as yet, rather elusive. Several  possibilities can be offered, such as a role in evoking the excessive  grooming behavior seen in stung cockroaches [13],  or importance for venom-induced changes in cockroach metabolism [11].  It is also possible that the SupEG, in concert with the SEG, plays a  role in inducing certain aspects of venom-induced hypokinesia either  directly, by affecting specific circuitries in this ganglion, or  indirectly, by affecting ascending SEG interneurons which, in turn,  modulate SupEG circuitries that control motor behavior. A direct effect  of the venom on the SupEG apparently contradicts previous studies which  showed that decerebrated insects (i.e., those without a SupEG) tend to  walk uninhibitedly (see, for instance, [23],  [24],  [38]–[41]),  suggesting a generally inhibitory effect of this ganglion on  locomotion. However, it has also been shown that certain structures  within the SupEG, and especially the Central Body Complex, affect some  finer aspects of locomotion, including the frequency, duration and  coordination of walking, turning behavior and obstacle climbing [19],  [22],  [23],  [35],  [42]–[46].  The venom could thus, in principle, specifically manipulate these SupEG  structures, in addition to manipulating SEG activity, to further  control the initiation of locomotory behavior in the cockroach prey.Apart from the fascinating biology, this paper is interesting also from a more concpetual point of view. The authors do not shy away from using terms one may find controversial such as 'drive' and 'free will', e.g. in the first paragraph of their discussion: Cockroaches stung by the parasitoid Jewel Wasp (A. compressa),  although not paralyzed, loose the ability to self-initiate locomotion  for several days [18].  This deficit cannot be attributed to an overall sleep-like state for  three main reasons. First, the deficit is highly specific, in that the  threshold for initiation of other motor behaviors (such as righting,  swimming, flight, etc.) is little affected [10].  Second, stung cockroaches do not assume a typical ‘quiescent’ position [28] and occasionally move their antennae in an exploratory manner. Third,  when startled by a supra-threshold stimulus, stung cockroaches respond  by jumping in place but do not perform the stereotypic subsequent run [14].  Thus, and since the sensory and motor systems per se are fully  functional in stung cockroaches [12],  [14],  the wasp venom appears to specifically decrease the cockroach's drive  for walking. The fact that the wasp injects its neurotoxic venom  directly into the cockroach's cerebral ganglia to ‘hijack the  cockroach's free will’ allows us to explore the neuronal substrate  responsible for this unique behavioral manipulation.They also cite our study on spontaneous flight behavior and use the term 'rest state' which is something we are actively studying in our own experiments, ever since I read about Marcus Raichle's work on the default mode network in humans. Clearly, general brain organization is centered around the spontaneous activity of brains and how it is modulated by sensory stimuli. More and more researchers are realizing this fundamental aspect now. This, for a neurobiological study highly unusual model system provides yet one more piece of evidence that there is a pervasive and radical paradigm shift in the neurosciences in that the conceptual framework is moving away from brains as passive stimulus-response systems towards a view of brains as active organs which probe the environment by spontaneous actions and then evaluate its responses via sensory systems (brains as output/input devices)....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Such was the case when &lt;em&gt;The Today Show’s&lt;/em&gt; host interviewed Rodney and Holly Peete about their autistic son, Rodney, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size:11px;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:#999;margin-top:5px;background:transparent;text-align:center;width:425px"&gt;Visit msnbc.com for &lt;a style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999!important;font-weight:normal!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com"&gt;Breaking News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507" style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999!important;font-weight:normal!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important"&gt;World News&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072" style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999!important;font-weight:normal!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important"&gt;News about the Economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauer stumbled through his last celebrity autism interview, &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/514#more-514"&gt;an hour-long Dateline episode&lt;/a&gt; about disgraced UK gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield. Lauer’s low point came when Wakefield looked him in the eye and said he had no conflict of interest when he published his infamous 1998 paper in The Lancet. Lauer just shrugged it off and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was when Lauer recently interviewed the Peetes. Between Generation Rescue talking points, the retired NFL quarterback and his Star-of-21-Jump-Street wife plugged their new book with the made-for-&lt;em&gt;Lifetime&lt;/em&gt; title, &lt;em&gt;Not My Boy!&lt;/em&gt; Lauer was happy to go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve done a lot of segments on autism,” said Lauer, “and the thing that always strikes me is (your son) was doing fine. All the milestones (were met). You were bonding, you were talking, then it changes suddenly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauer is trying to say that he has interviewed other parents who claimed their children suddenly regressed into autism. The narrative dovetails nicely with the urban legend that vaccines cause autism. Lauer promptly segues into two more anti-vaccine talking points: that it costs $150,000 a year to treat children with autism, and that couples with an autistic child divorce at higher rates than the rest of us. Holly Peete, who can currently be seen board-rooming with anti-vaxer Donald Trump on &lt;em&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/em&gt;, ran with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s completely unaffordable,” she said after her husband cops to trying “alternative therapies”. “You mention 650,000 kids (with autism). They’re going to become adults.” Ah yes, the autism tsunami, bearing down on a global village near you. If Lauer was of a mind to practice journalism, he might have pressed the Peetes about their evidence for an autism epidemic, or asked how much those unproven and likely ineffective alternative treatments were costing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauer moved on. “I heard a &lt;em&gt;cra-a-zy&lt;/em&gt; statistic,” he said, as he turned “crazy” into a three-syllable word. “The divorce rate among parents with autistic children is ridiculously high.” That statistic is so crazy, it doesn’t even need a number to go with it! &lt;a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/i/what-are-the-divorce-rates-among-autism-families"&gt;It’s also not supported by fact. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conspicuously absent from the interview was any mention of vaccines. In fact, there appears to be a decoupling of the vaccine canard from reporting of World Autism Awareness Month/Day in general. A Google News search of March 31-April 4, using the terms “World Autism Awareness Day” and “vaccines” yields only 11 hits, mostly for blog entries. Striking “vaccines” from the search yields over 530 hits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>autblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism News Beat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271233039239"><id gr:original-id="http://www.conservationmaven.com/frontpage/an-approach-for-reducing-human-wildlife-conflicts.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bcf81aead6dd65a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">An approach for reducing human-wildlife conflicts</title><published>2010-04-14T03:00:38Z</published><updated>2010-04-14T03:00:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/rBsVbxl9EH0/an-approach-for-reducing-human-wildlife-conflicts.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.conservationmaven.com/frontpage/an-approach-for-reducing-human-wildlife-conflicts.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Researchers have developed a framework to help managers identify and prioritize actions that will reduce human wildlife conflict.

Cognitive empathy refers to imaginatively understanding another person’s thoughts, feelings and actions. Emotional empathy is feeling the emotion of another person, but maintaining a compassionate, other-focused perspective

Cognitive empathy can be tested with facial expression recognition. [...]

You may ask: what can studying children and non-human animals tell us about the complexity of the human experience? Only educated human adults engage with formal mathematics, cooking, or map reading. Right? 

This is a reasonable question to ask. But when human adults show complex, possibly culture-specific skills, they emerge from a set of psychological (and thus neural) mechanisms which have two properties:

(1) they evolved early in the timecourse of evolution and are shared with other animals, and,

(2) they emerge early in human development, and can be found in infants and children, as well as adults.

These more basic psychological/neural mechanisms are called core knowledge systems. I will propose (and I hope to convince you, dear reader) that in order to understand the human mind, it is important to investigate both the core knowledge systems - the evolutionary building blocks of the mind - as well as the processes by which these systems are combined to give rise to the richness of human culture we see today.

What are you going to do? &lt;a href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/8/2010/04/first-contact-alien.png"&gt;Here's a brief, handy guide&lt;/a&gt; — I&amp;#39;ll just excerpt a few points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/04/first_contact/first.jpeg" width="353" height="313" alt="first.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I like this idea: there's no way we're going to war with them. Our technologies will not be comparable, and we have to note the obvious: they'd be the ones with interstellar space flight, not us. So, yes, it will be a case of nuclear weapons vs. sponges, and we'd better be careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is one important matter to consider about the comparison. If you found a sponge on a beach crowded with sponges, how much remorse would you feel if you took a sample? You don't want to be the first contactee. Or the second. Or any of them. This is going to be a personally dangerous event. Your best bet is to run away rather than try to chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several more suggestions for how to communicate, and it ends with this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/04/first_contact/humility.jpeg" width="360" height="319" alt="humility.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now if we've gotten this far, we're going to have to assume that the aliens do see us as something more than sponges. If we're &lt;i&gt;close&lt;/i&gt; to them technologically, then yes, it&amp;#39;s worth your while to show off your awareness of your place in the universe. If we&amp;#39;re not close, then face it — the aliens won&amp;#39;t care how much knowledge of our species&amp;#39; history we have. They&amp;#39;re going to be sizing us up for edibility, or suitability for mindless labor, or whether we&amp;#39;d be useful scrubbing implements in the shower, none of which require any philosophical or scientific capabiity at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting thought exercise, but only if we meet an alien species that isn't too far beyond us intellectually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/first_contact.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/_r-KXsKwGyQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271231171443"><id gr:original-id="998 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/03e2e070da2e6261</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Saving Georgian London: 76 Dean Street</title><published>2010-04-14T07:18:17Z</published><updated>2010-04-14T07:18:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/998" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;  On Saturday, during a conversation with the lovely Dan Cruickshank the chatter turned to the sad state of 76 Dean Street.

Today, Sci continues this trend.  Honestly, she couldn't stop thinking about it.  How is overeating like addiction?  How is it different?  And so she began to look up a bunch of papers on binge eating and dopamine.  

I was particularly interesting in the changes in food intake and reward associated responses in people with eating disorders like bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.  There are many hypotheses as to why these eating disorders exist, ranging from problems with society (which can certainly contribute to the incidence of the disorders), to hypotheses of obsessive control akin to the compulsions seen with OCD, to increased sensitivity to reward, to decreased sensitivity to reward.

This increased/decreased sensitivity to reward (some people have seen decreased sensitivity to reward in rats, along with increased self-administration of pleasurable things, but what this actually translates to in humans can be difficult to interpret) was particularly interesting, and so Sci was very glad when she came across this study.

There are two reasons this headline is worthy of note. First, it is amazing that an &lt;a href="http://www.imax.com/hubble/"&gt;IMAX movie about the Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; exists at all, and is worth mentioning on the front (web)page of the NYT. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise-300x300.jpg" alt="NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise" title="NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hubble is a part of the popular imagination, and may be the object most closely tied with Science in the eyes of the general public (even more than the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/18/highest-energy-ever/trackback/"&gt;LHC&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, it is absolutely astounding that NASA launched hundreds of kilos of camera equipment and film into orbit, and spent valuable astronaut time (both on the ground and in space) to pull off the filming. I would claim one of the lasting legacies of the Apollo missions to the Moon are the photographs, and in particular &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise"&gt;Earthrise&lt;/a&gt;. That single photograph of our home as a small blue marble against the vastness of space put our planet into proper perspective for the very first time. NASA is well aware that part of its mission is to light up the public imagination, getting us to peer past our limited horizons, and out into the vast Universe beyond. This film is part of that tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second interesting aspect of the headline is that it’s nonsensical. Hubble has only one eye. It has one mirror. It can’t perceive depth, and therefore can’t see in 3-D. We see slightly different images in each of our eyes, and then a fairly impressive difference engine (called a “brain”) figures out the depth to everything we are looking at, and whether that rock is about to bonk us on the head and we need to duck NOW! 3D movies (such as Alice and Avatar) use circularly polarized light, and glasses with different filters in each lens, to produce the different images for each eye. (The light is circularly polarized so that, if you tilt your head, it all still works; the old linear polarization approach didn’t do this, and had a tendency to make one feel motion sick [at least, it did for me]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general astronomical sources are too far away for us to discern distance using parallax. That’s why the night sky looks “flat”, even though the planets and stars and galaxies are at a tremendous range of distances. If you wanted to be able to directly “see” the distance to the nearest star, in the same way that you ascertain the distance to an approaching lion, your eyes would need to be separated by roughly 10 billion km. (Eye separation = Distance*Angle. The human eye has an angular resolution of roughly 1 arcmin = 0.0003 radians, and the nearest star [Proxima Centauri] is 4 lightyears = 3.8e13 km.) The way we figure out distance in Hubble images is by using color information (and, in particular, the spectra) to discern recession velocity (redshift), and thereby distance (using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_law"&gt;Hubble’s law&lt;/a&gt;). This is not something we do with our eyes (although we do use color information to discern temperature; you’re unlikely to grab something that is so hot it’s glowing blue). Hubble sees a purely two-dimensional Universe. So “seeing what the Hubble sees …in 3-D” is a contradiction in terms. Was the headline carefully crafted to see if we were paying close attention?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does have a few quirks, but overall, it’s pretty neat. I’m running Ubuntu right now and it works pretty well. It’s not the same as a “dock,” although you can use it as such through Docky, which is how I am running it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;George Orwell, in his brilliant 1946 essay Politics and the English Language, wrote: "When one watches some tired [political] hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases … one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy." He memorably argued that "if thought corrupts language, language can often corrupt thought" and proposed six rules of good writing:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;• Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.&lt;br&gt;
• Never use a long word where a short one will do.&lt;br&gt;
• If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.&lt;br&gt;
• Never use the passive where you can use the active.&lt;br&gt;
• Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.&lt;br&gt;
• Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four days later, there are only 83 comments. I'm used to seeing &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004244.html"&gt;hundreds or thousands of comments&lt;/a&gt; in response to invitations of this kind.  And none of the comments called for &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002625.html"&gt;cutting off tongues or fingers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is because current political rhetoric in Britain is &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/07/simon-hoggart-election-sketch"&gt;too derivative and impoverished&lt;/a&gt;, even in its clichés, to arouse much feeling. Or perhaps, the springs of British linguistic peeving might be drying up. In fact, several of the 83 comments questioned Orwell's rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it seems that 83 is actually a large number of comments in the Guardian's current blog ecology, where &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone/blog"&gt;yesterday's blog posts&lt;/a&gt; have so far gotten 1, 14, 0, 43, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 71, 1, … responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for those rules, here are some past LL posts about aspects of &lt;em&gt;Politics and the English Language&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To-do lists can help keep you organized and make it easier to achieve your goals. They save time, energy and, stress. Check out these basic tips for creating effective to-do lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Organized&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Writing on scraps of paper around your house isn’t the best organizational method. You need to have your ideas and tasks all in one place, so find the right system that works for you. It could be a spiral-bound notebook tucked into your purse, a wall calendar next to your desk, or an electronic list on your Blackberry or iPhone if you’re on the go. Wherever you make your list, refer to it often in order to stay focused, and re-prioritize as necessary. A big wall calendar with sticky notes is great because you can move the notes around if your priorities or schedules change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categorize Your Lists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Separate your to-dos into categories such as phone calls, errands, projects, and goals. Prioritize the items in each section by importance. For daily tasks, get the high-priority or difficult items out of the way early on. At the end of each day, move anything that you didn’t finish to the following day as you create tomorrow’s to-do list. For long-term goals or extensive projects, break down your goals into simple, more manageable parts. Large tasks don’t seem as overwhelming if you break them into sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Specific&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When writing your to-do lists, don’t be vague. “Start on weekly report.” isn’t enough. “Complete first three sections of weekly accounting report” sets a clear goal with a specific milestone to reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Get Frustrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At the end of the day, if your to-do list is still full, don’t let it get you down. Perhaps you had a lot of interruptions, or tasks took longer than you had expected. As long as you’re making some kind of progress (and not procrastinating), you’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://workawesome.com/productivity/how-to-write-an-effective-to-do-list/"&gt;WorkAwesome&lt;/a&gt; offers extensive info on how to write an effective to-do list. They have some great advice including dos and don’ts, color-coding prioritization, and quantifying your results.&lt;/p&gt;

The  forceps caused babies who might have died during childbirth to live and may have increased the survivorship of the mothers as well.  In this way, inclusive reproductive success of Dr. Forceps increased significantly.  Presumably, as more people moved into the region, and still more were born there,  and the land was divided up and farmed, competition between farmsteads would have increased.  By using the forceps to benefit his own kin, and by NOT using it for others (he was the doctor delivering the  babies) or even telling anyone else about it, Dr. Forceps increased his own fitness at the expense of everyone else's.  Hiding this new and amazing technology was probably an effective Darwinian strategy for him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/mendeley_a_reference_manager_a.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/mendeley_a_reference_manager_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/v8J9V7BU5WI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271209347925"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2010://2.4593">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6228cdae584a6ca3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="News Roundup" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="antonyflew" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Antony Flew"/><category term="religion" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="religion"/><category term="theology" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="theology"/><title type="html">Atheist philosopher Antony Flew dies</title><published>2010-04-14T01:02:04Z</published><updated>2010-04-23T20:31:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/04/atheist-philoso.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flew is of interest to PT readers in part because of his supposed conversion to deism a few years ago. You may find a detailed obituary &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/7586929/Professor-Antony-Flew.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The National Center for Science Education has also run a brief obituary &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/news/2010/04/antony-flew-dies-005438" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We covered Flew’s conversion to deism &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/12/antony-flews-co.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with an update &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/01/antony-flews-co-1.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Flew was an influential philosopher and was an atheist for the bulk of his career. His essay &lt;a href="http://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/phil06paptop1.html" rel="external "&gt;Theology and Falsification&lt;/a&gt; was widely read and translated into 40 languages. You may see my take on it &lt;a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/exclusive/young_01-05.htm" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The paper is also available &lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/antony_flew/theologyandfalsification.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with an introduction by Flew, but without the discussion with R. M. Hare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In later years, evidently influenced by Gerald Schroeder and the intelligent-design creationists, Flew “converted” to deism and was badly misused by creationists. He later admitted that Mr. Schroeder had “mistaught” him, but he continued to believe that life could not have begun without some intelligent or purposeful creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to NCSE, Flew published 2 monographs on evolution, but they say that these works were “arguably marred by a fondness for claims of genetic linkage between intelligence and race.” I do not know anything about these monographs and so will not comment further. I will remember Flew for the essay in which he showed just how foolish it is not just to believe without evidence, but more, to prop up your belief with untestable speculations.&lt;/p&gt;

Such phenotypic plasticity could provide organisms with the potential to respond effectively to environmental change. One area where such plasticity would be important would be in an animals sensory capabilities. Animals extract information from the environment using a number of sensory systems, and this information guides the animal as it locates food and mates, while also avoiding predators. Thus, the ability to compensate for a deficit in one sense, by increasing the acuity in another, is likely to be of critical importance within sensory disparate habitats. This is what is named the &amp;#39;compensatory plasticity hypotheses&amp;#39;....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The circadian rhythm is the result of a transcriptional control system that regulates the levels of many different proteins in the cell with the passing of time. Not all of the proteins subject to this control have yet been catalogued, and as a result some surprising effects are still being discovered. A recent article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences from the Sancar lab at UNC suggests that circadian control of a DNA repair factor may be a way to enhance the effectiveness of a chemotherapeutic agent. The article is open access, so I encourage you to open it up and read along.

Previously, the Sancar group has shown that the circadian rhythm affects DNA repair in brain cells. In that case, DNA had been damaged by UV irradiation, a lesion that had to be replaced by the excision repair mechanism. Because one of the critical factors for this kind of repair, the Xeroderma Pigmentosum A protein (XPA), undergoes a circadian oscillation, the efficiency of repair depends on the time of day at which the damage occurred. Kang et al. hypothesized that this circadian dependence could also be true for other forms of DNA damage that undergo excision repair.

This led them to cisplatin, a drug used as primary chemotherapy or part of a combinatorial regimen for several kinds of cancer. Cisplatin creates covalent bonds crosslinking DNA bases in an intra-strand or inter-strand manner. These covalent linkages make replication (and therefore mitosis) impossible, and elicit a DNA repair response. If the cell cannot clear the crosslink, it will either die by apoptosis, or if the apoptotic response is suppressed, fail to produce viable daughter cells. Either way, the growth of the tumor is suppressed. The excision-repair pathway is the only mechanism of clearing this kind of DNA damage, so Kang et al. thought that there might be a robust circadian dependence. In order to test this idea, they carried out experiments using extracts from mouse liver and testis.

Figure 1 shows the results of their experiment using liver extract. Panel C summarizes the key results (data shown in panels A and B) that XPA mRNA, XPA protein, and excision repair efficiency are correlated with the dark/light cycle the mice are experiencing, with the highest levels of protein and repair occurring in the late afternoon, and the lowest levels in the very early morning (around 5 AM). Panel E shows a comparison of excision repair between normal mice and ones that have been genetically modified to lack cryptochrome, a critical circadian clock protein. In these CryDKO mice the time of day has no effect on the efficiency of repair, and as panel F shows, they also do not have the daily fluctuation in XPA mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that circadian control of XPA expression levels dictates repair efficiency in liver tissues — as panel D shows, addition of exogenous XPA protein can recover the excision repair activity. However, there was no detectable circadian dependence for excision repair activity in testis, as Figure 2 shows using similar experiments.

Circadian control of XPA activity is possible because the protein doesn&amp;#39;t last very long in the cell. Figure 3 shows experiments using two inhibitors: cycloheximide (CHX), which prevents protein synthesis, and MG132, which prevents protein degradation by the proteasome. The gel in panel A shows that in two different types of cells, CHX treatment caused XPA protein to disappear over a period of three hours, in contrast to the control protein actin, which was unaffected. Addition of MG132 caused XPA to accumulate with time, although actin levels were again constant. The fairly rapid degradation of XPA protein means that the overall quantity of that protein in a cell will be highly dependent on the concentration of its mRNA transcript. That is, you can only have high XPA levels if there&amp;#39;s a lot of mRNA so ribosomes can continue to produce it. Circadian control of transcription is therefore able to regulate protein concentration. The authors hypothesize that this tight circadian control may have developed to prevent deleterious effects of non-specific DNA repair activity during times when there is no chance of UV insult, although there is no specific evidence to support this conjecture presently.

The MG132 experiment indicates that XPA is degraded by ubiquitin ligation and subsequent destruction in the proteasome. Figures 4 and 5 show a variety of evidence indicating that this process is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase HERC2. The experiments in figure 4 establish that HERC2 binds to XPA (panels A and B) and colocalizes with it in the cell (panels C and D). The gels in Figure 5 show that when HERC2 levels in the cell are knocked down by RNA inhibition using siRNA specific for that protein, CHX treatment does not cause XPA to degrade. These facts indicate that HERC2 is the ubiquitin ligase for XPA. The direct effect of HERC2 activity on the repair of cisplatin DNA damage is shown by figure 6. Here, cells were treated with cisplatin and HERC2 siRNA. The left side of panel A shows the clearance of cisplatin adducts from A549 cells over time (the right side shows the total DNA). As you can see, addition of HERC2 siRNA allows for more rapid clearance of the adduct, with a particularly dramatic effect at low dosage.

Unfortunately, due to its extreme toxicity, treating cancer cells with CHX is not a viable strategy for chemotherapy. However, knowing that the level of XPA protein in some target cells varies in a predictable way with the time of day can help doctors optimize treatments for maximum effectiveness. In particular, for cancers originating in tissues that have a strong circadian rhythm and intact XPA, early-morning treatment with cisplatin may be more effective than treatment at other times of the day. More experiments are needed before this can be formally recommended — in particular, whole-animal studies and human trials will be necessary to definitively establish the effect. If these results hold up in whole organisms, however, the circadian effect on DNA repair may become a valuable tool for optimizing some chemotherapy regimens.

As the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould so astutely pointed out in one of his most famous essays, the thumbs of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are nothing at all like the large digits on our own hands. Their accessory "thumbs", visible on the surface as a differentiated part of the pad on the "palm" of the hand, are modified sesamoid bones derived from the wrist. They are jury-rigged bits of anatomy which cast nature as an "excellent tinkerer, not a divine artificer." 

Surprisingly, however, these highly-modified wrist bones are not unique to the black-and-white bears. Red pandas (Ailurus fulgens), which are much more closely related to raccoons than bears, also have modified sesamoid "thumbs" which they use to manipulate bamboo. Hence, given the similar wrist anatomy and diet of these two carnivorans, it might be assumed that the false thumbs are adaptations related to bamboo-eating, but a recent analysis of a fossil relative of red pandas suggests that the peculiar structures evolved for an entirely different reason.

He has also written for the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His latest project is one that I am really optimistic about.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seidman wants to write about life as a teenage atheist (or Agnostic, non-theist, etc.) and he needs your help.  He would like to talk to some of you about your lives and experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book would be directed to teenagers who are realizing their own atheism and for people who want to understand them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the questions he’d like to hear your responses to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were raised with religion, how did you become an atheist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were raised without religion, how have you dealt with being part of a minority group? For instance, how have you handled relationships with believers, religious holidays like Christmas, and other aspects of growing up without a church?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’ve told your family and friends that you’re an atheist, how did you tell them, how did they react, and (if the reaction was unfavorable) how have you dealt with their reaction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has being an atheist affected your life in school, in dating and in other areas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you like most about being an atheist, and what’s the biggest problem that you’ve faced?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to participate in this project, you can &lt;a href="mailto:davidseidman@earthlink.net"&gt;contact David directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine a lot of you are past the teenage years and that’s fine, but there is a caveat for those of you under the age of 18:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Anyone under 18 who would like to be a part of this book &lt;strong&gt;must give me parental permission first&lt;/strong&gt;.  Parents can &lt;a href="mailto:davidseidman@earthlink.net"&gt;e-mail me their permission&lt;/a&gt; (or their questions about my book).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that makes it tough for teens to participate if they haven’t come out to their parents yet, but there are hopefully enough of you who are able to help out so that this project can come to fruition.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29774727@N04/4519119504/sizes/o/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2780/4519119504_fa304bc8e0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the Apollo 14 site. Click to embiggen — and I urge you to do so. You can really see the lander popping right off the surface. In &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29774727@N04/4518486063/sizes/o/in/set-72157622528415038/"&gt;the Apollo 11 image&lt;/a&gt; you can even see that the lander feet are farther away from you than the top of the lander. It’s &lt;em&gt;incredible!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These were done by Nathanial Burton-Bradford, and are part of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29774727@N04/sets/72157622528415038/"&gt;a set of other 3D space anaglyphs&lt;/a&gt;. He took pairs of images taken by LRO (which is orbiting and taking phenomenal images of the Moon) and combined them to make the anaglyphs. They’re all worth perusing. I’m glad I have a set of red/green glasses! If you don’t have one, I again urge you to find ‘em — they can be ordered online, usually pretty cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, I ignore Apollo Deniers, since obviously no amount of evidence will ever wrench them from their fantasy world of ridiculous, top-heavy, and fact-free conspiracy theories… but these images really do hammer home that &lt;em&gt;those landers are sitting on the Moon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, what we humans can do when we decide to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 7, 2010 she and her husband went to a performance of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Boyle"&gt;Frankie Boyle&lt;/a&gt;, a Scottish stand-up comedian. &lt;a href="http://k3tten.blogspot.com/2010/04/punching-me-in-face-would-have-been.html"&gt;As it happened, Mr. and Mrs. Glitter had front-row seats.&lt;/a&gt; During the performance, Mr. Boyle made some rather cheap and disparaging  comments about people with Down Syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;

Oh. I didn't say. Their adorable daughter has Down Syndrome. &lt;a href="http://www.mns.co.uk/012113968.html"&gt;From a reporter:


&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jokes in the routine included jabs at [people with Down syndrome's] hair, voices, and clothing, as well as including the parents of victims of the syndrome. However, the laughter immediately died down to silence, when the comedian turned to audience members, Sharon and Keiron [Glitter], in the front row because they were talking during the show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; [Mrs. Glitter] immediately told the comedian that her daughter was a sufferer of Down’s syndrome and that she found his routine offensive and upsetting. However, Boyle continued his tirade mocking the couple openly, and then stated that the show was his last and he did not care.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The whole thing went viral, somehow, a combination of the UK being a rather smaller country than the US, the power of twitter, and the power of the internet.

Mrs. Glitter went on to post:

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://k3tten.blogspot.com/2010/04/well-that-was-rather-unexpected.html"&gt;Well, that was rather unexpected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://k3tten.blogspot.com/2010/04/what-surreal-24hrs-it-has-been.html"&gt;What a surreal 24 hours it has been&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Her &lt;a href="http://k3tten.blogspot.com/2010/04/what-surreal-24hrs-it-has-been.html"&gt;closing thought, which I leave with you:

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If the fact that I enjoy stand up comedy and I also am upset when people make fun of people with disabilities makes me a hypocrite, then I hold my hands up and admit that must be what I am. But I am only human, and I am not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	
	If only one person stops and thinks before making fun of someone with a disability then its a good thing
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cornelius Hunter collects phenomena that he argues represent &lt;a href="http://www.darwinspredictions.com/" rel="external "&gt;“failed evolutionary 
predictions”&lt;/a&gt;.  He also argues that evolutionary biologists
are making a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sciences-Blind-Spot-Scientific-Naturalism/dp/158743170X" rel="external "&gt;“religious presupposition”&lt;/a&gt; when they insist
that science must use methodological naturalism.  When asked what
supernatural methodology he would have us use instead, he
&lt;a href="http://darwins-god.blogspot.com/2010/01/question-for-joe-felsenstein-and.html" rel="external "&gt;admits that methodological naturalism is “generally a good way to do science”&lt;/a&gt; [in his comment on that post of January 29, 2010 11:05 PM], and says that he’s only complaining that we’re being unclear about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But his bottom line is that he wants to test evolutionary predictions without his ever putting forth any alternative scientific theory for comparison.  &lt;strong&gt;Now, however, there are signs that he may have such a theory.&lt;/strong&gt;  In a &lt;a href="http://darwins-god.blogspot.com/2010/03/evolution-one-in-billion-shot.html" rel="external "&gt;post at his blog&lt;/a&gt; he invokes Bayes’ Theorem for an observation (O) and a theory (T):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
P(T|O) = P(T) * P(O|T) / P(O)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayes’ theorem gives us a way to evaluate a theory given a series of
observations. A difficulty, however, is that the probabilities are difficult to
gauge. What is P(T), P(O|T) and P(O)? What we can do is use a conservative
computation, giving evolution favorable treatment at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, let’s assume we start out with a very high probability that
evolution is true. Next, consider the ratio P(O|T) / P(O). If an evolutionist
is certain that observation, O, will not be observed, then the numerator should
be quite low, say one in a million or one in a thousand. If P(O) is 0.5 then
the ratio would be 0.000002 or 0.002, respectively. But to be conservative, and
give evolution favorable treatment, let’s set the ratio to 0.2, orders of
magnitude greater than is reflected in the evolutionists expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our 14 falsified predictions, using these extremely conservative values,
Bayes’ theorem tells us that evolution is a one-in-a-billion shot
(0.000000000164 to be exact).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is quite correct — &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; Cornelius Hunter can calculate
the overall probability &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-Eo0CGlYPno616tIH4yqQXQ-trans.png" alt="" width="36" height="15"&gt; of the observation.  He states it as 0.5 in
his hypothetical case.   But there is simply no way to calculate a value like
0.5 unless you have a non-evolutionary theory as well as the evolutionary 
theory.  If Hunter thinks that such a calculation can be made, he must have 
his own theory.  Let me explain why.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The denominator  &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-Eo0CGlYPno616tIH4yqQXQ-trans.png" alt="" width="36" height="15"&gt; is simply the sum of the numerator terms
&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-_8oytbhK7YyHPIxWxBUQmw-trans.png" alt="" width="88" height="17"&gt; over all possible theories &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-HnnKUM_PJb5eOwpJVcOrNQ-trans.png" alt="" width="12" height="15"&gt;.   If there are just two theories &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-j_pITcjFRiBDxeXXIDZejg-trans.png" alt="" width="17" height="15"&gt; and &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-OtoUpmjILLJPc0UgDOnA7Q-trans.png" alt="" width="18" height="15"&gt;,  the denominator is  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-I4gySjxcavl5BrIKddB3aQ-trans.png" alt="" width="274" height="17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it’s the weighted average of the probabilities of the
observation O given the different theories, each weighted by the prior 
probability of that theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to do the calculation with only one theory, it’s possible to
do that, but the result is boring.  &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-Eo0CGlYPno616tIH4yqQXQ-trans.png" alt="" width="36" height="15"&gt; is then just one term &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-_8oytbhK7YyHPIxWxBUQmw-trans.png" alt="" width="88" height="17"&gt;,
and the ratio &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-MdBHO-D2jAnMg0FJg6WeEg-trans.png" alt="" width="96" height="17"&gt; is just &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-CHfnM6wrHhF-u6yMpJ3Q7w-trans.png" alt="" width="51" height="17"&gt;, and since we only have one theory
its prior probability &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-nxJNfiNjjksO5xmSqBhijA-trans.png" alt="" width="65" height="15"&gt;, and the ratio &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-MdBHO-D2jAnMg0FJg6WeEg-trans.png" alt="" width="96" height="17"&gt; turns out to
always be 1.   Which is reasonable if there is no alternative theory, but
very uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson is simple: if you want to use Bayes’ Rule to calculate the
posterior probability of evolution, &lt;em&gt;you need at least one alternative
scientific theory&lt;/em&gt;.  As a sophisticated fellow, surely Hunter must have one 
in mind.   The world awaits it with bated breath (his prior probabilities
for the theories would be interesting too).   Or else the world awaits Hunter’s
admission that he didn’t know what he was talking about when he invoked
Bayes’ Theorem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://noisyastronomer.com/2010/04/12/uvas-mccormick-observatory-celebrates-quasquicentennial/"&gt;Reading her blog today&lt;/a&gt; I found out it’s the birthday of the McCormick Observatory! This venerable observatory houses a 26 inch ’scope that I used many times in my career at UVa, and I have many fond memories of it (and some not-so-fond, usually involving long cold nights at the eyepiece). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also mentions that it’s Thomas Jefferson’s birthday too. I think I’ll celebrate by reading &lt;a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.htm"&gt;the Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. That’s seriously one of the finest examples of writing in the English language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oh, the third one? My brother, of course. Happy birthday Merril!&lt;/p&gt;

Skeptics fighting each other over whether or not a particular issue falls within the jurisdiction of skeptical inquiry, and precisely what it means to be a Skeptic, and whether others’ definitions of skepticism and actions based on those definitions “hurt the movement”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than go into all of the various factions in this battle, and continue to rehash the argument, I’d like to challenge the fundamental assumption behind all this bickering:  The idea that a single Skeptical Movement actually exists.  &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that what we have here, currently, is a worldwide community of self-identified skeptics, out of which movements of different sorts can crystalize and spread.  Certain factions within the community seem to think that the next logical step is to create a single, unified Skepticism, encapsulating everyone who identifies as a skeptic, and expecting to be able to limit the scope of skeptical inquiry to what they deem appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is inherently problematic, for several reasons; the most daunting of which is the fact that, by definition, skeptics tend to eschew authority.  We like to figure things out for ourselves.  Because of this, we are never going to come to the same conclusions about everything, especially matters like religion that can be fraught with personal experience and cultural baggage.  Also, because of those different personal experiences, we all come to the table with different priorities and ideas on how to create the change we’d like to see in the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem lies in controlling how the word “skeptic” itself is used.  I posit that such control is impossible, given the fact that it is currently used by science advocates and woo peddlers alike.  Even if one assumes there is such a thing as a monolithic Skeptical Movement, we still don’t own the trademark on the word, and the general public isn’t ever going to necessarily identify the word “skeptic” with our particular brand of scientific advocacy and anti woo activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problems solve themselves when we stop trying to be something we’re not.  Skepticism means something different to all of us.  I think we need to stop being so hung up on labels and definitions and focus on what we’d like to accomplish.  Multiple tactics are capable of accomplishing each goal.  We may not always agree on how to achieve these things, but I think it’s unhelpful to bandy about the “so and so is hurting the movement” card.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally don’t agree with a lot of what comes out of the so-called “New Atheist” sphere.  I prefer a much more polite and rational discourse.  But, I will be the first to say that I think what they are doing serves a purpose.  I joined this community because of Richard Dawkins and Penn Jillette.  Not necessarily because I agreed with what they were saying, but because they were loud enough and controversial enough that they got my attention.  There is great strength in our diversity.  Different voices serve different purposes, and speak to different audiences.  To spend valuable time and resources decrying the work of others as “harmful to the movement” is kind of ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I think this discussion over the meaning of skepticism is an important one.  If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have spent time writing this post.  But to go into it expecting that your particular definition will triumph as The Real Skepticism is folly.  There is no “The Real Skepticism”; there is only the continually evolving idea in each of our minds about who we are and what we’d like to accomplish.  Talking about it in good faith can help us each to continue that process within ourselves, but we will never fully agree; nor should we.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I understand the desire some feel to take the large number of self-identified skeptics and create a huge, single-minded, skeptical Voltron and fight fiercely against pseudoscience with a Blazing Sword.  That seems like it would be awesome.  But once you start to dig into what that would actually mean, you might come to the conclusion I have, that maybe we’re better off fighting as the five lions; fighting for different, yet related priorities, and coming together as one when necessary.  One thing’s for certain; we’re not going to get anywhere if our lions continue to fight each other.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271193724609"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=5085">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e7d0af451e0739f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">How much do autism parents really buy into the vaccine causation idea?

It’s often difficult for new parents to figure out how to calm a wailing baby. Maybe she’s cold, tired, hungry, or has gas. &lt;a href="http://www.dunstanbaby.com"&gt;Priscilla Dunstan&lt;/a&gt; thinks she has it all figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="cry-baby" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/cry-baby.jpg" alt="Crying baby" width="300" height="212"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: sxc.hu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunstan claims her experience as a mom combined with her years in the opera allow her to recognize certain sounds in the human voice – the baby’s voice. She says that infants (up to three months) use five universal “words” that mean the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Neh” – I’m hungry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Owh” – I’m sleepy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Heh” – I’m uncomfortable (dirty diaper, stress, or discomfort)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eairh” – I have gas or an upset stomach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eh” – I need to be burped&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have seen Dunstan on the talk show circuit a few years back. She offers a DVD set that teaches parents how train their ears to recognize these vocalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunstan claims that if you can learn to recognize these specific sounds, you can avoid having your baby escalate into a hysterical fit when they don’t get exactly what they want when they want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My infant says “AHHHH” when hungry; there’s no “Neh.” However, there’s a clear distinction between her hungry cry and her tired one. What do you think of Dunstan Baby Language? Does it hold true for your baby?&lt;/p&gt;

It is characterized by mild to moderate mental retardation and "elfin" facial features. Most strikingly, individuals with WS exhibit highly gregarious social behaviour: they approach strangers readily and indiscriminately, behaving as if everybody were their friend. And, according to a study published today in the journal Current Biology, they are the only known group of individuals who do not form racial stereotypes.

Most of us stereotype others implicitly and automatically - we assume that the characteristics of an individual can be generalized to the group to which they belong, whether it be race, religion, social class or some other group. One factor thought to be important in the formation of stereotypes is fear - we give preferential treatment to those perceived to be like us, while being wary of those perceived to be different. Children with WS are socially fearless. Although they perceive some people to be more approchable than others, they apparently have difficulty inhibiting their compulsion towards social interaction.They therefore provide a unique opportunity to examine the contribution of social fear to the formation of stereotypes.

Now, she is out with a book that is going to seriously undercut some widespread assumptions out there concerning the science religion relationship.

The book, soon to be out from Oxford University press, is entitled Science vs. Religion: What Scientists Really Think. And let me give you just a taste of her answers, from the book jacket (I haven't dug in yet):
In the course of her research, Ecklund surveyed nearly 1,700 scientists and interviewed 275 of them. She finds that most of what we believe about the faith lives of elite scientists is wrong. Nearly 50 percent of them are religious. Many others are what she calls "spiritual entrepreneurs," seeking creative ways to work with the tensions between science and faith outside the constraints of traditional religion.....only a small minority are actively hostile to religion. Ecklund reveals how scientists--believers and skeptics alike--are struggling to engage the increasing number of religious students in their classrooms and argues that many scientists are searching for "boundary pioneers" to cross the picket lines separating science and religion.

&lt;p&gt;Technology rules the world, from TV and the Internet to air traffic control and medical records. Everything and anything is technologically wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-tech advances have produced some amazing gadgets, and certainly make some aspects of life a lot easier. However, they can also make life extremely passive. Families and friends communicate via text and email. Kids play video games and surf the Web instead of reading books. Does technology own a lot of your life? For most of us, the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Creativity needs time, space, and silence, and we have deprived ourselves, even as adults, of those experiences,” says &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/health/13099.html"&gt;Susan Linn&lt;/a&gt;, a Boston-based psychologist, instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, on Washingtonian.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem is that pretty much everything is done for you,” Linn says. “If someone is reading you a book or telling you a story, you get to imagine things. With screen media, we have to do less creative work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put yourself to the test and see if you can go a week without some of your most beloved technological devices. I’m not suggesting that you live without electricity and read by candlelight; but try not using email for an entire week. Or, can you survive the whole weekend without getting on the computer even once? Or, turn off the TV and video game console, and see if you come together as a family to play board games, read books, or just talk to each other. Taking a techno-break just might help restore your personal creativity – and encourage your family to get reacquainted.&lt;/p&gt;

Finding the right drug for each patient is often a matter of trying different ones until one works.So a genetic test to work out whether a certain drug will help a particular person would be really useful. Not to mention really profitable for whoever patented it. Three recent papers, published in three major journals, all claim to have found genes that predict antidepressant response. Great! The problem is, they were different genes.First up, American team Binder et al looked at about 200 variants in 10 genes involved in the corticosteroid stress response pathway. They found one, in a gene called CRHBP, that was significantly associated with poor response to the popular SSRI antidepressant citalopram (Celexa), using the large STAR*D project data set. But this was only true of African-Americans and Latinos, not whites.Garriock et al used the exact same dataset, but they did a genome-wide association study (GWAS),  which looks at variants across the whole genome, unlike Binder et al who  focussed on a small number of specific candidate genes. Sadly no variants were statistically significantly correlated with response to citalopram, although in a GWAS, the threshold for genome-wide significance is very high due to multiple comparisons correction. Some were close to being significant, but they weren&amp;#39;t obviously related to CRHBP, and most weren&amp;#39;t anything to do with the brain.Uher et al did another GWAS of response to escitalopram and nortriptyline in a different sample, the European GENDEP study. Escitalopram is extremely similar to citalopram, the drug in the STAR*D  studies; nortriptyline however is very different. They found one genome-wide significant hit. A variant in a gene called UST was associated with response to nortriptyline, but not escitalopram. No variants were associated with response to escitalopram, although one in the gene IL11 was close. There were some other nearly-significant results, but they didn&amp;#39;t overlap with either of the STAR*D studies.Finally, one of the STAR*D studies found a variant significantly linked to tolerability (side effects) of citalopram. GENDEP didn&amp;#39;t look at this.*The UST link to nortriptyline finding is the strongest thing here, but for citalopram / escitalopram, no consistent pharmacogenetic results emerged at all. What does this mean?  Well, it&amp;#39;s possible that there just aren&amp;#39;t any genes for citalopram response, but that seems unlikely. Even if you believe that antidepressants only work as placebos, you&amp;#39;d expect there would be genes that alter placebo responses, or at the very least, that affect side-effects and hence the active  placebo improvement.The thing is that the &amp;quot;antidepressant response&amp;quot; in these studies isn&amp;#39;t really that: it&amp;#39;s a mix of many factors. We know that a lot of the improvement would have happened even with placebo pills, so much of it isn&amp;#39;t a pharmacological effect.  There are probably genes associated with placebo improvement, but they might not be the same ones that are associated with drug improvement and a gene might even have opposite effects that cancel out (better drug effect, worse placebo effect).  Some of the recorded improvement won&amp;#39;t even be real improvement at all, just people saying they feel better because they know they&amp;#39;re expected to.If I were looking for the genes for SSRI response, not that I plan to, here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;d do. To stack the odds in my favour, I&amp;#39;d forget people with an moderate or partial response, and focus on those who either do really well, or those who get no benefit at all, with a certain drug. I&amp;#39;d also want to exclude people who respond really well, but not due to the specific effects of the drug.That would be hard but one angle would be to only include people whose improvement is specifically reversed by acute tryptophan depletion, which reduces serotonin levels thus counteracting SSRIs. This would be a hard study to do, though not impossible. (In fact there are dozens of patients on record who meet my criteria, and their blood samples are probably still sitting in freezers in labs around the world... maybe someone should dig them out).Still, even if you did find some genes that way, would they be useful? We&amp;#39;d have had to go to such lengths to find them, that they&amp;#39;re not going to help doctors decide what to do with the average  patient who comes through the door with depression. That&amp;#39;s true, but they might just help us to work out who will respond to SSRIs, as opposed to other drugs.Binder EB, Owens MJ, Liu W, Deveau TC, Rush AJ, Trivedi MH, Fava M, Bradley B, Ressler KJ, &amp;amp; Nemeroff CB (2010).

&lt;p&gt;On Day 4, she examined homeopathy's &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2008/04/world-homeopathy-awareness-week-day-4-homeopathy-and-your-junk/"&gt;claims to treat male and female fertility and sexual behavior issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

thinking I was finding out how to cure infertility with homeopathy. I
expected it would make me angry, but it turned out to be a bit less
angering and a bit more disturbingly funny. Beyond the fold are uses
for homeopathy for when &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2008/04/world-homeopathy-awareness-week-day-4-homeopathy-and-your-junk/"&gt;your plumbing is out of whack:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Update April 2010&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/192_08_190410/ern11179_fm.html"&gt;Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; a systematic review finds no evidence that homeopathy has  effects beyond placebo.

It seems instead of hiding eggs this Easter he would just continue to stash away child rapists and it’s up to the rest of the world to find them and place them in a basket. If you aren’t caught up I do suggest you read &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/yes-the-pope-should-be-arrested-and-i-dont-care-who-does-it/"&gt;Rebecca’s post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject that should clear things up for you. Although, if you aren’t caught up you might be living in a box and if so you might first want to poke a few holes to let in some air. Maybe add a few plants too because you are probably lonely and you might need a little oxygen and sunlight and maybe a friend or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a string of comments in Rebecca’s post that really got me thinking. Okay, so we know the guy &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; he has a direct line to god with some sort of unlimited long distance calling plan so he can talk all he wants to the almighty but when he is sitting around after a long day of chatting, twiddling tadpoles and playing hide the fish what &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; does make a pope feel &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt;? Is it the hat?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img697.imageshack.us/img697/7392/popehats.jpg" alt="pope hat convo" width="403" height="202"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what? I bet it &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;the hat and that sharp little cross necklace and dress combo, that and maybe his bulletproof Mercedes-terrarium-popemobile! Does he still ride around in that &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;sweet&lt;/span&gt; ride? Wait a sec, what is that you say? Maybe it’s the pope who needs to get out of &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; box, or at least let a little oxygen in? Perhaps you are right.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For me it is my artwork, artistic accomplishments and work here at Skepchick that makes me feel special. But what about you dear readers? What do you own or what do you do that helps you stand out from the crowd or simply makes you feel good about yourself? What makes you feel special?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been an atheist for several years now.  I have three younger children, all under the age of ten.  I grew up a fundamentalist Christian in a “spirit filled” evangelical church.  Everyone I have ever known was a Christian.  I live in a small town and the closest group of atheists is an hour’s drive.  My attempts to create an atheist social group in my area have failed.  However, there is a Unitarian Universalist church in the next town over that seems to be accepting of atheists.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family and I are dying socially with little to no one who believes like we do or even accepts us for our beliefs.  Our kids cannot play with the neighbors because they hate us and tell my kids they will burn in hell.  My kids didn’t even know what hell was!  My kids need other kids to play with that are accepting or at least have parents that are accepting.  I need social interaction with people that I don’t have to censor my own speech around for fear of further alienation.  My wife needs to be around others as she cannot work due to severe arthritis.  I would cry if my anger at the situation wasn’t overcoming the emotion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to try and visit the Universalist church, mainly for the social aspect of it, and because I want my children to be religiously literate, but without my disdain and bad feelings towards most religion. However, my own feelings about religion are getting in the way as I feel I am betraying myself by going to a church at all.  Am I betraying myself? How can I make myself do what I feel is right and set aside these feelings about organized religion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socially Deprived&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Socially Deprived,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer your letter, I decided that I need to visit a Unitarian Universalist congregation and see for myself. There is one that meets at a community center right here in my home town, and I went there last Sunday.  I tried to imagine that I was you, struggling with a strong loathing for organized religion in general, which wasn’t that hard because I share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many readers who comment on the letters I publish have recommended that the writers should investigate UU for a social outlet, for accommodating a religious spouse, for having some kind of “church” to point to for their neighbors’ sake, and for their children’s educational and social needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot know how typical this UU group is compared to others around the US or the world, but I had a very positive impression. I felt welcomed but not pressured.  Everything was invited, nothing was obligated or expected.  The general feeling was very inclusive, and not at all exclusive. The service had a variety of activities that were enjoyable, positive, affirming, and reflected very humanist values. Someone played good jazz on a saxophone, the singing was fun, and the lyrics were thoroughly humanist. There was very little ritual, no “woo” at all, and a great deal of basic people-to-people warmth.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  they really had me when I learned that at any time during the service I can get a cup of coffee and sip it in my chair.  &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of the minister’s talk was joys and sorrows. The emphasis was on people caring about each other and taking real action to help rather than just having detached sympathy.  God was only mentioned once close to the end, and that was only as part of a brief description of the story of Job, the only Biblical reference at all, as an example of the challenges of life. Neither naïve nor saccharine, it was a positive attitude mixed with a realistic outlook. The only things that the talk asked me to believe in were the value and dignity of human life and my own best qualities.  I felt very comfortable through the service and the socializing afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with a few members, two of whom identified as having humanist viewpoints without my prompting. Certainly there were several who believe in God and Jesus, but it was clear that my conforming was not a requirement to be there. I sensed no agenda to get me to think, believe or do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with the minister and mentioned in the conversation that I’m an atheist.  She had no problem with that, and said that several others in the congregation would easily identify with my viewpoint. I described some of the social problems that my fellow atheists face, and she said that she well understood, having come originally from Arkansas.  She wants the group to be a refuge and a resource for anyone who can benefit, both believers and nonbelievers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked her about the several children I had seen, who at the beginning of the service came through the crowd collecting cans and jars of food for the local homeless shelter. It was an adorable and heartwarming thing to see. Then they left to have some kind of fun treasure hunt.  The minister told me that they introduce the kids to the world religions so they can be literate about them and can make informed decisions about religion for themselves. They teach the kids skills for making ethical choices without formulaic or legalistic dogma, and to be involved with helping others who are in need. I saw the older kids being very sweet to the little ones. She said that she recommends that parents read &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0814474268/ref=nosim/?tag=parebeyobeli-20"&gt;“Parenting Beyond Belief”&lt;/a&gt; by Dale McGowan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group is active in supporting social and environmental justice. They work for local charitable causes including a food pantry, a homeless shelter, adopting needy families during the holidays, finding placement for homeless pets, supporting the families of gay and lesbian children, and many more. In a more global arena they organize fundraising events for AIDS research, support gay and lesbian civil rights,  and promote fair trade coffee and chocolate industries, among several other things. From what I could tell, these are all seen as opportunities to help rather than opportunities to proselytize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socially Deprived, if I had the needs that you have described, I would be very comfortable coming to this group for those needs and being completely up front with them about my motives. I think they would consider those motives entirely understandable and legitimate, and would continue to welcome and accept me, just as I am, including my coffee addiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are worried that you might be “betraying” yourself.  Certainly you will be going against your initial emotional revulsion to something that you associate with unhappy personal experiences and/or with religious organizations that you oppose. But getting past our reflex aversions is an important way that we grow. Seeing past our blanket associations can open up opportunities to enrich our lives and broaden our perspectives.  Ask yourself if there is some principle by which you live that you would be betraying. If not, if it’s just your acquired distaste for all things even vaguely churchy, then go visit that UU congregation in the next town over, and give it a try.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, it will have some resemblance to the one I visited.  Of course, all groups have their “warts” that you will notice after a time, but if that openhearted acceptance is there, it might rub off on you, and you’ll focus on the benefits instead of the flaws.  Beyond the activities at the meeting itself, you might find like-minded friends who live relatively close to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congregation may fit your needs or not, it may be to your liking or not, but either way at the very least I think you’ll emerge with your rationalism undamaged and your values uncompromised.  And you just might get over your repulsion and find a valuable asset for you, your wife and your children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to the &lt;a href="http://www.uua.org/"&gt;Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently an umbrella group for UU congregations and fellowships around the world. There is information about their principles and activities, as well locations of  congregations around the US and the world.  There are also more congregations under another organization called the &lt;a href="http://clf.uua.org/"&gt;Church of the Larger Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

All will eventually be answered, but not all can be published.  There is a large number of requests; please be patient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For example, about a fifth of Americans smoke.  But we as health care providers react differently to different kinds of substance use.  I certainly cannot speak for all doctors, but narcotic abuse seems to push our buttons in a way that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2010/04/a_simple_poll_on_the_smoking_e.php"&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt; and caffeine (and even alcohol) don&amp;#39;t.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I asked around to try to understand why so many of us have negative reactions to people with narcotic use disorders.  After talking to a few professionals in person and via email one factor stood out: narcotic abusers often use health care providers to obtain their fix.  Most of us don&amp;#39;t like being lied to or being involuntarily enlisted as a drug dealer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do you think, folks?  The social and medical consequences of various substances of abuse don&amp;#39;t seem to track with our perceptions of the users.  Do lay people differ from medical folks on this one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/5BKiSLCaZA4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271184782141"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=31715">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d55e35ff17cca61</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="currency"/><category term="pennies"/><title type="html">Cutting the Currency Gordian Knot</title><published>2010-04-13T18:30:14Z</published><updated>2010-04-13T18:30:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/cutting-the-currency-gordian-knot/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Get rid of the dollar bill and the penny.</summary><author><name>By DANIEL HAMERMESH</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271184274687"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/humanists_and_their_nuanced_po.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/136d44b7b679157f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Humanists and their nuanced polls</title><published>2010-04-13T18:11:42Z</published><updated>2010-04-13T18:11:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/k7wnsPiac74/humanists_and_their_nuanced_po.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/humanists_and_their_nuanced_po.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The New Humanist has a poll that is being crashed by apologists for Catholicism…I think.

&lt;a href="http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/"&gt;Do you think the Pope should face legal action over the Catholic child abuse cover-ups?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yes. This cover-up appears to go to the very top and its perpetrators must face justice.
	
20%&lt;br&gt;
 
Yes. While it's unlikely the Pope will end up in the dock, suggestion of a legal challenge during his UK visit will draw attention to the extent of the cover-up.
	
26%&lt;br&gt;
 
No. This looks like atheist posturing. We need to join with Catholics in calling on the Vatican to come clean on this issue, and talk of arresting the Pope will just alienate them.
	
9%&lt;br&gt;
 
No. This is about many individual, horrific cases of abuse spread over decades. It is a distraction to try and attribute responsibility to one man.

They may offer solid social and emotional support, but when it comes to delivering high-quality academic instruction, they just don’t do it. And a lot of them also assume that if a kid is struggling and is way behind in reading, he must have some neurological problem, and therefore it’s not their job to teach him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

....
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Look, the problem isn’t that teachers don’t know which students are in trouble and need help. I mean, you could try an experiment: Call 100 1st grade teachers around the country and ask them, “Do you have any kids who are in trouble in learning to read?” They’re not going to say, “Gosh, I don’t know. I haven’t DIBEL’d them yet.” Teachers know who needs help. If they don’t know, they shouldn’t be teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But you just said that many teachers aren’t skilled in teaching reading?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But that doesn’t mean they don’t know who’s in trouble. They just don’t know what to do with a kid who’s in trouble. The point is we need to free teachers up from spending their time using an assessment program on kids every few weeks, or having a reading or LD specialists going around doing it. Educators need to be working with kids and teaching them rather than continuing to document that they can’t do something.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Do you have any guidelines for the amount of intervention time that should be provided for a struggling reader?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, let’s talk about kindergarten and 1st grade. In kindergarten, amazingly, it takes as little as 15 to 20 minutes a day, working in a one-on-one or very small group setting with a child. That’s it. In 1st grade, most of the studies have recommended either a half-hour or 45 minutes a day, five days a week, usually for a period of roughly 20 weeks, as an initial shot at it. At that point, some kids still may not be up to grade level. But if you give them another 20 weeks, you can be down to 2 percent of kids who aren’t reading at grade level. And that 2 percent, according to the large-scale studies, are typically those students who are highly mobile and come in and out of the program, or are part of that very small portion of the school population who have very severe or profound cognitive disabilities. But you have to look around and ask, how many schools do we currently have that have any kind of intensive expert intervention in place in kindergarten, much less 30 or 45 minutes a day of one-to-one or one-to-three expert intervention for up to a year in the 1st grade? The answer is, there are virtually no schools like that in this country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How dare it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, reality is interfering with how we think planets form around stars. And the monkey in the wrench belongs to &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1016/"&gt;a handful of newly discovered planets that go around their stars the wrong way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1016a/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/wrongwayplanet.jpg" alt="wrongwayplanet" title="wrongwayplanet" width="610" height="431"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an artist’s illustration of one of these planets. As you can see in the diagram, the star rotates left-to-right, but the planet orbits right-to-left. That’s a bit of a puzzler, and here’s why.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
First, how do we think planets form? If you look at &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/13/open-wide-and-say-awwwww/"&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see a giant cloud of gas and dust collapsing in places to form stars. The stars form from little knots of overdense regions in the cloud. As the material collapses, any slight amount of rotation it has — from eddies and vortices in the gas, say — get amplified (think ice skater as she draws her arms in and spins faster). Random collisions of particles inside the cloud tend to drop more of the matter toward the center, along the equator of the spin, &lt;a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/education/outerplanets/solsys_star.php"&gt;forming a flat disk there&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disk spins, rotating around its center like a DVD (though stuff toward the center goes around faster than stuff near the outer edge). The middle of the disk is where the star forms. Farther out, local eddies and vortices can form planets. But the important thing to note is that in this scenario, everything spins in the same way. If the disk appears to be spinning clockwise, say, then the star will spin that same way, the planets will orbit that same way, and the planets will spin that same way. We’re pretty sure this is how things work because that’s pretty much what’s happening in our own solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory has been tested by observation and by increasingly complex modeling. Sometimes there are problems with it, but in general new ideas have been added that fix those problems, and over time we’ve been pretty happy overall with the idea that stars and planets form this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a bunch of newly discovered planets have messed this nice idea up. They orbit their stars the wrong way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we know? That part is pretty cool. First, these are &lt;em&gt;transiting&lt;/em&gt; planets. As the illustration above shows, from our point of view the planets pass directly in front of their stars every time they make an orbit. When that happens, they block a fraction (usually around 1%) of the star, and we see that as a slight dip in the light detected from the star. A lot of planets have been found this way, and it’s a pretty good method of finding planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now picture the star in the image above. It’s spinning, so the left side of the star in the diagram appears to be headed &lt;em&gt;toward&lt;/em&gt; us, and the right side moving &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from us. But that means there’s a Doppler shift, a slight change in the color of the light from the star. Just like a car roaring past you makes that &amp;quot;EEEEEEeoooooooow!&amp;quot; sound, light changes pitch if the source is moving toward or away from us, and that change in pitch is seen as a shift in color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light from the part of the star rotating toward us shifts a bit to the blue, and the side moving away shifts a bit to the red. That shift is very small, but measurable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the planet messes that up. As it transits (moves in front of) the star, it blocks first one side, and then the other. If it orbits the star in the same direction as the star spins, it will first block the blueshifted side, and then a bit later the redshifted side. That change in the starlight can be seen and measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for some of these planets just discovered, it’s all backwards! The redshifted side gets blocked first, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; the blueshifted side. That means &lt;em&gt;the planet is going around the star the wrong way.&lt;/em&gt; The press release about this discovery &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/videos/eso1016a/"&gt;has a nice video&lt;/a&gt; which makes this a bit more clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean our theory is wrong? Well, not exactly. It probably means that overall the theory is solid, but that there are exceptions, modifications, we don’t understand. Most likely the planets that form around other stars start off revolving around the star the same way, but then some sort of gravitational interaction with other forming planets knocks them off course. Some of these newly discovered systems do appear to have outer planets that could do the trick; the tug-of-war resulting from a close encounter could slingshot one of the planets into a retrograde (backwards) orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would play hell with the system. The planet knocked backwards would migrate in close to the star, tossing other smaller planets either into the star or out of the system entirely. If that’s true, then it means these weird planet systems won’t have many planets, just the one backwards-revolving one and one or two outer planets. That’s a nice prediction, in fact, and one that can be confirmed or falsified with more observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not like this is a rare event: fully 6 out of 27 systems appear to have these backwards-moving planets! That means that however these planets get knocked about, it has to happen fairly often. Obviously, we need to observe a lot more of these systems so we can get better statistics, and be able to see what similarities and differences they have with each other. That’s the best way to figure out what the heck is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does all this mean? Well, it means, as usual, that Nature is a bit more clever than we are, thinking up all sorts of ways of forming planets and systems of planets that didn’t initially occur to us. But that’s how science works. Things get complicated, so the first thing to do is simplify. Make your idea general. Then start adding complexity to it to explain what you actually see. As observation techniques get better, the idea has to get modified to account for new data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it’s a pretty big modification, but that’s not surprising: we’re new at this planet  finding thing. We’re bound to get plenty of surprises for a while, until we have a better grasp of the situation. Surprises are good: they help us test the theory, they help us understand reality a little better, and they help us learn a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

Though the centers provide pregnancy testing, family planning services,  counseling, and support, they do not provide any medical services. Last year, the city of Baltimore issued an ordinance requiring the centers to post a sign warning patients of limited medical services, and now &lt;a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:990712"&gt;Austin’s City Council&lt;/a&gt; is considering the same move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/03/31/crisis_pregnancy_centers/"&gt;Baltimore’s  Archdiocese&lt;/a&gt; sued the city for discrimination last month, claiming the ordinance requires unfair treatment of pro-life centers. The city asserts that they’re just requiring disclosure of information to patients who might be seeking medical help. In cities like Austin and Baltimore, where teen pregnancy and STDs rates are high, this argument is especially relevant. What do you think? Should the centers be forced to state their lack of services?&lt;/p&gt;

Others work on the scale of crowds, neighborhoods and nations, seeking hidden patterns in the way multitudes behave.  What&amp;#39;s unusual about this paper in PLoS One is that it combines both those perspectives: Mehdi Moussaïd and his co-authors have worked out the physical effects of a psychological motivation. That gave them a new way to predict how people walk on city streets.

There are other physics-style models of crowd behavior, but, as the authors point out, those have assumed that each human &amp;quot;particle&amp;quot; on the street is an isolated individual.  Give each &amp;quot;agent&amp;quot; a few simple rules to follow, and a computer can generate a simulation of actual people&amp;#39;s movements pretty well.  But we&amp;#39;re a social species, and such models fail to capture the fact that people don&amp;#39;t walk alone.

The paper&amp;#39;s authors set up a camera on streets in Toulouse and simply recorded pedestrian traffic on a workday and then again on a weekend—4559 people in all. If people talked, smiled, gestured or laughed together, they counted them as part of a single group. More than half the pedestrians in the workday streetscape were in such groups; on the weekend, 70 percent were.

Physical facts have an important effect on how people walk, of course.  As molecules of a gas move more quickly when they&amp;#39;re less densely packed, so too people on the street walk faster when they&amp;#39;re less crowded. However, Moussaïd and Co. found that walkers in groups put physical imperatives below psychological ones:  The bigger the collection of people, the slower all its members walked.  Degree of crowding had no effect on this pattern.

Were there any predictable laws in the way these walking groups organized themselves? To find out (this is the part that scientists properly call &amp;quot;heroic&amp;quot; for its superhuman care and patience) the researchers looked at all the pedestrians they&amp;#39;d recorded in groups and measured the angle and distance of an imaginary line between each person and his/her right-hand neighbor. That gave the team a way to define and track patterns in movement over time.

When streets weren&amp;#39;t too crowded (or, in physics-speak, when density was low), the social groups walked in a horizontal line, shoulder to shoulder. When streets get more crowded, though, groups reform into a predictable formation: The middle person or persons hang back, and others draw closer.  The result is a &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;U&amp;quot; of people.

It&amp;#39;s much like the &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; you can see in the sky when geese are migrating, except that the human version points away from the direction of travel.  As the authors point out, a flexible structure moving against a flow would be most efficient if it did what geese do.  (That is, of course, why geese do it.)  But people don&amp;#39;t. Physical laws push them one way, but a psychological law (people in a group want to communicate with each other) pushes the other way.

Armed with this information, the team devised a new model of pedestrian behavior, adding group motivations to the usual variables that represent the effects of density, physical barriers and so on.  This model, which assumes that people will do what makes it easiest to keep each other in sight and in earshot, fits real-life behavior quite well. Groups of walkers are slower than they &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; be, because they aren&amp;#39;t organized to walk in the quickest, most &amp;quot;aerodynamic&amp;quot; formation.  So, as the groups get bigger, they get slower, regardless of how many strangers are also walking on the street.

This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that human V&amp;#39;s lack leaders.  Conversational groups tend to be made up of a few big talkers and many listeners, so, Moussaïd and Co. expect that the &amp;quot;leaders&amp;quot; of  pedestrian groups are usually around the point of the inverted V.  Again, like birds, but in reverse, because it&amp;#39;s sociodynamic instead of aerodynamic.

Speaking of bird flight, this paper on pigeon flocking in last week&amp;#39;s Nature coincidentally touches on the same theme as the Moussaïd paper in PLoS. By tracking pairs of pigeons as they flew, Tamás Vicsek and his co-authors found that pigeons, too, have leaders: Birds in the front (especially if they were on the followers&amp;#39; left) had more influence over the movements of the whole group than did others.  In fact, they found a stable hierarchy of influence, with some pigeons definitely more equal than others.  Both papers combine  the individual and group levels of analysis to find rules in motion that looks random to the naked eye.

There is also  How to Cool the Planet by Jeff Goodell, author of Big Coal and a writer for Rolling Stone.

This in and of itself is a phenomenon--the two books were clearly racing each other and ended up coming out at about the same time. The question is, is that timing right?

I have no doubt we are going to have a big public debate about geoengineering at some point in the future. At that time, one or both of these books could be considered essential reading.

However, thus far, neither seems to be having its big publishing breakout moment. Indeed, neither has any reviews yet on Amazon.

I myself can't speak to the books' comparative quality: I was only sent, and have only read, Kintisch's, and it's excellent. For all I know, Goodell's is equally worthy. If you're interested, I recommend that you buy both of them.

But you are not the general public. And as we've learned, 97 percent of Americans have no clue what geoengineering even is.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there is much that  Harris and I agree on, but I think his main target is actually moral  relativism, and that he would get more mileage out of allying himself  with philosophy (not to the exclusion of science), rather than taking  what appears to be the same misguided scientistic attitude that Richard  Dawkins and Jerry Coyne have come to embody so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not exactly sure what Massimo’s beef is with Richard and me, but it seems to have something to do with our presumed lack of respect for philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a copy of the God Delusion with me at the moment, but both  Dawkins and Coyne have repeatedly made disparaging remarks about  philosophy during talks I’ve seen. Coyne even did it while giving a  research seminar at Stony Brook a few years ago (I was in the audience),  and Dawkins made a joke during a talk about having to hold back from  criticizing philosophy because Dennett was in the audience…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember what I said at Stony Brook, but I clearly don’t dismiss all philosophy—just what I see as bad philosophy. (Yes, there is some:  for a specimen, see &lt;em&gt;What Darwin Got Wrong &lt;/em&gt;by Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini).  I have enormous respect for the kind of philosophy which, as Russell Blackford points out, can approach science in its ability to find truth through reason. (One example that I cite constantly is the demonstration by Plato and others that much of morality doesn’t derive from religious dogma but is antecedent to it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t want to talk about Harris’s take on morality here  (see the  bottom of this post for a few comments). Instead, I’d like to address Massimo’s notion that the supernatural is simply impervious to scientific analysis.  As he said in a comment on his own post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . my problem with Dawkins and Coyne is different, but stems from the same  root: their position on morality is indeed distinct from Harris’ (at  least Dawkins’, I don’t recall having read anything by Coyne on  morality), but they insist in applying science to the supernatural,  which is simply another form of the same malady that strikes Harris:  scientism, the idea that science can do everything and provides us with  all the answers that are worth having.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let me get one thing clear at the outset.  I do not believe, nor have I ever asserted, that science provides us with all the answers that are worth having.  Some answers worth having involve subjective taste:  which bistro should I eat at tonight?  Should I go out with Sue or with Megan? Is Joyce’s &lt;em&gt;The Dead&lt;/em&gt; truly the best story ever written in English? (The answer to that, by the way, is “yes”.)  Why does Beethoven move me to tears while Mozart leaves me cold?  And there are the moral questions, such as “Is abortion wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now some of these questions are at least &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; susceptible to empirical investigation and falsification (I may find, for example, that I first heard Beethoven during a really good time of my life, and that this somehow conditioned my neural response to the music.)  But science certainly can’t “do everything.”  It can’t relieve the tears of a bullied child; it can’t bring civil rights to blacks and gays; it can’t bring peace to Israel and Palestine. Still, many of the answers to these questions can be &lt;em&gt;informed&lt;/em&gt; by scientific analysis.  If our answer to the question about abortion involves knowing whether a fetus can feel pain, well, that can—in principle—be studied scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins, too, is not immune to the blandishments of art and literature, as you can see by simply reading his books.  I suspect that both Richard and I are advocates of “scientism” only to the extent that when questions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; amenable to logic, reason, and empirical investigation, then we should always use those tools.  If that’s “scientism,” then so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Pigliucci is off the mark, I think, when insisting that we can’t apply science to the supernatural.  &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/is-atheism-scientific/"&gt;We’ve gone around about this before&lt;/a&gt;, but I want to make the point one more time.  This view is pretty common; it’s held not only by Massimo, but also by people like Eugenie Scott, who once told me that the supernatural is simply immune to scientific analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the point. &lt;strong&gt;Virtually every religion that is practiced by real people (as opposed to that espoused by theologians like Karen Armstrong) makes claims that God interacts with the world.  That is, most religions are theistic rather than deistic.  And to the extent that a faith &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; theistic,  it is amenable to empirical study and falsification—that is, it’s susceptible to science.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a short (and very incomplete) list of all the ways that science already has tested the supernatural assertions of faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The earth was suddenly created, complete with all its species, 6,000 to 10,000 years ago.  This was falsified by science.  The falsification likewise goes for other religions’ creation myths, like those of Hindus and the Inuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God put the earth at the center of the solar system and the universe.  Also falsified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is both omnipotent and benevolent.  Falsified by the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All humans descend from Adam and Eve, who also lived a few thousand years ago.  Falsified by genetic data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Praying for sick people makes them better.  Falsified by the intercessory prayer study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who lived in the past can be reincarnated as modern people, complete with their earlier memories.  Investigation has shown no evidence for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonah was swallowed and regurgitated by a giant fish (or whale).  Probably impossible; nobody has survived such an occurrence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God confounded all the languages at once at the Tower of Babel.  False: languages diverged gradually from common ancestors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tribes colonized North America from the Tower of Babel several thousand years ago. (Book of Mormon).  No evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faith by itself can cure dire diseases and medical conditions, which result not from organic conditions but from imperfect belief. (Christian Science).  No evidence for such faith healing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. soldiers will return to South Pacific islands bearing wonderful goods for the inhabitants.  False: won’t happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I need to go on.  The point is that all of these assertions dealt with supernatural claims that were part of mainstream or widely-practiced religions.  They were disproved by science, and many (but not all) of the faithful have discarded them. This shows by itself that Pigliucci is wrong: science can be applied to supernatural claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are other supernatural claims that haven’t yet been disproven by empirical tests but could be, at least in principle. Here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performing special dances to propitiate the gods will bring rain for the crops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likewise, sacrificing animals will propitiate the gods and bring good fortune.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mary’s body was taken directly to heaven, with no bones remaining on Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cloth that covered Jesus’s body miraculously retained his imprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Praying to God can help cure cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure all of you can considerably expand this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now maybe Pigliucci’s definition of “supernatural” is this: the supernatural is that which &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be studied by science. In that case his assertion is merely a tautology.  But I think most people conceive of the “supernatural” as something more than this: something numinous, beyond our normal experience (that’s what most of us would call “preternatural”); something like the dogmas espoused by religion.  As my friend Russell Blackford has pointed out, the definition of “supernatural” is pretty slippery, and varies from person to person. I claim that in its common usage, in which miraculous events occur on Earth through the intercession of gods, the supernatural can often be tested with science.  Any philosophy that claims it cannot is either espousing a tautology or is misguided.  And that is a kind of philosophy I cannot get behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;______&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footnote&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve watched Sam Harris’s Ted video about his forthcoming book, and tried to keep up a bit with the ensuing debate, but there’s simply too much to cover. I feel better withholding judgment on Sam’s ideas until I read his book.  So far I think that Sam’s detractors invoke the naturalistic fallacy too quickly, and that there may indeed be something about “is” that can be transferred to “ought.” Suppose, for instance, that we really do find that nearly all human judgments about morality rest on a common denominator of increased well-being? Wouldn’t that give us some guidance toward “ought?”  I do appreciate the opportunity that Sam has given us to ponder all this.  On the other hand, I’m not yet clear what Sam means by “well-being”?  Does he mean the well-being of humanity as a whole, or of (as John Rawls might say) the least advantaged individual?  Would it not be possible to commit palpably immoral acts and still increase the world’s net well-being, or would the mere occurrence of such acts (say, of torture) inevitably reduce overall well-being by eroding standards? And aren’t there different acts that have identical effects on well-being (say, Marc Hauser’s railroad-track question) but which we judge as morally non-equivalent?  There’s a lot to think about here, and I want to read Sam’s book before weighing in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4524"&gt;Our fearless leader Steve Novella gets the best responses to his posts!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(David Gorski) Homeopathy defender John Benneth has produced two videos in which he attacks Steven Novella personally with ludicrous and demonstrably false statements like “he doesn’t have any patients,” makes references to Jews, Nazis, and underwear models, and even uses the N word. He spews lots of amusing crank venom, but offers no evidence that any of Dr. Novella’s statements about homeopathy are wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4519"&gt;The continuum of surgical research in science-based medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(David Gorski) Applying the standards of science-based medicine to surgical research is problematic because of factors like variation in surgical skill and the difficulty of defining whether something is a new procedure that should be tested or just a minor technical innovation. Some new procedures have been widely adopted without proper study: efforts are underway to make surgery more evidence-based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4425"&gt;Taking Control of Death&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Harriet Hall) Literature can teach us things about the world that science can’t. Two recent novels provide insight into why some rational people reject lifesaving medical procedures and prefer to die sooner but to die on their own terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4575"&gt;Our Visit with NCCAM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Steven Novella) Josephine Briggs, the director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), invited 3 SBM bloggers to meet with her and other NCCAM officials. She reads the SBM blog, shares our concerns, and wants to make her organization a more rigorous scientific one. She even offered to have experts from SBM review NCCAM material before it is published on their website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4596"&gt;Looking for quackademic medicine in all the wrong places&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(David Gorski) Dr. Gorski solicits inputs to update his list of medical schools and academic centers that have been infiltrated by quackademic medicine and are teaching or tolerating non-science-based treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4535"&gt;CAM on Campus: Ethics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Tim Kreider) Another report from the medical school trenches describing how integrative medicine was introduced to first-year students. The lecture was misleading, contained fallacies, and suggested that a clinician’s uncontrolled observations should trump scientific evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4601"&gt;Outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Mark Crislip) A description of several recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illness around the world and in the U.S. that occurred because of falling immunization rates. Vaccines not only prevent individual illnesses, but they protect the community. &lt;/p&gt;

Dr.
MacDonald is Associate Professor, Department of Philosophy, Saint
Mary’s University, and a Nonresident Senior Fellow at Duke University’s
Kenan Institute for Ethics.  Dr. MacDonald blogs at the &lt;a href="http://www.businessethicsblog.com/"&gt;Business Ethics Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should we think about homeopathy, from the point of view of
Business Ethics? We can begin by asking the same questions about
homeopathy as we would ask about any other product. Those questions
fall under two main headings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it generally ethically OK to sell this product? Is it a product that should be on the market at all?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it’s generally ok to sell this product, what are the obligations
of companies selling them? Are there any ethical limits on how or to
whom they are marketed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I urge you to go &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedpharmacy.wordpress.com/2010/04/12/homeopathy-consumer-protection/"&gt;read and reflect upon the post&lt;/a&gt;.

The author's argument is powerful, but the section with the excerpts from the declarations of seccession by various southern states settles the facts of the case. Here's what Mississippi had to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that's bad, read Texas's:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…in this free government *all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights* [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it hasn't ended yet! There's an ongoing effort to &lt;a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/04/sons-of-the-confederacy-claim-tea-party-movement-as-kindred-spirit.php"&gt;couple the Tea Baggin' movement with Confederate goals&lt;/a&gt;, with just a little revisionism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The War Between the States was fought for the same reasons that the tea party movement today is voicing their opinion. And that is that you have large government that's not listening to the people, there's going to be heavy taxation," Fayard said Monday from his home in Duck Hill, Miss. "And the primary cause of the war was not slavery, although slavery was interwoven into the cause, but it was not the cause for the War Between the States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary cause of the Civil War &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; slavery. And unsurprisingly, &lt;a href="http://www.groundreport.com/Opinion/Tea-Party-Racism/2921697"&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt; is also a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/16/10-most-offensive-tea-par_n_187554.html"&gt;significant element&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.jackandjillpolitics.com/2009/04/the-rotting-racist-underbelly-of-the-tea-party-protests/"&gt;Tea Party movement&lt;/a&gt;. We're still fighting that damned war.&lt;/p&gt;

I usually don't, simply because I'd be inundated (so don't take this as an invitation!), and in most cases, those people ought to start their own blog and put it there. I thought I'd make an exception, though: this one is from Kelly Meagher, who is &lt;i&gt;14&lt;/i&gt;, and living in &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt;, and writing this for a school essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t nit-pick over it, although I know there are pedants here who will anyway.

It&amp;#39;s also an example of a junior high school kid being unafraid to come out about their godlessness, even in a place with a painfully conservative reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country we live in now is a strange one. Essentially, it is the melting pot of the entire world. People from across the globe come together here to live the "American Dream." The American Dream is different from person to person. Some say it's money, others say the ability to have a nice house and raise the perfect family in it. I say, it's the right to love whoever, and marry them if you want to, and being able to practice your religion without being rejected for it, or not being rejected for not practicing a religion at all! I would make these happen if I were president.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live theater. I spend my time either memorizing lines, learning choreography, or going thru the notes of a song.  I meet a lot of different people in theater. Some of these people are gay or bi. Sometimes, when we sit down during a break and just talk, I will hear the horror stories that their lives lead. One of my closest friends told me of how when he first came out to his parents by introducing his boyfriend to them, they responded ever so politely by kicking him out of the house. Others tell of how they received hate letters from people at their schools. And still more talk of friends who committed suicide because of those letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I would change that in several different ways: one would be making taunting and bullying an actual and true crime. And second would be by making gay marriage legal, in every single state. If a straight person like myself can marry and love whomever I choose, why can't everyone--especially including gays--be able to do the same?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only am I a theater dork, I happen to be an atheist. Now your first thought, if you didn't know this already, may be, "How can she be an atheist, she seems like an okay person!" If you just thought something along those lines, I'm not surprised, I get that a lot. But if you thought, "She's an atheist? Okay I'm ignoring her," then that is religious discrimination. It happens all the time. Most people are brought up thinking we are evil Satanists that try to break into people's minds and rewire them so that they worship a demon. This is a huge misconception. I want to break down this wall that people have been building since the B.C. years, and create a place where, no matter if you an atheist or a Muslim, because this happens to them too, you can worship who or what you want.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating gay rights and abolishing religious discrimination does no harm to anyone. It is only beneficial. By giving gays the rights they need, they can finally be a true part of society. And everyone's rights are protected by the Constitution, so gays can finally be included in the category of "everyone." By having people not give someone a hard time just because they are Atheist, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist or even Christian, people are able to be more open. They don't have to hold back on an interesting part of themselves to avoid being a social taboo.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I hear my friends talking about people they know that took their own lives, or I overhear people saying how bad someone is because they worship something different than they do, it makes me pretty sad. These people don't realize how they can change that. But I have. And, if I were president, this is what I would do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/coming_of_age_in_florida.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/XT4uyJ903jw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271175013927"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/i_hardly_need_to_pharyngulate.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a003215f2328c5e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">I hardly need to pharyngulate an Australian poll, do I?</title><published>2010-04-13T15:13:35Z</published><updated>2010-04-13T15:13:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/IGpO3WGCrQM/i_hardly_need_to_pharyngulate.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/i_hardly_need_to_pharyngulate.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It hardly seems sporting, it's already sailing off in the right direction.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/18/20100412/tod-obscene-sculpture-must-go-before-pop-7f81b96.html"&gt;mayor of Malta is quite anxious to have a statue removed&lt;/a&gt; from a prominent place on the road from the airport, before the Pope arrives. He might be &lt;i&gt;embarrassed&lt;/i&gt;, after all. That's the statue on the right; it's called "Colonna Mediterranea", and some people fear an obelisk is too phallic. Because, like everyone, when I see a giant green monument with multi-colored patches and a series of constrictions in it, I think of my penis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mayor shouldn't worry. The Pope and the Catholic Church have no shame.The statue might  serve a useful purpose in reminding the Catholic entourage to get their VD shots, while also intimidated them into keeping theirs in their pants. Or frocks. Or whatever they're wearing. And rather than worrying about offending the Pope, shouldn't he be more concerned about the offense to Malta?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rebelnews.org/society/religion/210103-malta-sex-victims-urge-pope-apology"&gt;Malta has its own history of priestly pedophilia&lt;/a&gt;, and has received complaints about 45 priests, which is rather impressive for such a small place…but the church claims that almost half of those accusations are groundless. I think they should be more optimistic, and phrase that as over half the accusations are not groundless. Either way, the Catholic church has been waving its erections around Malta for many years, the Pope should be able to cope with one more comparatively harmless one near the airport road. It&amp;#39;s the one that hasn&amp;#39;t raped any children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been reminded that there is an &lt;i&gt;even bigger&lt;/i&gt; phallic symbol erected in St Peter's Square, right where the Pope can see it and touch it any time he wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/04/malta_mustnt_offend_the_pope/st_peters_obelisk.jpeg" width="400" height="380" alt="st_peters_obelisk.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Malta should feel a little &lt;i&gt;inadequate&lt;/i&gt; and think about putting up more and bigger columns, instead.&lt;/p&gt;

We’re on to Chapter Fourteen, “Inflation and the Multiverse.”  Only one more episode to go!  It’s like the upcoming finale of &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;, with a slightly lower level of message-board frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to say about eternal inflation, but let’s just focus on one consequence: While the universe we see looks very smooth on large scales, on even larger (unobservable) scales the universe would be very far from smooth. The large-scale uniformity of our observed universe sometimes tempts cosmologists into assuming that it must keep going like that infinitely far in every direction. But that was always an assumption that made our lives easier, not a conclusion from any rigorous chain of reasoning. The scenario of eternal inflation predicts that the universe does not continue on smoothly as far as it goes; far beyond our observable horizon, things eventually begin to look very different. Indeed, somewhere out there, inflation is still going on. This scenario is obviously very speculative at this point, but it’s important to keep in mind that the universe on ultra-large scales is, if anything, likely to be very different than the tiny patch of universe to which we have immediate access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly straightforward chapter, trying to explain how inflation works.  Given that by this point the reader already is familiar with dark energy making the universe accelerate, and with the fine-tuning problem represented by the low entropy of the early universe, the basic case isn’t that hard to put together.  Of course we have an additional non-traditional goal as well:  to illuminate the tension between the usual story we tell about inflation and the “information-conserving evolution of our comoving patch” story we told in the last chapter.  Here’s where I argue that inflation is not the panacea it’s sometimes presented as, primarily because it’s not that easy to take all the degrees of freedom within the universe we observe and pack them delicately into a tiny patch dominated by false vacuum energy.  Put that way, it doesn’t seem all that surprising, but too many people don’t want to get the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the chapter where we first introduce the idea of the multiverse.  (The multiverse occupies less than 15 pages or so in the entire book, but to read some reactions you would think it was the dominant theme.  The publicists and I must share some of the blame for that perspective, as it is an irresistible thing to mention when talking about the book.)  Mostly I wanted to demystify the idea of the multiverse, presenting it as a perfectly natural outgrowth of the idea of inflation.  What we’re supposed to make of it is of course a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I think the chapter is a mixed success.  I like the gripping narrative of the opening pages.  But the actual explanation of inflation is kind of workmanlike and uninspiring.  I really put a lot of effort into coming up with novel explanations of entropy and quantum mechanics, which didn’t simply rehash the expositions found in other books; but for inflation I didn’t try as hard.  Partly simply because of looming deadlines, partly because I was eager to get to the rest of the book.  Hopefully the basic points are more or less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

We&amp;#39;re using Townsend&amp;#39;s A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics, which starts with spin-1/2 and develops the whole theory in terms of state vectors and matrices. This is kind of an uneasy fit for me, as I&amp;#39;m very much a swashbuckling experimentalist, and not as comfortable with formal mathematics.

This occasionally leads to good things, though, such as Monday&amp;#39;s class, on photon polarizations. the book uses some vector arithmetic to show that circularly polarized photons have spin angular momentum of one unit of h-bar. Being a formal and mathematical book, it pretty much leaves the subject there, but my immediate reaction is to look for an experiment that proves the angular momentum is real. So I did a little Googling, and turned up a paper from 1936(!) that does just that. And I talked about it in class, because I think experiments are way cool, and like to bring them in whenever possible. Having looked this up and read it carefully, I figure I might as well write it up for ResearchBlogging while I&amp;#39;m at it. The Q&amp;amp;A format worked pretty well last time, so we&amp;#39;ll stick with that.

What&amp;#39;s the paper? The paper is &amp;quot;Mechanical Detection and Measurement of the Angular Momentum of Light&amp;quot; by Richard A. Beth, who is the sole author listed, though he does single out a Mr. Wilbur Harris who &amp;quot;deserves much credit for the thoroughness and enthusiasm with which he carried out the tedious observations.&amp;quot; Much credit, but not co-authorship, evidently...

What does the paper describe? The paper reports on a series of experiments looking for angular momentum in light. Angular momentum, as the name suggests, is related to the rotational motion of objects, and circularly polarized light is predicted to have angular momentum. The experiments in the paper looked for, and found, evidence of this angular momentum by measuring the twisting of a quartz plate when circularly polarized light was sent through it. The apparatus is shown at right.

Back up a minute-- circular polarization? Yeah, circular polarization. Normally, when people talk about the polarization, they refer to the direction of the electric field associated with the classical light wave. The electric field oscillates up and down along some direction, changing its magnitude all the time.

There&amp;#39;s another way to make polarized light, though, which is to keep the magnitude of the electric field constant, and make the direction change all the time. In this case, the electric field starts out pointing up (say), then some time later points to the left, then down, then to the right, then up again. It completes one full revolution in the same time that it takes the light wave to complete an oscillation. There are two different circular polarization states, corresponding to the two different directions of rotation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuing with the tradition from last two years, I will occasionally post interviews with some of the participants of the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline2010&lt;/a&gt; conference that was held in the Research Triangle Park, NC back in January. See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Joanne Manaster from &lt;a href="http://www.joannelovesscience.com/" title=""&gt;Joanne Loves Science&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where does blogging fit into what I do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began my website about two years ago, while I was in a bit of a life crisis. As everything was chaotic, I thought, "What has ALWAYS been true about me and will always be true?" and the answer was, "I love science". Hence the website was christened "Joanne Loves Science". At first, it was to be a vehicle for delivering stem cell and tissue engineering news (to replace a newsletter I had previously published). Clearly  I am not doing that anymore. I mention this because I think it takes time for a website or blog to find its personality, so my advice to someone beginning a blog or website is to start writing about what interests you and allow your enthusiasm to shine through. You will eventually find the tone you wish to convey to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a decision, based on time constraints, to not accept comments on my posts, although I can turn them on at anytime if it should seem worthwhile.  My "About Joanne" page is quite long, as this has grown out of a demand from young people, especially young ladies, to get a sneak peek at my life, especially the modeling career. Happily, I am much more well-known now for my outreach currently than I ever was while modeling. This is very gratifying as I would much rather be known for adding a bit of intellectual value to society than merely being a pleasant object to look at. That being said, thanks to good genes and some tricks one learns while modeling, I am still maintaining a youthful exterior that belies my years of experience in academia, and I thought I should use that while I can. My telegenicity (or, as Neil DeGrasse Tyson once said of me, my "youtube-genicity") has come in handy to find new ways to reach to the general public about science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look at my site will demonstrate three main topics/beliefs I maintain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There are numerous popular science books out there for your enjoyment and enrichment. I hope to share my love for these books (and gratitude to the authors) by demonstrating the variety of books available. I like the concept of promoting books for many reasons, which should probably be written in a carefully constructed blog post!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Everyday items have science behind them, in them, etc. I sometimes demonstrate this via the science of beauty, which is, by far, the most popular page of my website after the first page.  I also use common/unusual items (gummy bears) to highlight simple scientific concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basics of the scientific method and how scientists conduct and communicate their work are very important and I am trying to gently reintroduce these concepts to my readers. Most American students have heard the same boring lessons about the scientific method a handful of times, but seldom grasp it fully and then are left befuddled by the significance or validity of scientific (or pseudoscientific) findings, possibly leading to misunderstandings and misconceptions about scientific topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the book recommendations, I try to make a point to meet any science author who comes near to town.  At the very least, I hope to express my gratitude for the work they do in making science accessible. If I have more time, I appreciate a nice conversation because I am a great admirer of intelligence and enthusiasm, both of which authors simply must possess. This is just pure selfishness on my part! My life has been extraordinarily enriched by the interactions with the ones I've communicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently met Jonah Lehrer when he came into town. He graciously spent some time with me and even helped create this video about the continuum of scientific expertise using my growing Barbie doll collection. He is quite the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out, for those of you who are new to my videos, that while I have experience "working the camera"......&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Joanne Manaster pic1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Joanne%20Manaster%20pic1.jpg" width="251" height="403" style="float:left;margin:0 00px 00px 0"&gt;&lt;img alt="Joanne Manaster pic2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Joanne%20Manaster%20pic2.jpg" width="225" height="403" style="float:left;margin:0 00px 00px 0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.....I have much to learn about operating one, so the video is slightly crooked, not centered and the lighting leaves something to be desired. I notice in particular that this one has many blips and skips which I suspect is an effect of uploading in less than optimal internet connections and my poor editing skills. Hopefully the content more than makes up for this! Grab a cup of coffee or tea or a beer and sit back and watch as Jonah drops his cell phone (oops) and confesses his predilection for blue bracelets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/4wCAQqeCcUA%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0xe1600f%26color2%3D0xfebd01&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What next? Carl Zimmer and Matchbox cars? Steven B. Johnson and Hungry, Hungry Hippo? Rebecca Skloot and Candyland?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About twitter and other social media, but mostly twitter:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has been a wonderful experience for me. Allow me to bullet point the benefits I have experienced by using twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It has been a fabulous way to promote my videos and get the word out, hopefully to the appropriate audience.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I am learning to become a better science communicator by watching carefully how other great science communicators do their jobs!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I have been richly rewarded by new friendships and collaborations I have made on twitter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I enjoy leaving an "open door " to the public in order to indicate that I am available to carry on a rational and friendly exchanges about science. I follow most people back because I have discovered that a seemingly "random" person will pipe in with comments such as "That was interesting." Or "Can you answer such and such?" And if I can't answer, my contacts might be able to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I've learned to set some personal boundaries on the internet, often learning this the hard way, unfortunately (particularly on youtube). It has been a surprisingly gratifying skill. I'm also learning to discern those who want to start an argument just for the sake of arguing or those who are trying to trick me into supporting their pseudoscience or to help them promote themselves. These people, frankly, take away time from those who have a genuine interest and curiosity about science and I'm learning to deal with them effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did I discover science blogs?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does anyone discover anything on the internet these days? By accident, of course. I'm sure I was looking up particular bits of information and came across one blog, then another, and another. I use the information in these blogs, frequently visiting ones with reliable and well documented information. I enjoy reading information and opinions from great science communicators!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And finally, you ask, what about my future plans?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I have so many ideas, it's a little ridiculous. I hope to continue communicating science, gaining a larger audience for the cause of quality and entertaining science. If I have to manipulate the entire world with gummy bears, cats, Barbie dolls, (and coming soon: cookies!), a giant helping of whimsical, lacy, heart-shaped Midwest charm coming from a fresh-faced biologist, then I'm going to do it. Unabashedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a promise to myself that I would never do anything on a video that I haven't done in class.  Well, it looks now as if I will have to sing in class. Yep, I sang in the next video. Why? Because thinking about science makes me so happy, I want to sing. That, or I just felt during some lapse of reasoning, that you all might want to see me sing a bouncy pop song and add scientific commentary. Why should musicians get a corner on metaphor? Pedantic's where it's at!&lt;/p&gt;

PZ Myers has discovered a company that markets fragments of DNA to promote good health. You don't actually eat the DNA, instead you drink water that has been exposed to the DNA [&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/more_magic_dna_snake_oil.php"&gt;More Magic Snake Oil&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company is called &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/more_magic_dna_snake_oil.php"&gt;Homeovitality®&lt;/a&gt; and one of their products is &lt;a href="http://www.homeovitality.com/super_memory.html"&gt;Super Memory/IQ&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m showing a picture of the product taken from their website in order to prove to you that it actually exists. This is part of the discussion concerning its scientific/medical efficacy—an important part of science education and social responsibility. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How does it work? Before I explain it to you, you'd better be sitting down. Try and remain calm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two genes in your genome called CRM2 and SNAP-25. CHRM2 encodes a muscarinic receptors and various alleles of this gene have been associated with alcohol dependence and drug dependance, according to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database [&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=118493"&gt;CHOLINERGIC RECEPTOR, MUSCARINIC, 2; CHRM2&lt;/a&gt;]. SNAP-25 encodes a synaptosomal-associate protein of 25kDa molecular weight. There have been reports that alleles of SNAP-25 are associated with hyperactivity but a separate study did not confirm this association according to OMIN [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/CHOLINERGIC%20RECEPTOR,%20MUSCARINIC,%202;%20CHRM2"&gt;SYNAPTOSOMAL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 25-KD; SNAP25&lt;/a&gt;].     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homeovitality® had some DNA sequences made for each of these genes: a 164 bp fragment in the case of CRM2 and a 144 bp fragment in the case of SNAP-25 [&lt;a href="http://www.homeovitality.com/homeovitality.html"&gt;What is Homeovitality®?&lt;/a&gt;]. They used these pieces of DNA to make the Super Memory/IQ product.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Homeovitality® products have also been succussed at each dilution stage so they will also help to promote desirable forms of hybrid vigour in a “like promotes like” mode of action involving some of the mechanisms (4) described by Dr. Kratz, (http://kulisz.com/how_does_homeopathy_work.htm).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homeovitality® products are safe because firstly, they are used at similar dilutions to classical homeopathic disease remedies and secondly, hybrid vigour is a completely natural biological process that has been developed by nature over millions of years to enable all creatures to enjoy “super health” and disease resistance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&amp;quot;Succussed refers to the practice of forcefully striking the various dilution solutions in order to help &amp;quot;potentize&amp;quot; the effect. &amp;quot;Hybrid vigor&amp;quot; refers to the belief that these DNA sequences—or, more appropriately, the memory of these sequences—will produce heterozygosity in patients and that&amp;#39;s a good thing.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-6971968579748950207?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271171201062"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23302">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e2d50ead2565503</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">A Christian Explains Why He Won’t Argue with Atheists Online Anymore</title><published>2010-04-13T15:00:35Z</published><updated>2010-04-13T15:00:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/13/a-christian-explains-why-he-wont-argue-with-atheists-online-anymore/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year, Christian &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Campbell&lt;/strong&gt; posted a list of “&lt;a href="http://st-eutychus.com/2009/five-things-that-would-make-atheists-seem-nicer/"&gt;Five things that would make atheists seem nicer&lt;/a&gt;” and got properly “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/advice_for_atheists.php"&gt;pissed on&lt;/a&gt;” by &lt;strong&gt;PZ&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan says he’s been one of those Christians who comments on atheist blogs in order to present an alternative perspective to readers — but now, he’s “on the verge of giving up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://st-eutychus.com/2010/eight-things-ive-learned-from-arguing-with-atheists-online-and-why-i-mostly-cant-be-bothered-anymore/"&gt;there are 8 reasons why&lt;/a&gt;.  He goes into more detail on his website, but my responses to the main claims are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. If you argue with atheists online, especially on their turf, you will almost always be outnumbered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree.  And Nathan explains it perfectly: We don’t have a church, so many of us congregate on the Internet instead.  We also have each other’s backs if we see a commenter going after one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Being outnumbered makes actually engaging with arguments hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being outnumbered shouldn’t be a problem if there were good arguments to make.  Christians don’t have them when it comes to most of our issues, plain and simple.  It’s not an issue of the token Christian only being able to address a couple of points among the many presented — it’s that even when they address specific points, they often do it poorly and dig themselves into a deeper hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. If you’re going to talk about science, logic or morality you need to be careful to frame your terminology accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn right. Christians need to realize they’re talking to people who have studied these topics extensively. As a result, they make rookie mistakes. Hell, I do it sometimes, too.  But I also know my limits and I try to avoid talking about scientific research and philosophy because I know those aren’t my areas of expertise.  Some of the online Christian commenters think their pastor taught them all they need to know about science and logic and morality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Atheists have no interest in nuance. They don’t pay any regard to context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan calls us out for “quote-mining” the Bible, among other things.  That’s just ridiculous. We quote Bible passages — in context and out of it — as much as pastors do. If you want to call us out for taking a passage out of context, I want to see you calling out pastors for doing the same thing because &lt;em&gt;they do it all the time&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a problem with us taking something &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt;?  Tell that to the approximately 100,000,000 Christians who &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/27682/onethird-americans-believe-bible-literally-true.aspx"&gt;believe the same thing&lt;/a&gt;.   Are they good Christians or foolish ones?  What do you say to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible’s full of good ideas and bad ideas (mostly bad ideas), true statements and untrue statements (mostly untrue statements).  Don’t whine just because we happen to be the people who aren’t afraid to point them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. “Christians” are your own worst enemies in these contexts. A week’s worth of reasoned and fruitful discussion can be very easily undone by one comment made without being mindful of presenting the “truth with love.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are a lot of annoying Christians out there.  They make the same mistakes.  They quote the Bible (in and out of whatever “context” Nathan thinks applies). They CAPITALIZE EVERYTHING as if their thoughts are more important than anyone else’s. They make comments that have nothing to do with the topic at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes someone a “good Christian commenter”? Well, I have a number of them on this site and I think I can explain why I appreciate their input.  Their end goal is not conversion of everyone else.  They know better than to do that.  Their goal is to offer a different perspective and they’re not afraid to defend themselves.  If they rebut a point that has been made, they’re respectful when they do it.  They acknowledge when Christians make mistakes and aren’t afraid to criticize their own people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Most “atheists” are antitheists, most hold atheism at the core of their identity — but this is not true for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I don’t know what this has to do with anything.  There are different types of atheists just as there are different types of Christians.  Even if I don’t agree with what other atheists say/believe, I don’t deny their atheism.  I know they don’t believe in any gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan claims “there are, in fact, external issues to take into account when deciding if a Christian is a Christian.”  I’m sure there are… but every church/sect/denomination has their own set of rules. It’s usually, “We’re Christians and everybody else is not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. You’ll almost never change anybody’s mind online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not if you make bad points, you won’t.  And most Christian commenters make absurd claims that won’t win anyone over to their side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, people who have something intelligent to say, with the ability to back it up, can really make a big dent in someone’s preconceived notions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what the number is of people who have become atheists — or who have become more active about their atheism or who have come out of the closet for the first time — because they read atheist blogs online.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess, though, is that the number is not trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Your best bet in these situations is just to bring everything back to a question of the historicity of Jesus and his resurrection, this, after all, is the lynchpin of our belief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Christians have tried and failed.  Books have been written and debunked.  If that’s all you have to offer, then you have nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this isn’t to say Christians shouldn’t bother commenting online or remarking on atheists’ blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if their purpose in doing that is to evangelize, they’re not going to accomplish anything worthwhile.  They’ll just make it that much harder for Christians who want to participate in a real debate on the issues — something that is increasingly difficult to do at Christian blogs and in churches.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Personally I can appreciate Bright Eyes once in a while, but on the whole I just don't get it. After shifting to 70s punk--which I can really get into--it happened...
"So I googled you. Science, eh?" Adam grins.

Here we go again. "Uh, yeah."

"I gotta ask. Climate change. Prove yourself. Make me believe."
And it starts... You see, I'm used to this challenge. Climate change might as well be the Yankees vs the Sox. It's a pub conversation about who's 'winning' when everyone is really loses unless we act. And I can already tell Adam's a bright guy. He's a skeptical thinker who doesn't have access to journal articles, but does hear the news media fallout.  He's got a lot of questions about so-called email conspiracies, but at least he's interested in a discussion.

So we have another drink and I tell him a little more about what's going on in oceans, on land, and in the atmosphere. He listens politely, and soon we're back to Kurt Cobain.&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F04%2F13%2Fscene-from-the-parlor%2F" width="100%" height="60" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271170769419"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=174334">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f4e467bd26792ff7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="Department of Energy"/><category term="doe"/><category term="LED lights"/><category term="national budget"/><category term="Tomorrow is Greener"/><title type="html">LEDs to cut the National Budget: According to the Department of</title><published>2010-04-13T14:43:06Z</published><updated>2010-04-13T14:43:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/174334/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEDs to cut the National Budget:&lt;/strong&gt; According to the Department of Energy (DOE), widespread adoption of &lt;a href="http://www.tomorrowisgreener.com/?p=336&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TomorrowIsGreener+%28Tomorrow+is+greener%29&amp;amp;utm_content=Twitter"&gt;LED lights could save $120 billion&lt;/a&gt; between 2010 and 2030.

Don’t have an abortion or use any form of contraception, rape a prepubescent child instead, no contraception needed; if they get a disease, who cares, you had your fun. They must have had a good reason to conceal these acts and relocate said priests, right? But what could be more valuable than the prevention of child molestation to an organization that “has deep respect for life?” What could make them be so careful to hide these offenses? Easy; they did it for “the good of the universal church.” They hid these offenders and offenses because they thought it would cause embarrassment! They must not have thought this through very well… Information gets out, reaches the internet, and then you really have a real opportunity for embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do instead of defrocking the priest and turning him over to civil authorities? Relocation and cover-ups, of course! These pretentious and pompously pious fuckwits should not be allowed to get away with this.

This is a refreshing bit of journalism that everyone should read.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is no secret that we have been &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/02/the-guardian-disappoints/"&gt;unimpressed&lt;/a&gt; by the quality of reporting of climate science or late.  From the insinuation that data were manipulated (for which there remains no evidence, &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/12/are-the-cru-data-suspect-an-objective-assessment/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;primae facie&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise), to the suggestion that “climate skeptics” had somehow been kept from publishing in peer reviewed literature (how, we wonder, does &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/01/lindzen-and-choi-unraveled/"&gt;Lindzen keep getting published&lt;/a&gt;?), to the blind repetition of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/mar/24/sunday-times-ipcc-amazon-rainforest"&gt;false claims of major errors in the IPCC&lt;/a&gt; (when only &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/02/ipcc-errors-facts-and-spin"&gt;a couple of actual errors&lt;/a&gt; – and none of them in the primary (Working Group 1) report – have been found), to the falsehood that climate data have not been readily available (&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/11/wheres-the-data"&gt;yes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/12/are-the-cru-data-suspect-an-objective-assessment"&gt;they have&lt;/a&gt;), the reporting has been more akin to the populist fearmongering of the McCarthy era than to the celebrated investigative journalism of Watergate.  That’s too bad, and not just because sensationalistic journalism may have done lasting damage to some institutions and individual scientists.  More importantly, it has done damage to public understanding, quite the opposite of the rightful role of the free press in a democratic society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, we were delighted to read the &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15719298"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15720419"&gt;“leader”&lt;/a&gt; in the March 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; edition of &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;.  And our delight with the &lt;i&gt;The Economist’s&lt;/i&gt; take on the story is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; that they share our opinion on the politics surrounding climate science.  Indeed, they appear to take at face value that the stolen CRU emails reveal ’shameful mistakes’ by scientists, and the dubious claim that IPCC errors (such as they are) have ‘tended to exaggerate the extent of climate change’.  They also repeat a few other contrarian memes – such as the idea that the various “Hockey Stick” climate reconstructions killed off the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/11/medieval-warm-period-mwp/"&gt;Medieval Warm Period&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/temperaturevariations-in-past-centuries-and-the-so-called-hockey-stick/"&gt;they didn’t&lt;/a&gt;) – without sufficient criticism, to our taste.  Yet this is actually the strength of the &lt;i&gt;The Economist’s&lt;/i&gt; articles: rather than engaging in ultimately rather trivial bickerings, they provide a refreshingly accurate and up to date assessment of much of recent climate science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; emphasizes the obvious yet frequently overlooked point that that even if the most outrageous claims about the land temperature data were true, there would still be the temperature data from the &lt;a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/sst/ersstv3.php"&gt;oceans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html#msu_decadal_trends"&gt;satellites&lt;/a&gt; to contend with.  And they articulate very well the more subtle understanding that the possibility of errors in the instrumental data doesn’t actually have a lot of bearing on our understanding of climate.  It is often assumed, they write,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“that data are simple, graspable and trustworthy, whereas theory is complex recondite and slippery….  In the case of climate change, as in much of science, the reverse is at least as fair a picture.  Data are vexatious, theory is quite straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/a-climate-science-forecast-in-the-wake-of-climate-files"&gt;Those&lt;/a&gt; who do not appreciate this point can easily be misled by the cavillous arguments of others who have become adept at focusing on this or that that specific bit of data and using it to convince people that they have uncovered some fundamental flaw in the theory.  Yet &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t simply dismiss these criticisms out of hand; they are, for example, exceedingly fair to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Dick Lindzen, who views the possible role of clouds as a strong negative feedback as a reason to believe the climate sensitivity is lower than &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/03/climate-sensitivity-plus-a-change"&gt;all the other evidence&lt;/a&gt; indicates.  (At they same time, they get Linzden to admit that he agrees that the mainstream views on the magnitude of the water vapor feedback -– roughly doubling the direct radiative impact of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; — is probably correct).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our only technical criticism of the &lt;i&gt;The Economist’s&lt;/i&gt; main article is that it states that the IPCC ‘expects the temperature to have increased by 1.1&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to 6.4 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C by 2100’, without pointing out that this combines the uncertainty in climate sensitivity with the uncertainty in policy.  This could easily be taken to suggest that we could keep the global mean temperature to within 1.1&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C above 19th century values, without any reduction in fossil fuel use, a &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/hit-the-brakes-hard/"&gt;virtually impossible&lt;/a&gt; result.  But this doesn’t detract from the larger point that &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; is making here – that the uncertainty is itself a reason for action, not a reason to delay action.  As they succinctly put it: “The fact that the uncertainties allow you to construct a relatively benign future does not allow you to ignore futures in which climate change is large”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; appears to understand what balanced reporting actually means: accurate reporting of science can be done while neither stifling debate nor accepting the criticisms of so-called ‘skeptics’ at face value.   The self-described goal of &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; is to engage vigorously in the “contest between intelligence and timid ignorance,” and they are doing a rather good job of it.  Whether this will prove sufficient to win the contest against aggressive ignorance is, of course, another matter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>eric</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271165988680"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=13884">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/df38597ad3c60485</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Herschel"/><category term="infrared"/><category term="Rosette Nebula"/><title type="html">Open wide and say Awwwww</title><published>2010-04-13T13:13:47Z</published><updated>2010-04-13T13:13:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/RwoEtbQtA_w/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/13/open-wide-and-say-awwwww/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every now and again a new picture from a space telescope comes down the pipe&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that’s a little bit different, a little bit of a step to the left. I think this image counts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://esamultimedia.esa.int/images/rosetta/hobys_rosette_05.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/herschel_rosette1.jpg" alt="herschel_rosette" title="herschel_rosette" width="610" height="466"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kewwwwl. That’s the Rosette Nebula as seen by &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMWQ59MT7G_index_0.html"&gt;the Herschel far infrared observatory&lt;/a&gt;. The Rosette is a huge star forming region, and one that’s been around a while. In &lt;a href="http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0554.html"&gt;optical images&lt;/a&gt; its name is obvious; it resembles a huge flower in space. The central region looks empty, and that’s because it mainly is: fierce winds from newborn stars have excavated a giant bubble in the center of the nebula. Acting like a snowplow, they have pushed the material from the middle of the gas cloud out to the edges, where it piles up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That’s what you’re seeing here; the inner wall of the nebula. This image is a long walk from the optical, though. It’s false color, where blue, green, and red represent the light from the nebula at 70, 160, and 250 microns. For comparison, the reddest light your eye can see is less than one micron in wavelength, so this is way far out in the IR. The reddest light in the image is coming from dust that’s only a few degrees above absolute zero! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bright spots you see peppering the image are cocoons of gas and dust surrounding stars in the process of birth. They’re not alone; see the finger-like tendrils all pointing off to the right? Those are regions of slightly denser dust which have resisted the winds from the central stars of the nebula (off the edge of this image to the right). Like sandbars forming behind rocks in a stream, these fingers indicate that the tips are denser, and are probably where stars are forming as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can’t get over is how three-dimensional this image looks! It’s like the mouth to Hell from Poltergeist. Well, a little bit. If the mouth were 5000 light years away, 100 light years (a quadrillion km, or 600 trillion miles!) across, and kept at a chilly -260° C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a big, cold, far away mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the analogy isn’t fair, anyway. In the movie, that mouth was where you went after you die, but in reality, this cavernous cloud is where life gets started. Maybe our own Sun was born in a nebula like this; &lt;a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/652/2/1755"&gt;some research indicates&lt;/a&gt; it may have been. So while this picture may look a little bit frightening, to me it’s comforting. Even sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, who can resist a nursery full of babies?&lt;/p&gt;

I want the public to be aware of the fact that homeopathy is based upon the “law of similars” – which is nothing more than the ancient superstition of sympathetic magic. I want the public to be aware of the fact that most homeopathic solutions are diluted far past the point where there is likely to be a single molecule of active ingredient left – and therefore claims for the homeopathic “law of infinitesimals” violates the law of mass action and the laws of thermodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also do not want to silence homeopaths, as some have suggested. I want them to speak for themselves – every time a homeopath opens their mouth they make my job easier. Right now Dana Ullman, the ultimate online homeopathy apologist, is spewing incoherent nonsense in the comments at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4671"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. You also have to see &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0c5yClip4o&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;Dr. Warner’s brilliant explanation&lt;/a&gt; for how homeopathy works (every time someone watches this video Einstein’s corpse cries.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now John Benneth is becoming the energizer bunny of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dGSsS6L2jM&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;hilarious YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, this is beyond parody. Nothing’s better than homeopathy explained by a raving…well, take a look for yourself. I am slightly embarrassed to have Benneth as my new nemesis. I preferred &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=484"&gt;Egnor&lt;/a&gt; – at least he was coherent at times and didn’t come off as a drunk who just rolled out of bed. With Egnor you could play “Spot the Logical Fallacy” and it would be challenging at times. Benneth makes it too easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So – I want the public to be as aware of homeopathy as possible. It seems the more people know about this absurd pseudoscience, the further it sinks. In the UK homeopathy is on the ropes, after the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3961"&gt;House of Commons Science and Technology Committee &lt;/a&gt;concluded that homeopathy is worthless nonsense that should be completely abandoned. And now the mainstream media in the US is catching on (they are usually slow to these parties, so this is a good sign).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Woolston of the LA Times does a fine job evaluating a new&lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-skeptic-20100412,0,5348639.story"&gt; homeopathic solution called Quietus&lt;/a&gt; (I guess no one at the company watched Children of Men – awesome movie, btw – in which Quietus was the name of a suicide pill). Woolston reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claims: The TV ad for Quietus says that the product “has helped thousands of people with tinnitus” and will “stop the ringing fast.” The ad doesn’t explain how Quietus is supposed to work, although the website does clarify that it was “created by a rock drummer” to treat his tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website for Tinnitus Relief Formula says “if you do only one thing for your tinnitus … this is it!” The site also says that “many individuals will experience a reduction in symptoms in four weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow – a rock drummer. That’s even better than a school teacher. Tinnitus is a persistent ringing in the ears, often a symptom of damage to the auditory nerve. It is difficult to treat, which makes is ripe for exploitation. There are different kinds of spontaneous head noises, however. The Quietus website mentions pulsatile tinnitus, without further explanation, as if this is one of the types of tinnitus they can treat. But pulsatile tinnitus can be a symptom of a serious condition – a blockage in the carotid arteries that feed the brain – and may be a warning of an increased risk for stroke. There is no mention of this on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nowhere on the website any mention of what is in Quietus or how it might work. I could not find any mention of ingredients online, and I have even seen reports that the package does not list ingredients. Of course, if it is homeopathic, it likely does not matter. Except that some “homeopathic” solutions are only slightly diluted (like Zicam) and they have real amounts of active ingredients. So it would be nice to know if there was anything in this product – but probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course there is no evidence that Quietus works. All we have are useless cherry-picked anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products like Quietus also raise a salient question – apologists for homeopathy often claim that research is negative because the homeopathic “remedies” tested were not properly individualized. Homeopathy is not like drugs, where you can have a one-size-fits-all approach. Every person needs their own personalized remedy. This, of course, is just more superstitious nonsense on the part of homeopaths, and a convenient bit of special pleading to explain away negative results. This claim is also incompatible with every homeopathic remedy on the market, like Quietus, which cannot be individualized. Internal consistency has never been the hallmark of quackery and pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for homeopathy awareness week, please do your part to spread the word – homeopathy is dangerous bunk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271160662300"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/dr_oz_americas_doctor_and_the_abdication.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d4d85c765e53b8c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Popular culture"/><title type="html">Dr. Oz: America's doctor and the abdication of professional responsibility</title><published>2010-04-13T13:00:29Z</published><updated>2010-04-13T13:00:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/gqKkDrOIGQo/dr_oz_americas_doctor_and_the_abdication.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/dr_oz_americas_doctor_and_the_abdication.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, there was once a time when Dr. Mehmet Oz didn't bother me that much. At least, for all his flirting with woo, I never quite thought that he had completely gone over to the Dark Side. Although I probably knew deep down that I was fooling myself. Maybe it was because Dr. Oz is a surgeon--and not just a surgeon but a cardiac surgeon. After the enthusiastic embrace of pseudoscience by so many surgeons, and in particular &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/02/slinking_away_in_shame_over_my_professio.php"&gt;Dr. Michael Egnor&lt;/a&gt;'s embrace of "intelligent design" creationism and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/michael_egnor_deepak_chopra_you_be_the_j_1.php"&gt;mind-brain dualism&lt;/a&gt;, maybe I didn't want to believe that yet another surgeon had fallen for a different form of pseudoscience and unreason. It just goes to show that even skeptics and supporters of science-based medicine can be prone to wishful thinking. Then Dr. Oz's unequivocal public embrace of &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; on his show, as well as his touting of "alternative therapies that really work" (hint: they don't) removed any remaining cover that allowed me to delude myself into thinking that Dr. Oz wasn't that bad. Without a doubt he is as bad as Deepak Chopra in many ways, although he probably hasn't reached Joe Mercola territory yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give him time, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/combatting_the_oprah_effect.php"&gt;the Oprah effect is strong&lt;/a&gt; and, remember, &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; is nothing more than &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/reiki_versus_the_catholic_church.php"&gt;faith healing based on Eastern mysticism&lt;/a&gt; rather than Judeo-Christian religion. Unfortunately, Dr. Oz has become "America's doctor." Fortunately, people are starting to notice his promotion of a range of dubious therapies that range from just questionable to what can only be described as pure quackery (&lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, for instance). While much of what Dr. Oz promotes is actually science-based medicine, it is adulterated with pseudoscience, or, as I can't resist saying, he "integrates" pseudoscience with science-based medicine, making him an excellent example of a practitioner of "integrative" medicine. Fortunately, journalists are starting to notice and ask some hard questions, journalists like Trine Tsouderos, who last Friday published an article in The Chicago Tribune entitled &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/ct-met-dr-oz-20100408,0,3288031.story"&gt;Questioning Dr. Oz&lt;/a&gt;. It's about time someone publicly questioned Dr. Oz, in particularl how he seasons his mundane science-based recommendations with questionable recommendations and even downright pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A furious transatlantic row has erupted over quotes that were  attributed to a retired Italian bishop, which suggested that Jews were  behind the current criticism of the Catholic church’s record on tackling  clerical sex abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website quoted Giacomo Babini, the emeritus  bishop of Grosseto, as saying he believed a “Zionist attack” was behind  the criticism, considering how “powerful and refined” the criticism is. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments, which have been denied by the bishop, follow a series  of statements from Catholic churchmen alleging the existence of plots to  weaken the church and &lt;a title="More  from guardian.co.uk on Pope Benedict XVI" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pope-benedict-xvi"&gt;P&lt;/a&gt;ope Benedict XVI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegedly  speaking to the Catholic website Pontifex, Babini, 81, was quoted as saying: “They  do not want the church, they are its natural enemies. Deep down,  historically speaking, the Jews are God killers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do note, however, that although Babini’s statements were published on a Catholic website, he denies them.  The Church is also rushing to distance itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the interview appeared on Italy’s main newspaper sites today,  complete with the American reaction, the Bishops’ Conference rushed out a  statement quoting Babini denying he had ever given the interview in the  first place. “Statements I have never made about our Jewish brothers  have been attributed to me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this one may be my favorite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://americanhumanist.org/system/storage/29/1499/ingoodwetrust-sky.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://americanhumanist.org/system/storage/29/1499/ingoodwetrust-sky.jpg" title="InGoodWeTrust" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“This billboard nicely sums up two of the main messages of the American Humanist Association,” said Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the AHA. “First, that you don’t have to believe in God to be good — in fact, humanists and other nontheists see being good as one of the most important of responsibilities in our one and only life. Second, that church and state should remain separate for the benefit of us all.” Speckhardt argued that “In Good We Trust” is a more inclusive and appropriate sentiment than the “In God We Trust” motto, which runs afoul the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Niose, president of the American Humanist Association, pointed out that the official national motto had an unsavory beginning. “The adoption of the ‘In God We Trust’ motto came at the height of the Cold War and McCarthyism in the 1950s, and it is unfortunate that we still cling to such religious rhetoric today. E pluribus unum, the Latin phrase for ‘out of many, one,’ would be a much more appropriate motto. It reflects the true character of American society and government.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2010-04-in-good-we-trust-says-new-humanist-billboard"&gt;AHA’s press release&lt;/a&gt;, the billboard can be seen on Highway 95, “just south of Moscow near the Sweet Avenue cross street, facing northbound traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billboard is a wonderfully simple concept.  It’s an idea anyone can get behind… unless you’re deluded enough to think that we can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be good if we believe in a god (a proposition that is so easily disprovable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it’s probably someone from that group who will inevitably vandalize this billboard.  I hope it doesn’t happen, but for some reason, the “moral, God-fearing” people are the same ones who can’t seem to stand any challenge to their beliefs.&lt;br&gt;

The cellular media darlings of action observation and action execution would like to join you in the human hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas critical for memory.&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; you say. &amp;quot;Direct evidence for the existence of mirror neurons has been obtained from single cell recordings in monkeys in specific brain regions. These include the ventral premotor cortex (area F5) and the inferior parietal lobule (Rizzolatti &amp;amp; Sinigaglia, 2010), not the hippocampus!&amp;quot;Figure  1 (Rizzolatti &amp;amp; Sinigaglia, 2010): The parieto-frontal mirror network. Lateral view of the macaque brain. The coloured areas represent the areas of the parieto-frontal circuit containing mirror neurons: the ventral premotor cortex (area F5), area PFG (located between parietal areas PF and PG) and the anterior intraparietal area (AIP)... The parieto-frontal circuit receives high-order visual information from areas located inside the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the inferior temporal lobe (IT). Neither of these temporal regions has motor properties. The parieto-frontal circuit is under control of the frontal lobe (area F6 or pre-supplementary motor area and the ventral prefrontal cortex (VPF)). The inset provides an enlarged view of area F5. IAS, inferior limb of the arcuate sulcus; LIP, lateral intraparietal area; VIP, ventral intraparietal area.Yet we&amp;#39;ve been led to believe that a new study published in Current Biology (Mukamel et al., 2010) has recorded from mirror neurons in the human brain for the first time. Last Friday, BPS Research Digest asked:Is this the first ever direct evidence for human mirror neurons?...Although recordings from single cells in the brains of monkeys have  identified &amp;#39;mirror&amp;#39; neurons that respond both to the execution of a  movement and the observation of another agent performing that same  movement, the existence of such cells in humans has, up until now, been  inferred only from indirect evidence, particularly brain imaging. Now Roy Mukamel and colleagues  have provided what appears to be the first ever direct evidence, using  implanted electrode recordings of single cells, for the existence of  mirror neurons in humans.The short answer to this question is &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; (unless you want to dilute the meaning of &amp;quot;mirror neurons&amp;quot; beyond recognition). To briefly summarize, the participants in the study were 21 patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. Depth electrodes were implanted into their brains to monitor for seizures, in advance of a possible surgical intervention to remove the epileptic focus. The electrode locations were constrained by clinical considerations and included regions in the medial frontal cortex (supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex) and the medial temporal lobe (amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal  cortex). The ventral premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobe were not targeted.The experimental protocol consisted of 3 tasks: Grasp, Facial expressions and Control.During Grasp, subjects were presented with video clips of a hand grasping a mug and with the words ‘Finger’ or ‘Hand’. They were instructed to grasp a mug with precision grip or whole hand prehension when the words ‘Finger’ or ‘Hand’, respectively, were presented and to simply observe when the video clips were played. During Facial expressions, subjects were presented with a picture of a smiling or a frowning face and with the word ‘Smile’ or ‘Frown’. They were instructed to perform the corresponding action when the words were presented and to simply observe when the pictures were presented... In the Control task, subjects were presented with the words used as cues in the Grasp and Facial expression parts of the experiment and were instructed to covertly read the words and refrain from making hand movements or facial gestures.Results are depicted in Table 1 below (click on image for a larger view).In each brain region, only a minority of cells responded with an increased (or decreased) firing rate during both observation and execution of the same action. Percentages of these Observation/Execution neurons ranged from a low of 2% in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex to 11% in hippocampus, 12% in parahippocampal gyrus, and 14% in supplementary motor area. The MTL regions also contain neurons that respond during the spontaneous recall of episodic memories (Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2008). So how can you tell if a neuronal response in the current experiment is related to memory recall or to action observation/execution? You can&amp;#39;t, but that doesn&amp;#39;t matter!The action observation/execution matching neurons in the medial temporal  lobe may match the sight of actions of others with the memory of those  same actions performed by the observer. Thus during action-execution, a  memory of the executed action is formed, and during action-observation  this memory trace is reactivated. This interpretation is in line with  the hypothesis of multiple mirroring mechanisms in the primate brain, a  hypothesis that can easily account for the presence of mirroring cells  in many cortical areas.&amp;quot;Now wait a minute,&amp;quot; said Professor Patricia Churchland [as paraphrased by Prof. Greg Hickok in Talking Brains]. &amp;quot;If mirror neurons are all over the brain then don&amp;#39;t  they lose their explanatory power?&amp;quot;Good point.Another issue is whether a given single- or multi-unit recording responded by increasing or decreasing its firing rate relative to the passive condition. It could be either, or both:Among the 68 action observation/execution matching cells [out of 1170 total cells recorded], 33 increased their firing rate during both observation and execution of a particular action.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;today has an &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/apr/13/science-cool"&gt;interesting but rather light-weight piece&lt;/a&gt; about whether we are living through a golden age of science. In fact, the article is more about science on British TV, which makes it doubly parochial. Furthermore, the article seems too influenced the undoubted success of my Mancunian colleague Professor Brian Cox (cue arty photo of Cox looking moody in an Oasis-style parka).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a more important point to be made here. Although TV is incredibly important, it is declining as a primary mode of communication/education, as compared to the rise of the Internet. And while the wave of science blogging, of which WEIT is a small part, marks a really interesting and important development, it would be naive to imagine that the tide of non-scientific nonsense has been turned. The number of irrational/paranoid/whacko sites is probably more than the number of atoms in the known universe, while the comments on YouTube and similar sites reveal a depth of ignorance – particularly amongst the young – that shows the work that remains to be done. And as for the growth of religion…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-UK readers, the backdrop to the article is the current British general election campaign, and the looming threat of massive – but absolutely massive – public spending cuts, which will occur whoever wins (but will be far worse under the Conservatives). And high up the list of sectors heading for cuts is the science budget. This article is partly an attempt to influence that debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cox says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Did you know, for example, that Britain’s entire science budget was £3.3bn last year, out of a total government spend of £621bn? And that physics-based industry alone contributes 6.4% of our GDP – comparable to the much vaunted and rather more costly financial services sector – yet no party is committed to protecting it after the next election.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice Roberts, a medic who has done programmes about human anatomy and anthropology, hits the nail on the head :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We seem to have been getting very mixed messages from the government about the value of science to our society. On the one hand, it has launched a campaign to show us that science is important, yet it has also tried to manoeuvre scientists into rubber-stamping political decisions, and has got rid of them if they won’t – as we saw with the very public dismissal of its chief drug adviser, David Nutt. And of course, there has been the recent announcement of cuts in higher education. In the run-up to the election, it will be interesting to see what the various parties promise us when it comes to science funding and education. And I’ll make up my mind about whether it’s been a golden age for science in a few years’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve argued previously about the role of parochialism in punishment and in theories about the evolution of war and cooperation, today, though, the theme is the extent to which more cosmopolitan countries tend to foster individuals who are more willing to cooperate globally.  Sounds intuitive, but how does it work experimentally?Consider a prisoner&amp;#39;s dilemma in the form of a multi-layer public goods game (PGG).  A basic PGG works as follows: each player is given some money to contribute to a communal pot, that amount is multiplied by some factor (rate of return), but everyone gets a share of the total minus what they initially contributed. Therefore, I do my &amp;#39;best&amp;#39; if everyone cooperates fully and contributes all their money, while I free ride and contribute nothing.  It&amp;#39;s a prisoner&amp;#39;s dilemma in action - everyone sees this and they shouldn&amp;#39;t cooperate.  Consider a similar game, but with two communal pots: one &amp;#39;local&amp;#39; where only people from my area can contribute to, the amount of which is then doubled and of which I receive 1/4 (3 other people in my group can contribute to it), and one &amp;#39;global&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;world&amp;#39; account that I and others can contribute to, the total amount of which is tripled, and of which I receive 1/12 (11 other people can contribute to it) .  The tension is the following: the direct return is 0.5 from the local account and 0.25 from the world account.  But if everyone contributes a maximal amount to the world account, then we all make off with the most money rather than if we had all defected and not made any contributions. This is also a prisoner&amp;#39;s dilemma, but with more layers of complexity.Buchan et al ran this experiment in 6 countries: the US, Italy, Russia, Argentina, South Africa and Iran, looking specifically at large cities in each of the countries.  They made two hypotheses.  First, globalization could lead to greater parochialism by emphasizing ethnic, local or national groupings. Conversely, globalization could have a palliative effect on parochialism and perhaps enable and sustain greater tolerance. They indexed a country level globalization index (CGI), an index produced by the University of Warwick. They also constructed an individual level globalization index (IGI) based on questions that each subject answered.  The authors used quota sampling methods for gender, age and socioeconomic status (though not for rural-urban, which I comment on later).Now we come to the reason I&amp;#39;m interested in the research.  When the authors ran the experiments, they showed that South Africans ranked 5th out of the 6 countries in the CGI: above Iran, but below Argentina.  Considering the experimental results, South Africa also ranked 4th or 5th below Italy, Russia and the United States, but almost exactly equal to Argentina in terms of probability of allocating resources to a global account.  Iran came in lowest .  Globalization at the individual and country seemed a good predictor of international cooperation. If you&amp;#39;re sceptical of the globalization result, the authors also point out that:&amp;quot;analysis of the CGI along with a host of macroindicators such as the rule of law, generalized trust, per capita income, and norms of civic cooperation shows that the CGI is the only macrovariable that is significantly correlated with mean cooperation rates at the world level.&amp;quot; (4140)So, it seems as though the second hypothesis is supported by the authors results: globalization may make people less parochial and more cosmopolitan.  But one problem emerges, as the authors chose to do the experiments in large cities, it is possible that they have a biased sample. There may be an underlying correlation between a person&amp;#39;s choice to live in a big city and a person&amp;#39;s cosmopolitanness - more cosmopolitan people may choose to live in big cities, less cosmopolitan people may choose to live outside of cities. Consequently, in the paper we may be observing an upper bound on a nation&amp;#39;s tendency to cooperativeness because the subjects are drawn from inherently more cosmopolitan (and maybe more internationally cooperative) people.  I&amp;#39;d like to see this research replicated with rural and urban samples to see what the differences might be.  I&amp;#39;d suspect that rural individuals would be more likely to cooperate locally, whereas urban individuals would be more likely to cooperate globally.  Thus, globalization might predict urban &amp;#39;world&amp;#39; cooperation, but not rural as there might be differences across countries over rural behaviour.  Apart from potential rural-urban differences that might exist among countries, I could not fault the experiment&amp;#39;s design.  Moreover, the fascinating research exemplified by this paper tends to make me slightly more optimistic about multilateralism and the benefits of globalization in the 21st century, though that could just be confirmation bias.ReferencesBuchan, N., Grimalda, G., Wilson, R., Brewer, M., Fatas, E., &amp;amp; Foddy, M.

Shu Li and colleagues dubbed this the &amp;#39;Psychological Typhoon Eye&amp;#39; in a paper published last year and now they&amp;#39;ve reported follow-up investigations that suggest the effect was still in evidence a year after the disaster.The 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake registered 8 on the Richter scale and killed over 68,000 people. More than four million people were also injured. In their initial paper, Shu Li&amp;#39;s team observed that survivors living in the most devastated regions were the least concerned, as measured by their estimates for: how many relief workers were needed, the likelihood of a epidemic outbreak, the need to take safety measures against aftershocks, and the level of dose needed if a fictitious psychological medication were made available for an earthquake victim.The new study of over 5000 residents finds that this association held after four and eleven months and it also replicates the finding when using a &amp;#39;relational distance&amp;#39; measure of involvement in the quake. That is, people who reported having closer rather than more distant relations who&amp;#39;d been affected by the quake tended to report less ongoing concern with the threat. One of the explanations for the Psychological Typhoon Eye mooted in Li&amp;#39;s 2009 paper was psychological immunity - the idea being that exposure to danger builds psychological resilience. However, the new study undermined this explanation - people living in the most devastated regions still showed the same level of Psychological Typhoon Eye regardless of whether they themselves had suffered physical or economic harm from the quake.  Another possible explanation is cognitive dissonance. The idea here is that continuing to live in a dangerous area is psychological uncomfortable - to justify this decision people have to downplay the risks in their own mind. Li&amp;#39;s team said more research was needed to test this explanation.These studies are not the first to find paradoxical psychological responses to danger. Research published in the 1970s found that people living nearer to French nuclear power stations perceived the risk to be lower than people living further away._________________________________Li, S., Rao, L., Bai, X., Zheng, R., Ren, X., Li, J., Wang, Z., Liu, H., &amp;amp; Zhang, K.

What follows is from the &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/07/06/homeopathy-recognised-as-bs-as-early-as-1851/"&gt;Australian Skeptic's site from 2009:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter published in the London journal of Medicine on July 29 th, 1851 from a Dr John McCormack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was entitled “OUR RELATIONS WITH HOMEOPATHY”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and was in response to speeches previously published regarding &lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“..prevailing professional laxity and charlatanry, in connection with the homeopathic quackery”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr McCormack had some pretty scathing things to say about homeopathy and its use by&lt;em&gt; “…shallow men and women…able to lure lucre by every imaginable wile from the sick and the silly”.....&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the article (remember, this is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1851&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) McCormack suggested some how actual doctors  should respond to homeopaths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;“1. That it is the opinion of this (Provincial) Association, that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;homoeopathy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;as propounded by Hahnemann, and practised by his followers, is so&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;utterly opposed to science and common sense&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;as well as so completely at variance with the experience of the Medical Profession, that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it ought to be in no way or degree practised&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;or countenanced &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by any regularly educated medical practitioner&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The widely discredited study is blamed for starting not only a contentious debate about whether to vaccinate children, but for a rise in measles among children whose parents were scared away from the MMR shot. Officially referred to as "Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children," the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; study became shorthand for the suspected link between childhood vaccinations and autism spectrum disorders that affect development and communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://press.thelancet.com/wakefieldretraction.pdf"&gt;terse statement&lt;/a&gt; released today, the editors of the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; write, "The claims in the original paper ... have been proven to be false. Therefore we fully retract this paper from the published record."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only surprise is how long the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; waited to denounce the study. Editors had previously said that they never should have published it after ten of the study's 13 co-authors &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35197332/ns/health-mental_health/"&gt;renounced it&lt;/a&gt;. The study was primarily authored by British doctor Andrew Wakefield, who is now based in the U.S and stands by his research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Britain's General Medical Council ruled that Wakefield showed a "callous disregard" for children and brought the medical profession "into disrepute" by promulgating his theory of a link between vaccines and autism.

&lt;p&gt;The sense of betrayal is both real and entirely understandable.  After all, Obama was different.  Hillary Clinton and John Edwards told stories about people who had been left exposed and left behind by our broken health care system, too, as do most Democrats running for office.  But when Obama told the stories, they were of his family.  He talked about his mother, spending the last few months of her too-short lives fighting cancer and insurance companies, who wanted to claim the cancer was a pre-existing condition.  And &lt;a href="http://bulletin.aarp.org/opinions/fromtheeditor/articles/lessons_from_home.html"&gt;he talked about his grandmother&lt;/a&gt;, Mrs. Madelyn Dunham, who died shortly before he was elected president:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;What I’ve learned from watching my grandmother is that with some modest help she’s able to remain independent.  And that costs the system much less than if she’d gone into a long-term care facility. The problem we have is that so much of our system is built around institutional care that we end up spending more money than we need to and probably with worse outcomes in a lot of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;These are not abstractions for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but when Obama did the “Walk a Day in My Shoes” program through SEIU*, he walked through the daily routine of Pauline Beck, a home health care worker in Oakland, CA.  In what he often referred to as “one of the best days I've had on the campaign so far,” he lived the life of a home health worker and saw first-hand how much better off Mr. Thornton, the 87 year-old triple amputee, was being cared for in his own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/miUS7WnMgBw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After telling the story of his grandmother and his “Walk a Day” experience from sea to shining sea, there was ample reason to believe that Obama was truly a different politician, that he felt the issue in his bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, there’s no doubt our current national long term strategy is based on inertia rather than common sense.  For Medicare and especially Medicaid, long-term care too often translates to care in an institution – a nursing home, or a hospital.  This may have made sense 40 years ago when the programs were first introduced, but we have different choices now, both for the elderly and the disabled.  Yet &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=12&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fassets.aarp.org%2Frgcenter%2Fil%2Finb161_ltc.pdf&amp;amp;ei=H7f3SdLsJaKstgexhY27Dw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEH44jtIxHG8j5nLwDiMWGy1-CyCg"&gt;according to the AARP&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 75% of long-term care allocation in 2006 were for institutional care – even for those who don’t need full instutionalization.  A friend of mine who only recently went on Medicare found this out the hard way.  She had complications from surgery and developed a staph infection.  After a too-long hospital stay just to be stabilized, Medicare would not pay for a home health worker to visit her once a day with the appropriate medication, but would pay for her to be institutionalized in a nursing home for two weeks during convalescence.  In terms of cost, it's absolutely no comparison -- she only needed the first, which was the cheaper option, but was forced into the most expensive option because Medicare wouldn't pay for her care otherwise.  It’s a vivid confirmation of AARP’s other stat:  “On average, Medicaid dollars can support nearly three older people and adults with physical disabilities in home and community-based services (HCBS) for every person in a nursing home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s bizarre and wasteful enough when we’re talking about seniors, but what about the disabled?  Why should you live your life in an institution because you have autism?  Or multiple sclerosis?  Or some other disability that renders you somewhat dependent on others, but otherwise wouldn’t prevent you from living your life at home and with the freedom that the rest of us take for granted?  It seems simple fairness to offer people a choice where there is legitimately no medical basis for institutionalization over home care.  Given that it also saves money in the system, it actually seems like a no-brainer.  It's what health care reform should be about -- greatly reducing costs and improving quality for those who need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama has talked the talk – but there’s only one way to get him to walk the walk for sure.  &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/community_choice_act_in_health_care_reform"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write to your representatives and demand that Congress pass and the president sign the Community Choice Act.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the numbers from The &lt;em&gt;NY Post&lt;/em&gt;’s article “&lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/04202009/news/regionalnews/inure_poorhouse_165236.htm"&gt;In$sure Poorhouse&lt;/a&gt;” on the cost increases for health insurance, they seem to be from a world gone mad. $4,354 for an average family plan, easily trumping the rental price of even an incredibly nice doorman building in my neighborhood!  It’s too horrific to believe!  Wait, no, it actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; too horrific to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, New York.  You got punk'd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, we know that the average plan for a family of four is about $12,000 nationally.  That’s exorbitant, but you’d have to go to the outer boroughs or perhaps have a bunch of roommates for your rent not to exceed a $1,000/month premium.  I would expect NYC to have more expensive insurance than the national average, certainly, but nearly 4x as much?  It’s hard to see that being justified even if New York is one of the six states that has guaranteed issue – a law preventing exclusion on the basis of pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key phrase in the article is “a &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; analysis of new data” – suddenly sounds a little less than authoritative, doesn't it?  Sure enough, the number quoted is the one that sounds the worst – the premium for “out of network” service, meaning the insurance company is selling you a plan that covers you even when you don’t use their doctors.  But that’s generally not a good figure to base your average off of.  It’s a less-often purchased plan precisely because of its cost, and because it's a somewhat dumb consumer choice.  You’re not using the network offered by your plan effectively.  The much more common cost is in-network, where the numbers are a more modest $2,966/month.   Indeed, when I hopped on einsurance.com for some field research, I was able to find a family-of-four plan where no one smoked and no one was a full-time college student for $2,266.70 with Atlantis and $3,223.34 with Empire.  Here’s the other kicker, of course:  these rates are all on the individual market, the most expensive place to buy insurance because you’re not the beneficiary of the better rates that come with group purchasing.  The cost for small business and particularly companies with a lot of employees is much less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the numbers have been tilted to give the blackest possible eye.  Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there are a lot of bugaboos and villains in this news story and, not surprisingly given it’s coming from the &lt;em&gt;NY Post&lt;/em&gt;, they tend to reinforce the notions of a health care system being gained by lack of personal responsibility and government interference.  First off, it’s all those darn people who are becoming uninsured!  Double-digit increases in rates for premiums are because “tens of thousands of healthy New Yorkers opt to drop coverage and leave insurers with an ever-sicker, costlier client pool.”  This is the favorite canard of business alliances and chambers of commerce – that all these young people are dropping their insurance, leaving the poor private insurance industry to have an older, sicker clientele.  No doubt, private insurance has dropped -- “&lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/148/1/55"&gt;from 63.6% in 2000 to 59.7% in 2006&lt;/a&gt;” according to the American College of Physicians -- but the number one culprit is businesses cutting costs by cutting benefits or eliminating them altogether, including &lt;a href="http://healthcare.change.org/blog/view/the_merry-go-round_of_escalating_costs"&gt;an expected 4% of employers this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, this villain is a manifestation of the logic whereby if you lose your job and your coverage, or if your employer doesn’t offer you benefits, you’ve somehow done something willfully selfish and wrong, and need an individual mandate to force you to buy the insurance you can't afford.  Funny, it was my understanding that the uninsured were, on average, less healthy than those with access to primary and preventative care, but whatever folks, don’t let the facts screw up a perfectly good story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second bugaboo are the recent tax increases on insurance plans in the state budget, which will of course immediately cause the insurers to “pass along more than $853 million in insurance-related taxes included in the state budget” to customers.  Stick a pin in this one – we’ll come back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third bugaboo is of course state mandates.  New York &lt;a href="http://www.cahi.org/cahi_contents/resources/pdf/HealthInsuranceMandates2008.pdf."&gt;mandates certain treatments must be covered&lt;/a&gt; by all “standard plans.”  So try as they might, insurance companies can’t deny you treatments for autism, blood products, hospice care, chemotherapy, occupational therapists or rehabilitation therapy, to name a handful that are shared by fewer than 75% of states.   New York doesn’t have any state mandate that’s unique, and only three (psychotropic drugs, ambulatory cancer treatment and hormone replacement therapy) that are shared by fewer than 5 states.  Nevertheless, we’re often told about how state mandates jack up the price.  Sure enough, there’s a big graph in the NY Post showing that on the individual market, Aetna’s premiums have jumped +27%, GMI HMO Select jumped a preposterous +35%, while Oxford (+8%), Atlantis (+10%) and Empire (-6%) stand out as the few relatively sane increases.  We’re left to presume that this is entirely because of insurance companies being forced to cover chemotherapy, pay new taxes, and deal with the effects of too many employees losing cov… ahem, I mean, “willfully declining insurance (and/or employment).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s one theory, certainly.  But note that the increases in premiums in New York actually &lt;em&gt;aren’t that much different&lt;/em&gt; from the rest of the country, even with more mandates. “From 2000 to 2005, premiums for family coverage &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/148/1/55"&gt;increased by 73%&lt;/a&gt; [or 14.6% per year], compared with inflation growth of 14% and wage growth of 15%,” again from the ACP.  Take out Aetna and GMI’s numbers and the rest of the field of insurers in New York are, gosh, average.  Here’s another intriguing piece of the puzzle.  Remember how the insurance companies were going to, out of financial necessity, pass on their new tax costs to their customers?  Not so much with the financial necessity.  The Northwest Federation of Community Organizers released a report this summer with &lt;a href="http://www.nwfco.org/pubs/2008.0727_insuring.health.or.ensuring.profit.pdf"&gt;a state-by-state breakdown of annual profits&lt;/a&gt; for private insurance.  For New York, they only cite Oxford and Empire.  Having read this far, you won’t be surprised to learn that from 2004-2007 annual profits for Oxford rose 36.2%, and Empire’s profits rose a stunning 71.6%.  So yes, any cost differential gets passed along to the customers – and I won’t be surprised if it got passed on in an exaggerated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal health care bill – either HR 676 or the one envisioned by the president – would define a standard set of benefits that would make state mandates moot, ensure guaranteed issue is the law of the land, prevent people from losing insurance because their business cut benefits or their job, and would reign in the obscene profits made by the insurance industry.  But it won’t do anything about the &lt;em&gt;NY Post&lt;/em&gt;’s exaggerations in service to political ideology.  Those are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this guarantees the funding - we'll get a crocodile roll deathmatch with Congress before this translates into real programs - but it's a vivid portrait of the Administration's values. Here's what jumped out at me.  You can download your own copy of &lt;a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy10/pdf/fy10-newera.pdf"&gt;the FY2010 Budget&lt;/a&gt; and follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Expands research comparing the effectiveness of medical treatments to give patients and physicians better information on what works best."&lt;/strong&gt; At this sentence, hordes of pharmaceutical and medical device lobbyists began sharpening their pencils.  Somewhere, far off in the night, &lt;a href="http://healthcare.change.org/blog/view/betsy_mccaugheys_scary_stories_about_health_care_what_needs_to_be_done"&gt;Betsy McCaughey&lt;/a&gt; dreams of a reinvigorated political career or at least a book deal.  But it cannot be stressed enough how essential this is in improving quality and lowering costs.  As &lt;a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2009/01/atul-gawande-talks-about-measurement-accountability-and-the-va.html"&gt;Atul Gawande&lt;/a&gt; points out, "In 1996, Americans underwent some 60 million surgeries. In 2008, that number rose to 100 million. Does that mean that Americans are healthier?  No one knows because we never measure how well our healthcare system is performing."  This will be a fight, for certain but a fight worth having -- and winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Invests over $6 billion for cancer research at the National Institutes of Health."&lt;/strong&gt; Combine this with the $10 billion in the stimulus (which, credit it where it's due, Sen. Arlen Specter went to the mattresses for) and you have an unprecedented boost to cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millions more for HIV/AIDS prevention and support for individuals, families and communities dealing with Autism.&lt;/strong&gt; Given the almost criminally poor funding, these are two long-overdue budget priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Invests $330 million to increase the number of doctors, nurses, and dentists practicing in areas of the country experiencing shortages of health professionals."&lt;/strong&gt; As anyone who's observed Massachusetts in the wake of their universal health care legislation knows, extending coverage to the uninsured exposes weaknesses in your delivery system very quickly, particularly if you don't have enough doctors and nurses.  Typically, the bulk of investments in the physician shortage focus on rural areas.  Certainly the need there is great, but dealing with a rural shortage is insufficient - there's a looming crisis in the ever-shrinking number of primary care physicians compared to specialists.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ear-marked money specifically for primary care providers in rural areas, but the budget leaves it vague.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Health IT, especially Electronic Health Records.&lt;/strong&gt; The $19 billion in the Recovery Act was just the beginning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Medicare, Medicare, Medicare.&lt;/strong&gt; The budget gives only a glimpse of the reforms in store for Medicare - and each one of them will be a fight in and of itself.  For starters, the funding for the health care reserve fund comes in part from no longer paying &lt;a href="http://healthcare.change.org/blog/view/its_time_to_end_medicare_no_advantage"&gt;the private insurance companies who sell Medicare Advantage plans&lt;/a&gt; 12% more to give the same benefits and yield the same outcomes as traditional Medicare.  Money for the reserve fund will also come from savings to Medicare Part D through finally allowing drug reimportation, increasing the use of generics, requiring more rebates for bulk purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Administration is also looking to get innovative, using the Big Dog of Medicare (and Medicaid) to try out cost-saving and quality-enhancing pilot programs.  If those reforms prove successful, the private insurance industry is sure to follow suit, particularly if they substantially reduce costs.  Check this sentence out:  "New Medicare and Medicaid demonstration and pilot projects will evaluate payment reforms, ways to provide higher quality care at lower costs, improve beneficiary education and understanding of benefits offered, and better align provider payments with costs."  Under "better align provider payments," you can bunch together experiments with coordinated care, episodes of care, increasing reimbursement for primary care, and more attempts to have compensation explicitly reflect quality, and not just fee-for-service.  And if you think that's not going to be a fight...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, although it's not in HHS, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Veterans Affairs health care system.  Most still don't realize that &lt;a href="http://healthcare.change.org/blog/view/the_va_the_greatest_story_never_told"&gt;the VA is the best health care system in the country&lt;/a&gt; - producing quality health outcomes as a greatly reduced cost, and with some innovative features the rest of our public programs desperately need.  Yet the VA often gets treated like the red-headed stepchild in the budget process.  Not anymore.  The Obama Administration intends to &lt;strong&gt;restore eligibility to 500,000 veterans&lt;/strong&gt; whose income-based eligibility was scaled back during the Bush years.    The Department of Veterans Affairs will see a &lt;strong&gt;$25 billion increase over the next five years&lt;/strong&gt;, with much of that earmarked to increasing the funding of the VA health care system dramatically, create Centers of Excellence for specialized care, and expand access to mental health care services, particularly for veterans in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was conducting my experiment to see &lt;a href="http://healthcare.change.org/blog/view/health_care_for_the_recently_unemployed_its_even_worse_than_you_think"&gt;what I could get on the individual insurance plan market&lt;/a&gt;, one selling point that most plans had in common was "No Maximum Benefit Limit."  The likeliest reaction for people reading those words is "Cool - I didn't even know I needed that, but I'm glad I have it."  After all, given the amount of money you and your employer are regularly paying to the insurance company, and the myriad ways that insurance nickels and dimes you through denying claims, requiring pre-approvals and cherry-picking customer likely not to require a lot of care in the first place, they're making money hand over fist.  If they let you into their policy, they shouldn't be able to kick you out because you need care, should they?  If they can, why is no one talking about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether they should or not, they often can.  According to a survey by Kaiser Family Foundation, &lt;a href="http://www.kff.org/insurance/7672/upload/76723.pdf"&gt;55% of employer-based insurance plans have Lifetime Maximum Benefit Limits&lt;/a&gt; of either $1-2 million or above $2 million.  That's a better than 50-50 chance that your plan does as well.  This option is becoming more widely-used as employers look for ways to trim the rising cost of health care without trimming the benefits their employees would miss - their co-pay prices, employee contributions, provider networks, etc.  Now $2 million dollars may seem like a lot, particularly if you're relatively healthy, but &lt;a href="http://www.womenstake.org/2008/07/maximum-limits.html"&gt;Brigette Courtot of the National Woman's Law Center&lt;/a&gt; shows how the sudden onset of a catastrophic trauma or chronic disease can get you close to that maximum limit in no time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;	&lt;li&gt;"Coronary Artery Disease (the leading killer of women in the U.S.): over $1 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple Sclerosis (which affects twice as many women as men): $2.2 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Single Kidney Transplant: $500,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spinal Cord Injury: between $624,000 and $2.8 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;HIV Care: $618,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Autism: over $300,000"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the way most people learn that they have such a limit tends to follow a story I received from a reader of this blog, herself a health care provider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;"In December I received a phone call from my benefit plan informing me that I am nearing my Lifetime Maximum Benefit Limit.  I was not aware that my benefits were limited to a million dollars, and once I have used that amount in medication, doctors visits and services, THAT'S IT.  I was shocked.  I asked, 'Then what do I do?'  The woman said I could apply for Medicare, but at 40 years old, I am not eligible.  I have neuromuscular disease which left me completely disabled for 4 months in 2005, and I was only able to get back to work because of expensive IVIG treatments which cost $16,000 per month.  I am only able to function, go to work, and attend to my patients because of my monthly infusions.  Now I think I will be covered for about another 6 years, but after that, what do I do?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go all Bob Dole on this, where's the outrage?  You'll notice this is prevalent in employer-based insurance, not so much in the individual market.  The why is obvious - individuals often presume that their coverage is good and that their employer has negotiated the best deal.  Individuals need to be coaxed to buy the expensive package, and are more likely to nix something that so obviously underinsures them.  Rep. Anna Eschoo has introduced &lt;a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d111:6:./temp/~bdFODW::%7C/bss/%7C"&gt;HR 1085&lt;/a&gt; to specifically address this problem, but the bill's prospects are questionable.  We need to make sure people know that this is just as important as community rating and forbidding pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, if your coverage disappears when you need it the most, how does that benefit anyone... except the insurance industry's bottom line?&lt;/p&gt;

If I was not so averse to cold, I'd think this would be the best career in science ever!

It is no surprise that their latest paper - A Circadian Clock Is Not Required in an Arctic Mammal (press release) - was widely covered by the media, both traditional and blogs, See, for example, The Scientist, BBC, Scientific American podcast and Wired Science.

Relevant, or just cool?

It is hard to find a science story that is more obviously in the "that's cool" category, as opposed to the "that's relevant" category. For the background on this debate, please read Ed Yong, David Dobbs, DeLene Beeland, Colin Schultz, and the series of  Colin's interviews with Carl Zimmer, Nicola Jones, David Dobbs, Jay Ingram, Ferris Jabr, Ed Yong and Ed Yong again.

I agree, it is a cool story. It is an attention-grabbing, nifty story about charismatic megafauna living in a strange wilderness. I first saw the work from the lab in a poster session at a conference many years ago, and of all the posters I saw that day, it is the reindeer one that I still remember after all these years.

Yet, the coolness of the story should not hide the fact that this research is also very relevant - both to the understanding of evolution and to human medicine. Let me try to explain what they did and why that is much more important than what a quick glance at the headlines may suggest. I did it only part-way a few years ago when I blogged about one of their earlier papers. But let me start with that earlier paper as background, for context.

Rhythms of Behavior

In their 2005 Nature paper (which was really just a tiny subset of a much longer, detailed paper they published elsewhere a couple of years later), Stokkan and colleagues used radiotelemetry to continuously monitor activity of reindeer - when they sleep and when they roam around foraging. 

You should remember that up in the Arctic the summer is essentially one single day that lasts several months, while the winter is a continuous night that lasts several months. During these long periods of constant illumination, reindeer did not show rhythms in activity - they moved around and rested in bouts and bursts, at almost unpredictable times of "day". Their circadian rhythms of behavior were gone. 

But, during brief periods of spring and fall, during which there are 24-hour light-dark cycles of day and night, the reindeer (on the northern end of the mainland Norway, but not the population living even further north on Svaldbard which remained arrhythmic throughout), showed daily rhythms of activity, suggesting that this species may possess a circadian clock.

Rhythms of Physiology

In a couple of studies, including the latest one, the lab also looked into a physiological rhythm - that of melatonin synthesis and secretion by the pineal gland. Just as in activity rhythms, melatonin concentrations in the blood showed a daily (24-hour) rhythm only during the brief periods of spring and fall. Furthermore, in the latest paper, they kept three reindeer indoors for a couple of days, in light-tight stalls, and exposed them to 2.5-hour-long periods of darkness during the normal light phase of the day. Each such 'dark pulse' resulted in a sharp rise of blood melatonin, followed by just as abrupt elimination of melatonin as soon as the lights went back on.

Rhythms of gene expression

Finally, in this latest paper, they also looked at the expression of two of the core clock genes in fibroblasts kept in vitro (in a dish). Fibroblasts are connective tissue cells found all around the body, probably taken out of reindeer by biopsy. In other mammals, e.g., in rodents, clock genes continue to cycle with a circadian period for a very long time in a dish. Yet, the reindeer fibroblasts, after a couple of very weak oscillations that were roughly in the circadian range, decayed into complete arrhytmicity - the cells were healthy, but their clocks were not ticking any more.

What do these results suggest?

There is something fishy about the reindeer clock. It is not working the same way it does in other mammals studied to date. For example, seals and humans living in the Arctic have normal circadian rhythms of melatonin. Some other animals show daily rhythms in behavior. But in reindeer, rhythms in behavior and melatonin can be seen only if the environment is rhythmic as well. In constant light conditions, it appears that the clock is not working. But, is it? How do we know?

During the long winter night and the long summer day, the behavior of reindeer is not completely random. It is in bouts which show some regularity - these are ultradian rhythms with the period much shorter than 24 hours. If the clock is not working in reindeer, i.e., if there is no clock in this species, then the ultradian rhythms would persist during spring and fall as well. Yet we see circadian rhythms during these seasons - there is an underlying clock there which can be entrained to a 24-hour light-dark cycle.

This argues for the notion that the deer's circadian clock, unless forced into synchrony by a 24 external cycle, undergoes something called frequency demultiplication. The idea is that the underlying cellular clock runs with a 24-hour period but that is sends signals downstream of the clock, triggering phenotypic (observable) events, several times during each cycle. The events happen always at the same phases of the cycle, and are usually happening every 12 or 8 or 6 or 4 or 3 or 2 or 1 hours - the divisors of 24. Likewise, the clock can trigger the event only every other cycle, resulting in a 48-hour period of the observable behavior.

If we forget for a moment the metaphor of the clock and think instead of a Player Piano, it is like the contraption plays the note G several times per cycle, always at the same moments during each cycle, but there is no need to limit each note to appear only once per...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Go check out the rest of the excellent material at both sites.A recent study looks at The association between emergency medical services staffing patterns (the number of paramedics dispatched on an ambulance) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival. They make some interesting observations.We tested the hypothesis that two or more paramedics at the scene of OHCA would be correlated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge.[1] Since there were at least 2 paramedics on scene, they really compared the presence of 2 medics with the presence of 3 medics and with the presence of more than 3 medics. OHCA is Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest. Paramedic treatment of cardiac arrest is provided by protocol and direct medical oversight.[1]An interesting interpretation of the word direct. A medical command physician is available by phone or radio for consultation/orders. This is historically the way direct medical oversight has been interpreted, but it requires some flexibility in the interpretation of the meaning of direct. The word oversight requires similar flexibility, since the physician depends entirely on what the medic says, except for the medical command physicians who perversely just say no to everything.Cardiac arrests resulting from a drug overdose, suicide, drowning, hypoxia,  exsanguination, stroke, or trauma were excluded from the study. Also excluded were cases in which no crew configuration or responding unit information was available, cases in which no resuscitation effort was attempted, and cases in which no time data were available.[1] It is reasonable to exclude some of these causes, since they are not standard medical cardiac arrests and do not contribute significantly to resuscitation statistics. The intent of the study seems to be the effect of the number of medics on standard cardiac arrest. Trauma is reasonable to exclude, since resuscitation from traumatic arrest is, for all practical purposes, zero percent. Movies and TV suggest otherwise, but there is nothing about chest compressions that reverses blood loss, TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury), pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, or other traumatic causes of sudden death. On the other hand, there are some causes of cardiac arrest that do respond to chest compressions, such as commotio cordis[2], [3] or lightning strike,[4] that might appear to fall into the trauma category. Cardiac arrest due to stroke may have resuscitation outcomes as dismal as trauma.Why exclude cardiac arrest due to hypoxia? Are they looking only at airway obstruction as a cause of hypoxia? Does this include anaphylaxis or asthma? What about CHF (Congestive Heart Failure), which could be categorized as hypoxic or as cardiac? These are questions that were not addressed. There is no explanation for any of these exclusions anywhere in the paper. Are these excluded because the authors consider resuscitation to be so unlikely that they would only contribute a more zeros to the data?If a paramedic responded as part of the ﬁrst response unit’s crew, the paramedic was not counted as being part of the crew conﬁguration. The independent variable was categorized solely on the number of paramedics present in the responding ALS unit crew. Milwaukee County EMS operates with a minimum of two paramedics on ALS ambulances. During the study period, there were no cases treated by one paramedic.[1]In other words, although we are looking at whether more medics lead to better outcomes, we will set aside cases where the medics are first responders, unless those first responders are responding on an ambulance. Interesting, but it is difficult to tell if this would have any influence, since no numbers are reported. If medic first responders are rare, it probably will not have any effect on outcomes. Not having data, we do not know if it is rare. If medic first responders are common, this should not be ignored as a variable.It might be nice to evaluate the effect of paramedic first responders. Even though there does not appear to be any benefit from having paramedics treating cardiac arrests, as first responders or otherwise, some systems are adopting the practice of having every responder be a paramedic. These systems seem to  encourage the belief that, even though paramedic treatments do not improve outcomes, the sight a lot of paramedics on scene is more important than anything that might actually improve outcomes. There is no need to address things that matter, when we can put on an impressive show, unless survival is important.Neurologic status at discharge was not available.[1]Too bad. That could be useful information to have.There were sufficient data to analyze 10,057 (98%)cases.[1]That is very good.FIGURE 2. Frequencies of cardiac arrest outcome by year in Milwaukee County.ROSC = Return Of Spontaneous Circulation.I added the red circles and green squares to make it easier to identify the lines. Nothing else was changed about this chart.The most interesting thing that I notice is that increases in one of the surrogate end points (ROSC) seems to indicate drops in the end point that matters - survival to discharge. While they did not have access to the neurological status at discharge, this information seems to contradict what everyone claims is important about resuscitation - If we don&amp;#39;t have ROSC, we cannot improve survival to discharge. In the above chart, as ROSC increases, survival to discharge decreases. Is this statistically significant? I don&amp;#39;t know, but it appears to be pretty consistent. The numbers are not provided by years, but the trend can be determined from the chart. Below, I list the the changes from year to year in ROSC (Return Of Spontaneous Circulation) and in  Survival (survival to discharge from the hospital). ⇓ = year to year decrease. ⇑ = increase. ⇔ = no change.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a history of breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in the risk of acute otitis media, non-specific gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma (young children), obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, childhood leukemia, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and necrotizing enterocolitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;no relationship between breastfeeding in term infants and cognitive performance. The relationship between breastfeeding and cardiovascular diseases was unclear. Similarly, &lt;strong&gt;it was also unclear concerning the relationship between breastfeeding and infant mortality in developed countries&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how could they take a study that showed no clear relationship with mortality and re-interpret it to predict that 900 lives a year could be saved? They used statistical skullduggery. They went to other statistical sources to find the rates of breastfeeding and the overall death rates from diseases like asthma. Then they used their imagination to estimate how many of these deaths involved non-breastfed children. Then they combined those estimated death rates together with the odds ratios from the AHRQ study to do their calculations. That’s not kosher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other factors to consider. One of the reported adverse effects, necrotizing enterocolitis, is largely a disease of newborns who are premature and have low birth weights. Some of the diseases are treatable and not usually serious, like otitis media. And the risk of otitis in bottle fed babies can be decreased by not letting the child hold the bottle or take it to bed. For some conditions like atopic dermatitis, the risk depends on the family history: in &lt;a href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/160/3/217"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;  there was an increased risk of atopic dermatitis with breastfeeding when parents had no history of allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to read all the caveats in the text of the AHRQ report, especially about the dangers of relying on systematic reviews and meta-analyses when the individual studies those reviews are based on may be flawed. 80% of the studies included in their analysis were surveyed only via these secondary sources. There are individual studies that contradict their findings for most of the conditions they studied. The report’s conclusion cautioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A history of breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of many diseases in infants and mothers from developed countries. Because almost all the data in this review were gathered from observational studies,&lt;strong&gt; one should not infer causality based on these findings.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, there is a wide range of quality of the body of evidence across different health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not exactly a ringing endorsement of reliable data to base a cost assessment on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the commenters on the news story said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no reason for a healthy well-fed mother not to breast feed her baby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I beg to differ. There are a lot of healthy well-fed mothers who have found what they think are valid reasons not to breastfeed. I chose not to breastfeed my babies because it was inconvenient, time-consuming, interfered with my sleep, and was incompatible with my job as a doctor working 24 hour shifts in the emergency room and as a flight surgeon on call. I suppose I could have pumped milk and planned ahead and found a way to do it, but it would have required heroic measures. I can imagine leaking breast milk all over my flight suit when I was on an emergency helicopter mission and simply couldn’t stop to pump. Moreover, I tried breastfeeding briefly with my first baby and frankly, I didn’t like it. All in all, I thought my babies were better off with a happy mother and a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new study confirms what we already knew: that breastfeeding is better for a baby than bottle-feeding. The question is how much better, and this study really can’t answer that question. It consists of estimates based on estimates based on mixed data of varying quality. Considering the quality of the data and the pitfalls of epidemiological studies, it is likely that this new study overestimates the value of breastfeeding and the number of preventable deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we could accurately calculate the numbers needed to treat (NNT) with breastfeeding to save one baby’s life or prevent one ear infection, they would be very high numbers. Mothers should be given those numbers; but they should also understand that if they bottle-feed, the odds are good that their child will thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breastfeeding is clearly better for babies, and I strongly support it, but I think the facts leave us room to support those women who make an informed choice not to breastfeed. Some women can’t produce enough milk or have health problems that interfere with breastfeeding. Some women know the benefits of breastfeeding but choose not to do it. We may not agree with their choice, but we can respect their autonomy. Thank goodness we now have safe, nutritious infant formulas that give us a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

Now that Jim Carrey has broken up with &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, he’s being erased just like Desiree Jennings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Friday, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.generationrescue.org/"&gt;Generation  Rescue&lt;/a&gt; had completely &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/04/what-changes-are-in-store-for-generation-rescue"&gt;revamped  its website&lt;/a&gt;.  Gone is the picture of Jim Carrey, Jenny McCarthy, and Evan from the  front page of the website. Gone is any mention of his name, leaving  Generation Rescue as now being just “Jenny McCarthy’s Autism  Organization – Generation Rescue.” Gone is Jim Carrey from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.generationrescue.org/about/leadership"&gt;Generation  Rescue Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;. Given the slickness of hte new look, no  doubt that this revamp of the website has been a long time in coming,  and probably GR simply moved up its originally planned revamp in order  to deal with Jim and Jenny’s breakup. More interestingly, all mention of  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/desiree_jennings_cured.php"&gt;Desiree  Jennings&lt;/a&gt; appears to have been send down the memory hole. In case  you don’t remember who she is, she is the young woman who claimed that a  flu vaccine caused her to develop dystonia, a claim riddled with  inconsistencies that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/dystonia_from_a_flu_vaccine.php"&gt;didn’t  stand up to even mild scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This again raises the issue of whether or not Jim Carrey is still an anti-vaxxer at all? Did he come to his senses and opt to cut all ties with &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; just like the co-founder of her now doomed school?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://image3.examiner.com/images/blog/wysiwyg/image/Dr_Oz(1).jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://image3.examiner.com/images/blog/wysiwyg/image/Dr_Oz(1).jpg" alt="" width="119" height="174"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/ct-met-dr-oz-20100408,0,3288031.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune questions the authority of the great and power Dr. Oz &lt;/a&gt;- Their conclusion seems to match that of the medical consensus, pay no attention to man on the screen inexplicably wearing surgical scrubs. And they also talk about Joseph Mercola, the most dangerous cola of them all.&lt;/p&gt;

That enemy, it turns out, is themselves. Instead of learning from the sex scandals of those who have come before and dropping below the radar, the Church has decided to go another way, digging themselves deeper and deeper every single day with a brand new excuse and scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a leading Catholic exorcist used the ever popular &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/chief-exorcist-rev-gabriele-amorth-devil-vatican/story?id=10073040"&gt;“devil made them do it” &lt;/a&gt;defense. Then the Church and leading Catholic figures started responding by playing down the significance of their crimes with the always popular &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/03/12/another-catholic-downplays-child-rape/"&gt;“everyone else is doing” defense&lt;/a&gt;. Then came the even more popular &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/bill-donohue-blames-parents-for-churchs-child-sex-abuse/"&gt;“blame the parents” defense&lt;/a&gt;. Then came the “blame the gays” defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Church turned its focus away from excusing their crimes to &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100331/ap_on_re_eu/eu_the_vatican_s_defense"&gt;announcing reasons why the Pope should be immune from prosecution&lt;/a&gt;. The first is that the Pope, as head of state, is immune from prosecution  (aka Joey Ratz does whatever Joey Ratz wants and if you get in the way,  he’ll whack you or have your children horribly raped). The second  excuse is that the American priests were not Vatican employees  (This  should go over really well with the American Catholics). And the third  excuse is that they’ve declared by fiat that the smoking gun evidence  that has been confirmed by high ranking church officials is really not  smoking gun evidence at all (I call this the Jedi Mind Trick defense –  these aren’t the droids you’re looking for. Now move along).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then another leading Catholic exorcist led the offensive against the media for having the audacity to report the undeniable facts about the greatest sex scandal in human history by using the &lt;a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/satan_behind_media_attacks_on_the_pope_asserts_italian_exorcist/"&gt;“devil is making the media do it” defense&lt;/a&gt;. Bill Donohue just accused the New York Times of being biased against Catholicism. Then more Church leaders ran with the media accusations approach and &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/04/03/vatican-now-pisses-off-the-jews/"&gt;declared the media were akin to anti-Semites&lt;/a&gt;, which was particularly amusing given the Catholic Church’s long history of promoting anti-Semitism. This was obviously a smart move because when you’re in such hot water already, why not piss off the Jews too while you’re at it? Of cource El Papa himself wasn’t going to restrict his grand media conspiracy theories to any one group. No, the Pope went for a more generic &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2250557/"&gt;“they’re all out to get us” defense&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am personally convinced that the constant presence in the press of the  sins of Catholic priests, especially in the United States, is a planned  campaign … to discredit the church.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then as they continued to deny the smoking gun evidence of the Pope’s and the Church’s involvement in these crimes, &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/more-smoking-gun-evidence-that-pope-hid-pedophile-priests/"&gt;even more smoking gun evidence surfaced that directly implicated the Pope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in the last few days, it got REALLY interesting. In addition to&lt;a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/04/12/popes-number-two-claims-sexual-abuse-scandals-due-to-homosexuality-not-celibacy/"&gt; continuing to use the “blame the gays” defense&lt;/a&gt;, they &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/04/11/connecticut.abuse.bill/index.html?hpt=T1"&gt;decided to condemn a Connecticut bill that would remove the statute of limitations on child sexual abuse cases&lt;/a&gt; for some unknown reasons because the Catholic Church has been denying guilt for child abuse cases and, if you remember, &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100331/ap_on_re_eu/eu_the_vatican_s_defense"&gt;specifically distanced themselves from American Catholic officials&lt;/a&gt;. That was the same day a Bishop used the super popular &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/11/catholic-bishop-blames-jews"&gt;“blame the Jews” defense&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A website quoted Giacomo Babini, the emeritus bishop of Grosseto, as  saying he believed a “Zionist attack” was behind the criticism,  considering how “powerful and refined” the criticism is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  comments, which have been denied by the bishop, follow a series of  statements from Catholic churchmen alleging the existence of plots to  weaken the church and &lt;a title="More  from guardian.co.uk on Pope Benedict XVI" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pope-benedict-xvi"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegedly  speaking to the Catholic website &lt;a title="Pontifex" href="http://www.pontifex.roma.it/"&gt;Pontifex&lt;/a&gt;, Babini, 81, was quoted as saying: “They  do not want the church, they are its natural enemies. Deep down,  historically speaking, the Jews are God killers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, how adorable that last statement would have been had it not been used the greatest fascist dictator in history to justify the systematic extermination of six million Jews in the greatest act of genocide ever recorded…and you know, it didn’t directly contradict the Catholic Church’s official position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its website, the American Jewish Group Committee quoted bishop  Vincenzo Paglia, an official at the Italian Bishops’ Conference, as  saying Babini’s remarks were “entirely contrary to the official line and  mainstream thought of the Catholic church”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever is doing their PR is doing a spectacular job of making things worse. I couldn’t make the Church look any worse if you paid me millions of dollars to do so. By tomorrow they’ll probably be blaming black people and the decline of slavery for their inability to restrain themselves from raping children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not? They’ve got nothing to lose as those responsible for these crimes and for the crimes of covering it up and allowing it to continue will NEVER EVER BE PUNISHED FOR THEIR ACTIONS. Even the most outraged media personalities won’t go any further than insisting that the Pope resign…cause after all, that’s the strictest punishment we have for aiding child rapists, right? And if the Pope resigns, the Catholic Church will never ever rape any other children or cover up the rapes of children ever again, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these people will be appropriate punished because they work for the Catholic Church. Bill Maher said it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right. The Pope is coming to America this week, and, ladies, he’s  single! Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Bill, you can’t be saying  that the Catholic Church is no better than this creepy Texas cult! For  one thing, altar boys can’t even get pregnant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, really, what tripped up the “little cult on the prairie” was  that they only abused hundreds of kids, not thousands all over the  world. Cults get raided. Religions get parades. How does the Catholic  Church get away with all of their buggery? VOLUME, VOLUME, VOLUME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a few hundred followers and you let some of them molest  children, they call you a cult leader. If you have a billion, they call  you “Pope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like if you can’t pay your mortgage, you’re a deadbeat, but if  you can’t pay a million mortgages, you’re Bear Stearns, and we bail you  out. And that’s who the Catholic Church is, the Bear Stearns of  organized pedophilia. Too big to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church is just “too big to fail” or too big and influential for authorities to stand up to them. What politician would demand these monsters be prosecuted under the law? So they’re going to get away with it and we should either stop kidding ourselves into thinking otherwise or prepare to take extreme action to force politicians into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very old friend of mine came into town over the Easter weekend. I went to elementary school with Jolene, and much later she was an apprentice shepherd on my crew. After a few seasons she became a Project Manager with a crew and flock of her own. My wife was a shepherd on Joe’s crew, as was our current upstairs neighbor Julie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only see Joe once a year or so now, so it’s always a bit of an occasion. We cracked a few beers that evening and it soon became a sheep camp reunion. And, that brought us to a small moment of skeptical reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to ramble through sheep camp on my way there, though. You can skip to the end if you’re impatient. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other such small groups united by a hard-to-describe common experience, shepherds love to get together and tell old war stories. “Remember the time you charged those grizzly bears?” “Remember when whatsername took three hours to fail to make fire?” You know how it goes. Sheep herding was an odd sort of life: lonely yet close; boring yet stressful; peaceful yet dangerous. It sounds sort of dreamy and pastoral (and it could feel that way occasionally) but herding 1500 sheep on foot is hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, it was exhausting. We worked seasons of about 90 days, plus six weeks of pre-season and a couple weeks of post-season. Work days ran 16 hours. (Easy to do, in one sense, up there along the Alaska Panhandle: in June, it didn’t really get dark till midnight.) One day off per week, if possible: the needs of the animals came first. (I recall I went five weeks one time.) Sleep deprivation was a serious issue. People can get into real trouble when they’re sleepy — particularly driving those active logging roads and lonely highways, as we had to do for supplies and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:260px"&gt;&lt;img title="Daniel_leans_on_crook" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Daniel_leans_on_crook.jpg" alt="Daniel Loxton in sheep camp" width="250" height="362"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Trailing&amp;quot; sheep on logging road. Daniel Loxton brings up the tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great saving grace is that sheep rest partway through the day. They fill up all morning, and then sit down to ruminate for a while and take it easy. That’s when you get some sleep. You find a spot that’s somewhat sheltered from rain or sun (if you can) and then you just drop like a puppet with its strings cut. Sometimes you wake up in a puddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, at the ripe old age of 35, I’m retired from the sheep — but my little boy can’t get enough of those old stories. When I tuck him in at night, his “one more story” requests usually sound like this: “Dad, can you tell me the story about the one mean sheep? Please?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, sheep are bright and interesting animals. Scoff if you like, but there it is. By and large they’re pleasant-tempered animals as well. But they display variations of personality, as do other complex mammals. In a flock of 1500, there are always a few bad apples. (At the beginning of every season we’d watch for those bad apples — the ones going right when everyone else is going left — and we’d put bells on them. Then, we’d know what mischief they were getting up to, even when we couldn’t see them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early one season I met one of those bad apples in a most surprising way. I was asleep near the flock, nestled into a little hollow, when I suddenly woke with an agonized “Oooof!” I snapped upright, swearing, and saw a big brockle-faced (multi-colored) ewe standing near me. She stared at me, seemingly with deliberate, hostile disdain. Then, she tossed her head and strolled back into the flock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What the hell was that?” I asked. Not far off, Jolene was laughing in shocked disbelief. “She came right out of the flock,” Joe said, “walked right up to you, reared up, and nailed you with both front feet!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can tell you, that’s no joke. Big ewes run a couple hundred pounds, and they’re strong, too. This was an extremely memorable misadventure, and my son&lt;em&gt; loves&lt;/em&gt; this story. I tell it often. (By way of epilogue, incidentally, we found that sheep and put a bell on her. We also gave her a name. Will you think less of me if I tell you she was named for the meanest girl in our Junior High school?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to our shepherd’s get-together the other night. It happened that Jolene told that very same story. This was the first time we’d synchronized our memories of that event in a few years, and the outcome was inevitable: there was significant drift. The basic plot was the same — sheep comes out of flock, deliberately kicks me while I’m down — but the details were different. It was a different area, maybe a different year. In her version I was sleeping out on a skid road, not in a hollow. Little things, but &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; little things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other stories we told were the same way. Some diverged. Others just seemed a little too perfect. Did they really happen that way? Listening to the stories — telling the stories — we couldn’t be sure. Not really. Not any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this is surprising stuff for skeptics. We know memory is extremely unreliable, malleable stuff — less like a hard drive, and more like leaves floating on a pond. Whenever I hear a paranormal witness tell a tale set decades in the past, I think, “Man, I’m lucky if I can remember what happened on Tuesday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, no matter how aware of it we think we are, we forget how much we forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Reindeer_bw.GIF" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Reindeer_bw.GIF" width="290" height="305" style="float:left;margin:0 00px 00px 0"&gt;&lt;img alt="lepidopterist.gif" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/lepidopterist.gif" width="224" height="305" style="float:left;margin:0 00px 00px 0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If I was not so averse to cold, I'd think this would be the best career in science ever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise that their latest paper - &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982210000850" title=""&gt;A Circadian Clock Is Not Required in an Arctic Mammal&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100311123516.htm" title=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;) - was widely covered by the media, both traditional and blogs, See, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/57213/" title=""&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8565233.stm" title=""&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=how-its-internal-clock-is-read-know-10-03-18" title=""&gt;Scientific American podcast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/03/arctic-reindeer-circadian-clock/" title=""&gt;Wired Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Relevant, or just cool?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to find a science story that is more obviously in the "that's cool" category, as opposed to the "that's relevant" category. For the background on this debate, please read &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/16/the-value-of-this-is-cool-science-stories/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/2010/03/coolnifty_versus_funny-smellin.php" title=""&gt;David Dobbs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sciencetrio.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/and-itsz-gota-b-whizbang-pllllllls/" title=""&gt;DeLene Beeland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://colinschultz.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/systemic-issues-in-science-journalism-the-reinforcing-cycle-of-niche-reporting/" title=""&gt;Colin Schultz&lt;/a&gt;, and the series of  Colin's interviews with &lt;a href="http://colinschultz.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/interview-with-carl-zimmer/" title=""&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://colinschultz.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/interview-with-nicola-jones/" title=""&gt;Nicola Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://colinschultz.wordpress.com/2010/03/13/interview-with-david-dobbs/" title=""&gt;David Dobbs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://colinschultz.wordpress.com/2010/03/11/interview-with-jay-ingram/" title=""&gt;Jay Ingram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://colinschultz.wordpress.com/2010/04/03/interview-with-ferris-jabr/" title=""&gt;Ferris Jabr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://colinschultz.wordpress.com/2010/03/13/not-exactly-an-interview-with-ed-yong/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://colinschultz.wordpress.com/2010/04/04/interview-with-ed-yong/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, it is a cool story. It is an attention-grabbing, nifty story about charismatic megafauna living in a strange wilderness. I first saw the work from the lab in a poster session at a conference many years ago, and of all the posters I saw that day, it is the reindeer one that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/what_makes_a_memorable_poster.php" title=""&gt;I still remember after all these years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the coolness of the story should not hide the fact that this research is also very relevant - both to the understanding of evolution and to human medicine. Let me try to explain what they did and why that is much more important than what a quick glance at the headlines may suggest. I did it only part-way a few years ago when I blogged about one of their &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/circadian_rhythms_or_not_in_ar_3.php" title=""&gt;earlier papers&lt;/a&gt;. But let me start with that earlier paper as background, for context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rhythms of Behavior&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their 2005 Nature paper (which was really just a tiny subset of a much longer, detailed paper they published elsewhere a couple of years later), Stokkan and colleagues used radiotelemetry to continuously monitor activity of reindeer - when they sleep and when they roam around foraging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should remember that up in the Arctic the summer is essentially one single day that lasts several months, while the winter is a continuous night that lasts several months. During these long periods of constant illumination, reindeer did not show rhythms in activity - they moved around and rested in bouts and bursts, at almost unpredictable times of "day". Their circadian rhythms of behavior were gone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, during brief periods of spring and fall, during which there are 24-hour light-dark cycles of day and night, the reindeer (on the northern end of the mainland Norway, but not the population living even further north on Svaldbard which remained arrhythmic throughout), showed daily rhythms of activity, suggesting that this species may possess a circadian clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rhythms of Physiology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a couple of studies, including the latest one, the lab also looked into a physiological rhythm - that of melatonin synthesis and secretion by the pineal gland. Just as in activity rhythms, melatonin concentrations in the blood showed a daily (24-hour) rhythm only during the brief periods of spring and fall. Furthermore, in the latest paper, they kept three reindeer indoors for a couple of days, in light-tight stalls, and exposed them to 2.5-hour-long periods of darkness during the normal light phase of the day. Each such 'dark pulse' resulted in a sharp rise of blood melatonin, followed by just as abrupt elimination of melatonin as soon as the lights went back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="reindeer melatonin.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/reindeer%20melatonin.jpg" width="367" height="336" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rhythms of gene expression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in this latest paper, they also looked at the expression of two of the core clock genes in fibroblasts kept &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; (in a dish). Fibroblasts are connective tissue cells found all around the body, probably taken out of reindeer by biopsy. In other mammals, e.g., in rodents, clock genes continue to cycle with a circadian period for a very long time in a dish. Yet, the reindeer fibroblasts, after a couple of very weak oscillations that were roughly in the circadian range, decayed into complete arrhytmicity - the cells were healthy, but their clocks were not ticking any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="reindeer fibroblasts.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/reindeer%20fibroblasts.jpg" width="448" height="195" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do these results suggest?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something fishy about the reindeer clock. It is not working the same way it does in other mammals studied to date. For example, seals and humans living in the Arctic have normal circadian rhythms of melatonin. Some other animals show &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/02/small_arctic_mammals_entrain_t.php" title=""&gt;daily rhythms in behavior&lt;/a&gt;. But in reindeer, rhythms in behavior and melatonin can be seen only if the environment is rhythmic as well. In constant light conditions, it appears that the clock is not working. But, is it? How do we know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the long winter night and the long summer day, the behavior of reindeer is not completely random. It is in bouts which show some regularity - these are &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/clocktutorial_2_basic_concepts_3.php" title=""&gt;ultradian rhythms&lt;/a&gt; with the period much shorter than 24 hours. If the clock is not working in reindeer, i.e., if there is no clock in this species, then the ultradian rhythms would persist during spring and fall as well. Yet we see circadian rhythms during these seasons - there is an underlying clock there which can be entrained to a 24-hour light-dark cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argues for the notion that the deer's circadian clock, unless forced into synchrony by a 24 external cycle, undergoes something called &lt;i&gt;frequency demultiplication&lt;/i&gt;. The idea is that the underlying cellular clock runs with a 24-hour period but that is sends signals downstream of the clock, triggering phenotypic (observable) events, several times during each cycle. The events happen always at the same phases of the cycle, and are usually happening every 12 or 8 or 6 or 4 or 3 or 2 or 1 hours - the divisors of 24. Likewise, the clock can trigger the event only every other cycle, resulting in a 48-hour period of the observable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we forget for a moment the metaphor of the clock and think instead of a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/the_clock_metaphor.php" title=""&gt;Player Piano&lt;/a&gt;, it is like the contraption plays the note G several times per cycle, always at the same moments during each cycle, but there is no need to limit each note to appear only once per cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, both the activity and melatonin rhythms appear to be driven directly by light and dark - like a stop-watch. In circadian parlance this is called an "hourglass clock" - an environmental trigger is needed to turn it over so it can start measuring time all over again. Dawn and dusk appear to directly stop and start the behavioral activity, and onset of dark stimulates while onset of light inhibits secretion of melatonin. An "hourglass clock" is an extreme example of a circadian clock with a very low amplitude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we mostly pay attention to period and phase, we should not forget that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/07/the_amplitude_problem.php" title=""&gt;amplitude is important&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/phaseresponse_curve_and_tcycle.php" title=""&gt;amplitude is important&lt;/a&gt;. It determines how easy it is for the environmental cue to reset the clock to a new phase - lower the amplitude of the clock, easier it is to shift. In a very low-amplitude oscillator, onset of light (or dark) can instantly reset the clock to Phase Zero and start timing all over again - an "hourglass" behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The molecular study of the reindeer fibroblasts also suggests a low-amplitude clock - there are a couple of weak oscillations to be seen before the rhythm goes away completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be other explanations for the observed data, e.g., masking (direct effect of light on behavior bypassing the clock) or relative coordination (weak and transient entrainment) but let's not get too bogged down in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/clock_tutorial_6_to_entrain_or.php" title=""&gt;arcane circadiana&lt;/a&gt; right now. For now, let's say that the reindeer &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/basics_biological_clock_3.php" title=""&gt;clock exists&lt;/a&gt;, that it is a very low-amplitude clock which entrains readily and immediately to light-dark cycles, while it fragments or demultiplies in long periods of constant conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why is this important to the reindeer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During long night of the winter and the long day of the summer it does not make sense for the reindeer to behave in 24-hour cycles. Their internal drive to do so, driven by the clock, should be overpowered by the need to be flexible - in such a harsh environment, behavior needs to be opportunistic - if there's a predator in sight: move away. If there is food in sight - go get it. If you are full and there is no danger, this is a good time to take a nap. One way to accomplish this is to de-couple the behavior from the clock. The other strategy is to have a clock that is very permissive to such opportunistic behavior - a very low-amplitude clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why have clock at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stokkan and colleagues stress that the day-night cycles in spring help reindeer &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_15_seasonality_3.php" title=""&gt;time seasonal events&lt;/a&gt;, most importantly breeding. The calves/fawns should be born when the weather is the nicest and the food most plentiful. The reindeer use those few weeks of spring (and fall) to measure &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_16_photoperiodi_3.php" title=""&gt;daylength (photoperiod)&lt;/a&gt; and thus time their seasonality - or in other words, to reset their internal calendar: the circannual clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;But, what does it all mean?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above deals only with one of the two hypotheses for the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/clocktutorial_3a_clock_evoluti.php" title=""&gt;adaptive function&lt;/a&gt; (and thus &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/clocktutorial_3b_whence_clocks.php" title=""&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt;) of the circadian clock. This is the &lt;i&gt;Internal Synchronization&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis. This means that it is adaptive for an organism to be synchronized (in its biochemistry, physiology and behavior) with the external environment - to sleep when it is safe to do so, to eat at times when it will be undisturbed, etc. In the case of reindeer, since there are no daily cycles in the environment for the most of the year, there is no adaptive value in keeping a 24-hour rhythm in behavior, so none is observed. But since Arctic is highly seasonal, and since the circadian clock, through daylength measurement (photoperiodism) times seasonal events, the clock is retained as an adaptive structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not so new - such things have been observed in cave animals, as well as in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/why_social_insects_do_not_suff.php" title=""&gt;social insects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the paper does not address is the other hypothesis - the &lt;i&gt;Internal Synchronization&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis for the existence of the circadian clock - to synchronize internal events. So a target cell does not need to keep producing (and wasting energy) to produce a hormone receptor except at the time when the endocrine gland is secreting the hormone. It is a way for the body to temporally divide potentially conflicting physiological functions so those that need to coincide do so, and those that conflict with each other are separated in time - do not occur simultaneously. In this hypothesis, the clock is the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/04/everything_important_cycles_2.php" title=""&gt;Coordination Center of all the physiological processes&lt;/a&gt;. Even if there is no cycle in the environment to adapt to, the clock is a necessity and will be retained no matter what for this internal function, though the period now need not be close to 24 hours any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What can be done next?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, reindeer are not fruitflies or mice or rats. They are not endangered (as far as I know), but they are not easy to keep in the laboratory in large numbers in ideal, controlled conditions, for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out in the field, one is limited as to what one can do. The only output of the clock that can be monitored long-term in the field is gross locomotor activity. Yet, while easiest to do, this is probably the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/clock_tutorial_4_on_methodolog.php" title=""&gt;least reliable indicator&lt;/a&gt; of the workings of the clock. Behavior is too flexible and malleable, too susceptible to "masking" by direct effects of the environment (e.g., weather, predators, etc,). And measurement of just gross locomotor activity does not tell us which specific behaviors the animals are engaged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be so nice if a bunch of reindeer could be brought into a lab and placed under controlled lighting conditions for a year at a time. One could, first, monitor several different specific behaviors. For example, if feeding, drinking and defecation are rhythmic, that would suggest that the entire digestive system is under circadian control: the stomach, liver, pancreas, intestine and all of their enzymes. Likewise with drinking and urination - they can be indirect indicators of the rhytmicity of the kidneys and the rest of the excretory system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lab, one could also continuously monitor some physiological parameters with simple, non-invasive techniques. One could, for example &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/chossats_effect_in_humans_and.php" title=""&gt;monitor body temperature&lt;/a&gt;, blood pressure and heart-rate, much more reliable markers of circadian output. One could also take more frequent blood samples (these are large animals, they can take it) and measure a whole plethora of hormones along with melatonin, e.g., cortisol, thyroid hormones, progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, etc (also useful for measuring seasonal responses). One could measure metabolites in urine and feces and also gain some insight into rhythms of the internal biochemistry and physiology. All of that with no surgery and no discomfort to the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one can place reindeer in constant darkness and see if all these rhythms persist or decay over time. Then one &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_10_entrainment_3.php" title=""&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_11_phase-shifti.php" title=""&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_12_constructing_3.php" title=""&gt;Phase&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_13_using_the_ph_3.php" title=""&gt;Response&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_14_interpreting_3.php" title=""&gt;Curve&lt;/a&gt; and thus test the amplitude of the underlying oscillator (or do that with entrainment to T-cycles, if you have been clicking on links all along, you'll know what I'm talking about). One can test their reproductive response to photoperiod this way as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, fibroblasts are peripheral cells. One cannot expect the group to dissect &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_7_circadian_org_3.php" title=""&gt;suprachiasmatic nuclei&lt;/a&gt; out of reindeer to check the state of the master pacemaker itself. And in a case of such a damped circadian system, testing a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/05/a_pacemaker_is_a_network.php" title=""&gt;peripheral clock&lt;/a&gt; may not be very informative. Better fibroblasts than nothing, but there are big caveats about using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that the circadian system is distributed &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/clocktutorial_5_circadian_orga.php" title=""&gt;all around the body&lt;/a&gt;, with each cell containing a molecular clock, but only the pacemaker cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus are acting as a network. In a circadian system like the one in reindeer, where the system is low-amplitude to begin with, it is almost expected that peripheral clocks taken out of the body and isolated in a dish will not be able to sustain rhythms for very long. Yet those same cells, while inside of the body, may be perfectly rhythmic as a part of the ensemble of all the body cells, each sending entraining signals to the others every day, thus the entire system as a whole working quite well as a body-wide circadian clock. This can be monitored in real-time in transgenic mice, but the technology to do that in reindeer is still some years away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one could test a hypothesis that the reindeer clock undergoes seasonal changes in its organization at the molecular level by comparing the performance of fibroblasts (and perhaps some other peripheral cells) taken out of animals at different times of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's up with this being medically relevant?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why is all this important? Why is work on mice not sufficient and one needs to pay attention to a strange laboratory animal model like reindeer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, unlike rodents, reindeer is a large, mostly diurnal animal. Just &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/06/everything_you_always_wanted_t.php" title=""&gt;like us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="a1 reindeer.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/a1%20reindeer.jpg" width="400" height="302" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, reindeer normally live in conditions that make people sick, yet they remain just fine, thank you. How do they do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even humans who don't live above the Arctic Circle (or in the Antarctica), &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/01/sun_time_is_the_real_time.php" title=""&gt;tend to live in a 24-hour society&lt;/a&gt; with both light and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/02/lesson_of_the_day_circadian_cl.php" title=""&gt;social cues&lt;/a&gt; messing up with our internal rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/12/a_huge_new_circadian_pacemaker.php" title=""&gt;complex circadian systems&lt;/a&gt; that are easy to get out of whack. We work night-shifts and rotating shifts and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/09/some_hypotheses_about_a_possib.php" title=""&gt;fly around the globe&lt;/a&gt; getting &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/07/is_that_your_jetlag_treatment_1.php" title=""&gt;jet-lagged&lt;/a&gt;. Jet-lag is not desynchronization between the clock and the environment, it is internal desynchronization between all the cellular clocks in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the state of almost permanent jet-lag that many of us live in, a lot of things &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/03/cortisol_necessry_for_circadia.php" title=""&gt;go wrong&lt;/a&gt;. We get sleeping disorders, eating disorders, obesity, compromised immunity leading to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/11/serotonin_melatonin_immunity_a.php" title=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, problems with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/05/oxytocin_and_childbirth_or_not_1.php" title=""&gt;reproduction&lt;/a&gt;, increase in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/lithium_circadian_clocks_and_b_3.php" title=""&gt;psychiatric problems&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/seasonal_affective_disorder_-.php" title=""&gt;Seasonal Affective Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, prevalence of stomach ulcers and breast cancer &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/04/rotating_shifts_shorten_lives.php" title=""&gt;in night-shift nurses&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we get all that and reindeer don't? What is the trick they evolved to stay healthy in conditions that drive us insane and sick? Can we learn their trick, adopt it for our own medical practice, and use it? Those are kinds of things that a mouse and a rat cannot provide answers to, but reindeer can. I can't think of another animal species that can do that for us. Which is why I am glad that Stokkan and friends are chasing reindeer with enormous butterfly nets across Arctic wasteland in the darkness of winter ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

Things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to be “recognized” by the campus in order to meet, but recognition opens the door to several perks — like free meeting space, the opportunity to apply for event funding, the chance to advertise on campus, and booth space during new student days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Northeastern University in Boston, an &lt;a href="http://huntnewsnu.com/2010/04/atheist-org-wants-recognition/"&gt;atheist group is having no luck&lt;/a&gt;, even after repeated attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason they were rejected the first time (in Fall, 2008) was because of their proposed group name: Student Atheists at Northeastern (SANE).  The Student Affairs Board found the implication offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the group’s former president, Andrew Groleau, tried again in Fall of 2009, this time using the name NU Free Thought Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn’t work, either, but for a different reason.&lt;/p&gt;

“I submitted all the proper paper work over a year ago with an amended constitution indicating our name change. After many attempts to even begin dialogue with Student Activities, we have gotten no where,” said Groleau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Student Activities Center has not received any paperwork from the NU Free Thought Society, Nyul said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the students are just moving forward without “official” status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“It has gotten to a ridiculous point,” said Nick Loek, current President of the NU Free Thought Society. “I hate to say it, but we are giving up. We can function without their recognition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We intend to continue being a part of campus with events like ‘Ask an Atheist Night’ and attend events with prominent speakers, however, these expenses are being covered from out of our pockets,” Loek said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/node/8"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; will try to get in touch with Nick to see how we can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this is just a miscommunication that can be remedied without much further drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 12, 1961: Yuri Gagarin becomes the first man in space. That was 49 years ago today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 14, 1970: An oxygen tank disrupts on Apollo 13, causing a series of catastrophic malfunctions that nearly leads to the deaths of the three astronauts. That was 40 years ago this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 12, 1981: The first Space Shuttle, &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt;, launches into space. That was 29 years ago today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t yet born when Gagarin flew, and I was still too young to appreciate what was happening on board Apollo as it flew helplessly around the Moon instead of landing on it. But I do remember breathlessly awaiting the Shuttle launch, and I remember thinking it would be the next phase in our exploration of space. I was still pretty young, and hadn’t thought it through, but I’m sure had you asked me I’d have said that this would lead to cheap, easy, and fast access to space, and by the time the 21st century rolled around we’d have space stations, more missions to the Moon, and maybe even to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I hadn’t thought it through. Of all these anniversaries, that one is the least of the three we should celebrate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t get me wrong; the Shuttle is a magnificent machine. But it’s also a symbol of a political disaster for NASA. It was claimed that it would be cheap way to get payloads to space, and could launch every couple of weeks. Instead, it became frightfully expensive and couldn’t launch more than a few times a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a political problem. Once it became clear that NASA was building the Shuttle Transport System, it became a feeding trough. It never had a chance to be the lean space machine it should’ve been, and instead became bloated, weighted down with administrative bureaucracy and red tape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than that, though, to me it symbolizes a radical shift in the vision of NASA. We had gone to the Moon six times — seven, if you include Apollo 13 — and even before the launch of Apollo 17 that grand adventure had been canceled by Congress, with NASA being forced to look to the Shuttle. Ever since then, since December 1972, we’ve gone around in circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there’s a lot to be said for low Earth orbit. It is a fantastic resource for science, and I strongly think we should be exploiting it even more. But it’s not the goal. &lt;em&gt;It’s like walking halfway up a staircase, standing on your tiptoes, and admiring the view of the top landing.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep walking up those stairs. In 1961, the effects of space travel were largely unknown, but Yuri Gagarin took that chance. He was followed by many others in rapid succession. Extrapolating from his travels, by now there should be a business making money selling tours of the mountain chains around Oceanus Procellarum by now. Of the three anniversaries, looking at it now, Gagarin’s is bittersweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970 Apollo 13 became our nation’s &amp;quot;successful failure&amp;quot;. A simple error had led to a near tragedy, saved only by the experience, training, guts, and clever thinking on their feet of a few dozen engineers. They turned catastrophe into triumph, and now, four decades later, we can’t repeat what they did. Think on this: when the disaster struck their ship, the crew of Apollo 13 were over 300,000 kilometers from Earth.  Apollo 13 may have been a successful failure, &lt;em&gt;but it’s a failure we can’t even repeat today if we tried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written quite a bit about NASA’s future, including &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/02/01/president-obamas-nasa-budget-unveiled/"&gt;my support of Obama’s decision to cancel Constellation&lt;/a&gt;, the program that includes the next series of big rockets to take people into space. That may seem contradictory on its surface, but I support the decision because, in my opinion, Constellation was over budget, behind schedule, and had no clear purpose. The idea of going back to the Moon is one I very much strongly support, but I get the impression that the plan itself is not well-thought out by NASA. The engineering, sure, but not the political side of it. And it’s the politics that will always and forever be NASA’s burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a political decision to cancel Apollo. It was a political decision to turn the Shuttle from a space plane to the top-heavy system it is. It was a political decision to cancel the Shuttle with no replacement planned at all (that was done before Obama took office, I’ll note). It was a political decision that turned the space station from a scientific lab capable of teaching us how to live and explore space into the hugely expensive and bloated construction it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA needs a clear vision, and it needs one that is sturdy enough to resist the changing gusts of political winds. I’m hoping that Obama’s plan will streamline NASA, giving away the expensive and &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; duties it needs not do so that private industry can pick them up. The added money to go to science, again in my hopes, will spur more innovation in engineering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And NASA needs a goal. It needs to put its foot down and say &amp;quot;This is our next giant step.&amp;quot; And this has to be done hand in hand with the politics. I understand that is almost impossible given today’s political climate, where statesmanship and compromise has turned into small-minded meanness and childish name-calling on the Congress floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m old enough to remember when NASA could do the impossible. That was practically their motto. Beating the Soviets was impossible. Landing on the Moon was impossible. Getting Apollo 13 back safely was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the three anniversaries, Apollo 13 is the one we should be celebrating. I’ll gently correct what Gene Kranz said that day: failure really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an option, but not an &lt;em&gt;acceptable&lt;/em&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, at this very moment, those feats are all impossible once again. But for a time, they were not only possible, &lt;em&gt;we made them happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to do the impossible once again. &lt;/p&gt;

Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read." -&lt;i&gt;Groucho Marx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"While no one has proved that wormholes exist, that does not for a moment keep the more adventurous of thinkers from trying to figure how they might behave."&lt;br&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Michael Lemonick, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956761,00.html"&gt;Time magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Wormholes.  We've all heard the word before, and we're used to the concept (thanks to science fiction) that wormholes &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be tunnels to either completely different locations in space &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; in time!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/SG-1_True_Science_Wormhole.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/SG-1_True_Science_Wormhole-thumb-500x266-46892.jpeg" width="500" height="266" alt="SG-1_True_Science_Wormhole.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How so?  You see, when you get enough mass (or other form of energy) in a small enough space, it becomes harder and harder to escape from it, gravitationally.  The Earth isn't so bad; you "only" have to travel at about 25,000 miles-per-hour (~40,000 km/hr) to escape from its gravity, something we've been doing since the 1960s.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/SaturnV.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/SaturnV-thumb-500x554-46894.jpeg" width="500" height="554" alt="SaturnV.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you keep turning up the mass, you'd need to travel faster and faster to escape.  You can add mass to something arbitrarily, but as for velocity?  There's a limit to that: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light"&gt;the speed of light&lt;/a&gt;.  If you make something so massive that you can't escape from it, &lt;i&gt;even if you move at light-speed&lt;/i&gt;, congratulations!  You've just made a black hole: something with gravity, but that emits no light; that anything can be sucked into, but that nothing can escape from!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/131_BlackHole.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/131_BlackHole-thumb-500x333-46896.jpeg" width="500" height="333" alt="131_BlackHole.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the "reverse" of a black hole would be something that &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; can be sucked into but that &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; can escape from: a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hole"&gt;white hole&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/251.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/251-thumb-500x400-46898.jpeg" width="500" height="400" alt="251.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White holes are not observed to exist, but they are theoretically possible.  Something interesting?  If you have a black hole in one region of space, it &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt;, in principle, be connected on the other end (in a separate region) to a white hole!  The connection between the two -- the black hole and the white hole -- is known as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, or more popularly, a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole"&gt;wormhole&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/File%3ALorentzianWormhole.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/File%3ALorentzianWormhole-thumb-500x479-46900.jpeg" width="500" height="479" alt="File:LorentzianWormhole.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have speculated for a long time that when matter falls into a black hole, it emerges somewhere else as a white hole, and that this apparent "boom" of matter, seeming to come from nowhere, would look an awful lot like our Big Bang.  In fact, some say, perhaps that's where our Universe got its start!  It's an interesting idea that we have not been able to test (yet), but that is certainly a worthwhile speculation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recently, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6TVN-4YK7J05-3&amp;amp;_user=2495299&amp;amp;_coverDate=04/12/2010&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000057581&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=2495299&amp;amp;md5=7e348f34a5d92c339e478045f1296b7b"&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; has come out (and you can read the &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.1994"&gt;preprint here&lt;/a&gt;) that asks the question: &lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/does-our-universe-live-inside-a-.html"&gt;could our Universe live in the "neck" of one of these wormholes&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/File%3AFY221c15.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/File%3AFY221c15-thumb-500x400-46902.png" width="500" height="400" alt="File:FY221c15.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is making news on the net, I'm here to bring you back to reality.  First off, this is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a new idea; it's been around since at least &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972Natur.240..298P"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt;.  Second of all, what the author finds is that the interior of an Einstein-Rosen black hole is &lt;i&gt;static&lt;/i&gt;, which is not a property of our (expanding) Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this paper does show a few interesting things.  First off, this solution is stable, which means -- in principle -- that it &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; exist.  Second off, it is possible that this can be generalized to make the space inside of it do other things besides remain completely static (like expand or contract).  And third off, it brings up this amazingly interesting possibility that not only might our Universe &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the inside of a black hole, but that each black hole that's come to exist in our Universe may house its own miniature Universe inside of it!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/rn_398.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes/rn_398-thumb-500x375-46904.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="rn_398.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any way to test this?  Not yet, since a black hole like this would look identical from the outside to a plain old "I'm-a-singularity-at-the-center-and-nobody's-going-nowhere" &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric"&gt;Schwarzschild&lt;/a&gt; black hole.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in summary, I'm skeptical that this idea is right, and I'm even more skeptical that this idea is testable in principle.  But that doesn't mean it isn't incredibly interesting in its own right, and that further research might bear out some awfully interesting details.  I have a feeling we'll be hearing about this one again sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/do_we_live_inside_a_wormholes.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271118747963"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/monday_metazoan_who_invented_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/311ba0d207a1bae5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Monday Metazoan: Who invented The Wave?</title><published>2010-04-13T01:06:53Z</published><updated>2010-04-13T01:06:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/6gLrBV9k0RI/monday_metazoan_who_invented_t.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/monday_metazoan_who_invented_t.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/vll_2xH_SQY%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=248" width="425" height="248"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/monday_metazoan_who_invented_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/6gLrBV9k0RI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271118747963"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/episode_xlvii_mounting_numbers.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/360bf7be82c709a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Open Thread"/><title type="html">Episode XLVII: Mounting numbers, and a song to their significance</title><published>2010-04-13T00:12:03Z</published><updated>2010-04-13T00:12:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Ot6GhfoEb5o/episode_xlvii_mounting_numbers.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/episode_xlvii_mounting_numbers.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was much talk of music in the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/episode_xlvi_early_morning_on.php"&gt;prior embodiment&lt;/a&gt; of the immortal thread, so I thought everyone would appreciate a special song.

They see it as a difficult issue that could sidetrack campaigns to encourage critical thinking, even though a lot of prominent skeptics are also atheists. I&amp;#39;ve never quite seen the logic: they&amp;#39;re going to oppose the use of magic crystals to enhance your aura, but praying to a magical sky-primate to bring you a new bicycle…eh, it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt. It seems a little inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Rebecca Watson, a godless skeptic if ever there was one, wrote a bit in support of the Hitchens/Dawkins proposal to bring legal action against the perfidious pope, and she caught some flak for it — people claimed that opposing religion, even if it is a baby-raping religion, could &amp;#39;harm the cause&amp;#39; (Oh, those three words…I have heard them so often). &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/yes-the-pope-should-be-arrested-and-i-dont-care-who-does-it/"&gt;Watson has a good reply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is this effort going to somehow hurt the "skeptical movement?" You may notice that I use the quotation marks here, because I can't bring myself to seriously consider a movement supposedly based on the defense of rationality that would turn its back on children who are raped by men they trust because those men claim a supernatural being gives them power, wisdom, and the keys to eternal life with a direct line to God's ear. If we discovered that a world-famous psychic was leading a secretive cabal that protected child rapists, would we be silent? If a world-famous faith healer was using his heavenly persona to molest kids, would we say that it's not our fight? You might. I couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would hope, though, that it wouldn't take molestation of children to stir up a skeptic (although, apparently, even that won't rouse some of them, if the culprit is a priest). Shouldn't an organization that claims you'll go to hell after you're dead if you don't give them money while you're alive also be on every skeptic's hit list?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/deep_rifts_with_the_skeptics.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/D3caNiqHhQE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271118747958"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/another_predictable_excuse.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/64f941f9958aa2f3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Another predictable excuse</title><published>2010-04-12T22:30:04Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T22:30:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/qmWCym61kGY/another_predictable_excuse.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/another_predictable_excuse.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The horrible evidence of a Catholic cover-up keeps piling up in these various sex abuse cases…what&amp;#39;s going on? Certain minds are certainly drifting towards conspiracy theories, evil attempts to bring down the church with a web of deception. And if that&amp;#39;s the case, who is behind it all? Isn&amp;#39;t it obvious? &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/11/catholic-bishop-blames-jews"&gt;It must be…&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Jews!!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A website quoted Giacomo Babini, the emeritus bishop of Grosseto, as saying he believed a "Zionist attack" was behind the criticism, considering how "powerful and refined" the criticism is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the article is accompanied by a photo of the Pope…and this doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily reflect his views. It is the position of one rather cranky, old, and possibly senile priest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allegedly speaking to the Catholic website Pontifex, Babini, 81, was quoted as saying: "They do not want the church, they are its natural enemies. Deep down, historically speaking, the Jews are God killers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's probably also the view of Mel Gibson and a terrifying number of conservative Catholics. It's also a position advanced by that important event in Catholic history, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php"&gt;Fourth Lateran Council&lt;/a&gt;, which also, curiously enough, established that whole celibate priests nonsense. You can trace a lot of the most horrible Catholic ideas right back to 1215, and we're still suffering for their foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, not really today, but we've been on break, so I got them today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The majority of them was Chemistry supplies, but there was some Bio stuff in there too (an electrophoresis kit and some frogs to dissect). Getting boxes full of SCIENCE is just fun. Especially since I've centered the vast majority of my demonstrations around the best type: Explosions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My Chem class really isn't up to the proper section for reactions yet. We're still slogging out way through bonding, and I keep telling them we need to learn what bonds are before we start making and breaking them. We're getting there, but not quite yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I just couldn't help myself from doing a demonstration. One of the bits I'd gotten was calcium carbide which, when mixed with water, forms acetylene gas. The way I've seen this demonstration done previously was in a bottle into which a few small chunks were placed. They fizz and give off some gas, and then are ignited with a spark generator making a fantastic boom. All of my students jumped. This is all I did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I actually do the demonstration in the proper section, there's a further component to it: Instead of just dumping in a small amount, a heaping spoonful is tossed in. When the spark igniter is hit, absolutely nothing happens. The reason is that the acetylene gas pushes out all the air and without a proper stoichiometric balance, ignition can't take place.

Neither the religion in which the person was raised (versus none), nor religious service attendance, nor the importance of religion in daily life, were related to whether the person had given blood in the past.In terms of raw numbers, women raised as mainline protestants were slightly more likely to have given blood than people from other religions or none (see figure), but these effects disappeared once the statistics were adjusted for other factors (for example, people who are born in the USA are more likely to give blood than are immigrants). There was no effect among men, even in the unadjusted data.By cutting and dicing the statistics, the authors (Frank Gillum at Howard University and Kevin Masters at Syracuse) were able to find occasional groups that seemed to be more generous donors (Catholic men aged 35-44, for example), but I think they have fallen foul of the problem of multiple comparisons. If you make enough groups (nearly 50 in this case) some are going to come out high just by random chance.This is a surprising result, given that the religious are supposed to be more charitable and pro-social than the non-religious. If nothing else, you would expect religious service attenders to donate more, simply because (in the US at least) conscientious and dutiful people are expected to do both.The authors think that it might be because religiously-motivated charity is primarily directed to people of the same &amp;#39;tribe&amp;#39;. The problem with blood donations is that anyone could benefit - even people who are outsiders.That would certainly fit with other research into charitable giving (some 80% of evangelical charitable giving goes to other evangelicals), and charitable giving to co-religious is inversely related to support for broad-based state welfare. It also fits with theories that explain religion as an invented (or socially evolved) tool to increase group solidarity.But I can&amp;#39;t help thinking that another process might also be at work here. One of the interesting things about religion is that, although religious people tend to report that they are more pro-social, when tested in controlled conditions they are not (except when previously primed with religious messages).Now, blood donations are all traceable. That means you might think twice to make sure that you give an accurate report of your donation history, and resist the temptation to inflate your contributions to match your self image!Gillum RF, &amp;amp; Masters KS (2010).

At that time, there was a question which confronted us every day of our lives, and for which nobody had any answer that was even remotely satisfactory -- namely, "Where did all these animals come from?!?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now obviously, when confronted with a question one cannot answer, the "Let's just make shit up!" approach is not preferred.  Especially if the shit you make up is the ol' "goddidit" refrain.  But for a question so basic and so omnipresent as the origin of species, it's pretty forgivable, in my opinion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also prior to Darwin, there was no "Creation Science" movement to speak of.  And why not?  Humanity had all the tools they needed to do &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baraminology"&gt;baraminology&lt;/a&gt; for millenia, and yet the idea wasn't even proposed until 1941, and wasn't formalized until 1990.  And the bizarre clawing apologetics of idiots like Dembski is certainly a new phenomenon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why did it take so long?  It seems as though in past centuries, a Creationist attitude was just the default.  I forget who coined the term "promiscuous teleology", but it seems appropriate here.  That's just the way we tend to think.  So the majority of Creationists had no special stake in it.  Now, of course, the only people who are Creationists are those who want to make some excuse for it, to keep this dumb old idea alive for some reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wonder to what extent a belief in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_dualism"&gt;Cartesian dualism&lt;/a&gt; might follow a similar trajectory.  And are we seeing the first wave of "dualist apologists" right now?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet another one of those elephant-in-the-room everyday questions that for most of history had no good answer is, "What is consciousness and why do we have it?"  Much like the teleological explanation for the origin of species, believing by default in an immaterial "soul" that is the essence of consciousness would be an intellectual lapse, and far less preferred then simply admitting that we don't know -- however, it's such an every day question that, in the absence of any decent answers, people could be forgiven for taking the supernatural position.  It's still &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;, but it's understandable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As our knowledge of neuroscience advances, however, we are starting to have much better answers to that question.  We still can't quite fully put all the pieces together, but we know from case studies of brain damaged patients that pretty much any facet of what we might call consciousness can be altered or destroyed by neurological changes.  And as we start to understand more and more pieces of the brain, it becomes much easier to understand how the sensation of consciousness could emerge from this.  (Particularly interesting are observations into how certain parts of the brain seem to be dedicated purely to coming up with a coherent narrative to give the appearance of all these disparate components acting as a single entity, but I digress...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the face of this, will dualism be forced to beat a retreat?  In the future, will it no longer be the default position?  And for those dedicated to the ideal of dualism, will they find themselves coming up with all sorts of pseudoscience-y apologetics to make room for a "science of dualism"?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well goddamn, Deepak Choprah's &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/intentchopra/2008/08/deepak-chopra-understanding-co.html"&gt;already on the case&lt;/a&gt;!  Could he merely be ahead of his time?  Is he the Kent Hovind of dualism, proposing ridiculous ideas like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l00AZyx1B-4"&gt;a giant ice shield&lt;/a&gt;, before his more "refined" Dembski-esque counterparts come along with ridiculous mathematical "research papers"?  Time will tell, I suppose...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-6859653344035328510?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271109766212"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_270.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49f2dec07d668a44</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS ONE</title><published>2010-04-10T03:49:03Z</published><updated>2010-04-10T03:49:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/5uqN5Oc4QMM/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_270.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_270.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?field=date&amp;amp;month=4&amp;amp;year=2010&amp;amp;day=9" title=""&gt;27 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.

Add multiple kids and/or a career outside the home to the equation, and you have the recipe for an extremely wiped out mommy. Here’s a list of 10 ways to help tired moms survive the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="multi-tasking-mom" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/multi-tasking-mom-300x199.jpg" alt="Multi-tasking mom" width="300" height="199"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember to Eat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Skipping meals literally starves the body – it’s like running the car on empty,” explained Marlene Merritt, founder of the &lt;a href="http://merrittwellnesscenter.com/"&gt;Merritt Wellness Center&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/10/30/energy.boosters/index.html"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A wide variety of liquids can have you on your toes again in no time – from &lt;a href="http://www.monsterenergy.com/web/guest/home"&gt;Monster Energy Drinks&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.5hourenergy.com/"&gt;5-hour Energy&lt;/a&gt; to your favorite coffee at &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/starbucks-giveaway-exclusively-for-blisstree-readers/"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathe Deeply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.realsimple.com/health/fitness-exercise/9-energy-boosters-10000001171644/page3.html"&gt;Real Simple&lt;/a&gt; teaches us that stress leads to a failure to breathe deeply, and a failure to breathe deeply leads to fatigue. So fill those lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a Cold Shower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Put down the kiddos for a second and hop in the shower. Keep the water cold and feel the energy rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Nap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Studies have shown that even a nap as short as 30 minutes can have a profound effect with regard to staying energetic and mentally sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Whether it’s a brisk walk around your house or a quick yoga session, getting the blood flowing will provide an instant energy rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break It Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“If you take short breaks throughout the day, you will have more overall accomplishments,” says Jon Gordon, an energy consultant, to &lt;a href="http://women.webmd.com/features/fatigue-fighters-six-quick-ways-boost-energy?page=2"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meditate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.how-to-meditate.org/"&gt;Learn how to meditate&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll learn how to remain calm and focused during stressful times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Massages, Please&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you can’t coax your partner to give you a massage, spring for a professional. You can even have a masseuse come to your office to relieve midday stress, tired muscles, aches, and pains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep On It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Prevention is the best medicine. Remove distractions to maximize the sleep you get at night. If that includes your spouse, we give you permission to ignore him or her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching a child a second language may seem pointless to those parents who learned a second language in high school – only to forget it all a few years later. However, research shows that kids who learn a second language get ahead in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.actfl.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4524#academic_achievement"&gt;American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages&lt;/a&gt;, kids who are learning a second language score better on standardized tests, read English better and go on to do better in college. Additionally, they point to evidence that bilingualism can improve intelligence, memory, cognitive abilities, and problem solving skills. In short, kids are human sponges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips on how to teach your child a second language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a Good Teach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Check with your child’s school for any classes that teach a second language. If that option isn’t available at school, consider hiring a private tutor. Or, go digital. At &lt;a href="http://www.littlepim.com/"&gt;LittlePim.com&lt;/a&gt;,  you can purchase instructional DVDs that are geared toward helping kids learn a foreign language. Available languages include Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The vast majority of adults have difficulty picking up a second language. Conversely, multiple studies show that young children have an easier time becoming bilingual. The younger you start teaching the second language, the easier it will be for your child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make It Fun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even for the brightest of kids, learning a second language isn’t an overnight accomplishment. Be patient and avoid setting unrealistic expectations. Keep your child motivated by getting movies, books, toys, and music CDs in the new language. (Local libraries are great resources for these materials.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Involved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t rely on the teacher or the DVDs to do all the work. Instead, set aside at least 15 to 30 minutes a day to reinforce what your child is learning. Actually, now might be a good time to dust off that Spanish book from your high school days and learn the language yourself &lt;em&gt;otra vez&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tackle Tough Tasks Early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mid-morning is when you have the most energy and focus. So it’s the best time to do difficult or unpleasant tasks. If there’s something that you keep putting off, schedule it in the morning and give yourself a set time limit to get it done. Once it’s off your “to-do” list, the rest of your day will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molehills Aren’t Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The reason you put things off day after day is because you’re making them bigger than they need to be. Stop exaggerating the situation in your own mind and look at your tasks realistically. Then, come up with a swift game plan to tackle them. If you’re procrastinating about making a decision because you’re worried about making the wrong one, force yourself to confront your fears and just do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want to make an easy job seem mighty hard, just keep putting off doing it.” – &lt;a href="http://thinkexist.com/quotes/olin_miller/"&gt;Olin Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break It Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you have a complex project at work, break it down into small, manageable tasks. Don’t think about the big (overwhelming) picture as you’re working; just concentrate on the task at hand. You’ll be done before you know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prize Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes, a pat on the back from your boss isn’t enough. Reward yourself when you complete something substantial. Lunch out at a restaurant or a spa treatment are great payoffs for all your hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

The group refuses to disclose its finances or membership, self-identifies as “The Family” or the “&lt;a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2009/07/hbc-90005375"&gt;Christian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;,” and extols the subversive and revolutionary skills of Osama bin Laden and Lenin. For more than fifty years, it’s held the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington D.C. — a Jesus-themed gala of networking and schmoozing for the world’s top power brokers and politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, President Obama spoke at the Prayer Breakfast. During his address, the famed orator could muster only an oblique remark about reports that the Family helped propose legislation in Uganda that would have gay people imprisoned or executed. Melanie Sloan, director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melanie-sloan/why-is-the-president-atte_b_447605.html"&gt;lambasted the President&lt;/a&gt; for attending. She noted that the Family uses its connections to ingratiate foreign dictators with the American government, and other critics pointed out that defense contractors partly bankroll its gala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the JREF has learned that the 2009 Prayer Breakfast hosted an Albanian member of parliament, Fatmir Mediu, accused of helping scam the U.S. Army on a critical Afghan war contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under cover of the Prayer Breakfast and its pretensions to faith and piety, the suspect Albanian met with Vice-President Joseph Biden, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and a score of senators and congressmen, while subject to an escalating criminal investigation in Albania. Gary Kokalari, an Albanian-American activist in New York City, alerted the JREF to these meetings, which illustrate with uncommon clarity the perverse nature of the Family’s influence on government, and the way the group insinuates shifty characters into the corridors of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story starts at a ruined Albanian arms depot called Gerdec. Two years ago, in March 2008, the depot erupted in an almost nuclear-sized chain of explosions, killing 26 people and obliterating a village. Fatmir Mediu — who would later turn up at the Prayer Breakfast — immediately resigned as Albania’s Minister of Defense over the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reporter C.J. Chivers &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/world/asia/27ammo.html"&gt;blew open a scam&lt;/a&gt; that had allegedly been run out of the same depot by an arms company, AEY Inc., based in Miami Beach. Under a nearly $300 million U.S. Army contract, AEY had been tasked with selling ammunition to the Afghan government for the anti-terrorism fight. According to the&lt;em&gt; Times’&lt;/em&gt; front-page scoop, the Miami Beach company was filling the order with vintage, decayed Albanian ammo — which was illegal to sell to the Army because it had been manufactured decades earlier, much of it in the Chinese factories of Mao Tse-Tung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;expose, U.S. authorities indicted AEY’s principals, including its 22 year-old president, Efraim Diveroli, and its 25 year-old vice-president, a licensed masseur and recording artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in covertly recorded cell phone conversations, the young Diveroli hinted he had been bribing and cajoling a monolithic Albanian “mafia” that went up to the country’s “prime minister and his son.” The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;relayed allegations from an Albanian whistleblower that Defense Minister Fatmir Mediu was complicit in the $300 million bamboozle, taking kickbacks. Mediu denied it. But, corroborating the charge, an Army Major told a congressional investigation that he had been at a late-night meeting between Mediu and the American ambassador to Albania, John Withers — at which Mediu fretted over the tightening &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;investigation and insisted the “U.S. owed him something.” According to the Army Major’s account, Mediu and the U.S. ambassador agreed to a cover-up of the Maoist ammo scheme. A congressional investigation &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5228076&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; obfuscation on the part of the State Department, whose own subsequent inquiry cleared the ambassador of involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three AEY officials have pled guilty to a count of conspiracy stemming from the scheme and await sentencing. But the &lt;em&gt;Times’ &lt;/em&gt;whistleblower, Kosta Trebicka, the key to the case, turned up dead on a remote dirt road in eastern Albania in September 2008, &lt;a href="http://albca.com/aclis/images/albanian_pictures/kostatrebicka/kostatrebicka-kufomavendimakina.bmp"&gt;sprawled about 50 yards away&lt;/a&gt; from his (barely) dented car — in what the Albanian government called an accident. So his full account of what happened with the $300 million contract, and the role Fatmir Mediu played in it, will never be known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whistleblower’s death was convenient for Mediu. But in June 2008, at the &lt;a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;amp;mm=4&amp;amp;dd=26&amp;amp;nav_id=49771&amp;amp;version=print"&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; of Albania’s general prosecutor, the country’s parliament voted to deprive Mediu of immunity from prosecution and commence an investigation into the explosion at the arms depot. The prosecutor highlighted the fact that children were employed there to dismantle heavy ordinance under dangerous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="184" width="350" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/mediu_and_cohen1.jpg" alt="mediu_and_cohen1" style="margin:3px;float:right;border:#000000 3px ridge"&gt;Then, in February 2009, Mediu arrived at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington D.C. with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who was dodging reports that his government had &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,490028,00.html"&gt;demolished a village&lt;/a&gt; in cooperation with the World Bank. Berisha and Mediu got a VIP welcome from the Family and top U.S. officials. According to a &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;q=cache:2gzgxTnEROkJ:www.km.gov.al/skedaret/1234259203-Weekly%20News%20Issue%2073%209-February%202009.pdf+national+prayer+breakfast+mediu&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;pid=bl&amp;amp;srcid=ADGEESiy1N8bLZDDnSuGWuhMi_E_Y2FTAGJ0Eas5HMt1Ks-nGXB6LLhZNczuBnDxPDE8O0SmRHw8OX6iHyDXyFN7eA8Y5dQKGZ2Q11aeSl_G7t0Jdl5QCBDyZ9L482ZPcipi35aAb1Ey&amp;amp;sig=AHIEtbTDq5EZgv9GJHgLf9XnRPepYAMHuA"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; issued by the Albanian government, it was at this Prayer Breakfast that Mediu met with Vice-President Joseph Biden and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a picture of Mediu posing with senators John Thune (R-SD) and Sam Brownback (R-KS). The newsletter states that Mediu joined the pair at a “special dinner” organized by Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Congressman Heath Shuler (D-NC). Also dining were senators James DeMint (R-SC) and John Ensign (R-NV) and, to quote from the newsletter, “congressmen Mike Doyle (D-PA), Trent Franks (R-AZ), Zach Wamp (R-TN), Robert Aderholt (R-AL), etc.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mediu was photographed across a boardroom table from William Cohen, Secretary of Defense under Bill Clinton, in an in-depth meeting at Cohen’s Washington consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mediu’s Family-sponsored Washington visit came to an awkward end. After leaving the Prayer Breakfast and returning to Albania, he was immediately indicted for “abuse of power.” But last year, he was appointed Albania’s Minister of the Environment, restoring his immunity from prosecution and prompting the country’s High Court to &lt;a href="http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/newsbriefs/2009/09/15/nb-03"&gt;suspend the case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s clear through this international murk and unseemliness is that the Family may have something other than American interests at heart. In an interview, Melanie Sloan emphasized that Mediu and his ilk can enter Washington thanks only to the Family’s clout, which blends the powers of church and state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have a history of dealing with foreigners of questionable repute who have a lot of money,” Sloan says. “They lend legitimacy to these characters by introducing them to U.S. government officials outside of State Department protocol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without backing from the quasi-official Prayer Breakfast, it’s unlikely Mediu ever would have met with the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and powerful senators and congressmen — all in one week, and while facing an impending indictment and allegations that he had conspired against the U.S. Army. But he did meet with them. And he can literally thank God for that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefbrandon@gmail.com (Penn Bullock)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271106474083"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/observations/2010/04/does_money_lessen_pain.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/424fa2c6aefacfec</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Does Money Lessen Pain?</title><published>2010-04-12T14:40:54Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T14:40:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/I3T44dOjdzQ/does_money_lessen_pain.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/observations/2010/04/does_money_lessen_pain.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">While reading through the science news headlines today, I came across a very interesting one from the Telegraph: "Handling cash 'better at killing pain than aspirin', study claims."

Intrigued, I sought out the paper mentioned in the article. It turns out it wasn't published recently at all - it was published last year in June. Of course, they were probably fooled by the fact that the University of Minnesota just published a press release on it. Regardless, the real question is whether money was truly more effective than painkillers at preventing pain. So what did the researchers find?

Both photographed at the Bronx Zoo.

It never fails. Whenever I visit a zoo's African wild dog exhibit someone inevitably asks "Are those hyenas?", and when I visit spotted hyena enclosures I often hear the question "Are those dogs?" These carnivores, known to scientists as Lycaon pictus and Crocuta crocuta (respectively), are only distant cousins, but the vague similarities shared between them often cause people to confuse one with the other.

There are a few quick and dirty ways to tell them apart. Spotted hyenas, as their name indicates, have a coat flecked with solid spots while the fur of each African wild dog carries a distinctive pattern of caramel, white, black, and dark brown. They are also shaped a little bit differently; hyenas are stockier, with relatively shorter midsections, while African wild dogs have a longer, more lanky appearance. And, if you are really an astute observer, you might notice that African wild dogs lack something your more familiar domestic dogs have; a fifth toe, or dewclaw, on the forelimb. It is thought that this loss might be an adaptation which allows African wild dogs to more efficiently run after prey over long distances, but when did this happen, and how do these canids relate to other dogs?

In that post, based on recent evidence, Travis concluded:"...in overweight and obese individuals, exercise (in the form of walking) has little or no association with injury or illness."

However, there still remains the issue of various musculo-skeletal problems which appear to happen at a high rate among those individuals carrying excess weight, independent of their activity level.Knee and hip osteoarthritis, for example, are quite commonly listed as a frequent medical consequence of obesity. A new study from our neck of the woods (Ontario, Canada) sought to determine the effect of weight status on the age at which individuals elected to have knee or hip replacement surgery.

She was spouting some accommodationist nonsense on NPR, and I petulantly turned off the car radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before cracking the book, I did a quick Google search, and this video came up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/12/krista-tippett-on-science-and-faith/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/hlg7CLWKsYk/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not promising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;@4:50 “I actually interviewed an Australian astrobiologist recently  for a program we’re doing on the religious sensibility of Albert  Einstein, and he says that theology is the midwife of science. And he  points out that in Western culture, and even names that we wrongly think  of as being opposed to religion—Galileo, Newton, even Darwin himself,  and into the twentieth century, somebody like Albert Einstein— you know,  especially Darwin, Newton, and Galileo: they thought that what they  were doing with science was understanding God better. They went from the  premise that, you know, the Americans you just heard a moment ago,  hold, that God created the world, that they believed that Nature, that  the created world, is the works of God, and in understanding nature and  the world as it is, they could understand the mind of God. And that is  an impulse that even today is consonant with the way many scientists  approach their work, whether they are kind of traditionally religious or  not. And that’s being lost in the way that science is being set up as  an enemy to religion. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I know a lot of scientists, but have never encountered a single one who seems motivated by the desire to understand the nature of God. Maybe Newton did that, but &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; not Einstein and Darwin.  To claim that those two guys did science as a way of getting inside God’s mind is the most blatant form of factual distortion in the service of accommodationism.  &lt;em&gt;Of course &lt;/em&gt;science is an enemy of religion, for its method is doubt, empirical testing, and the rejection of ideas for which there’s no evidence.  If religious people practiced their faith using those principles, in a very short time there would be no religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this the kind of stuff I can expect in her book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_____&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, no, not a hippopotamus. Too artifactual sounding. Too human-made sounding. More like the siren, like an old fashioned air raid siren. And as I listened, not only did it get louder, but I had the distinct impression that it was getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.datenight-movie.com/#/home"&gt;Date Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;’s Tina Fey and Steve Carell are a little too funny and good-looking to convince us that they are ordinary New Jersey couple Claire and Phil Foster, but partners going on “date night” to spice things up is pretty believable. Their movie opened nationwide last Friday, and while we hope to never have a date night quite as “exciting” as Claire and Phil’s (though we wouldn’t mind if James Franco were involved), we do wonder if there’s something to the idea of scheduling a regular time to do something special with your someone special. After all, even Barack and Michelle Obama make time in their busy schedules for dressy, romantic &lt;a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/05/obamas-date-night-in-new-york-.html"&gt;date nights&lt;/a&gt;. Do you believe in scheduling a “date night” to keep things stimulating, or do you think they just add another pre-planned element to a lackluster routine? Take our poll.&lt;/p&gt;

suicide attempt using homeopathic sleeping pills by South Africa’s Owen
Swart.  Not to give away any spoilers or anything, but the fact that
it’s a 6 video series is a bit telling.&lt;/p&gt;

method).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile he embraces the likes of J. B. Handley and turns a blind eye to his shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to examine people like Higgs the way doctors study disease –
there is pathology there, and by understanding it perhaps we can get
better at fighting it. I tried the “seek common ground and
understanding” approach over e-mail with Higgs, but he was not
interested. Maybe my observations gave him a moment of pause. I doubt
it, but I try never to give up on optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271100240242"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/04/april-17-in-san-franciscos-att-park-ed-rev-for-those-who-learn-differently.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3ba12f506c10bc9c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Education: Independent And Private Schools"/><category term="Education: Public Schools"/><category term="Learning Disabilities"/><title type="html">April 17 in San Francisco's ATT Park: Ed Rev, for those who learn differently</title><published>2010-04-12T17:54:24Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T17:54:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/04/april-17-in-san-franciscos-att-park-ed-rev-for-those-who-learn-differently.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From  the excellent &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-4959-Special-Education-Examiner%7Ey2010m4d11-Annual-event-welcomes-all-who-learn-differently--April-17-at-ATT-Park"&gt;Robin Hanson, the  Special Education Examiner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Education Revolution or Ed Rev as it is nicknamed, is a wonderful event

Grothe, Bruce M. Hood discusses why so many people believe in the  supernatural despite the lack of evidence, explaining that it may have  something to do with how our brains are wired. He draws a distinction  between religious supernatural beliefs, which are culturally determined,  and more universal secular supernatural beliefs such as mind-body  dualism and causality. He explains how such magical thinking may be  socially advantageous and how even skeptics engage in supersense  thinking. He also warns against the unscrupulous individuals who take  advantage of what is a natural disposition in the majority of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derek and Swoopy discuss the growth of skeptical podcasting in the  five years since they founded the influential podcast Skepticality. They  talk about how hosting their show opened new opportunities for  them.They explore the extent to which skeptical podcasts foster  insularity within the skeptical movement, or succeed as outreach tools  reaching new audiences for science and critical thinking, and the  influence of such podcasts on the growth of local skeptics community  groups. And they talk about the future of skepticism and skeptical  digital outreach. Listen &lt;a href="http://www.forgoodreason.org/derek_and_swoopy_five_years_of_skepticality"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It covers just about the whole range of faux "issues" they pretend to have something about which to say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm becoming more and more of the mindset that, rather than focusing on how dumb the Tea Party thing is, we ought to try and remember what the root causes are of this populist vomit-rage.  In the quote from 2008, Obama was referring to towns in the Midwest suffering from staggering job losses.  While cynical GOP strategists, religion, and Beckian journalism have plenty to do with the Tea Party movement, in many ways the root cause is frustration with the lack of economic opportunity.  Ironically, one might even argue that the Tea Party phenomenon might never have emerged if more liberal policies had been adopted throughout the country...!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what does this mean in practice?  I'm not sure, but one thing it reminds me of is why it's not okay to let the Red States twist in the wind, hoisted by their own petard.  It bothers me when people say things like, "Well, who would want to live in Alabama anyway?  Fuck 'em."  First of all, children growing up in Alabama don't have a choice.  Other people may not have much of a practical choice due to job or family situations, etc.  And this is just another reason:  When any state neglects the welfare of their citizenry, it breeds the kind of populist outrage that fuels movements like the Tea Party -- and that influences politics on a national level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Alabama doesn't take care of their own people, then pissed-off Alabamians are going to march on the capital and demand that New York stop trying to look after their citizens too.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-3094560940840369738?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271099447766"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/04/in_soviet_russia_your_vote_det.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f3ad1799ed99cdd9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">In Soviet Russia, your vote determined your job; In America...</title><published>2010-04-12T18:31:11Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T18:31:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/GmFnnqAESzo/in_soviet_russia_your_vote_det.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/04/in_soviet_russia_your_vote_det.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the Soviet Union, party membership was everything.  Your job, your access to food and other consumer goods, and your apartment all depended on your standing with the party.  And votes were simply a tool to provide a patina of legitimacy.  No one who liked warm weather voted against the Party.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many advantages of the protections provided by the U.S. constitution is that we generally cannot be hired or fired based on our personal or political beliefs.  We also get to elect our leaders frequently.  So it should be with a great sense of irony that various teabagger groups shout and stomp about the US becoming a socialist regime, while simultaneously&lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/35338.html"&gt; threatening armed rebellion&lt;/a&gt; for&lt;a href="http://teablogging.net/2009/07/16/republican-candidate-calls-for-armed-uprising-at-tea-party-rally/"&gt; not getting their way in an election&lt;/a&gt;.  And it is with disgust and disdain that I view professionals punishing others based on their vote or their political views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20001984-503544.html"&gt;a physician fired an employee for voting for Obama&lt;/a&gt;, that was---I assume---a clearly illegal act.  It was also immoral.  But it has nothing to do with medical ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when a doctor refuses to see patients based on their politics, this is a gross violation of medical ethics.  In fact, it's hard to think of a precept of medical ethics &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; violated by this sort of behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;This has become an issued due to the&lt;a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-04-02/news/os-mount-dora-doctor-tells-patients-go-aw20100401_1_health-care-doctor-patients" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt; widely-publicized story&lt;/a&gt; of Dr. Jack Cassell, a Florida urologist who posted a sign on his office door which said, &amp;quot;If you voted for Obama...seek urologic care elsewhere. Changes to your healthcare begin right now, not in four years.&amp;quot; The doctor claims that he hasn&amp;#39;t turned anyone away, but that is irrelevant. The only person&amp;#39;s needs being served by the sign are his own---whether it is to make a political point, humiliate others, or who-knows-what-else. (The statement that he hasn&amp;#39;t turned anyone away is irrelevant for a number of reasons: first, he can&amp;#39;t know this, as the sign acts as his proxy, and second, even if no one leaves, they can be made to feel very uncomfortable.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;As a physician, Dr. Cassell&amp;#39;s first duty is to serve his patients.  He should not be forced to see any particular patient, but neither should he abandon patients or turn them away for arbitrary reasons.  Dr. Cassell is well within his constitutional and professional rights to choose whom he treats and what he says, but using patients to satisfy one&amp;#39;s own needs is both unethical and pathetic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;Basic medical ethical principles, such as beneficence, non-maleficence, and dignity dictate that we not use patients to make our own political statements.  Dr. Cassell&amp;#39;s sign may deter current and future patients from seeking needed care, and may lead to abandonment, as patients of his who see the sign may feel unwelcome.  This may lead to feelings of humiliation and delay of needed care.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;Behavior such as Cassell&amp;#39;s is unconscionable.  He should save his political activism for the ballot box and teabagger meetings.  Punishing patients for their vote seems so----Soviet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/GmFnnqAESzo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271099096215"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23277">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bd74ba761059974e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">The Religious Contortionist</title><published>2010-04-12T19:00:15Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T19:00:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/12/the-religious-contortionist/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It would be great if religious people could &lt;a href="http://www.nakedpastor.com/archives/5018"&gt;break out&lt;/a&gt; of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've only recently begun teaching in a big state university, maybe tier C in the field I'm in.  I'm in a quandary as to how to manage pressure to pass students who are under performing.  The first semester, I had to lower the passing to a basically ridiculous level and the college still inquired why so many failed (10 %).  Now, I'm again feeling pressure to pass students who do not deserve to pass.  I'm getting very disillusioned by this type of practice.  Grade inflation seems to be so common that I even have students who think that a 60 is a B.  I'm wondering what your thoughts are regarding this, and would appreciate any suggestions you might have.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to grade fairly is one of those perennial questions with which academics struggle, and it would be sufficiently challenging even without pressure from students or administrative types.  However, as my correspondent notes, there is also pressure from students and administrative types who want academics to change their grading methodology, so that they will get the grade they want for the amount of effort they are willing to put in, or so that the department or college will pass "enough" of the student population to satisfy the powers that be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the question of how to properly calibrate a grading scheme and then move on to the related question of how to defend that grading scheme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/04/ask_dr_free-ride_my_college_wa.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/04/ask_dr_free-ride_my_college_wa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/cQVoCrJNXFo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271098410015"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=174210">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f95f3f2a9580566</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="corporate blacklist"/><category term="corporate responsibility"/><category term="Corporate Responsibility Magazine"/><category term="New-York-Times"/><title type="html">Blacklisted: Corporate Responsibility Magazine’s April/May</title><published>2010-04-12T14:27:07Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T14:27:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/174210/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blacklisted:&lt;/strong&gt; Corporate Responsibility Magazine’s April/May issue, coming out this week, will issue a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/business/media/12mag.html?ref=business"&gt;“blacklist” of the least transparent corporations&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am proudly and unapologetically blasphemous, and I encourage other people to join my heretical ranks all the time. If ID is blasphemous, it&amp;#39;s the first element of their program that I can approve of — anything that weakens the grip of faith has got something good going for it. It&amp;#39;s simply not a problem. It can&amp;#39;t even be a problem for a religious program in America — we&amp;#39;re a pluralist society, and &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; is blasphemous to someone. The mild-mannered theistic evolutionists think ID is blasphemy, but so does Ken Ham…and Ham also thinks the theistic evolutionists are heretics, apostates, and blaspheming bastards who defile the Holy Word of God. Lutherans are blaspheming Catholics. Baptists blaspheme against the sacred doctrines of Calvin. Every time you pull out a cell phone, you&amp;#39;re insulting the Amish way of life, and Ron Jeremy is glad the Shakers died out. So? We can&amp;#39;t use and absence of blasphemy as a criterion for truth and accuracy. It&amp;#39;s silly to bring it up. And, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2010/04/is_id_blasphemous.php"&gt;Jason points out&lt;/a&gt;, the same religious arguments applied against ID are equally valid when aimed at theistic evolutionists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also troubled by this whole position of Faith Project Director. Peter Hess is almost certainly a nice guy, and he&amp;#39;s on the side of evolution, or he wouldn&amp;#39;t be working at NCSE…but why is the NCSE now actively engaged in the business of promoting Faith Projects, and why do they have a professional Bible thumper to pontificate on hair-splitting matters of dogma? They&amp;#39;re all wrong. Having a theologian on staff to tell us that some of them are more wrong than others on matters sacerdotal, from his position which is just as shaky as everyone else&amp;#39;s, seems to me to be so bad that it falls into the category of not even wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s the matter of this paper. It is titled, &amp;quot;CREATION, DESIGN AND EVOLUTION: CAN SCIENCE DISCOVER OR ELIMINATE GOD?&amp;quot;, and the answer Hess gives is no: &amp;quot;The scientific quest for the designer behind the veil of nature ultimately fails—science can neither discover nor eliminate God.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s easy, then. God is irrelevant. These guys always seem to use &amp;quot;science&amp;quot; as a word demarcating a very narrow field of endeavor involving white lab coats, test tubes, and strangely colored solutions, but it isn&amp;#39;t. Science is simply a process for examining the world, and anyone can do it, even if you do&amp;#39;t have a lab coat. If something has an effect or influence, you can try to examine it using the tools of science — so when someone announces that gods cannot be detected by observation or experiment, they are saying they don&amp;#39;t matter and don&amp;#39;t do anything, which is exactly what this atheist has been saying all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the strange thing about the whole argument. When I was on my daily walk today, I was surrounded by a million mysteries: what's in that house? How was this sidewalk made? What signaling molecules are moving through that tree to trigger new bud formation? What insect was making that odd sound? Why was my left ankle sore this morning? Were there any neutrinos whizzing through me right now? How did that boulder get on that lot? You get the idea. We're immersed in a piece of the universe and we don't know a lot about it, but we're seeing these curious eruptions of natural phenomena all around us, and we can pursue them if we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the obnoxious part of religion, and why it&amp;#39;s in conflict with science. Science is the world of Let&amp;#39;s-Find-Out, while religion is always the land of You-Can&amp;#39;t-Know-That. One tries to build fences around sacred domains, the other has great fun knocking them down. Go ahead, pretend that your god is safe and hidden away where scientists can&amp;#39;t poke at him with needles or measure his emanations with widgets that go beep or photograph his spoor and stick it in a chromatograph — we don&amp;#39;t care. The only way he can escape our probes is if he doesn&amp;#39;t exist…so the more you protest that he is absolutely indetectible, the more we nod and say, &amp;quot;Then you&amp;#39;re admitting that he isn&amp;#39;t even vapor.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denying god is yet more blasphemy, isn't it? That's why I'm in trouble. Of course, claiming that god has no measurable influence in the world is probably also blasphemy, which puts Peter Hess in the theological clink, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what may come as a surprise for some, Huckabee agreed that an atheist could be fit to serve as president. &lt;span&gt;"I'd rather have an honest atheist than a dishonest religious person,"&lt;/span&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't worry. He didn't mean it. He's actually just doing some sneaky sniping at Mitt Romney. He continues with a clarification of what he really meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's better to have a person who says, 'Look, I just don't believe, and that's where my honest position happens to be. I'm frankly more OK with that than a person who says, 'Oh, I am very much a Christian. I very much love God.' And then they live as if they are atheists, as if they have no moral groundings at all. That's more troubling."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think it's nice if a person believes in God. I'd hate to think somebody was making decisions who thought that he couldn't be higher than himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See? He still equates atheism with a complete lack of moral grounding. He's still a slimebag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/mike_huckabee_endorses_my_cand.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/yALAs8_qTtQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271097645558"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3036070768804518015.post-1917868971334697118">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/37b44c3abeaf7bab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Exchange Screening of Obselidia with Film Director Diane Bell</title><published>2010-04-12T18:08:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-15T13:55:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.nap.edu/~r/x-changefiles/~3/cwu4BQ1gp4g/exchange-screening-of-obselidia-with.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/feeds/1917868971334697118/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2010/04/exchange-screening-of-obselidia-with.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2010/04/exchange-screening-of-obselidia-with.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/blog" type="html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/S8NlC2tQyxI/AAAAAAAAALo/TuELz7qB1f8/s1600/Obselidia_Move_Poster.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;width:210px;height:320px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/S8NlC2tQyxI/AAAAAAAAALo/TuELz7qB1f8/s320/Obselidia_Move_Poster.jpeg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Science and Entertainment Exchange, along with Cultural Programs of the National Academy of Sciences, sponsored a special advance screening of the film Obselidia in Washington, D.C., this past Tuesday (April 6th).  The film was directed by Diane Bell and played at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival where it won of the Alfred P. Sloan Prize - an award given to a feature film that has science or technology as a major theme or a scientist, engineer, or mathematician as a main character in the storyline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obselidia explores our attitudes toward technology and how we think about a future that’s bound to be severely altered by environmental change.  In the film, George, an encyclopedia salesman, shuns new technology.  After the Internet wipes out his livelihood, he endeavors to write The Obselidia, a compendium of everything that is obsolete - including love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, George meets and befriends Sophie, a beautiful cinema projectionist who works at a silent movie theater.  She feels that nothing is obsolete as long as someone loves it.  The two travel to Death Valley to interview a reclusive scientist who predicts that 80 percent of the world’s population will be obliterated by irreversible climate change by the year 2100.  George and Sophie must then grapple with a difficult question: if the world is not going to exist tomorrow, how are they going to live today?  Obselidia offers a rare and humane lens through which we can view a world increasingly preoccupied with and inhabited by extinction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/S8NmbUWubEI/AAAAAAAAALw/MEzerWr034Y/s1600/IMG_9356.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;width:320px;height:214px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/S8NmbUWubEI/AAAAAAAAALw/MEzerWr034Y/s320/IMG_9356.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After the screening, the audience enjoyed a panel discussion centered on the film’s portrayal of science and technology, moderated by Kevin Finneran, Editor-in-Chief of Issues in Science and Technology.  Panelists included Diane Bell, earth scientist Tony Busalacchi, and Daniel Sarewitz, director of the Consortium on Science, Policy, and Outcomes, based at Arizona State University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were a wide variety of questions touched on during the panel.  The discussion underlined many common themes that cut to the core of the mission of The Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange: the intersection of science and media, the implications of scientific achievement, the portrayal of scientists in film, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much of the conversation centered on the idea that although we often celebrate the benefits of new technology - iPad anyone? -  we seldom acknowledge what we’ve lost when we embrace technology.   We have an obsession with what's new, but we don't think about what we give up when we stop doing things the old way.  Daniel Sarewitz specifically pointed out that the film brought to the surface the idea that technological advancement is as much about what is cool and new as it is about giving up the past, the death of old ways, and loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Director Diane Bell also shed light on many interesting aspects of the film's production and her research. When asked if her climate scientist character, who was an iconic representation portrayed as one of the first people to sound the alarm about climate change, was based on famed climate scientist James Hansen, Diane responded that she based her character not on Hanson, but on James Lovelock, founder of the Gaia Theory.  As we often find at The Exchange, science and scientists can inspire great art, like the movie OBSELIDIA, just as Diane Bell's film inspires everyone who sees it to think more deeply about all that technology has to give, and what it may take away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Qhly0dt8Fj0%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-1917868971334697118?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ll be back writing later next week – feel free to give feedback as always.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly fifteen years ago, I began my first degree… in Agriculture. This always astonishes students, who expect their English teacher wouldn’t be able to give advice on Biology homework nor be able to rattle off the taxonomic ranks of ‘Kingdom-Phylum-Division-Class-Order-Family-Genus-Species’ on command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed my major for several reasons but did continue my interest in science via my Philosophy degree, Education and Psychology studies. Thus I learned about Darwin’s contribution to taxonomy… and Leibniz’s unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that imagination and passion were a common element in the desire to accurately ascertain and classify the species of the world… and also could lead to being directed towards the credulous paths of hoaxed creations and cryptozoology, as well as artistic interpretation of what a new species could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="lots of creative links" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~misaak/taxonomy/taxEtym.html#people"&gt;Creativity in biological nomenclature&lt;/a&gt; was something I learned about in the mid-90s, when I heard of a news report on a beetle named after &lt;a title="darth vader" href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/darthvader/"&gt;Darth Vader&lt;/a&gt;. A genuine article, a newly-discovered beetle; indeed the product of research and study… so-called for his shiny head with a slit across the front, like the Sith Lord’s helmet – &lt;a title="Darth Vader Star Wars" href="http://www.starwars.com/kids/explore/reallife/f20060202/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agathidium vaderi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t stop there though. What about a spider called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="db" href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/Invertebrates/whataname.cfm"&gt;Draculoides bramstokeri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;? Or the sand-crab &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="ag" href="http://fujukan.lib.u-ryukyu.ac.jp/en/spec/details.php?id=RUMF-ZC-00515&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;Albunea groeningi&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; named after Matt ‘The Simpsons’ Groening? A big winner in terms of nomenclature nods would have to be &lt;a title="frank zappa" href="http://www.zappa.com/"&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt;, who has at least &lt;em&gt;five &lt;/em&gt;different species named after him… one because the orb-weaver spider, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="zappa" href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/andymurkin/Resources/MusicRes/ZapRes/spider.html"&gt;Pachygnatha zappa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, features abdominal marking that resembles his mustache. Oh, and &lt;a title="HH" href="http://www.playboy.com"&gt;Playboy &lt;/a&gt;founder Hugh Hefner has… yeah, you guessed it, an &lt;a title="rabbit" href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Sylvilagus_palustris.html"&gt;endangered rabbit&lt;/a&gt; named after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe like &lt;a title="Red Dwarf reference Rimmer" href="http://www.reddwarf.co.uk"&gt;Rimmer of Red Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, you promote the classics of ‘&lt;a title="Mozart" href="http://www.mozartproject.org/"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt;, Mendelssohn and &lt;a title="motorhead official site" href="http://www.imotorhead.com/"&gt;Motorhead&lt;/a&gt;‘ – at least three species named after Mozart, like the &lt;em&gt;Mozartella beethoveni&lt;/em&gt; (an encyrtid wasp) – and indeed, even Motorhead’s Lenny Kilmister, with a 428-million year old fossil polychaete named after him in 2006 : &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="link" href="http://harderbeat.com/archive/nov06/html/Extremities.html"&gt;Kalloprion kilmisteri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often get skinks brought into the house by my helpful cats, although I’ve never inquired as to whether it’s a  ‘&lt;a title="skinky sexy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroticoscincus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eroticoscincus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘ or the ‘&lt;em&gt;sexy skink&lt;/em&gt;‘ that they’re trying to show me… and since &lt;a title="tolkien" href="http://www.tolkiensociety.org/"&gt;JRR Tolkien’s&lt;/a&gt; birthday is coming up on the 3rd of January, you might like to check out &lt;a title="amphipod JRR Tolkein" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucothoe_(amphipod)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leucothoe tolkieni,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an amphipod named after him, amongst dozens of species based on his characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal favourite? &lt;a title="baru darrowi" href="http://podblack.com/archive.amol.org.au/discovernet/alcoota/baru.asp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baru darrowi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a large fossilised Australian crocodile – named after Paul Darrow who played &lt;a title="Blake&amp;#39;s Seven" href="http://www.cultv.co.uk/blakes7.htm"&gt;Avon in Blake’s Seven&lt;/a&gt; – pretty apt considering his idea of &lt;a title="blake&amp;#39;s seven quotes" href="http://www.katspace.org/fandom/b7/b7bio"&gt;diplomacy&lt;/a&gt; would well match that of a crocodile…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s enough to give you genus-envy, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.wired.com/tableofmalcontents/images/unicornhoax.jpg" alt="WIRED Leibniz&amp;#39;s unicorn" width="225" height="286"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Such achievements, finding new species, naming them and being a part of the wonder of nature. It makes you then question – what about the fakes? Why do we allow ourselves to be fooled by perposterous claims of new species that push the boundaries of reality – &lt;a title="Unicorn fake" href="http://blog.wired.com/tableofmalcontents/2006/11/a_unicorn_skele.html"&gt;Leibniz’s unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, Phineas Taylor Barnum’s much-toted &lt;a title="F mermaid" href="http://www.thefeejeemermaid.com/"&gt;Feejee Mermaid&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a title="jackalope" href="http://www.sudftw.com/jackcon.htm"&gt;Jackalope&lt;/a&gt; (which I even saw for myself tucked away on the side stage during a &lt;a title="bowie in Perth" href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=UjiTow4Z1hc"&gt;David Bowie tour&lt;/a&gt;, as their special traveling mascot)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it’s to do with the promise of acclaim and wonder that comes with finding something new; as well as the profit and even sometimes amusement that is created – claims made in all honest hope, or deliberate hoax or even artistic interpretation that marries science, art and the fantastic. Of course, all of these can also teach us valuable lessons in regards to the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a lesson was produced by William Willers, who created the &lt;a title="Centaur of Volvos" href="http://notes.utk.edu/bio/unistudy.nsf/ed40209576f6c3198525667a00778ed9/78dff46a51a10457852563f0000529bc?OpenDocument"&gt;Centaur of Volos&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, from the bones of a human and a Shetland pony. This centaur creation is intended to be a teaching tool; biology professor &lt;a title="NG" href="http://eeb.bio.utk.edu/greenberg.asp"&gt;Dr Neil Greenberg&lt;/a&gt; and art professor Beauvais Lyons promote skepticism through displaying it at the &lt;a title="exhibit" href="http://www.lib.utk.edu/news/archives/exhibits/001421.html"&gt;University of Tennessee:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hoax is intended to draw attention to the mythological and poetic dimensions of science and history, and to remind students not to believe everything they see or read. “The Centaur Excavations at Volos” is staged like an authentic exhibition, depicting a “centaur” burial and a group of related ceramics. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’m an Australian, I often hear about Australian cryptozoological claims (especially from a few friends who live in the rural areas of the state) such as the &lt;a title="Yowie" href="http://www.yowiehunters.com/"&gt;Yowie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="thylacine claims" href="http://www.cryptozoology.com/cryptidsq/thylacine.php"&gt;surviving thylacines&lt;/a&gt;, which even led Steve Irwin to try to track some evidence of their survival. These are a great many&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.lintonandkay.com.au/images/dynamic/1171_normal.jpg" alt="Kangaroo bird" width="167" height="250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;world-wide examples of efforts to seek species that have never had any convincing proof for them or are feared extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, however, I was able to attend the traveling exhibition for &lt;a title="Dr Seuss" href="http://www.lintonandkay.com.au/exhibitions.asp"&gt;The Art of Dr Seuss,&lt;/a&gt; which revealed to me how the notion of ‘undiscovered species’ provokes artistic muses as well as credulous claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surreal artwork like ‘&lt;a title="girl and unicorn" href="http://www.lintonandkay.com.au/images/dynamic/1164_normal.jpg"&gt;Every Girl Needs a Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;‘ and ‘&lt;a title="pink tufted beast" href="http://www.lintonandkay.com.au/images/dynamic/1180_normal.jpg"&gt;Pink Tufted Small Beast in a Night Landscape&lt;/a&gt;‘ … and er, the ‘&lt;a title="martini bird" href="http://www.lintonandkay.com.au/images/dynamic/1174_normal.jpg"&gt;Martini Bird&lt;/a&gt;‘ clearly nod to the fantastic imaginings that come from the ‘what if’ about species. The basis of these quirky species ‘hoaxes’ in the name of art come from Theodore ‘Dr Seuss’ Geisel’s use of animal bones and horns in his ‘&lt;a title="unorthodox taxidermy" href="http://www.drseussart.com/taxi.html"&gt;Unorthodox Taxidermy&lt;/a&gt;‘ series. An important element were the donated beaks, antlers and horns of deceased animals by his father, who was a superintendent of the Forest Park Zoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence items like the ‘Kangaroo Bird’ and the ’semi-normal Green-Lidded Fawn’, made of old bones, antlers and cast resin. They nearly seem to have walked out of one of the children’s books he created… probably chewing the pages as they go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.lintonandkay.com.au/images/dynamic/1195_normal.jpg" alt="semi normal fawn" width="182" height="214"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, a website also exists that &lt;a title="Gary Arseneau" href="http://podblack.com/garyarseneau.blogspot.com/2007/05/art-of-dr-seuss-coverup.html"&gt;questions the veracity of these Seuss-specials&lt;/a&gt; in themselves, with a lengthy &lt;a title="Rodin Chaser article" href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+curious+fixation+of+the+Rodin+Chaser:+a+museum&amp;#39;s+proactive...-a0153629078"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of checking out whether artistic pieces are ‘authentic created-during-the-artist’s lifetime’ items! Debate over what makes them ‘real’ revolves around how each sculpture features an ‘Authorized Engraved Signature’, identifying the work as an ‘exclusively authorized limited edition commissioned by the Seuss Estate’. Is art of fake species still art, whether created by the original artist or not? Is a ‘fake’ fake fake? Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, recently I was told of the &lt;a title="link" href="http://www.thefeejeemermaid.com/"&gt;New York artist Juan Cabana&lt;/a&gt; who actively creates hoax Feejee mermaids, based on &lt;a title="history of Feejee Mermaid" href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/Feejee_Mermaid/"&gt;Barnam’s brainchild&lt;/a&gt;, and sells them – with unknown persons taking photo of his art on shorelines, resulting in a newspaper &lt;a title="feejee mermaid mistake" href="http://www.thefeejeemermaid.com/mexicomermaid.htm"&gt;reporting erroneously&lt;/a&gt; how his art ‘washed up’ as evidence of a new species! An inspired fake with a faked-finding creating hoaxed headlines? Getting dizzy yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific value of finding a new species is unquestioned – the ’specialness’ involved, however, can lead to non-scientific goals. Yet I also think that the artistic and the historical value we gain from the study of pseudo-species and the continuing search for the missing link / hidden creature / brand new mutation that may take us where no label has gone before…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… are nothing when compared to the value of saving daffodils from being eaten by fake animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that in the distant past — like, a billion years ago — liquid water was abundant on Mars. We also know that water currently exists on Mars in the form of ice, sometimes just below the surface (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/01/12/mars-craters-reveal-ice/"&gt;where even small meteor impacts can reveal it&lt;/a&gt;). But can there still be &lt;em&gt;liquid&lt;/em&gt; water flowing on Mars, even if only for a very, very short time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe. Just maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010446_1255"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/hirise_russell_gullies.jpg" alt="hirise_russell_gullies" title="hirise_russell_gullies" width="610" height="458"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010446_1255"&gt;This HiRISE image&lt;/a&gt; shows a small region of a Martian crater named Russel (click to access much bigger versions of it). There are a lot of sand dunes in it, and as you can see in the lower left, many gullies as well. These gullies were obviously carved by &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; moving downslope. Sometimes, these gullies can form due to the presence of dry ice: frozen carbon dioxide, which is abundant on Mars. In the summer, as temperatures warm, the dry ice turns into a gas, dislodging material and letting it roll downhill. It’s thought that quite a few gullies on Mars are formed this way (as well as &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/08/martian-avalanche-crashes-the-party/"&gt;very dramatic avalanches&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these Russell Crater gullies are different. They do seem to form at higher elevations, near the tops of dunes, as you’d expect. But there are also &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_011580_1255"&gt;weird dark spots&lt;/a&gt; near these locations, which are poorly understood. The gullies seem to be constrained in their width; they don’t get broader downslope. Mind you, these are super-hi-res images; &lt;em&gt;the gullies shown here are only a few meters across&lt;/em&gt;, if even that! You could easily hop across them if you were strolling across the Red Planet’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gullies do widen where two tributaries meet, which is exactly as you’d expect from flowing material. That’s probably clearer in this picture of the same region but taken at a different time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uahirise.org/PSP_002337_1255"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/hirise_russell_gulliesbw.jpg" alt="hirise_russell_gulliesbw" title="hirise_russell_gulliesbw" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the really weird thing is how the gullies end. If this were just sand flowing because it was disrupted by dry ice evaporating, you’d expect to see a fan-shaped formation where the gullies terminate downslope. That’s the natural way flowing sand comes to a halt, by spreading out and forming those big triangles. &lt;em&gt;But these gullies don’t do that&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000783/"&gt;they just kinda stop&lt;/a&gt;. The gullies suddenly end in an abrupt narrowing of the trench, as if the material that’s moving is being reabsorbed by the surface underneath it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what you expect from solid material like sand flowing downhill. It’s far more like the way an actual flowing liquid behaves. Because of this &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2009GL042192.shtml"&gt;a team of German scientists studying this data&lt;/a&gt; think this may be more evidence that water can exist as a liquid on the surface of Mars, at least for short periods, time enough to flow downhill a bit. So we’re talking seconds or minutes here, not years, but still. Holy Haleakala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Edited to add: I neglected to mention originally that the length of these gullies has been seen to grow between the times the images were taken, meaning that whatever is flowing down these dunes is doing so &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;. This isn't some long-ago phenomenon; it happened a few weeks ago!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid water on the surface of Mars can’t stick around long; even at those low temperatures it will boil away from the low atmospheric pressure, or freeze rapidly. So having any liquid at all is really pretty amazing. But it raises lots of other questions, not the least of which are where does it come from, and why the heck is it liquid at all? You’d expect the water under the surface, if that’s what’s causing this, to be frozen; we see lots of that on Mars. So why is this liquid? Did something happen to liquify it (and it’s a pretty short list of what could do that), or is it liquid already (like in an underground aquifer or a hot spring) and just happened to break through the surface to flow for a short, glorious time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to know for sure is to keep looking. These images are a red flag for scientists, an alarm raised that we need to keep digging around, to keep our eyes open, &lt;em&gt;and to pay attention to what we’re seeing&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a whole lot that Mars is trying to tell us. All we have to do is listen.&lt;/p&gt;

Wild Dog crawled into the Cave and laid his head on the Woman's lap... And the Woman said, "His name is not Wild Dog any more, but the First Friend."

--Just So Stories, Rudyard Kipling.

Archaeological evidence indicates that dogs were already a part of human society around the end of the Ice Age. Small dog skeletons have been unearthed in human communities as far back as 6- to 12-thousand years ago in Europe, the Middle East, and China. The jawbone of a domestic dog was found in a late Paleolithic grave in Germany, and dated to around 14 thousand years ago. And there is the famous site at Ein Mallaha (Eynan, in Hebrew), in Northern Israel where an elderly human and a 4-5 month old puppy were buried together, 10- to 12-thousand years ago.

Figure 1: From the site at Ein Mallaha. The person's left hand is placed on the body of a 4-5 month old puppy.

Some evidence exists that dogs were the first animals to be domesticated, and until now, humans have only succeeded in domesticating around 20 different animal species. Compared with those other species (such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows, horses, donkeys, and camels), only dogs (and to some extent, cats, though at the risk of alienating readers, I maintain that cats are evil) have established for themselves a social niche within human society. Dogs were not only bred for companionship; some dogs were bred for hunting, guarding, or herding. More recently, dogs have worked as service dogs or drug-sniffing dogs. The question remains: Why do dogs have such apparent psychological effects on humans?

I&amp;#39;ve masticated this point to a fine mush by now, but selection and neutral processes act in tandem. Mutational bias and drift matter. So often in the literature you find people arguing over whether something is an adaptation or a spandrel. This gets even more absurd when the structure in question is as massive as the human language capacity. For example, in the landmark Pinker &amp;amp; Bloom 1990 paper signalling the revival of evolutionary linguistics, you find awful sentences like:&amp;quot;The key point that blunts the Gould and Lewontin critique of adaptationism is that natural selection is the only scientific explanation of adaptive complexity.&amp;quot; [p.6; emphasis mine]First off, it&amp;#39;s kind of cute that a couple psychologists seem to think they can so easily outright dismiss a point made by evolutionary biologists. I mean, seriously, I find it adorable. On that note, I&amp;#39;m now gonna write a book chapter debunking generative linguistics, because, well, my buddy says they&amp;#39;re wrong. I wonder how much Pinker&amp;#39;s evolutionary views have been shaped by Dawkins et al. Their camp is rather influential outside evolutionary biology, and while many claim that panadaptationism is a strawman -- and even in biology that point is debatable -- outside evolutionary biology, panadaptationism is alive and well. Part of the reason is that adaptationist stories are written in popular books, while pluralistic approaches largely remain hidden in the likes of Molecular Biology &amp;amp; Evolution, Biology Direct and Journal of Molecular Evolution. Researchers working in applied evolutionary fields have likely never heard of them.Back to Pinker &amp;amp; Bloom, first off it&amp;#39;s quite a tautology to claim that adaptive complexity evolves through adaptation. Well, yes, you JUST labelled it adaptive. In the immortal words of 4chan, long cat is loooooong. Casting that aside, they&amp;#39;ve falled for a false dichotomy. You would think someone as smart as Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom wouldn&amp;#39;t fall for it. But they did. Why does it have to be one or the other? Why adaptation or spandrel? Especially when we speak of highly complex systems -- is it not in the definition of complexity that they consist of multiple components? How likely is it that all of them are adaptive or neutral or maladaptive? Is it even remotely productive to reduce a system so drastically as to label it simply as an adaptation? What does that even mean, besides stating the obvious? &amp;#39;Adaptation&amp;#39; has got to be one of the more utterly useless terms in evolution biology, at least the way it&amp;#39;s abused today.Letting Pinker &amp;amp; Bloom speak further:&amp;quot;Adaptive complexity&amp;quot; describes any system composed of many interacting parts where the details of the parts&amp;#39; structure and arrangement suggest design to fulfill some function. The vertebrate eye is the classic example. The eye has a transparent refracting outer cover, a variable-focus lens, a light-sensitive layer of neural tissue lying at the focal plane of the lens, a diaphragm whose diameter changes with illumination level, muscles that move it in precise conjunction and convergence with those of the other eye, and elaborate neural circuits that respond to patterns defining edges, colors, motion, and stereoscopic disparity. It is impossible to make sense of the structure of the eye without noting that it appears as if it was designed for the purpose of seeing -- if for no other reason that the man-made tool for image formation, the camera, displays an uncanny resemblance to the eye. Before Darwin, theologians, notably William Paley, pointed to its exquisite design as evidence for the existence of a divine designer. Darwin showed how such &amp;quot;organs of extreme perfection and complication&amp;quot; could arise from the purely physical process of natural selection.&amp;quot; [p.6 cont&amp;#39;d]Holy fucking crap, argument from design, for selectionism! Impressive. Yes, you guys just totally pwned Gould with the vertebrate eye. He was unaware of its very existence. Eyes don&amp;#39;t preserve well in the fossil record, you see? Eyes look designed, therefore selection. Great. I&amp;#39;ll let them finish...&amp;quot;The essential point is that no physical process other than natural selection can explain the evolution of an organ like the eye.&amp;quot; [p.6]AFAIK, Gould never denied selection!!! He was a brilliant biologist who thoroughly understood evolution, unlike some recent drama queens. What Gould argues is that a) not everything is an adaptation and b) adaptation is neither the sole nor the most important &amp;#39;force&amp;#39; in evolution (nor is it actually a &amp;#39;force&amp;#39; of any sort...). Furthermore, while I am unaware of Gould&amp;#39;s opinions about The Eye, and am currently too lazy to research the topic, to me it seems highly implausible that the vertebrate eye evolved solely through selection. In fact, considering that selection is a purifying, not driving, &amp;#39;force&amp;#39; -- that is, selection simply removes the not sufficiently fit -- it is curious to see where Pinker &amp;amp; Bloom think the &amp;#39;material&amp;#39; for the selective evolution of the eyes comes from. Surely they&amp;#39;re not insane enough to believe that the thing evolved entirely through point mutations each making the eye progressively slightly better and better and suddenly, veeeery gradually, ta-da: The Eye!On that note, I wonder if there&amp;#39;s a strong link between selectionism and gradualism. In a sense, one does kind of have to believe the above point-by-point scenario to explain how anything arises purely by selection. To anyone with the slightest inkling of how genes and genomes work, such a view is obviously absurd. Although considering how Dawkins has already enlightened us that molecular biologists may or may not be -reputable- biologists...I&amp;#39;m still amused by how remarkably cute it is of Pinker &amp;amp; Bloom to know so much about the details of evolution that they can make bold statements like the last sentence cited above. That&amp;#39;s one strong statement!tl;dr Some rather reputable and smart people still fall for the false dichotomy where something is either purely adaptive or purely &amp;#39;random&amp;#39;. Selection is not the sole source of order (Lynch 2007 PNAS; you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

One such symposium in the Healthy Minds Across America 2010 series was held in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 10, 2010.  Three internationally recognized researchers presented at the Tulsa symposium:  Helen Mayberg, Wayne Drevets and Robert Kowatch.  I will present some of my notes for these presentations over the next week.  This post will summarize the key points for Dr. Mayberg's presentation.Dr. Mayberg has been leading clinical research efforts to explore the potential for deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat severe depression.  The remission rates for standard antidepressant drugs is only about 30-40% pointing to the need for further novel treatment approaches.  Since DBS has become a relatively common treatment for Parkinson's disease, the technology and surgical experience already exists.  Moving to trials for treatment resistant depression involves identifying key neural circuits, preliminary surgical experiments and finally randomized, controlled trials of effectiveness.  Here is a synopsis of where DBS stands and the future research direction:Understanding the key role of brain circuits in emotional regulation dates back to the work of Papez in 1937Drevets, Mayberg and other have explored the dysfunction of the frontal and cingulate brain areas in depressionBrodmann's area 25 appears to be a key region in the circuitry abnormalities found in depressionArea 25 appears to be linked to antidepressant response across a variety of treatments--SSRI drugs, transcranial magnetic stimulation, ECT and vagal nerve stimulationThe stimulation device used in DBS is similar to that for Parkinson's diseaseThe device is implanted in the brain using MRI imaging for localizationVarious levels of stimulation are adjustable and controlled by a stimulator implanted in the chest (like a cardiac pacemaker)Patients are awake during surgery and are asked to respond to any emotional changes as stimulation is providedEarly patients have reported a sense of calmness when stimulation is turned on, but this is not universally reportedSix subjects received DBS in Canada and 17 subjects in U.S. at Emory University where Dr. Mayberg now worksEight of 11 subjects in the U.S. with long-term outcome information appear to have a significant positive responseDBS does not reduce the need for a psychosocial rehabilitation program to complement reduction of symptoms with the treatmentDBS research is progressing to a full-scale multicenter randomized clinical trial.  The clinical trial is called the BROADEN study.  A website has been set up for clinicians and patients who may be interested in learning more about this treatment.Dr. Mayberg emphasized that even if DBS is effective it will not be a treatment for all with depression.  It may provide more information about new drug development.  It is not without risk, but appears worthy of continued research.BROADEN Study Website Mayberg HS (2009).

Bruce Waltke is apparently a respected Old Testament scholar who &lt;i&gt;used&lt;/i&gt; to work at the Reformed Theological Seminary. &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2010-04-09-IHE-evangelical-endorsing-evolution-forced-out09_ST_N.htm"&gt;Not any more, though&lt;/a&gt;. He made the mistake of speaking in a BioLogos-sponsored seminar, saying that you could be a Christian, you could even believe the Bible was inerrant, and you could also believe in evolution. He was promptly shown the door, but not because what he said was irrational and incoherent, but because evolution is a proscribed subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Milton insisted that this provides for "a diversity" of views, he acknowledged that others are not permitted. Darwinian views, and any suggestion that humans didn't arrive on earth directly from being created by God (as opposed to having evolved from other forms of life) are not allowed, he said, and faculty members know this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tough one for me. The article is full of opinion from loons affiliated with BioLogos and the Templeton Foundation, organizations that I think are dangerous because they willfully poison science with superstition, so it hurts to agree with them at all, especially since they only endorse the compatibility of religion and science as a tool to smuggle lies into the search for truth…but they are right to condemn the closed-mindedness of these theologians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I also have a tiny amount of sympathy for the theologians. Their beliefs are so ridiculous (and I include the beliefs of Waltke and the followers of BioLogos and Templeton) that any introduction of reason and evidence-based thinking risks inducing the meltdown of the elaborately rickety structure of their belief. The RTS should be reassured, though: BioLogos and Templeton both show that at least some people's stupidity can perennially persist even in the face of facts that show they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/evangelical_scholar_expelled.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/VN81PRRtsro" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271090404750"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/sex_with_children_and_getting.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dba801325bfc4a1c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Sex with children AND getting rich?

Predatory sexual habits don&amp;#39;t seem to be his only legacy, though: &lt;a href="http://ncronline.org/news/accountability/money-paved-way-maciels-influence-vatican"&gt;follow the money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maciel left a trail of wreckage among his followers. Moreover, in a gilded irony for Benedict -- who prosecuted him despite pressure from Maciel's chief supporter, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Vatican secretary of state from 1990 to 2006 -- Maciel left an ecclesiastical empire with which the church must now contend. The Italian newsweekly L'espresso estimates the Legion's assets at 25 billion euros, with a $650 million annual budget, according to The Wall Street Journal .The order numbered 700 priests and 1,300 seminarians in 2008. On March 15 of this year, five bishops, called visitators, from as many countries, delivered their reports to the pope after a seven-month investigation. A final report is expected by the end of April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the whole article. The twisted sexual politics of Catholicism are just a small part of the corrupt whole: the accounts of the kickbacks and bribes — $5000 here, $10000 there, all adding up to a giant pot of cash — make the organization sound like just a gilded Mafia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, this video came to mind after reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not going to rehash what was said because we agreed that Steve would handle that task, and he &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4575"&gt;did so admirably last week&lt;/a&gt;. I agree with Steve that it was encouraging that Dr. Briggs apparently reads this blog and shares many of our concerns about NCCAM, the poor science that it has funded, and its use by promoters of unscientific medicine to promote their quackery. Most heartening of all was that she appeared to recognize how much CAM is infused with anti-vaccine beliefs and, worse, the promotion of these beliefs to the detriment of public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those positive reactions to what was a friendly but frank exchange of views notwithstanding, as we were sitting in a conference room next to Dr. Briggs’ office, I couldn’t help but wonder what the reaction of CAM promoters would be when they found out about this meeting. Now I know. John Weeks over at &lt;a href="http://theintegratorblog.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=650&amp;amp;Itemid=189"&gt;The Integrator Blog&lt;/a&gt; is not happy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novella’s posting reads like a Fox News interview: 95% his team’s point, then a brief NCCAM response. That Briggs asked for the meeting likely grew out of an early March conference at Yale at which Novella and she both participated. For this, she deserves the Barack Obama Big Tent award for her proven interest in sitting down with everyone, no matter which party affiliation or belief. (Some have said this was proven in early 2008 when &lt;a href="http://theintegratorblog.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=435&amp;amp;Itemid=189"&gt;Briggs met with me&lt;/a&gt;.) Arguably, Briggs takes her openness to dialogue further than the President. While Obama has kept arms length from leaders who call for the demise of the United States, Briggs has now met with those who have been lobbing bombs at her professional home for years, calling steadily for NCCAM’s destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our previous calls for the closing of a relatively small government institute because we view it as a poor use of taxpayer money is just like calling for the downfall of the United States government. Weeks clearly likes ridiculously overblown hyperbole. Interestingly enough, what appeared to upset Mr. Weeks the most was our discussion of homeopathy with Dr. Briggs. As &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4575"&gt;Steve put it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Briggs pointed out that it is not the job of the NCCAM to make final pronouncements about any treatment or medical claim. This is fair enough — but depends on context. The NCCAM is responsible for informing the public about so-called CAM modalities, and that should include a fair assessment of the science. If the science says a treatment is worthless, the NCCAM should not be afraid to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the NCCAM does determine what studies the NCCAM funds. The NCCAM accepts applications for research into homeopathy, but have not funded any in several years. What does this mean? Will they consider funding homeopathy research, and if so they are basically saying that they do not close the door on any medical modality, no matter how implausible or damned by negative evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they will not consider funding homeopathy, then why are they accepting grant applications for homeopathy research? This could be construed as disingenuous — perhaps a way to not fund homeopathy research without having to say they will not fund homeopathy research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve is correct. The NIH can never totally close the door on any line of research. It can, however, set priorities. It could decide that, given the homeopathically diluted prior plausibility of homeopathy based solely on physics, chemistry, and biology, homeopathy is not a priority. It can make sure that only reviewers with the relevant background in basic and clinical science — not “homeopathic” science — make up the study sections that review NCCAM grants. Indeed, I was much heartened to learn from Dr. Briggs that she had already moved peer review of CAM grants out of NCCAM-sponsored study sections and into regular standing NIH study sections run by the &lt;a href="http://cms.csr.nih.gov"&gt;Center for Scientific Review&lt;/a&gt;, which is where the vast majority of NIH grants are normally reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sort of counterpoint to our message, Mr. Weeks described in the same post a meeting that Dr. Briggs had with an “international homeopathic team.” Besides the amusement I felt at the word choice (is a homeopathic team a team so diluted that there is no one there?), the content itself was at the same time both disturbing and full of hilarious howlers. For instance, this passage concludes the section discussing our visit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, what would have been especially interesting is if Briggs’ scheduler crossed wires and the anti-NCCAM bloggers and homeopathic researchers had showed up for the same meeting time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t speak for Steve or Kimball, but I assure Mr. Weeks, that I probably would have enjoyed such an encounter thoroughly, although we would have been disappointed that we wouldn’t have been able to have the discussion that we had planned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how did the meeting between Dr. Briggs and the homeopaths go? This is how Mr. Weeks describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gahles, in a report to the Integrator, assessed that the meeting went “very well.” In her view, a presentation by Chaplin and Roy on chemistry and slides that “showed activity of homeopathic remedies on basophils and IgG” seemed to be particularly compelling to the NCCAM team in suggesting mechanism of action. Gahles underscored that conventional bio-markers seemed to be key in stimulating interest from the NCCAM team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a presentation on quantum physics and energy medicine seemed to be less useful in making in the case. At one point, an NCCAM team member who said he found the presentation “powerful” asked what the community of top scientists would think. Those in the meeting responded: “We are the leading scientists in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More like the leading pseudoscientists in the field. The thought of a homeopath claiming to be a leading scientist, particularly when it comes to physics and energy brings to mind &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2377"&gt;Dr. Charlene Werner’s tortured attempt&lt;/a&gt; to explain homeopathy through physics or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_physics_of_h.php"&gt;John Benneth’s attempt&lt;/a&gt; to explain it as “nanocrystalloids.” Maybe they’re the “leading scientists” of the field of homeopathy. Or perhaps Mr. Weeks means &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=448"&gt;Dana Ullman&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=35"&gt;Jacques Benveniste&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, it’s disturbing that an NCCAM team member apparently found the presentation “powerful.” Anyone who finds the clinical research on homeopathy “powerful” does not understand the true tenets of homeopathy and what pseudoscience they are. Such attitudes will tend to stand in the way of attempts to bring more rigorous science to the study of CAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Mr. Weeks has done us an unintentional favor — two, actually. First, he has demonstrated clearly that the CAM community wants its pseudoscience, not rigorous science, to guide NCCAM’s research efforts. This has only reinforced my appreciation of Dr. Briggs’ delicate situation. Every move she makes towards bringing rigorous science to the study of CAM is certain to enrage supporters of the purely pseudoscientific CAM modalities such as homeopathy, &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, and various “energy healing” modalities that are no better than faith healing under different belief systems than Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Weeks actually points out the heart of the conflict at the heart of NCCAM. Dr. Briggs is clearly trying to move NCCAM in a direction that we at SBM would approve of, namely towards a more drug discovery-oriented approach towards herbal and botanical remedies and various supplements, as well as the study of exercise and various relaxation techniques. After all, these are the most plausible remedies that fall under the general rubric of CAM, and a pharmacognosy approach is the most likely to yield useful information and scientific advances. But that is not what CAM proponents want. Indeed, they resent this approach, as Weeks demonstrates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the perverse pleasures that comes from the disposition of the NIH to hire NCCAM leaders who have no prior experience in alternative or integrative medicine is to think of the culture shock when they move from a zone of relative comfort — drug research on fractions of botanical  — into the far reaches such as homeopathic theory and practice. In truth, forms of energetic thinking and practice are infused throughout the “CAM” universe; homeopathy’s dance with Avogadro’s number merely makes it, with distant prayer, the most challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Challenging” is putting it mildly. But this is the kicker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is probably good that Briggs’ extensive and admirable self-education process over the last 2 years preceded this meeting. The culture shock may had this meeting been in her first months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rather suspect that Mr. Weeks is correct here, only not in the way he thinks. I’m willing to bet that it was a major culture shock for Dr. Briggs to find out just how much magical thinking, religion, and pseudoscience underlie so much of CAM. What Weeks calls a “comfort zone” is in reality nothing more than staying within what can be studied and demonstrated scientifically, which is what scientists do. If homeopaths could produce anything more than centuries-old magical thinking to support their quackery, if they could produce actual science in the form of physics, chemistry, and biology to support their mystical beliefs in the “memory” of water and that “like cures like,” then their discipline would enter the realm of science, rather than being relegated to the realm of pseudoscience. The problem, of course, is that homeopathy and the “energy healing” modalities are so removed from science that this is about as unlikely to happen as there is likely to be a single molecule of active remedy left in a 30C dilution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therein lies the conflict at the heart of NCCAM, and, although I approve of Dr. Briggs’ attempts to increase the scientific rigor of NCCAM and, given that NCCAM isn’t going anywhere, see that as the best path towards trying to make NCCAM a useful center in the NIH, I’m afraid that her actions will only exacerbate the conflict. It’s the institution and the laws that created it that are the problem, and Dr. Briggs won’t be there forever. Her successor might not be as dedicated to science as she is. (In fact, if people like John Weeks get their way, you can count on it.) No matter how much Dr. Briggs may change the culture of NCCAM under her stewardship, all it takes is a new director to change it right back. Directors come and go, but institutions last for generations.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of us who have been following the antics of "Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey's Autism Organization - Generation Rescue" have wondered what this would mean for the pro-disease movement pushing the idea that vaccines cause autism. Would Jim Carrey still lend his considerable Hollywood clout, which is at least an order of magnitude greater than Jenny McCarthy's, to Generation Rescue? We didn't have long to wait. By Friday, &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; had completely &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/04/what-changes-are-in-store-for-generation-rescue"&gt;revamped its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone is the picture of Jim Carrey, Jenny McCarthy, and Evan from the front page of the website. Gone is any mention of his name, leaving Generation Rescue as now being just "Jenny McCarthy's Autism Organization - Generation Rescue." Gone is Jim Carrey from the &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/about/leadership" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;. Given the slickness of hte new look, no doubt that this revamp of the website has been a long time in coming, and probably GR simply moved up its originally planned revamp in order to deal with Jim and Jenny's breakup. More interestingly, all mention of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/desiree_jennings_cured.php"&gt;Desiree Jennings&lt;/a&gt; appears to have been send down the memory hole. In case you don't remember who she is, she is the young woman who claimed that a flu vaccine caused her to develop dystonia, a claim riddled with inconsistencies that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/dystonia_from_a_flu_vaccine.php"&gt;didn't stand up to even mild scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently even GR realized that it had backed a loser, something it had apparently realized relatively soon after its initial promotion of the story, even though it lashed out at people like Steve Novella and myself for having criticized its use of this poor woman for its own purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/generation_rescue_in_transition.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/generation_rescue_in_transition.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/ccWKM5zZgS4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271088463122"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2246">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e8ded60e0c75b92d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Abbreviation"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><category term="Writing"/><title type="html">Vwllssnss</title><published>2010-04-12T15:42:50Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T15:42:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2246" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following on Barbara Partee's &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2226"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on vwllssnss, here's today's &lt;em&gt;Zits&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Carmen Drahl, Associate Editor for Science/Technology/Education at &lt;a href="http://pubs.acs.org/cen/" title=""&gt;Chemical &amp;amp; Engineering News&lt;/a&gt; (find her as @carmendrahl on Twitter) to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Carmen Drahl pic1.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Carmen%20Drahl%20pic1.JPG" width="356" height="336" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;It's a pleasure and a privilege to be interviewed, Bora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good conversations make me happy. School was fun for me (well, maybe not grad school) and that's evolved into a desire to always be learning something new. I enjoy doing nothing as much as I enjoy doing things. On Mondays, if I'm not too busy, I take hip-hop dance classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hometown is Hackettstown, New Jersey. M&amp;amp;M&amp;#39;s are made there. I got a bachelor&amp;#39;s in chemistry from Drew University and a Ph.D. in chemistry at Princeton. Scientifically my expertise hovers somewhere around the interface between organic chemistry and biochemistry. A short while after defending my dissertation, I moved to Washington DC to write for &lt;a href="http://pubs.acs.org/cen/" title=""&gt;Chemical &amp;amp; Engineering News&lt;/a&gt;, and that's where I've been for almost three years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scandal led me to science blogs. Seriously. In March 2006 I was still an organic chemistry grad student. Everyone in my lab was buzzing about a set of retractions in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (disclosure: today I work for the American Chemical Society, which publishes JACS). A rising young organic chemistry star retracted the papers because work by one of his graduate students couldn't be reproduced. It was a big deal and became an even bigger deal as the inevitable rumors (salacious and otherwise) surfaced. The blogosphere had the details first. So that's where Google pointed me and the other members of my lab when we searched for more information. I learned about the awesome (but sadly now defunct) blogs Tenderbutton and The Endless Frontier, by Dylan Stiles and Paul Bracher, both chemistry grad students like me. I also discovered the solid mix of chemistry and pharma at Derek Lowe's &lt;a href="http://pipeline.corante.com" title=""&gt;In the Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, which is still the first blog I visit every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Carmen Drahl pic2.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Carmen%20Drahl%20pic2.JPG" width="336" height="448" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;By the time I discovered science blogs I knew my career goals were changing. I'd already been lucky enough to audit a science writing course at Princeton taught by Mike Lemonick from TIME, and thought that maybe science writing was a good choice for me. After reading chemistry blogs for a while I realized "Hey, I can do this!" and started my own blog, &lt;a href="http://blind-science.blogspot.com" title=""&gt;She Blinded Me with Science&lt;/a&gt;, in July 2006. It was the typical grad student blog, a mix of posts about papers I liked and life in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At C&amp;amp;E News I&amp;#39;ve contributed to its &lt;a href="http://cenblog.org" title=""&gt;C&amp;amp;ENtral Science&lt;/a&gt; blog, which premiered in spring 2008. I've experimented with a few different kinds of posts- observations and on-the-street interviews when I run into something chemistry-related in DC, in-depth posts from meetings, and video demos of iPod apps. One of my favorite things to do is toy with new audio/video/etc technology for the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March I just started a new era in my web existence- I'm becoming a pharma blogger. I'm the science voice at &lt;a href="http://cenblog.org/the-haystack" title=""&gt;The Haystack&lt;/a&gt;, C&amp;amp;E News&amp;#39;s new pharma blog and one of seven new blogs the magazine launched last month. My co-blogger is the talented Lisa Jarvis, who&amp;#39;s written about the business side of pharma for ten years and who brings a solid science background to the table as well. I kicked us off by liveblogging/livetweeting a popular session at the American Chemical Society&amp;#39;s meeting in San Francisco where drug companies reveal for the first time the chemical structures of potential new drugs being tested in clinical trials. The whole thing synced to FriendFeed as well. Folks followed the talks from all three venues, which was great. I hope I can continue doing that sort of thing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this August, I'm co-organizing a mini-symposium at the American Chemical Society meeting in Boston about the chem/pharma blogosphere and its impact on research and communication. I'm in the process of inviting speakers right now. It's my first time doing anything like this and part of me is petrified that no one will show up. Tips on organizing a conference session and how not to stress when doing so are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I'd love to get more chemistry bloggers to connect with the community that attends ScienceOnline. I don't ever want to become that old (or not-so-old) person who is clueless about them-thar newfangled whosiwhatsits that the kids are using nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things come to mind, actually. I'd like to think that the web has made grad school a helluva lot less isolating for science grad students. You have the virtual journal clubs like &lt;a href="http://totallysynthetic.com/blog" title=""&gt;Totally Synthetic&lt;/a&gt;, posts like SciCurious's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2010/04/a_letter_to_a_grad_student.php"&gt;letter to a grad student&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a journalist the web's capacity to equalize fascinates me. I'm extremely lucky to have a staff gig as a science writer without having gone to journalism school or landed a media fellowhip and it's weird to think that my old blog might've helped my visibility. I didn't know Ed Yong's story until Scio10 but I think he's a highly talented example of how the web can open doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web&amp;#39;s equalizing power goes to readers of science content as well as writers, of course. In the ideal situation a reader can give a writer instant feedback and you can get a real conversation going, something that was much harder with the snail-paced system of letters to the editor and reader surveys. Not that the conversation is always civil. Most of C&amp;amp;EN&amp;#39;s readers have a decent amount of scientific training, but the debate that rages whenever we run an editorial about climate change is as intense as any I&amp;#39;ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases like that I don't know that the web gives people a good representation of what the consensus is. For folks who don't have scientific training, how do you ensure that people don't just go to the content that already confirms their pre-existing beliefs about autism or global warming? John Timmer touched on this more eloquently &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/02/scienceonline2010_-_interview_7.php" title=""&gt;in his interview with you&lt;/a&gt;, and I agree with him that I don't think we have an answer yet. Though on a slightly different note, I will mention that I've been enjoying the New York Times's recent attempts to recapture the spontaneity of flipping through the newspaper in online browsing, like the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/timesskimmer/" title=""&gt;Times Skimmer&lt;/a&gt; for Google Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are some of your favourite science blogs? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the blogs I've already mentioned I enjoy &lt;a href="http://www.coronene.com/blog/"&gt;Carbon-Based Curiosities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/" title=""&gt;Wired Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chemistry-blog.com/" title=""&gt;Chemistry Blog&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/" title=""&gt;Terra Sigillata&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few of the 50 or so blogs on my feed reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered scads of new blogs at Scio10 but I'll focus on the one that's become required reading for me these days: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/obesitypanacea/" title=""&gt;Obesity Panacea&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;d covered obesity drug development for C&amp;amp;EN but I&amp;#39;d never met Travis Saunders and Peter Janiszewski or heard of their blog until the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dailymonthly.com/" title=""&gt;Dave Munger&lt;/a&gt;is my hero - his blogging 102 session was packed with practical tips that I brought back to C&amp;amp;EN for incorporating into our blogs, such as the use of the Disqus plugin for catching conversations on social networks, getting smart about using stats and surveys, etc. Some of that&amp;#39;s already happened, and some of the ideas are still in the works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came for the nuts-and-bolts blogging tips but I stayed for the conversations, especially the ones at the bar after the official program was done for the night. And the icing on the cake was seeing folks I'd worked with but never met, like Cameron Neylon and you, Bora, and catching up with people I hadn't seen in months, like Jean-Claude Bradley, Aaron Rowe, Jennifer Ouellette and Nancy Shute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview.

&lt;p&gt;The sex column has mutated mightily since the earliest days of “Ask Anka” in &lt;em&gt;Details&lt;/em&gt;. Once banished to the back section of alt-weeklies, right by the classified ads, frank first-person sex writing has spread to college newspapers and blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ad as this world has matured, so have its participants. So what happens when writers decide that they want to focus their erotic energies on one person, or just that they need to take a break from chronicling their intimate exploits? Some writers go the eminent-sage route, moving into a position where they dole out advice to the needy. But others, including the acid-tongued New York City dating columnist Amy Sohn and the pioneering sex website Nerve, are moving on to a step that, one could argue, comes naturally: They’re writing about their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I had a kid, it seemed natural to me to start exploiting it for material,” Sohn &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/news/the-mommy-wars/amy-sohn-and-neal-pollack-think-people-are-just-jealous-300546.php"&gt;once joked&lt;/a&gt;. Sohn came to prominence in the ’90s with her sex column for the &lt;em&gt;New York Press&lt;/em&gt;. Her column “Female Trouble,” as well as and her first novel &lt;em&gt;Run Catch Kiss&lt;/em&gt; chronicled her postgraduate exploits in New York’s singles scene. She’s since abandoned the streets of Manhattan for the more genteel world of Brooklyn, and the dating merry-go-round for playground equipment at the local park. The change of scene has proven to be no less neuroses-inducing for Sohn, if her writing is any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only show I could tolerate was the Saturday-morning Upside Down Show because I had developed an intricate sexual fantasy involving the two Australian hosts and myself in the Outback,” Sohn wrote in a &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/news/politics/homefront/32861/"&gt;2007 piece lamenting trends in kiddie TV&lt;/a&gt;. And in a January piece entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ivillage.com/amy-sohn-baby-einstein-was-my-porn/1-e-62499"&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;Baby Einstein&lt;/em&gt; Was My Porn,’&lt;/a&gt; she mourned her tied-downness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew these families were too attractive to be real, but I wanted to believe this fantasy of domestic bliss. This was a world with no Zoloft, no mastitis, and no wine. The Baby Einstein parents did all the things that we were unable to do with our own babies, because if we were, we wouldn’t have been plopping them in front of the TV while we took a shower, made a business call, or had sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohn’s lack of a libidinous life isn’t necessarily casting a pall over her career; her moving on from having sex to dealing with kids was noticed by no less a light of the carefree New York lady set than Sarah Jessica Parker, herself a mother of three. The &lt;em&gt;Sex And The City&lt;/em&gt; star has &lt;a href="http://www.amysohn.com/?p=75"&gt;optioned Sohn’s book about Park Slope upscale Brooklyn parenting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Prospect Park West&lt;/em&gt;, for an HBO-show treatment. And Nerve, the crisply hip sex Web site that launched around the time that Sohn was engaging in her downtown adventures, spun off Babble, a site devoted to parenting, in 2006; it’s stuffed with blogs about cooking for kids and obsessing over celebrity spawn. (It’s probably worth noting that Dan Savage was ahead of this trendlet, writing his first parenting memoir &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kid-Happened-Boyfriend-Decided-Pregnant/dp/0452281768"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kid: What Happened After My Boyfriend And I Decided To Get Pregnant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2000.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part, the shift from talking about lube to discussions of diapers is brought on by demographic movement. “More and more young parents are choosing to living in cities, and the average father today spends twice as much time with his children than the average father in 1965,” noted &lt;a href="http://www.babble.com/misc/preview/pressrelease.html"&gt;the press release accompanying Babble’s 2006 launch&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a generation in the process of reinventing technology and media, and eager to look at the challenges of parenting with fresh eyes.” Not to mention, with enough money to spend on advertisers’ products – particularly the sort of big-budget advertisers. (Sohn, in her announcement about Parker’s optioning of her book, refers to this as “the perils of aspirational living.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there are some writers who are trying to work both sides of the aisle. Ayelet Waldman’s 2005 attempt to fuse orgasmic sex-columnist rapture with stories about being on the front lines of parenthood &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/fashion/27love.html"&gt;made people cringe over their &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Sunday Styles sections&lt;/a&gt;, although that might be because she was so self-admittedly smug about her boasts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am the only woman in Mommy and Me who seems to be, well, getting any. This could fill me with smug well-being. I could sit in the room and gloat over my wonderful marriage. I could think about how our sex life – always vital, even torrid – is more exciting and imaginative now than it was when we first met. I could check my watch to see if I have time to stop at Good Vibrations to see if they have any exciting new toys. I could even gaze pityingly at the other mothers in the group, wishing that they too could experience a love as deep as my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not like becoming a parent turns off the libido, and Waldman’s icky self-satisfaction, while rankling, certainly fits in well with the rest of the Styles section’s consumption-happy ethos. Another parenting columnist, Kristen Chase, calls herself &lt;a href="http://www.imperfectparent.com/mominatrix/"&gt;The Mominatrix&lt;/a&gt;, and her bio notes that “when she’s not perusing the local adult bookstores and foot fetish websites, she maintains several weblogs (sic), including Motherhood Uncensored, Cool Mom Picks, and Parent Bloggers Network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not to be all “what about the children,” but, well…what about the children? Sohn might have used the verb “exploiting” jokingly in her explanation of her new career trajectory, but there’s a certain unsavoriness to the idea that the offspring of these writers are accruing a paper trail that was written long before they could learn their ABCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dating columns, the “others” are given nicknames, or at least identified by their first name only; sure, the way nicknames are generally used to distill complex human beings down to a single character trait is dehumanizing, but they at least have the advantage of giving anonymity to those parties who can’t speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also troubling are the notions of sexuality ascribed by the career path of the person who chooses first-person libido chronicling as their beat when they’re first embarking on their career. Is it possible, one wonders, to move on from cataloging one’s dates to a topic that doesn’t involve? Is there some sort of twistedly American redemptive arc implicitly stipulating that any woman who talks about their sex life in public eventually has to produce a kid from all that energy – kind of like the old sitcom trope that results in so many long-simmering couples popping out babies, once the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;

It produces an enzyme which seems to be involved in repressing cellular senescence by regulating the p53 pathway, mouse mutations in these genes produce the symptoms of accelerated aging, and there are even a couple of known human alleles correlated with changes in longevity and coronary artery disease. The current research is at the level of basic science, though, asking how this gene product fits into the regulatory web that maintains cell states; it is not ready for any kind of medical work, I don't even know how we would take advantage of the information to tinker with aging processes, and as far as I know, there are no clinical trials of any kind in the works. So it's promising and is useful information, but it's not at all ready or even approachable for medical use, yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn't stop the quacks, though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commercial quack operation called &lt;a href="http://www.homeovitality.com/homeovitality.html"&gt;Homeovitality&lt;/a&gt; is taking advantage of a tiny bit of research (to create pseudo-scientific buzzwords) and people's ignorance to market fake therapies. One among several is based on a smidgen of truth about the Klotho gene and a lot of fakery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeovitality® is an entirely new concept in health promotion. It is designed to help people achieve and maintain different forms of nature&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;super-health&amp;quot; and stay healthy. For the first time ever, Homeovitality® helps everyone to benefit from new &amp;quot;cutting-edge&amp;quot; genetic and other scientific discoveries right now using a safe, natural non-pharmacological delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering how they are taking advantage of "cutting-edge" research. Here's how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of Dr. Matsumara's work and completion of the Human Genome Project, the complete DNA sequence of the KL gene has been worked out. Therefore, to target your KL gene, a DNA molecule was prepared that was identical in sequence to 273 base pairs of an active part of everyone's KL gene. The sequence of the KL targeting molecule is as follows;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
5'- ACTACCGCTT CTCCATCTCG TGGGCGCGAG TGCTCCCCAA TGGCAGCGCG GGCGTCCCCA ACCGCGAGGG GCTGCGCTAC TACCGGCGCC TGCTGGAGCG GCTGCGGGAG CTGGGCGTGC AGCCCGTGGT CACCCTGTAC CACTGGGACC TGCCCCAGCG CCTGCAGGAC GCCTACGGCG GCTGGGCCAA CCGCGCCCTG GCCGACCACT TCAGGGATTA CGCGGAGCTC TGCTTCCGCC ACTTCGGCGG TCAGGTCAAG TACTGGATCA CCA -3'.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The KL targeting molecule, as well as the others was prepared, purified and sequenced by one of Australia's leading genetics laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they get onto the easily accessed &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/"&gt;NIH site&lt;/a&gt; and get the gene sequence, and then they order a vial of the purified DNA from a commercial outfit (this is &lt;i&gt;trivial&lt;/i&gt;: the NIH even includes a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/clone/orderclone.cgi?db=gene&amp;amp;uid=152831"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to suppliers of cDNA clones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, really, just having a strand of DNA with the sequence of Klotho does nothing — it&amp;#39;s the action of the gene product in the cell that plays a subtle role in aging. What we need for a therapeutic use of this information is a way to regulate the activity of the protein in cells in a predictable way. So what does Homeovitality® have people do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.homeovitality.com/super_heart.html"&gt;Drink it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink a DNA solution? Are they insane? That&amp;#39;s just going to get broken down and do nothing, and besides, it&amp;#39;s not as if your body contains some shortage of Klotho genes — every cell in your body has a copy. Of course, even that objection is pointless, because you aren&amp;#39;t actually drinking any DNA. This is a &lt;i&gt;homeopathic&lt;/i&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeovitality® products have also been succussed at each dilution stage so they will also help to promote desirable forms of hybrid vigour in a &amp;quot;like promotes like&amp;quot; mode of action involving some of the mechanisms (4) described by Dr. Kratz, (&lt;a href="http://kulisz.com/how_does_homeopathy_work.htm"&gt;http://kulisz.com/how_does_homeopathy_work.htm&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Homeovitality® products are safe because firstly, they are used at similar dilutions to classical homeopathic disease remedies and secondly, hybrid vigour is a completely natural biological process that has been developed by nature over millions of years to enable all creatures to enjoy &amp;quot;super health&amp;quot; and disease resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're selling bottles of water and pretending it's medicine, with a cloud of pseudo-scientific hokum to justify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's another sad fact: the creator of this snake-oil, Peter Kay, has a legitimate degree and a &lt;a href="http://www.homeovitality.com/about_us.html"&gt;good collection of scientific publications to his name&lt;/a&gt;, some of them in topics with which I am familiar. &lt;i&gt;None&lt;/i&gt; of them justify this homeopathic DNA nonsense. It looks like someone has realized that science doesn't pay as well as grifting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/more_magic_dna_snake_oil.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/vrBRhUdnom4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271084689139"><id gr:original-id="http://conservationbytes.com/2010/04/12/maggot-plants-mangroves/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a799e0a9bb8e1823</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The maggot of the plant world – mangroves</title><published>2010-04-12T10:16:47Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T10:16:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/bTJA9se9p-M/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://conservationbytes.com/2010/04/12/maggot-plants-mangroves/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I don’t know how many of my readers have waded through a mangrove swamp before – if you have, you’ll know it’s no ‘walk in the park’.

&lt;p&gt;She played an actress on the show “Designing Women,” and in one particular &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Designing_Women_episodes#Season_3_.281988.E2.80.931989.29"&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; from 1988, her character &lt;strong&gt;Julia Sugarbaker&lt;/strong&gt; ran for a seat on a local board of commissioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s her taking part in a debate where a question comes up about whether children should recite the Pledge of Allegiance in school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/VnMn-ObT0r8%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How great was that?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, the other remembrances of her will be similar to the one in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, which described her as “an accomplished actress who gave strong, opinionated Southern women a good name.”&lt;/p&gt;

He went to France in 1916 when he was only 21 years old. Robert fought with the 73rd Battalion and he was killed in action at Vimy Ridge on this day, April 12, in 1917. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Canadians "celebrate" the battle of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vimy_Ridge"&gt;Vimy Ridge&lt;/a&gt; as a great Canadian victory. It was part of the larger Battle of Arras, which in turn was a diversionary attack in support of the larger Nivelle Offensive carried out by the French Army. About 3,600 young Canadian men were killed during the four day battle and 7,000 more were wounded. This is just a small fraction of the casualties on both sides during World War I.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We need to be very careful not to glorify war while remembering all those young mean and women who died in a war that never should have been fought. I will eventually go to Arras and visit the large memorial erected by the Canadian government (see below) but I will do it in order to reinforce my view that war is folly and the deaths of soldiers like Robert Alexander Hood should never have happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is never any glory in war and it's nothing we should ever be proud of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S8C7Z9TqJOI/AAAAAAAAKjg/6jVExne018U/s1600/tmp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:294px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S8C7Z9TqJOI/AAAAAAAAKjg/6jVExne018U/s400/tmp.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1.

And in the U.S., where mine safety is sometimes seen as a question that was resolved decades ago, the death of at least 25 men is a painful reminder of the risks they face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx</id><title type="html">Science In The News Daily</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271084373569"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.9367/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f916d931861c42fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Drug Giants Tackle 'Neglected' Effort</title><published>2010-04-12T15:38:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T15:38:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.9367/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the La Jolla laboratories of Novartis are taking part in an unusual assignment for the pharmaceutical industry--finding drugs for some diseases with little or no moneymaking potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;/em&gt; (Registration Required)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx</id><title type="html">Science In The News Daily</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271084373553"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.9366/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a3fcd4c7b952fe8d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Swirling Dust Shocks Physicists</title><published>2010-04-12T15:37:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T15:37:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.9366/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scientists have explained how lightning can occur even in the driest deserts.

They actually believe that water can retain some magical properties after it has been exposed to certain chemicals. How is this possible? It's because of "nanobubbles."    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's John Benneth explaining the "science" behind homeopathy. This is woo of the highest order.

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/good-morning-meltdowns/"&gt;my first Blisstree post&lt;/a&gt;, I admitted to dropping the F-bomb in front of (and directly at) my kids. I didn’t think that much about this curse word until Blisstree asked me to write about how lousy it feels to swear in front of your progeny. Which got me worrying: “Why hadn’t it bothered me more? Is cursing worse than just yelling? Don’t other parents accidentally tell their kids to F*@# off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to canvass my like-minded parent friends, assuming I’d hear stories and assurances that would make me feel better about working blue around my kids. But while the first handful of peers I talked to were supportive, not one of them had cursed at their kids. This kind of F*&amp;amp;$ed me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When K said: “I’m sorry, I don’t have a cursing story. But I’d like to read about other people doing it!”&lt;br&gt;
I heard: “I thought you were a good mom. What’s going on in your house?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When P said: “I haven’t really had the balls to curse at my kids yet, but I am a year behind you – I bet next year at this time I will have done it.”&lt;br&gt;
I heard: “I’m calling child protective services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When S said: “I’m pretty good with the curses, but do you want to hear a story about how, when D was a baby, I forgot to strap her into the backpack carrier, then I fell – and she shot out onto the sidewalk?&lt;br&gt;
I heard: “Wow. I may be a terrible mom, but I’m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I did ferret out a few more friends whose stories made mine sound tame, and for a little while I reveled in feeling that I’d never done anything particularly egregious or damaging. But of course that just F-ed me up even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I know where my tight-assed judgments come from. Growing up, swearing was so verboten in my parents’ house that I still feel a sliver of rebellion every time I get my potty mouth on. Once, my brother actually had his potty mouth washed out with soap. And my siblings and I often heard the story about how, when my parents were dating and my dad said the F-word while driving with my mom, she made him stop the car so she could get out and walk the rest of the way. Meanwhile, here I was, a mom who had consciously chosen a less violent, more democratic parenting style than my parents (read: no spanking) lobbing obscenities at my kids? I was truly confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, over morning coffee, my friend J told me her story, about how one day her son was deep into a fit and she was feeling so far out of control, she yelled “F*&amp;amp;%$ you!” The kid stopped dead in his tracks and, as she put it: “Nothing came out of his body. No sound, no breath.” And then – he went on his merry way. But J (who happens to be a patient, creative, and amazing mom of four) was so certain she’d scarred her son for life, she called a child psychologist – who assured her that her son would recover, and that what she’d done was the equivalent of tossing a bucket of water on someone who is hysterical. Should she apologize? Sure, the therapist said; it’s fine to say you’re sorry for using the word, maybe adding that like wine and R-rated movies, the term is for grownup use only. But that’s about as far as anyone needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounded good to me. And here was my son’s response when I apologized for having cussed him out that day: “You did?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, when we drop the F-bomb, we’re really just reaching for the strongest ammunition in our arsenals, and for anyone raised the way I was, expletives carry a lot of weight. But now, I get that my slip didn’t weigh nearly as heavily on me as did the anger I’d hurled it with. And I’d worked hard (and for once successfully) to correct the disastrous mornings that had led to the explosion. That’s really the best any of us can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that my kids are hitting their tweens, I’m opting to defuse the F-bomb in our house by throwing my hat in with another handful of friends I talked to. Sometimes, these parents unapologetically swear at or around their kids, and honestly, the words just don’t hold that much valence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, F*@# it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring cleaning your home can seem like a daunting task, but these tips can make the mess feel a lot more tolerable during this necessary annual ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean one room a day &lt;/strong&gt;– Don’t overwhelm yourself by thinking about the entire house. But make it a rule: Don’t leave the room until you’re done.  Your home will be sparkling clean in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get organized &lt;/strong&gt;– Bring boxes or bins to each room labeled “Trash,” “Storage,” “Recycle,” and “Donate.” Start cleaning out the closets or cabinets first. Move on to cleaning the light fixtures, windows, counters, and other surfaces. Finish with window coverings, baseboards and floors. Don’t forget wiping out the refrigerator and oven cleaning in the kitchen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Turn up the music &lt;/strong&gt;– Blast your favorite upbeat music as you clean the house. It’ll take your mind off the huge project at hand and keep you in a great mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward yourself &lt;/strong&gt;– When you’re done with each room, reward yourself with a relaxing bath, some aromatherapy candles, a glass of wine, and a good book. You’ve earned them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; sheet of ice, about 3250 square kilometers (1250 square miles) in area, roughly equal to a square 57 km (34 miles) on a side. There had been a series of warm summers that weakened the shelf, and then the very warm summer of 2002 spelled doom for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Landsat 7 satellite took many images of the collapse, but the Earth Observatory Image of the Day &lt;a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=43459"&gt;just released two dramatic shots of its impact&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/craneglacierretreat.jpg" alt="craneglacierretreat" title="craneglacierretreat" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The top image was taken on April 6, 2002 — about two months after the shelf collapsed — and the bottom one on February 20, 2003. What you’re seeing is the Crane glacier which flowed out into the ice shelf. See how the end of the glacier has retreated so far back into the bay? The Larsen B ice shelf helped stabilize the glacier, but with the shelf gone, the glacier was free to break off as well. The end result is the glacier edge effectively retreating up the channel. You can see icebergs floating in the bay, some hundreds of meters across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard not to wonder about climate change when looking at this. As we reality-based folks are fond of saying, weather (short-term, local environment) is not climate (long-term, larger environment). On the other hand, how many episodes of weather over how large a region does it take to add up to climate?&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t know about the first two, but a new paper suggests being blonde on a beach may be good, but you can be too blonde – if you’re a mouse.

Animal colours provide some classic cases of adaptation and natural selection. For instance, most people with even a passing familiarity with biology know about peppered moths and industrial melanism. Fur colour in mice isn’t quite as famous as moth colours yet, but it might be getting there. I discussed mouse colour being hyped as “one for the textbooks” in a previous post. I suggested that the field experiments supporting some of the work were a little obscure and not well described. 

Some people agreed with me. Alright, nobody said anything to me personally, but it would explain a new paper from the same lab. Sacha Vignieri, Joanna Larson, and lab leader Hopi Hoekstra go back to the field to get some more direct evidence for how mouse coat color influences survival in the field. The first couple of paragraphs do an excellent job of explaining why this story is worth revisiting 60 years after experiments showing that different fur colours were advantageous in different environments.

The team went to northern Florida, the scampering grounds of a field mouse (Peromyscus polionotus; pictured above) that shows two distinct fur colours. They needed to go there not for the mice, but because that’s where the mouse predators live.

The authors didn’t need any mice, because they made their own.

Now, before you get this image of some sort of Frankenmouse experiment (“It’s alive... and squeeking!”), Vignieri and colleagues made models of mice out of plasticine.

Okay, they were a little more realistic than that.

You might think plasticine is a poor thing to make a mouse out of. Mice are furry, and plasticine... isn’t. True, but from a distance, the shape alone is enough to fool some predators.

(I can just imagine some poor, hungry predator coming down thinking, “Food, food, at long last, food!—Wha...!? This isn’t food! Damnit!”)

The big advantage to using plasticine models over other kinds is that when something attacks them (“So... hungry!”), they leave behind too or claw marks. This way, you can actually make a reasonable guess as to whether the predator was, say, a mammal or a bird. They also measured the colour of the soil they placed their plasticine models on, so they were able to test how closely they matched.

They tested two locations. On an beachfront island, the soil was very light coloured. Some ways inland in a park, the soil was quite a bit darker.

It might be to the predators’ credit that the non-moving, non-furry plasticine mice didn’t get attacked all that often. Of 2,688 chances predators had at them, 28 models were recovered with predator marks; another 12 went missing. And, as expected, the mice models that didn’t match the soil colour had the most attacks. The light coloured mice on dark soil getting the worst of it, but the authors attribute this to a higher rate of predation overall in habitats with dark soils.

But light coloured mice on light soil suffered from increased attacks if the mice were too much lighter than the soil. This is a nice example of stabilizing selection, where predation is constantly nudging mice to match their local environment as closely as possible.

In other words, it was possible for mice to be “too blonde.” 

But before brunettes start gloating: the same was true for very dark coloured mice on dark soil.

But while blonde mice may have a selective advantage over brunette mice on the light-coloured beaches, brunettes could console themselves by remembering there’s a lot more inland than there is beach.

For a glimpse of their phylogeny, see this diagram, but keep in mind that the majority of forams are actually allogromiids, forams which build their walls of protein as opposed to scavenged material or depositing mineral substances. From the allogromiids there have been several independent origins of non-proteinaceous forams, many building their tests out of sand grains, remnants of prey or their own waste. Test-building is a complicated and highly regulated process (many forams actually select sand grains with the right properties for building their tests!), a topic I should get around to eventually (not with those dark menacing storm clouds rapidly approaching from the horizon signalling the inevitable Armageddon finals). Thus, I figured that for this superficial protist appreciation post one can't go wrong with Notodendrodes, a genus of forams that look like trees!Notodendrodes, like their sphaerical relative Rhabdammina, build their tests out of sand grains, especially quartz. Unlike Rhabdammina, they also have extensive "root" and "arborescent" structures sticking out of the sphaerical shell and into the sand and up in the air, respectively.Notodendrodes antarctikos from the deep sea, arborescent structure. Image from Bowser lab, shamelessly stolen from certain course slides.One must also note that forams extend far beyond their tests: they are surrounded by a complex network of extruded strands of cytoplasm forming the reticulopodia. These networks can be used to capture prey, absorb nutrients and, in some species, transport algal symbionts far outside the shell to harvest light energy. Notodendrodes lives too deep for housing photosynthetic symbionts; it is said to use its root pseudopodia for absorbing nutrients from the sediment and the arborescent network for sifting through the algal rain falling from the surface (Bowser Lab webpage on Notodendrodes ). Notodendrodes hyalinosphaira. Scalebars: A,B - 2mm; C - 1cm; D - 5mm (DeLaca et al. 2002 J Foram Res)These cells are quite sophisticated and should make great companions for cell biology research. The reticulopodia are able to move things along them (seems to be widespread feature among Rhizarians), and before you get the idea that these giant cells are docile and harmless, some forams can prey on small animals like copepods. There are some truly frightening micrographs in OR Anderson's Biology of Foraminifera. Notodendrodes is apparently uninucleate. Wonder what ploidy levels would be needed to sustain such a monster-sized cell...Anyway, this post fails to do justice to these organisms, but this week is simply awful for me, so I must leave it at that. My whole life is due this week. Also, I have three weeks left to finish wrapping up my current research project, and I'm having great difficulty focusing on it with all the course-related crap on top of it. Expect negligible blogging efforts in the next few weeks...By the way, Mystery Micrograph #20 feels neglected.

He&amp;#39;s not a very bright guy, and he doesn&amp;#39;t know much about biology or history, and he&amp;#39;s extremely annoyed that not only is the local school teaching his kids stuff he didn&amp;#39;t know, but they&amp;#39;re actually telling them that his sources of information are wrong. You see, the only level of education we&amp;#39;re allowed to raise children to is the Kurt Zimmerman level…which is a little scary. I was kind of hoping that sending my kids off to school would produce progeny who are smarter than &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;, and now I learn that they're only supposed to produce kids who are dumber than Kurt Zimmerman? How dismaying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/apr/05/tennessee-dad-wants-biology-textbook-banned-myth/"&gt;Zimmerman is upset because he found a biology textbook that defines creationism as "the biblical myth that the universe was created by the Judeo-Christian god in 7 days".&lt;/a&gt; This is mostly factually correct (one might quibble that the bible actually says their god created the earth in &lt;i&gt;six&lt;/i&gt; days, and doesn&amp;#39;t really say much about the universe as a whole…but really, when you&amp;#39;re dealing with that degree of lunacy, 7 is the same as 6 is the same as canned beans), but seeing &amp;quot;myth&amp;quot; in the same sentence as &amp;quot;bible&amp;quot; has made Mr Zimmerman quite unhinged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman asked in December that the school immediately quit using the book "Asking About Life" in his son's class and all classes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He said it could "mislead, belittle and discourage students in believing in creationism and pointedly calls the Bible a myth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not misleading at all, it doesn't belittle students except in the sense that students who believe something that is wrong will be faced with a direct statement that they are wrong, and I should hope schools would discourage people from believing in stupid and fallacious mush! It also doesn't go as far as I'd like or that Zimmerman thinks it does: it does not call the bible a myth. It says that it contains a myth, which it does. It would be nice if we did have a high school biology book that called all of Christianity and Judaism a collection of myths, but we don't. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Zimmerman has accomplished one triumph: he has won himself a brief spot on Fox News. The really astonishing thing about this clip is that the two Fox interviewers, Barbie and Dullard, actually come off as dumber than he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/3JQbThfN3O8%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=258" width="425" height="258"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news, though, is that the local school board has decided not to decide anything about the book for 30 days. That's committee-speak for "let's wait for the noise and notoriety of Mr Zipperhead to die down a bit, so we can ignore the whole stupid proposal".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, this is interesting: a commenter looked up the book on Google Books and got the actual, full quote from the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s and 1980s, antievolutionists in Arkansas, Tennessee and
Louisiana passed identical bills calling for "equal time" for teaching
evolution and creationism, the biblical myth that the universe was
created by the Judeo-Christian god in six days. But a court ruled that
the "equal-time" bill was unconstitutional on the grounds that it
violated the separation of church and state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's even biblically accurate.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Using Multimedia to Advance Your Research" -- and - "Adventures in Self-Publishing"&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="http://www.explainingresearch.com/index.php?page_id=269" title=""&gt;Dennis Meredith&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="http://www.explainingresearch.com/" title=""&gt;Explaining Research: How to Reach Key Audiences to Advance Your Work&lt;/a&gt; (Oxford University Press)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 26, 2010, 6:00 p.m.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sigmaxi.org/about/center/directions.shtml" title=""&gt;Sigma Xi Center&lt;/a&gt;, RTP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dennis Meredith drew a standing-room-only crowd when he talked at the 2010 AAAS meeting about the role of multimedia in research. We've prevailed on Dennis, formerly of Duke University, to reprise his presentation for the home-state crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the AAAS Annual Meeting guide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Creating video and Web explanations of research not only enhances the public's understanding of science and technology; it also brings scientists practical benefits, such as content that helps funding agencies and legislators advocate for research budgets. And more personally, it teaches scientists an invaluable "visual vernacular" that they can use to enhance their communications with key audiences, including their colleagues, donors, institutional leaders, and students."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dennis will also discuss his experiences in publishing Explaining Research with Oxford and in self-publishing his supplemental booklet, &lt;a href="http://www.explainingresearch.com/index.php?page_id=360" title=""&gt;Working with Public Information Officers&lt;/a&gt;. Although there are many caveats and pitfalls, it is possible to self-publish a science book and make money. Dennis will be signing copies of both books after the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food and drink will be available at 6:00. The seminar begins at 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;

All this week on the blog, I'm going to be discussing issues raised on the show--so having heard it will be kind of an essential baseline.

I'm always trying to become a better interviewer, so with this next post, I want to zoom in on an area where I failed to press my interview subject as I probably should have. And that is the relationship between religious beliefs and opposition to geoengineering.

At around minute 9:15, I asked Eli about religious opposition to geoengineering--basically, about the folks who say that we shouldn't "play God." He gave a very detailed answer, essentially signaling that, hey, yeah, this is a lot like genetically modified foods--some people think the impulse to interfere with "nature," to remake it in the way that only "God" is supposed to do, is wrong.

I have no doubt this impulse is out there. But I don't find it to be at all a rational argument, or a sound basis for public policy.

Once the notion that mercury in the form of thimerosal in vaccines might be responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders (it’s not) became popular in the anti-vaccine crowd, this made them natural allies with the “mercury-militia” – those who blame environmental mercury for a host of ills. The fact that some anti-vaccinationists seek to provide their children on the autism spectrum with unconventional biological treatments, based on their disproved “toxin” hypothesis, made them natural allies with the alternative medicine community. Both seek freedom from &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1826"&gt;pesky regulation&lt;/a&gt;, and rail against the perceived deficiencies of science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ideological alliance is brewing – that between the anti-vaccine movement and extreme environmentalists. This post is not a commentary on environmentalism, and please do not take it as such – the purposes and claims of the two movements are quite distinct. But they share a common thread: distrust of scientific experts and government regulators who reassure the public that environmental exposures are safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been the most prominent environmentalist to take up the anti-vaccine cause, in several articles and speeches. While he appears to be only a part-time anti-vaccinationist, his celebrity and street cred among environmentalists lend a great deal of weight to his &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=58"&gt;paranoid musings about scientific fraud&lt;/a&gt; and government cover ups. It seems he wants to recapitulate the moral clarity that his uncles displayed in the 1960s, defending the little guy against abuses by the powerful and privileged. He is ready to see a conspiracy, and he wants to be the crusader for environmental justice – and if kids are the alleged victims, all the better. His article in the Huffington Post – “Attack on Mothers,” says it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there appears to be another environmentalist, who is also a journalist, getting into the anti-vaccine game – one Steven Higgs who writes for The Bloomington Alternative. He came to our attention recently when he wrote a fawning piece about Generation Rescue’s J.B. Handley. David Gorski and I attempted to reason with him over e-mail, but the result indicated to us that Higgs is not an objective journalist but an anti-vaccine activist – and he came to this position largely through his environmental activism – a budding RFK Jr. (David covers this topic also over at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4621"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt; today.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/10323"&gt;In a recent article Higgs wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent most of the past 28 years journalistically investigating  conflicts between environmental victims and experts in the relevant  fields. And, I can say without qualification, the victims have been  right and the experts wrong in every significant story I’ve covered. I  can’t think of a single exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a definitive statement should raise a red flag – no qualifiers or exceptions? That sounds like confirmation bias. Many of the famous environmental cases usually end ambiguously, in that there is no definitive scientific evidence of harm from the environmental exposure, but the families and activists believe they have been harmed. So I guess if someone always sides with the alleged victims, regardless of the scientific evidence, that could confirm the belief that the victims are always right and the experts always wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source of confirmation bias is that when claims of environmental toxicity first come to light, the standard scientific approach is to be cautious but investigate. Good scientists are initially skeptical, and require a threshold of evidence before they accept a claim. So initially scientists may say, “Wait a minute, slow down, this evidence is not compelling, we need better evidence.” If eventually the evidence suggests that there was environmental toxicity, then Higgs and others can claim that the experts were wrong – but this is a gross misreading of the nature of scientific skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924521,00.html"&gt;This article from 1980 about the Love Canal&lt;/a&gt; is a good example – the scientists are simply calling for better evidence, but that can be interpreted as concluding that there was no problem. Love Canal also demonstrates that these issues are complex. There were toxins being dumped into the environment by industry who tried to deny responsibility, local residents were exposed, but the actual health consequences remain a bit controversial, and were likely not as bad as the worst of the media hype suggested. But eventually the science sorted itself out and the government cleaned up the spill and relocated all the residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson is – that environmental stories like this one are complex, and anyone who takes a one-sided position “without qualification” is either not looking into it deeply enough or has an axe to grind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of thimerosal in vaccines is far more complex. When I first looked deeply into this issue I actually was not sure which way I would go – I wanted to get the bottom line correct, and did not want to commit myself without fully wrapping my head around this complex story. At points in my research I felt there might really be something going on. It wasn’t until after I fully digested all the science and all the arguments that I was convinced there is no correlation between vaccines and autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Higgs claims to have done the same thing, as an environmental journalist, but he came away with the opposite conclusion. I am interested in why – how can two people look at the same information and come to opposite conclusions? Of course, I think I am correct (although I am always willing to reconsider my position in light of new information or arguments) and I detect in Higgs the tell-tale signs of bias, as I noted above. Higgs was prepared for an environmental scandal, and he found one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also seen many intelligent and well-meaning people get sucked into a complex pseudoscience – essentially they are overwhelmed by misinformation in an area where they lack expertise, and therefore cannot put that information into context. When one is confronted by a large volume of information all pointing in one direction, it seems compelling. I have even known skeptics who, after watching Loose Change, thought there had to be some hanky panky going on with 9/11. I have debated creationists who are loaded with information – all subtly distorted against evolution. Sophisticated and complex pseudosciences are a nuisance in this way, and the anti-vaccine movement has now developed into just such a pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more interesting is how Higgs has responded to scientists with whom he disagrees – and this reflects the danger of “going down the rabbit hole” of a complex pseudoscience, especially those with a conspiracy angle. Higgs wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with respect to vaccines and autism, I say again, without reservation, parents like J.B. Handley and grandparents like Dan Burton are right about vaccines and autism. The experts are wrong, and their behaviors — their vitriolic attacks upon those who disagree, their underhanded political tactics — suggest they know they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know we are wrong? The undeniable implication (although Higgs denied this to me and David in an e-mail) is that we are lying. We are therefore complicit in a cover up. Also – look at the extreme bias. Higgs thinks that scientists are guilty of “vitriol.” Mostly, scientists will sharply but accurately criticize Handley and his ilk, and some science bloggers will get “insolent” and that can be considered vitriolic. But it is nothing – nothing – compared to the personal smear campaign that Handley and others have launched against those scientists trying to educate the public about vaccines. Remember the infamous “baby-eating” Photoshop job that was published on Handley’s propaganda blog, Age of Autism (and then taken down after it disgusted even the vitriolic echochamber of that blog community). Higgs’ characterization of the situation is so out of touch with reality that it is inexcusable for a journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note the populist anti-intellectualism of stating that the experts are always wrong. This reminds me of creationist McLeroy’s famous comment, “Somebody has to stand up to those experts.” In his e-mail to us, Higgs coupled this with the argument ad populi logical fallacy, that he must be right because the anti-vaccine movement has successfully scared much of the public about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also stated that what scientists do is not hard – “That,” as Yoda said, “is why you fail.” Forgive me, but science is hard. That is, doing rigorous science, or even just properly interpreting a complex set of scientific data, is complex, tedious, and exacting. There are numerous pitfalls, and even experienced scientists can get it wrong. We need a community of scientists poring over methods and data, and correcting each other, to grind out a consensus. I’m sorry, but being a passionate journalist (or parent) does not qualify you (as Handley himself &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523"&gt;has demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; on numerous occasions). It is worse to not even have any pause about the fact that the scientific community disagrees with you. That is hubris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am willing to believe that Higgs and others are sincere crusaders, who are just grossly mistaken in their approach and conclusions. Higgs and Handley are not willing to give us the same courtesy – they think we are lying, dishonest, and on the take. They demonstrate that personal attacks is what you do when you don’t have science or even logic on your side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the details of the analysis of the scientific evidence, Higgs buys the anti-vaccine propaganda down the line. Clearly he has consumed Handley’s campaign of misinformation. With regard to a large CDC study showing no correlation between thimerosal and neurodevelopmental disorders, Higgs writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, titled “Early Thimerosal Exposure and Neuropsychological  Outcomes at 7 to 10 Years,” found that exposure to mercury between birth  and 28 days was related to significantly poorer “speech articulation.”  It also found a “significant negative association with verbal IQ” among  girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=17"&gt;I have dealt with this this claim here&lt;/a&gt; – essentially the study looked at many outcomes, and a couple (when looked at individually) were correlated greater than chance, some positive, and some negative. But when considered as a whole, this is what we expect from chance alone. In other words, the results of this study are exactly what we would predict if there were no correlation between thimerosal and any neurodevelopmental disorder. Put into scientific parlance – this study fails to reject the null hypothesis. Understanding statistics on this level is one of those things experts do that Higgs thinks is so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higgs also engages in massive cherry picking. He still thinks that thimerosal is responsible for an epidemic of autism – even though the evidence suggests &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1374"&gt;there is no epidemic of autism&lt;/a&gt;. But more to the point – the final nail was put into the coffin of the thimerosal hypothesis when almost all of the thimerosal was removed from the vaccine schedule by 2002. The anti-vaccine crowd (most notably David Kirby – another journalist gone astray) predicted that autism rates would plummet. &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=159"&gt;They didn’t – they continued to rise.&lt;/a&gt; I and others predicted they would continue to rise, but ultimately would have to level off once diagnostic rates reached saturation. There are some early signs that diagnoses are starting to level off, but it’s too early to say yet. But they did not plummet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higgs is now trying to use some recent and minor decrease in a &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/articles/2010/01/24/10291"&gt;narrow data set in the Ohio Valley&lt;/a&gt; to conclude that the much predicted decline in autism rates is finally here (better late than never). He does not mention that the California data, which is the data that the anti-vaccine crowd originally used to argue for a correlation – shows no decline. David takes down this argument further on SBM – for example, the rates are leveling off for all age groups, not just the youngest cohort, which is what you would predict if this were really an effect of removing thimerosal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode also reminds me of David Kirby, who in 2005 was trumping a very short-term downward deflection in the California numbers and happily extrapolating to the predicted “plummet.” But short term trends cannot blithely be extrapolated – as the California data showed. It was just a fluctuation – but the trend continued upward at the same slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Higgs appears to be another player in the anti-vaccine scene. His path to this particular pseudoscience appears to be (like RFK Jr.) through environmental activism. But the intellectual failings are the same that skeptics encounter over and over again in denial and pseudoscience. Higgs is cherry picking data, dismissing experts, misunderstanding statistics, and engaging in massive confirmation bias. He then shields himself from the very people who can point out his errors by denigrating them and writing them off as tainted (the Handley method).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile he embraces the likes of J. B. Handley and turns a blind eye to his shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to examine people like Higgs the way doctors study disease – there is pathology there, and by understanding it perhaps we can get better at fighting it. I tried the “seek common ground and understanding” approach over e-mail with Higgs, but he was not interested. Maybe my observations gave him a moment of pause. I doubt it, but I try never to give up on optimism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271078450406"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/welcome_the_newest_scibling_36.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f17bafe01bda4a28</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Welcome the newest SciBling</title><published>2010-04-12T14:17:13Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T14:17:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/7tUsHajp7jc/welcome_the_newest_scibling_36.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/welcome_the_newest_scibling_36.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/2010/04/welcome.php" title=""&gt;say Hello&lt;/a&gt; to Jason Goldman, the proprietor of the newest addition to the Scienceblogs Borg, over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/" title=""&gt;The Thoughtful Animal&lt;/a&gt;.

Once the notion that mercury  in the form of thimerosal in vaccines might be responsible for  neurodevelopmental disorders (it’s not) become popular in the  anti-vaccine crowd, this made them natural allies with the  “mercury-militia” – those who blame environmental mercury for a host of  ills. That fact that some anti-vaccinationists seek to provide their  children on the autism spectrum with unconventional biological  treatments, based on their disproved “toxin” hypothesis, made them  natural allies with the alternative medicine community. Both seek  freedom from &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1826"&gt;pesky  regulation&lt;/a&gt;, and rail against the perceived deficiencies of  science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ideological alliance is brewing – that between the  anti-vaccine movement and extreme environmentalists. This post is not a  commentary on environmentalism, and please do not take it as such – the  purposes and  claims of the two movements are quite distinct. But they  share a common thread: distrust of scientific experts and government  regulators who reassure the public that environmental exposures are  safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been the most prominent environmentalist to  take up the anti-vaccine cause, in several articles and speeches. While  he appears to be only a part-time anti-vaccinationist, his celebrity  and street cred among evnironmentalists led a great deal of weight to  his &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=58"&gt;paranoid musings  about scientific fraud&lt;/a&gt; and government coverups. It seems he wants  to recapitulate the moral clarity that his uncles displayed in the  1960s, defending the little guy against abuses by the powerful and  privileged. He is ready to see a conspiracy, and he wants to be the  crusader for environmental justice – and if kids are the alleged  victims, all the better. His article in the Huffington Post – “Attack on  Mothers,” says it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Now there  appears to be another environmentalist, who is also a journalist,  getting into the anti-vaccine game – one Steven Higgs who writes for The  Bloomington Alternative. He came to our attention recently when he  wrote a fawning piece about Generation Rescue’s J.B. Handley. David  Gorski and I attempted to reason with him over e-mail, but the result  indicated to us that Higgs is not an objective journalist but an  anti-vaccine activist – and he came to this position largely through his  environmental activism – a budding RFK Jr. (David covers this topic  also over at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4621"&gt;Science-Based  Medicine&lt;/a&gt; today.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/10323"&gt;In a recent  article Higgs wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent most of the past 28 years journalistically  investigating  conflicts between environmental victims and experts in  the relevant  fields. And, I can say without qualification, the victims  have been  right and the experts wrong in every significant story I’ve  covered. I  can’t think of a single exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a definitive statement should raise a red flag – no qualifiers  or exceptions? That sounds like confirmation bias. Many of the famous  environmental cases usually end ambiguously, in that there is no  definitive scientific evidence of harm from the environmental exposure,  but the families and activists believe they have been harmed. So I guess  if someone always sides with the alleged victims, regardless of the  scientific evidence, that could confirm the belief that the victims are  always right and the experts always wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source of confirmation bias is that when claims of  environmental toxicity first come to light, the standard scientific  approach is to be cautious but investigate. Good scientists are  initially skeptical, and require a threshold of evidence before they  accept a claim. So initially scientists may say, “Wait a minute, slow  down, this evidence is not compelling, we need better evidence.” If  eventually the evidence suggests that there was environmental toxicity,  then Higgs and others can claim that the experts were wrong – but this  is a gross misreading of the nature of scientific skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924521,00.html"&gt;This  article from 1980 about the Love Canal&lt;/a&gt; is a good example – the  scientists are simply calling for better evidence, but that can be  interpreted as concluded that there was no problem. Love Canal also  demonstrates that these issues are complex. There were toxins being  dumped into the environment by industry who tried to deny  responsibility, local residents were exposed, but the actual health  consequences remain a bit controversial, and were likely not as bad as  the worst of the media hype suggested. But eventually the science sorted  itself out and the government cleaned up the spill and relocated all  the residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson is – that environmental stories like this one are complex,  and anyone who takes a one-sided position “without qualification” is  either not looking into it deeply enough or has an axe to grind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of thimerosal in vaccines is far more complex. When I first  looked deeply into this issue I actually was not sure which way I would  go – I wanted to get the bottom line correct, and did not want to  commit myself without fully wrapping my head around this complex story.  At points in my research I felt there might really be something going  on. It wasn’t until after I fully digested all the science and all the  arguments that I was convinced there is no correlation between vaccines  and autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Higgs claims to have done the same thing, as an environmental  journalist, but he came away with the opposite conclusion. I am  interested in why – how can two people look at the same information and  come to opposite conclusions? Of course, I think I am correct (although I  am always willing to reconsider my position in light of new information  or arguments) and I detect in Higgs the tell-tale signs of bias, as I  noted above. Higgs was prepared from an environmental scandal, and he  found one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also seen many intelligent and well-meaning people get sucked  into a complex pseudoscience – essentially they are overwhelmed by  misinformation in an area where they lack expertise, and therefore  cannot put that information into context. When one is confronted by a  large volume of information all pointing in one direction, it seems  compelling. I have even known skeptics who, after watching Loose Change,  thought there had to be some hanky panky going on with 9/11. I have  debated creationists who are loaded with information – all subtly  distorted against evolution. Sophisticated and complex pseudosciences  are a nuisance in this way, and the anti-vaccine movement has now  developed into just such a pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more interesting is how Higgs has responded to scientists  with whom he disagrees – and this reflects the danger of “going down the  rabbit hole” of a complex pseudoscience, especially those with a  conspiracy angle. Higgs wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with respect to vaccines and autism, I say again,  without reservation, parents like J.B. Handley and grandparents like Dan  Burton are right about vaccines and autism. The experts are wrong, and  their behaviors — their vitriolic attacks upon those who disagree,  their underhanded political tactics — suggest they know they were  wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know we are wrong? The undeniable implication (although Higgs  denied this to me and David in an e-mail) is that we are lying. We are  therefore complicit in a cover up. Also – look at the extreme bias.  Higgs thinks that scientists are guilty of “vitriol.” Mostly, scientists  will sharply but accurately criticize Handley and his ilk, and some  science bloggers will get “insolent” and that can be considered  vitriolic. But it is nothing – nothing – compared to personal smear  campaign that Handley and others have launched against those scientists  trying to educate the public about vaccines. Remember the infamous  “baby-eating” Photoshop job that was published on Handley’s propaganda  blog, Age of Autism (and then taken down after it disgusted even the  vitriolic echochamber of that blog community). Higgs’ characterization  of the situation is so out of touch with reality that it is inexcusable  for a journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note the populist anti-intellectualism of stating that the  experts are always wrong. This reminds me of creationist McLeroy’s  famous comment, “Somebody has to stand up to those experts.” In his  e-mail to us, Higgs coupled this with the argument ad populi logical  fallacy, that he must be right because the anti-vaccine movement has  successfully scared much of the public about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also stated that what scientists do is not hard – “That,” as Yoda  said, “is why you fail.” Forgive me, but science is hard. That is, doing  rigorous science, or even just properly interpreted a complex set of  scientific data, is complex, tedious, and exacting. There are numerous  pitfalls, and even experienced scientists can get it wrong. We need a  community of scientists pouring over methods and data, and correcting  each other, to grind out a consensus. I’m sorry, but being a passionate  journalist (or parent) does not qualify you (as Handley himself&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523"&gt; has  demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; on numerous occasions). It is worse to not even have  any pause about the fact that the scientific community disagrees with  you. That is hubris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am willing to believe that Higgs and others are sincere  crusaders, who are just grossly mistaken in their approach and  conclusions. Higgs and Handley are not willing to give us the same  courtesy – they think we are lying, dishonest, and on the take. They  demonstrate that personal attacks is what you do when you don’t have  science or even logic on your side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the details of the analysis of the scientific  evidence, Higgs buys the anti-vaccine propaganda down the line. Clearly  he has consumed Handley’s campaign of misinformation. With regard to a  large CDC study showing no correlation between thimerosal and  neurodevelopmental disorders, Higgs writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, titled “Early Thimerosal Exposure and  Neuropsychological  Outcomes at 7 to 10 Years,” found that exposure to  mercury between birth  and 28 days was related to significantly poorer  “speech articulation.”  It also found a “significant negative  association with verbal IQ” among  girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=17"&gt;I have dealt  with this this claim here&lt;/a&gt; – essentially the study looked at many  outcomes, and a couple (when looked at individually) were correlated  greater than chance, some positive, and some negative. But when  considered as a whole, this is what we expect from chance alone. In  other words, the results of this study are exactly what we would predict  if there were no correlation between thimerosal and any  neurodevelopmental disorder. Put into scientific parlance – this study  fails to reject the null hypothesis. Understanding statistic on this  level is one of those things experts do that Higgs thinks is so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higgs also engages in massive cherry picking. He still thinks that  thimerosal is responsible for an epidemic of autism – even though the  evidence suggests there is no epidemic of autism. But more to the point –  the final nail was put into the coffin of the thimerosal hypothesis  when almost all of the thimerosal was removed from the vaccine schedule  by 2002. The anti-vaccine crowd (most notably David Kirby – another  journalist gone astray) predicted that autism rates would plummet. They  didn’t – they continued to rise. I and others predicted they would  continue to rise, but ultimately would have to level off once diagnostic  rates reached saturation. There are some early signs that diagnoses are  starting to level off, but it’s too early to say yet. But they did not  plummet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higgs is now trying to use some recent and minor decrease in a &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/articles/2010/01/24/10291"&gt;narrow  data set in the Ohio Valley&lt;/a&gt; to conclude that the much predicted  decline in autism rates is finally here (better late than never). He  does not mention that the California data, which is the data that the  anti-vaccine crowd originally used to argue for a correlation – shows no  decline. David takes down this argument further on SBM – for example,  the rates are leveling off for all age groups, not just the youngest  cohort, which is what you would predict if this were really an effect of  removing thimerosal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode also reminds me of David Kirby, who in 2005 was trumping  a very short-term downward deflection in the California numbers and  happily extrapolating to the predicted “plummet.” But short term trends  cannot blithely be extrapolated – as the California data showed. It was  just a fluctuation – but the trend continued upward at the same slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Higgs appears to be another player in the anti-vaccine scene.  His path to this particular pseudoscience appears to be (like RFK Jr.)  through environment activism.

Lovecraft's least successful horror stories is "&lt;a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/mc.asp"&gt;Medusa's Coil&lt;/a&gt;", a 1930 collaboration with Zealia Bishop. The story builds to one of the hideous final denouements that Lovecraft liked to end his stories with.&lt;blockquote&gt; Nor was it right that the neighbours should know that other horror which my strange host of the night could not bring himself to tell me--that horror which he must have learned, as I learned it, from details in the lost masterpiece of poor Frank Marsh.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be too hideous if they knew that the one-time heiress of Riverside--the accursed gorgon or lamia whose hateful crinkly coil of serpent-hair must even now be brooding and twining vampirically around an artist's skeleton in a lime-packed grave beneath a charred foundation--was faintly, subtly, yet to the eyes of genius unmistakably the scion of Zimbabwe's most primal grovellers. No wonder she owned a link with that old witch-woman Sophonisba--for, though in deceitfully slight proportion, Marceline was a negress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE END&lt;p&gt;Modern liberal readers of course find "Medusa's Coil" laughable rather than horrific. The reason is that we are neither the misogynists nor the racists that the story presupposes. Lovecraft probably never stopped to think that he might one  day be read by African American women or by anyone who considers such women to be people worthy of common respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded the other day of "Medusa's Coil" by the ending of the five-part TV miniseries &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_%28TV_series%29#Overview_2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Criminal Justice 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's the story of a woman who murders her husband over some dark secret between the two of them. Throughout there are enigmatic hints about some sort of violence or oppression she has suffered from her husband. But the viewer is left to wonder up to the last moment. Before the dramatic conclusion, in the court room, we learn that the husband had made a habit of raping his wife. And then, as the camera pans along the ranks of horrified jurors, we are finally told the shocking truth: &lt;i&gt;it was anal sex&lt;/i&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. OK. So the big thing here isn't that she kept getting raped by her husband, but where, specifically, he put it in her. Are we to take it that if he had just used more conventional means to commit those rapes, then she wouldn't have been driven to kill him? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, forced entry hurts your bottom more than your vagina. But, beyond the physical pain involved, screen writer Peter Moffat clearly expected a strong sodomy taboo among the viewers. In 2009. Moffat very correctly judged that it would have been completely ineffective to use vanilla domestic sexual coercion as a plot twist. We're supposed to be shocked not so much because the woman's bottom hurts, not because she kept getting raped over and over again, but because she has been forced to take part in a Forbidden Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nerve Magazine&lt;/i&gt; ran a "&lt;a href="http://www.nerve.com/Dispatches/Morin/AnalSex/index.asp"&gt;The Mainstreaming of Anal Sex"&lt;/a&gt; article in 1999. &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2126643/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Slate ran theirs in 2005. To readers of &lt;i&gt;Cosmopolitan Magazine&lt;/i&gt; and fans of the &lt;i&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/i&gt; TV show, anal sex is about as controversial as Pilates. Mainstream on-line book stores offer many handbooks on the subject of how you might enjoy your own male or female little tush sexually. It's optional: it's your bottom and you decide what you'd like to try and what you'd then like to try again -- or not. Everybody knows that the basic rule in bed is "consenting adults". Therefore the &lt;i&gt;Criminal Justice&lt;/i&gt; miniseries ends in anticlimax: when we learn that the long-withheld secret is rape we find it sad but banal. Even though it was anal.&lt;/p&gt;

In response to this, the Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Internal Medicine residency program created an innovative inpatient team model, which was published in this month&amp;#39;s New England Journal of Medicine.Study DesignSetting:Faulkner Hospital, an affiliated community hospital with 72 inpatient medicine bedsControl team = General Medical Service (GMS) teamA single attending drawn from a &amp;quot;faculty pool&amp;quot;1 resident, 2 internsA different attending drawn from a &amp;quot;faculty pool&amp;quot; to teach 3 times weeklyIntern call was every 4th night until 10 pmResident stays until 7 pm and then night float residentExperimental team = Integrated Teaching Unit (ITU)2 attendings with each covering half of patients on teamOne attending is hospitalist and the other is an internist or specialistAttendings were selected based on excellent teaching evaluations.Addition of multidisciplinary team members2 residents, 3 internsBoth attendings participated in daily morning rounds for 2 hoursOne attending was available all day for teaching and clinical careIntern call was every 6th night and leaving by noon next dayResident supervised all interns every 4th night until 10 pm, and then night float residentTeam census cap = 15 patientsMethodologyPatients were randomized onto one of 4 teams over a 12-month period. There were 2 GMS and 2 ITU teams each month. An independent observer recorded intern activity on these 4 teams.ResultsResults for the GMS team are shown in blue and ITU team in red.Average patient census per intern = 3.5 patients vs 6.6 patients Overall trainee satisfaction (83% response rate) = 55% vs 78% Intern time spent with learning activities = 10% of total time vs 20% (p=0.01)Intern time spent with teaching activities = 2% of total time vs 8% (p=0.006)Duration of patient hospital stay = 4.61 days vs 4.10 days (p=0.002)There was no difference in time spent with patient care, patient outcome, and patient satisfaction.The authors noted through qualitative responses, that having a dual-attending team was an important factor in greater trainee and attending satisfaction with the ITU team model. Trainees and attendings on the ITU teams enjoyed the increased exchange of ideas and debate, feedback, and different teach styles.Bottom LineThe ITU team is a novel pro-education model which promotes greater attending supervision, a lower patient census, and more time for both self-reflective and structure learning on inpatient Medicine services. This study demonstrates that changes which prioritize education can be implemented without negatively impacting on the quality of clinical care.How is this relevant for Emergency Medicine?There are some fascinating findings from this study which are directly relevant to the field of EM. To me, this study seems to suggest:There should be greater resident and attending staffing in the ED so that the ratio of providers-to-patients is lower. This is especially relevant given that our ED&amp;#39;s are so often crowded and overwhelmed with clinical demands. This may help move education up on the priority list for residents and attendings on shift.For residency programs with ED teaching attending shifts, where an attending physician&amp;#39;s sole responsibility is to teach without clinical responsibilities, preference should be given to attendings who are stellar educators. This was the model used in this study.Future studies should look at the ideal patient load in balanced learning for EM residents.Reference McMahon, G., Katz, J., Thorndike, M., Levy, B., &amp;amp; Loscalzo, J.

Homeopathy, grounded in the belief that water has a memory, just doesn't work. Rational skeptics anger and inflame proponents of homeopathic because we demand evidence of effectiveness. Evidence, according to a concordance of studies, that just doesn't exist.

&lt;p&gt;Parsing is not the only way to fail in this case. Google Translate (which is phrase-based, as far as I know, and doesn't try to parse the input) renders the headline as "derecho de Hungría, el centro y la fecha, obtengan beneficios".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was puzzled about how &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; could be translated as "la fecha" (= "the date"), but then I realized that it's probably from associating the English phrase "so far" with the typical Spanish translation "hasta la fecha".&lt;/p&gt;

We went looking for a small black hole in our neighborhood, maybe a few hundred light-years away, and instead we found a supermassive black hole nearly 7 billion light-years away.  Sometimes astronomy can be that way...

Back in February, my colleagues and I were looking at white dwarfs with the Keck I telescope in Hawaii.  Before our second night started, the astronomers at the neighboring telescope (Keck II, my telescope&amp;#39;s twin) came over and asked if we had time to look at an object for them, because their telescope had the wrong camera for the observations they needed.  We had the time, and agreed.

Their target was discovered by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, a space-based telescope that looks at gamma rays, the most energetic type of light in the Universe.  On February 1, the Large Area Telescope on Fermi, a telescope that maps the entire sky in gamma rays every three hours, had detected a new source of gamma rays.  This new source was long-lived, meaning it was not one of the enigmatic gamma-ray bursts that come and go in a few seconds. Since gamma rays are made by very energetic processes, the Fermi scientists knew that they were seeing something very exciting.

The new gamma ray source that Fermi saw was right in the band 

of the Milky Way as seen from Earth, in the middle of the constellation Cassiopeia. 

 Because most of the stars in our own galaxy appear to be in the band of

 the Milky Way,  Fermi scientists thought we must be seeing something in our own galaxy.  And since gamma rays have to come from very energetic things, we suspected it may be some kind of black hole in the Milky Way.  But while the dust and gas in the galaxy can act like a screen and block many kinds of light, gamma rays can travel right through.  So, if there is a distant galaxy that just happens to appear lined up with our Milky Way, we might be seeing something millions of times further away.  We needed more information.

The natural place to start was to look at pictures of this point of sky in other wavelengths of light.  Some of the astronomers therefore went and looked in X-rays, some in radio waves, and some in optical (visible) light.  And there was something there in all three of those types of light!  In fact, in visible light there are two faint little dots.  This isn&amp;#39;t surprising -- there are so many stars in the Milky Way, you are bound to see one or more stars no matter where you look.  One of these two points of light was the source of the gamma-rays, and one was probably just a normal star.

This is where my white dwarf collaborators and I came into the picture, as we just happened to be sitting in front of the telescope at the right time.  We were asked to get a visible-light spectrum of both sources. Spectra, the splitting of light into its component colors, are like fingerprints.  Each type of object has its own unique spectrum.  Was the Keck telescope, one of the most powerful astronomical tools on the planet, able to tell us what these objects were?  We pointed the Keck telescope and its spectrometer at the two stars, recorded the data, and sent it to the gamma ray astronomers to analyze.

One of the faint spots was an ordinary star.  Ordinary stars don&amp;#39;t produce gamma rays, so this first source was the wrong one.  The second spectrum was something very interesting: a quasar.  Quasars are ginormous black holes located at the centers of galaxies.  As the material near the black hole falls in, it heats up and releases the visible and X-ray light that we were seeing.  We had our gamma-ray source, but it wasn&amp;#39;t nearby.  It was 7 billion light years away, and by chance happened to be lined up with the band of our Milky Way.

Fermi has seen many gamma-ray sources like this one.  When gas is falling into a black hole, it travels faster and faster, often colliding with other gas that is also falling in. The energy from all of this heat is enough to create jets, pencil-thin beams of matter that stream away from the black hole at nearly the speed of light (see the video at the top of this post for an artist&amp;#39;s conception of these jets).  If these jets happen to be pointed at the Earth, we are seeing the most energetic part of the whole system, which means lots and lots of gamma rays.  The amount of gamma rays produced varies as the amount of energy in the jets changes.  Seven billion years later, these gamma rays arrive at the Earth, where we just happen to be looking with a gamma-ray telescope.

Some of the astronomers were a little disappointed.  Giant black holes are really cool, but there are thousands of them known.   Fermi has discovered many new types of gamma-ray sources in our own galaxy, and we were hoping this might be yet another unexpected discovery.  Instead, we had the chance alignment of a very, very distant galaxy with the stars of our own galaxy.  

My part in this whole adventure was small.  I took the optical light spectrum, and I wrote up a paragraph describing how I did that.  Twenty-one other astronomers were involved in the rest of the project, gathering data and analyzing from all kinds of telescope, and each contributing our little niche of expertise to a bigger problem that none of us would have solved individually. 

Our paper on this discovery is still going through the review process, where another scientist is checking over what we did to look for any mistakes or problems with our logic.  Here&amp;#39;s hoping she agrees with our analysis!

&lt;p&gt;The question: “&lt;strong&gt;In general, how religiously observant is your extended family?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/category/richard-wade/"&gt;Richard Wade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; often hears from atheists who have to deal with notoriously religious extended families.  I get emails from people frequently telling me about conflicts they’ve had with religious people at family gatherings.  You would think this is a major problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the data suggests otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/images/extended.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/images/extended.png" title="ExtendedFamily" width="550" height="441"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Just over a quarter of respondents (25.5%) report an extended family that is moderate to intense in its religiosity.&lt;/strong&gt; My surprise is partly an artifact of reportage — the vast majority of my own correspondence and contact with secular parents comes from those in a deeply religious extended family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a third of respondents (35.2%) are in an extended family that ranges from secular to mildly religious, while &lt;strong&gt;the largest proportion (39.2%) are in a situation of significant variety,&lt;/strong&gt; either split along two or more sides of the extended family or scrambled up within the whole.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the problem does exist — and it’s awful when it’s your own family going through it — it may not be as bad a problem as we thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the other questions Dale asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have your children experienced any significant outside religious pressure or indoctrination?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which of the following best describes your feelings about your children’s eventual worldview?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a secular parenting community was established in your area, what (if anything) would make it especially attractive to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you &lt;a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=3867"&gt;look to see what the respondents said&lt;/a&gt;, I urge you to guess what the responses were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Dale says, this may not be scientific, but there’s no reason to think the results are all that inaccurate.  If it is indeed a decent snapshot of atheist parents and their families, then we have to rethink how difficult our situation really is.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccawatson/status/11984749385"&gt;my Tweet&lt;/a&gt; summed up my feeling on the matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins is going to personally arrest the pope. I hope it’s like the video for Sabotage but with old dudes http://is.gd/bo707&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wrong to assume that people would read that and think, “Yes, that is a completely ridiculous headline.” I’m kicking myself for not being clearer, because when Dawkins posted a clarification to say that &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5415"&gt;no, he did not say he’d be personally arresting the pope&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of my Twitter and Facebook followers happily declared that it was all a big hoax. A few others declared that it was all a big publicity stunt on Dawkins’ part, and that it therefore hurt “the skeptical movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bullshit&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins’ clarification explained that while he was not going to swing into action Beastie Boys-style, he does support the actual effort currently underway to hold the Pope accountable for the systematic protection of child abusers. And that, to me, was the entire point: not that Dawkins is involved (though that is a funny image), but that the Pope may in fact answer for his crimes. So no, it’s not all a big, overblown hoax. It is a real and important story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the second point, that this effort will apparently hurt the “skeptical movement”: it won’t, and it’s completely absurd to suggest otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like and admire Massimo Pigliucci, but he is 100% wrong when he posted this (among other things) on my &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/skepchick"&gt;Facebook profile&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;naturally, always a good thing to keep one’s baloney detector set to orange alert. though the basic problem remains: two of the “horsemen” are behind a sensationalistic stunt that has no chance in hell (pun intended) of actually succeeding in the real world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/1exfi4"&gt;&lt;img title="Bad Boys II starring Richard Dawkins &amp;amp; Chris Hitchens, by @LudditeWebDev " src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/badboys-205x300.jpg" alt="Bad Boys II starring Richard Dawkins &amp;amp; Chris Hitchens, by Jen @antiheroine" width="205" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bullshit, Massimo, on several points. Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins lent their support to an effort that was already well underway, and if it weren’t for that support, most people wouldn’t know that this is happening. To describe their support as a “sensationalistic stunt” is pointless cat-fighting. And to describe it as an effort that “has no chance in hell” of succeeding is simply &lt;em&gt;ignorant&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/apr/02/pope-legal-immunity-international-law"&gt;Geoffrey Robertson nicely sums up the case against the Pope&lt;/a&gt;, including his alleged violation of the ICC Statute, which defines a crime against humanity as including “rape and sexual slavery and other similarly inhumane acts causing harm to mental or physical health, committed against civilians on a widespread or systematic scale, if condoned by a government or a de facto authority.” He also dismisses the Pope’s right to sovereign immunity on several levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original article (with the hyperbolic headline) pointed out that this kind of effort has paid off in the past, as with the arrest of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet%27s_arrest_and_trial"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a serious legal effort to hold accountable a man who the evidence suggests has committed a terrible human rights violation involving the &lt;em&gt;raping of children&lt;/em&gt; around the world. If you want to turn up your nose and call it a stunt that’s bound to fail, that’s your prerogative. Just don’t expect to have my respect as a humanist or a skeptic, and do us all a favor and stay out of the way of those who are trying to make a real difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is this effort going to somehow hurt the “skeptical movement?” You may notice that I use the quotation marks here, because I can’t bring myself to seriously consider a movement supposedly based on the defense of rationality that would turn its back on children who are raped by men they trust because those men claim a supernatural being gives them power, wisdom, and the keys to eternal life with a direct line to God’s ear. If we discovered that a world-famous psychic was leading a secretive cabal that protected child rapists, would we be silent? If a world-famous faith healer was using his heavenly persona to molest kids, would we say that it’s not our fight? You might. I couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people suggested to me that Dawkins’ name attached to this effort would turn off religious people who would otherwise support it but who are too close-minded or stupid to examine evidence for themselves and come to a decision. Apparently I have a higher opinion of religious people than those who are making this argument, since I’d like to believe that there are people out there who don’t need to be told what to do by their preacher, and who can agree with a compelling argument from someone they don’t usually agree with. Yet supposedly this isn’t true, so you know what would be great? If we had a prominent theistic religious leader who could lead this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So step right up, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2010/apr/01/catholicism-childprotection"&gt;Bill Donohue&lt;/a&gt;. The floor is yours, &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/04/02/2863269.htm?section=justin"&gt;Archbishop Jensen&lt;/a&gt;! We’re all waiting, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8602644.stm"&gt;Cardinal Sodano&lt;/a&gt;! Lead your flock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re waiting, I’ll be supporting the sensationalistic stunt.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca Watson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271063723578"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/04/four_stone_hearth_call_for_sub_24.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/349eabd4e4bb476e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Four Stone Hearth: Call for Submissions</title><published>2010-04-12T10:02:02Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T10:02:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/81ltp5zVrdk/four_stone_hearth_call_for_sub_24.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/04/four_stone_hearth_call_for_sub_24.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The 90th &lt;a href="http://www.fourstonehearth.net/"&gt;Four Stone Hearth&lt;/a&gt; blog carnival will run at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://ahotcupofjoe.net/"&gt;A Hot Cup of Joe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;There is something very offensive about the idea that a ‘bachelor of science’ degree can be awarded by a university, as a prize for memorising gobbledygook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the contents of the ‘degrees’ has been exposed to public ridicule, many universities have stopped doing it.  All (or nearly all) of these pseudo-degrees have closed at the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885"&gt;University  of Salford&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485"&gt;University of Central Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2914"&gt;Robert Gordon University&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881"&gt;University of Buckingham&lt;/a&gt;, and even at the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329"&gt;University of Westminster&lt;/a&gt; (the worst offender), one course has closed (with rumours of more to follow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" width="100%"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve already written about the course in Traditional Chinese Medicine at the University of Salford (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1950"&gt;Chinese medicine -acupuncture gobbledygook revealed&lt;/a&gt;) and at the University of Westminster: see &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043"&gt;Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients&lt;/a&gt;. The former has closed, but not  the latter. Here is another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One place that has yet to come under close scrutiny is &lt;a href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/"&gt;Middlesex University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/michael_driscoill.jpg" alt="Michael Driscoll"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael Driscoll, VC of Middlesex University. The buck stops with him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their “Complementary Health” courses are as follows (April 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="complementary_health_sciences_ayurveda_bsc" href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/complementary_health/complementary_health_sciences_Ayurveda_bsc.aspx"&gt;Complementary Health Sciences (Ayurveda) Degree, BSc Honours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="herbal_medicine_bsc" href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/complementary_health/herbal_medicine_bsc.aspx"&gt;Herbal Medicine  Degree, BSc Honours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="traditional_chinese_acupuncture_bsc" href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/complementary_health/traditional_chinese_acupuncture_bsc.aspx"&gt;Traditional Chinese Acupuncture Degree, BSc Honours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="traditional_chinese_medicine_bsc" href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/complementary_health/traditional_chinese_medicine_bsc.aspx"&gt;Traditional Chinese Medicine Degree, BSc Honours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and also two postgraduate courses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="ayurvedic_med_msc" href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/complementary_health/ayurvedic_med_msc.aspx"&gt;Ayurvedic  Medicine, MSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="chinese_medicine_msc" href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/complementary_health/chinese_medicine_msc.aspx"&gt;Chinese  Medicine, MSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Middlesex University for samples of their teaching materials under the Freedom of Information Act, and, as usual, the request was refused.  As usual, I then asked for the mandatory internal review of the decision, and this time, most unusually, the internal review did not confirm the initial refusal and I was sent a bundle of teaching materials about Chinese Herbal Medicine, It was not all I asked for, but it is quite enough to show the absurd ideas that are still being taught as part of bachelor of Science degree in a UK University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are the ideas absurd, pre-scientific, indeed antiscientific.  They are also dangerous. People who have been taught this nonsense are going out and being let loose on sick people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, &lt;a href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/Executive/index.aspx"&gt;Professor Michael Driscoll&lt;/a&gt;, is an economist, not a biologist.  Surely you don’t need to be a scientist to feel a bit suspicious when you read on the Middlesex web site about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion including distribution of meridians-collaterals and location of acupoints; needling and moxibustion techniques;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have any of the members of &lt;a href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/Executive/index.aspx"&gt;the Executive&lt;/a&gt; ever thought to ask about what goes on in these courses?  Even if it is beyond an economist to see through the nonsense, surely it should be possible for Professor Margaret House, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Academic, whose interests lie in water quality, should be able to, though as Dean of the School of Health and Social Sciences she appears to sponsor the nonsense. And Professor Waqar Ahmad, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research and Enterprise, who has written a s book on Ethnicity, Health and Health Care, should surely be able to distinguish sense from nonsense in health care? In that respect, I’d have less confidence in Katie Bell, Chief Marketing Officer, who joined Middlesex University in 2009 following a career in brand marketing for Nestlé UK and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Marketing people seldom have much regard for truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have any of the &lt;a href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/governors/Biographies/index.aspx"&gt;University’s Governors&lt;/a&gt; ever asked what is going on in their name?  It’s true that none of the long list of distinguished-sounding governors is a scientist. Surely you don’t need to be to question whether or not what follows can be described as ‘science’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that none of these distinguished people has ever bothered to look at the dangerous nonsense that is being taught in their University.  It is not in the nature of ‘managers’ to look far beyond ticked-boxes and profit,  They should have done of course, but to make it easier for them, here is a small selection of the slides that I was sent (the copyright for them lies with the university: these few slides come under the heading ‘ ‘fair quotation’ and it is undoubtedly in the public interest to show them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course CMH 1211&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-1211-1.jpg" alt="chm 1211" width="500" height="374"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-1211-2.jpg" alt="chm1211" width="500" height="378"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uhuh, my spleen qi is well and truly knotted already though when I learned physiology it was not thought that the spleen had much to do with emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-1211-3.jpg" alt="chm 1211" width="478" height="359"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-1211-4.jpg" alt="chm 1211" width="481" height="363"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah so at least the problem of heavy breathers is solved. But high temperature, abdominal pain and abnormal pulse can be signs of serious illness. If your only explanation for them is “preponderant evil Qi”, you are a menace to public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-1211-5.jpg" alt="chm 1211" width="483" height="367"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-1211-6.jpg" alt="chm 1211" width="485" height="363"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these symptoms could be the result of a serious disease. It is not only antiquated nonsense to talk about them in terms of Yin, Yang and Qi.  It endangers people,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course CMH 2212&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese materia medica.  Some of the herbs are likely to contain active ingredients (indeed some are very dangerous). It would be quite possible to study the ingredients of these herbs and to investigate how they work in the light of what has been learned about physiology and pharmacology in the last 200 years.  Pharmacology has a long history of doing that,  But is seems to play no part in this course.  Herbs are “cold” or “hot” and may “check the exuberance of yang”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-2212-1.jpg" alt="chm 2211" width="500" height="374"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-2212-2.jpg" alt="chm 2212" width="500" height="379"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-2212-3.jpg" alt="chm 2212" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-2212-4.jpg" alt="chm 2212" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and so on, just preposterous, made-up nonsense from another era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it were taught as cultural history, it might be interesting. But it is being taught as though it were true, and an appropriate way to treat sick people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course CMH 3214&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-3214-1.jpg" alt="chm 3214"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-3214-2a.jpg" alt="chm 3214"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-3214-2b.jpg" alt="chm 3214"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you trust your child to someone who’d been taught that “causes of paediatric diseases are relatively simple”, and “children are pure yang”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now some Chinese recipes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course CMH 3100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-3100-1a.jpg" alt="chm 3100" width="250" height="29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-3100-1b.jpg" alt="chm 3100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may or may not taste good, but to recommend it for diabetes is seriously irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-chm-3100-2.jpg" alt="chm 3100" width="500" height="92"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The programme specification&lt;/strong&gt; for the “BSc (Hons) Traditonal Chinese medicine” can be &lt;a href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/Assets/BSc%20_Hons_%20Traditional%20Chinese%20Medicine%C2%A0%2018.pdf"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;. [local copy &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/mdx-tcm.pdf"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is written with all the official trappings, just as though the degree was about science.  It isn’t. It is a danger to public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have asked the vice-chancellor, Michael Driscoll, to express his view of these comments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rather unexpected comment from &lt;a href="http://acupuncture.blog.co.uk/2010/04/12/dc-s-improbable-science-blog-dangerous-chinese-medicine-taught-at-university-8352795/"&gt;a London acupuncturist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At least,I knew that Professor David Colquhoun is very skeptical about Chinese medicine. he comment Chinese medicine study”not only are the ideas absurd, pre-scientific, indeed antiscientific. They are also dangerous. People who have been taught this nonsense are going out and being let loose on sick people.” “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But,I still like to read his blog as His article very is respectable. I think. Look this…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skeptic blog&lt;/strong&gt; featured this post in its &lt;a href="http://skeptic.org.uk/news/2010/2545"&gt;weekly roundup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27 May 2010.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411780"&gt;Times Higher Education reported&lt;/a&gt; the decision of Middlesex University to close its philosophy department. This department seems to have a &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411482"&gt;remarkable reputation&lt;/a&gt;, not least for a post-1992 university. Three academics and four students have been suspended and gagged in classical bullying style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has happened while they continue to teach dangerous rubbish like that described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411780"&gt;a comment at Times Higher&lt;/a&gt;, as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a reflection on the quality of university management that Middlesex has chosen to shut its philosophy department while continuing to run degrees in quackery. These courses not only offer an Hons BSc for memorising chunks of anti-scientific nonsense. They also pose a real danger to patients. See http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of no better illustration than this of the crass nature of the judgements made by Middlesex’s management. They are either ignorant of what constitutes science, or they are corrupt. I see no other possibilities. In either case they should not be running a university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Prof Michael Driscoll owes the world an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

Guess who is opposing the bill. No, it&amp;#39;s not NAMBLA. No, it&amp;#39;s not a mob of sexually precocious toddlers. It&amp;#39;s…&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/04/11/connecticut.abuse.bill/index.html?hpt=T1"&gt;the Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;! You probably didn't see &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; one coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason they oppose it isn&amp;#39;t some conservative legal principle. They spilled the beans already — it&amp;#39;s the cost to the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed change to the law would put "all Church institutions, including your parish, at risk," says the letter, which was signed by Connecticut's three Roman Catholic bishops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh? Why are they worried? Do they have a gang of septuagenarian child molesters tucked away somewhere in the bosom of the Connecticut church?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/an_interesting_admission.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/WCBD66pI-78" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271050761841"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=3094">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/67b2e36cc39aa14d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="Blogroll"/><category term="Challenges to Science"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="Podblack Finds"/><category term="Podcasting"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Psychology"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="philosophy"/><category term="Barbara Drescher"/><category term="books"/><category term="child health"/><category term="Dawkins"/><category term="ethics"/><category term="Ethics-Based Option to Scripture"/><category term="internet"/><category term="Jim Wallace"/><category term="Leslie Cannold"/><category term="Michael McRae"/><category term="NSW"/><category term="Pope visit"/><category term="Reed Esau"/><category term="Richard Dawkins"/><category term="scripture"/><category term="techonology"/><category term="The Age"/><category term="Tribal Science"/><category term="twitter"/><category term="UK"/><category term="Woo fighters"/><title type="html">Podblack Finds For 12th April 2010</title><published>2010-04-12T04:46:59Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T04:46:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/j4biPhiEUjU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2010/04/podblack-finds-for-12th-april-2010/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skepticallyspeaking.com/episodes/55-science-education"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Picture-3.png" alt="" width="278" height="188"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;A quick-round up for the start of the week – then it’s back to work for me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly – Jim Wallace is not happy about ethics classes being offered to students from NSW as an alternative to scripture… &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/you-cant-teach-ethics-without-referring-to-christianity-20100409-rxai.html"&gt;Opinion, The Age:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/you-cant-teach-ethics-without-referring-to-christianity-20100409-rxai.html"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/you-cant-teach-ethics-without-referring-to-christianity-20100409-rxai.html"&gt;You can’t teach ethics without referring to Christianity:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;With our nation having just played host to a big atheist convention trumpeting the intellectual superiority of unbelief, many may well be wondering why we still bother gazetting an extended long weekend to celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. For future generations this perplexity will grow if the NSW Government, dancing to the tune of intolerant secularists, has its way in our schools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…it just gets &lt;em&gt;nastier&lt;/em&gt; from then on in. You have been warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read Leslie Cannold’s article to compare – &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/find-these-kids-an-alternative-for-gods-sake-20100411-s0c7.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find these kids an alternative, for god’s sake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to know more about the &lt;a href="http://www.humanrightsconsultation.gov.au/www/nhrcc/submissions.nsf/list/33A33D332F6E653BCA2576180003F0D0/$file/Coleen%20MacKinnon_AGWW-7SXDS2.pdf"&gt;Towards an Ethics-based Option to Scripture in NSW Primary Schools (pdf) -&lt;/a&gt; you can also check out the &lt;a href="http://www.ethics.org.au/living-ethics/towards-ethics-based-complement-scripture-nsw-primary-schools"&gt;St James Ethics Centre&lt;/a&gt; and listen forthcoming podcast interview I plan to do with Stephen Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEWLY LAUNCHED! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://woofighters.org/about-3/"&gt;Woo-Fighters!&lt;/a&gt; Tune into the next &lt;a href="http://www.skepticallyspeaking.com/episodes/55-science-education"&gt;Skeptically Speaking radio show this Friday&lt;/a&gt; (Saturday for those in Australia) to hear not only the creator, Prof Barbara Drescher, but my soon-to-be-published by Random House friend, Michael McRae!&lt;em&gt; The purpose of the &lt;a href="http://woofighters.org"&gt;Woo Fighters organization&lt;/a&gt; is to promote critical, skeptical, and scientific thinking by inspiring students to become active promoters of scientific skepticism and defenders of science. At present, the founding chapter of Woo Fighters is a recognized entity at &lt;a title="CSU Northridge" href="http://www.csun.edu/"&gt;California State University, Northridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s been happening on Twitter? A discussion on whether he recent &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5415"&gt;‘it’s &lt;em&gt;not actually true&lt;/em&gt;‘ statement by Prof Richard Dawkins about the ‘arrest the Pope’ claim has anything to do with skeptical activism:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Daniel_Loxton"&gt;&lt;img style="border:1px solid black;margin:1px" src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Picture-52.png" alt="" width="348" height="313"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003366"&gt;Needless to say, I did NOT say “I will arrest Pope Benedict XVI” or anything so personally grandiloquent. You have to remember that The Sunday Times is a Murdoch newspaper, and that all newspapers follow the odd custom of entrusting headlines to a sub-editor, not the author of the article itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003366"&gt;What I DID say to Marc Horne when he telephoned me out of the blue, and I repeat it here, is that I am whole-heartedly behind the initiative by Geoffrey Robertson and Mark Stephens to mount a legal challenge to the Pope’s proposed visit to Britain. Beyond that, I declined to comment to Marc Horme, other than to refer him to my ‘Ratzinger is the Perfect Pope’ article here: &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5341"&gt;http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5341&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003366"&gt;…Even if the Pope doesn’t end up in the dock, and even if the Vatican doesn’t cancel the visit, &lt;strong&gt;I am optimistic that we shall raise public consciousness to the point where the British government will find it very awkward indeed to go ahead with the Pope’s visit, let alone pay for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [My emphasis]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, people starting up Facebook groups urging Dawkins to Rugby-tackle the Pope into an arrest are clearly just being a little too enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also had the likes of Skeptic’s Daniel Loxton discussing what is the best path for skeptics to take (as shown in the screen-shot), including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Daniel_Loxton/status/12014172088"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Justice and law should involve critical thinking and science, but science-minded people need not agree about right and wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite liked &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/reedes/status/12014526398"&gt;Reed Esau’s balanced approach&lt;/a&gt; too: &lt;em&gt;“Skepticism has a defined scope, as established by CSICOP during its founding. See also Loxton’s WDWGFH [PDF -&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/WhereDoWeGoFromHere.pdf"&gt;Where Do We Go From Here?]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;… &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/reedes/status/12015336938"&gt;agreed that skepticism does have broad application, but if an activist wants to get shit done, pragmatically she has to limit scope&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I will say that Daniel Loxton’s : &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Daniel_Loxton/status/12018237435"&gt;OK, we need a baseline. Show of hands. Who thinks, “Who was the best Star Trek captain?” is within the cope of scientific skepticism?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is utterly bonkers and he will be buried in Tribbles for daring to ask such a question. It’s &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; Jean-Luc Picard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a find by Leslie Cannold, the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8611045.stm"&gt;BBC recently stated what I kind of thought was ‘the bleedin’ obvious’: Internet child health advice ‘wrong’ – Many people use the internet to find health information!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typing your child’s medical problem into Google is unlikely to deliver much in the way of good advice, UK researchers have said. The Nottingham-based team used the search engine to find UK-based advice on five common issues, including breastfeeding and autism. Only about 200 of 500 sites offered correct information, Archives of Disease in Childhood reports. Government-run sites were the only completely reliable source, they found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally – &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/dcommandatore/2010/04/08/autism-needs-progress-not-self-obsessed-celebrities/"&gt;Big Hollywood – Autism Needs Progress, Not Self-Obsessed Celebrities&lt;/a&gt;. Well said…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then, I turned to the Internet and saw Jenny McCarthy begging people to vote for her anti-vaccination charity, Generation Rescue, to win $250K from the “Pepsi Refresh Everything Project.” In a somewhat &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlE6pMVIPwE&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;crazed plea&lt;/a&gt;, McCarthy promises that she will spend everyday for the rest of her life helping raise money for these autistic kids.  And then I heard something from way out in left field.  Yoko Ono was named the first-ever “World Autism Ambassador” by Autism Speaks.   Huh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The month was getting off to a bad start and then something good happened.  HBO aired &lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/a-mothers-courage-talking-back-to-autism/index.html#/documentaries/a-mothers-courage-talking-back-to-autism/video/a-mothers-courage-talking-back-to-autism.html/eNrjcmbOYC7ULMtMSc13zEvMqSzJTHbOzytJrShRz89JgQkFJKan+iXmpjLns0knlpbkF+QkVtqWFJWmsjGyMXIyMgIAdc8XOA=="&gt;“A Mother’s Courage: Talking Back to Autism.”&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apparently, the type of awareness that Jenny McCarthy and Holly Robinson Peete are spreading is not helping Margaret Dagmar Ericsdottir or her son.  This former businesswoman turned full-time mother was so starved for helpful information that she had to travel the globe with a film crew to find a way to actually help her severely autistic son, Keli, communicate.  “A Mother’s Courage” was refreshing in that it moved past hearing about how hard it is for parents to accept an autism diagnosis and move toward improving the quality of life of autistic individuals.  Acceptance, understanding and progress are what autistic people need, not celebrities selling books and declaring war on the CDC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to keep commenting on my site and ask questions – remember that the &lt;a href="http://www.tokenskeptic.org"&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are still coming out even though I won’t be here much for this week!&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ll be back writing later next week – feel free to give feedback as always.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, it’s pretty cool to read about the ‘&lt;a title="sexy scandal" href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/94543"&gt;sexiest plagiarism scandal of 2008′&lt;/a&gt;. And all because of animal sex and romance fiction! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit upfront and proudly that I’m a fan of romance novels. Yes, from the trashy ones to the ones you grumbled about having to write essays about. The reasons are simple – &lt;em&gt;firstly, the genre is fantastic for introducing students to writing fiction&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, ‘romance’ is educational on many different levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romance is a subject of serious study in Psychology, with a lot of research on breaking down the different facets of attachment and analysing how romantic relationships contribute to one’s personal development. ‘Intimacy versus isolation’ (as Erikson puts it) can be traced to how you interacted from a young age with your parents, including infancy (Scharf, Mayseless &amp;amp; Kivenson-Baron, 2004). So, with that much impetus to make a connection in our lives – why should we be ashamed of supporting &lt;img src="http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3485/image112aq1.jpg" alt="good books" width="280" height="210" align="left"&gt;a writing tradition which creates &lt;a title="mills and boon" href="http://www.millsandboon.co.uk/"&gt;massive publishing industries&lt;/a&gt;, is a significant part of &lt;a title="P&amp;amp;P" href="http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/pridprej.html"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, on the stage, screen and page – as well as reflecting an important part of life as we know it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly when encouraging young women who are resistant readers, suggestions like reading and critiquing &lt;a title="gg" href="http://www.gossipgirl.net/"&gt;Gossip Girl&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a title="stephanie myers" href="http://www.stephaniemyers.com"&gt;Twilight&lt;/a&gt; Series and &lt;a title="shottp" href="http://www.randomhouse.com/teens/sisterhoodcentral/"&gt;Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants&lt;/a&gt; are a great way into exploring literature and enjoying books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of ‘&lt;a title="sbtb" href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/"&gt;Smart Bitches, Trashy Books&lt;/a&gt;‘ since last year, I’ve enjoyed the blog; reading advice and checking out the links that reinforce the value of this genre as an artform – and as a really fun teaching tool. Especially when blog entries request for authorial advice like &lt;a title="paranormal romance education, stat!" href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/index.php/weblog/gs_vs_sta_a_sci_fi_writer_needs_a_romance_education_stat/"&gt;‘I want to write paranormal romance – what’s the stuff to avoid and what should I include?’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I’ve used books in the “&lt;a title="english quest" href="http://www.jaconline.com.au/engine.jsp?page=titlesearch&amp;amp;gensearch$A$PDIV=SCH&amp;amp;gensearch$ANXTSCREEN=SEARCH&amp;amp;gensearch$A$PTYPE=CT&amp;amp;gensearch$A$PCODE=ENGLDR&amp;amp;library=english&amp;amp;SD=7"&gt;EQ” – English Quest&lt;/a&gt;” series in my high school classes. They meet the requirements of English outcomes and have a great range of activities, including one on writing romance fiction. Taking a chapter from the Harlequin Romance novel ‘&lt;a title="english bride" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/English-Bride-Legends-Outback-Harlequin/dp/0373158653"&gt;The English Bride&lt;/a&gt;‘ by Australian author Margaret Way, students break down the elements of characterisation, structure and most fun of all – learn how to use adjectives powerfully!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the exercises they do whilst reading the selected passages in EQ is highlight all the analogies to ‘lions’ that are used to describe the hero of the story. He’s tawny, with a mane of dusty locks that peek from beneath his Akubra hat. &lt;em&gt;His muscular arms clench manfully around her as he guides her with his paw-like embrace into the steamy&lt;/em&gt; … okay, you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that the cliches would be a turn-off – but it’s the challenge of finding new ways to describe settings, capture characterization with evocative and interesting uses of language. I must point out, however, I warn my students that if they get a little TOO evocative, that they might have to face reading out their faux-romance novel chapter to the class… that makes them selectively stop just before the &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interesting pages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when hearing that Paul Tolme was alerted to plagiarism of his work ‘&lt;a title="badlands" href="http://www.defenders.org/newsroom/defenders_magazine/summer_2005/toughing_it_out_in_the_badlands.php"&gt;Toughing it Out in the Badlands&lt;/a&gt;‘ (Defenders Magazine, Summer 2005 – on Black-footed ferrets) – by romance-writer Cassie Edwards, author of ‘&lt;a title="shadow bear" href="http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/e/cassie-edwards/shadow-bear"&gt;Shadow Bear&lt;/a&gt;‘… er, I wasn’t really that shocked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sensing her vulnerability, Shadow Bear knows just what to say: “In turn, coyotes, badgers, and owls prey on ferrets, whose life span in the wild is often less than two winters ? They have a short, quick life.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow, that is some bad dialogue. It stands out as clunky and awkward even by the standards of &lt;a title="Romance Novels" href="http://www.newsweek.com/related.aspx?subject=Romance+Novels"&gt;romance novels&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because Edwards didn’t write it. I did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that taking chunks of Tolme’s work &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; shocking and disturbing. But despite the ‘clunky’ misuse as a post-coital-cool-down conversation – recognizing that the relationships in the animal world can be racy, engaging and portray relationships as tumultuous as a story about &lt;a title="P&amp;amp;P" href="http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/pridprej.html"&gt;five unmarried sisters during the Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt;? As the news article in Newsweek demonstrates – watch out &lt;a title="animal planet" href="http://podblack.com/animal.discovery.com/fansites/meerkat/meerkat.html"&gt;Animal Planet!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="book" href="http://www.drtatiana.com/"&gt;Dr Tatiana’s Sex Advice to All Creation: The Definitive Guide to the Evolutionary B&lt;img src="http://img174.imageshack.us/img174/7797/tatianalp9.jpg" alt="the book" width="240" height="180" align="right"&gt;iology of Sex&lt;/a&gt; reflects this brilliantly. Olivia Judson’s book takes stories of the bizarre sex life of animals and teaches about natural history and evolutionary biology… in the form of sex-columns. And you thought they &lt;a title="Sex and the City HBO" href="http://www.hbo.com/city/"&gt;had it tough in the city&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’m a spotted hyena, a girl. The only trouble is, I’ve got a large phallus. I can’t help feeling that this is unladylike. What’s wrong with me?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, my first response was ‘never mind – join the &lt;a title="Scissorsisters band" href="http://www.scissorsisters.com/"&gt;Scissor Sisters&lt;/a&gt;‘, which isn’t correct…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think I’ve made a dreadful mistake. I’ve just lost my virginity to a fellow who recently escaped from a local fruit fly factory… he says he’s put a spell on me so that I’ll never be able to have sex with anyone else… is he all bluff?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s a potentially good plot source for the ‘paranormal romance’ that was being touted earlier… an alien male with his own sexy spells? In this case, it’s all due to an ‘&lt;em&gt;antiaphrodisiac, a chemical that makes her stink, so that males will find her repulsive.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll learn about &lt;a title="oral sex in sea slugs" href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn12922-oral-sex-gene-helps-male-fish-fake-it.html"&gt;oral sex in fish,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="sexy scandal" href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/114049792/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;amp;SRETRY=0"&gt;bestiality and necrophilia&lt;/a&gt; in bacteria, &lt;a title="spiders" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B7GJ0-4NT24ST-1&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=c5b5cbd3ff3714ac5fd4a88e1b26f4ec"&gt;really sad tarantualas who can’t get a girl&lt;/a&gt; and have only two months of life to live, &lt;a title="seahorses" href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03243.x?cookieSet=1&amp;amp;journalCode=mec"&gt;flirty seahorses&lt;/a&gt; that don’t deliver the goods and as you can see from my links – it has inspired me to do even further research to check out the wonders of weird and wacky lives of animals! By the way, this book features a GREAT bibliography and index pages… something that really should be emphasized in this &lt;a title="page four" href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/94543/page/4"&gt;tale of black-footed research banditry in a romance novel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, these tales are not really ‘PG’ in that regards. But in many ways, it’s a pointer as to how we should encourage more animal-related stories in general as material fit for encouraging a love of reading and science… er, as well as learning about how love is really a fascinating topic and not something to be feared of if you discuss it in a rational, informed way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for something for the younger years, I can’t go past a fond favorite. When I was ten, I was given a copy of ‘&lt;a title="mfaof" href="http://www.shoarns.com/MyFamilyandOtherAnimals.htm"&gt;My Family and Other Animals&lt;/a&gt;‘ – if you’re keen on the ‘&lt;a title="durrell" href="http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/durrell.htm"&gt;Alexandria Quartet&lt;/a&gt;‘, you might recognize the famous last name ‘Durrell’. This nature-filled youthful autobiography, however, is by &lt;a title="Gerald Durrell" href="http://www.durrellwildlife.org/"&gt;Gerald Durrell&lt;/a&gt; – the younger brother of the famous poet and chronicler &lt;a title="Lawrence Durrell" href="http://books.google.com.au/books?as_auth=Lawrence+Durrell&amp;amp;ots=MXOS2aXher&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=print&amp;amp;ct=title&amp;amp;cad=author-navigational&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;. Gerald Durrell, like Paul Tolme, was a great supporter of animal conservation and created the famous &lt;a title="Jersey Zoo" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/myfamily/durrell.html"&gt;Jersey Zoo&lt;/a&gt; – which featured in the John Cleese film ‘&lt;a title="fierce creatures" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119115/"&gt;Fierce Creatures&lt;/a&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘My Family and Other Animals’ was the first in a series of animal-packed adventures that lasted all of Durrell’s life, well into adulthood – with healthy helpings of travel journalism, family eccentricities and some of the best breakdowns of the life of little creatures that you’ll ever find. Beautiful descriptions, wonderful prose writing. And often very funny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fruit that [Achilles the tortoise] liked best were wild strawberries. He would become positively hysterical at the mere sight of them, lumbering to and fro, craning his head to see if you were going to give him any, gazing at you pleadingly with his tiny shoe-button eyes… but if you gave him a big one, he behaved in a way that I had never seen another tortoise emulate. He would grab the fruit and, holding it firmly in his mouth, would stumble off at top speed until he reached a safe and secluded spot amongst the flowerbeds, where he would drop the fruit and then eat it at leisure, returning for another one when he had finished.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’d be great if more authors were able to say ‘I read widely, I’m inspired by the world around me and I reference science works based on facts and research when I create fiction.’ Or ‘I was interested in romance literature and nature from a young age and it improved my vocabulary and my appreciation for life on earth – and you hear my unique chat-up lines!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Oh – the moral of the story? Paul Tolme, the man in the center of the ferret fur-flying &lt;a title="spanks!" href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/index.php/weblog/paul_tolme_ive_been_properly_spanked/"&gt;has this to say on the SBTB site:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I urge you to learn more by visiting sites such as &lt;a title="www.prairiewildlife.org" href="http://www.prairiewildlife.org/"&gt;www.prairiewildlife.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="www.defenders.org" href="http://www.prairiewildlife.org/"&gt;www.defenders.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="www.nationalwildlife.org" href="http://www.nationalwildlife.org/"&gt;www.nationalwildlife.org&lt;/a&gt;. Having my work copied in a romance novel has introduced me to an audience of readers I knew little about, and for that I am glad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week was a little hectic (advisor #2 visiting from Wyoming + two days of mass spectrometry time), so I’m just getting around to posting the “Geology Word of the Week” now late on Sunday night. However, all is well as long as I make this post before midnight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s geology word of the week is a word I’m sure you’ve all heard before: &lt;strong&gt;dip&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take a &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;in a pool, you &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;your tango partner, you make chip &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;for a party, you feel weightless for a moment as you go over a &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;in the road, you &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;into your savings to buy a present for your sweetheart, you watch the sun &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;below the horizon, you chew some &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;tobacco (gross… I hope not!), but do you measure strike and &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;with a Brunton compass? If you’re a geologist, then yes! You measure strike and &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In geology, &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;is the amount that a layer (or sequence of layers) of rock is tipped from horizontal. &lt;strong&gt;Dip &lt;/strong&gt;is closely related to strike, which is the compass direction perpendicular to the &lt;strong&gt;dip&lt;/strong&gt;. Together, &lt;strong&gt;dip &lt;/strong&gt;and strike are important measurements for geologists to take in the field as these two measurements allow geologists to map out the 3D structure of rock layers on a 2D map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://homepage.usask.ca/~mjr347/prog/geoe118/images/strike.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dip and strike are &lt;a href="http://www2.gsu.edu/~geohab/pages/geol4013/bruntonCompass.htm"&gt;measured with a Brunton compass&lt;/a&gt;, a fancy compass that is a must-have for the field geologist. By the way, Brunton compasses work better when you wear your cap backwards. It’s true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocks layers are almost always deposited horizontally, so why many rock layers tilted? Most commonly, tilted layers represent rock layers that have been tilted because of squishing and uplift. These rock layers were originally flat, but they’ve been uplifted and tilted because of geological forces. In some cases, the tilting may have been present when the rock formed.  For instance, many sandstone rocks represent sand dunes that have solidified over the centuries from loosely-consolidated sand into solid sandstone rock. Sand dunes have characteristic shapes because of the wind. When these sand dunes are preserved, the tilting is preserved, too, and is called cross-bedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a great movie that show how cross-bedding in sand dunes forms and is then incorporated into solid sandstone rock:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.fossweb.com/CA/modules3-6/SolidEarth/activities/geologylab/faultingandfolding/earth-processes/cross-bedding.htm"&gt;Cool Cross-Bedding Movie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a picture of some great cross-bedding in giant sand dunes in Sedgefield, South Africa:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a title="ImageShack - Image And Video Hosting" href="http://img413.imageshack.us/i/img1805j.jpg/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/3808/img1805j.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those of you who find cross-bedding a little (yawn) boring, here’s a slightly- um- different view of that same cross-bedding:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a title="ImageShack - Image And Video Hosting" href="http://img43.imageshack.us/i/img1811gv.jpg/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/2870/img1811gv.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now that I’ve woken up (hopefully) those of you who may have zoned out, let’s review the new geology lingo: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dip&lt;/strong&gt;: the amount a rock layer is tilted&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Strike&lt;/strong&gt;: a direction perpendicular to dip&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cross-bedding&lt;/strong&gt;: inclined beds in sediments (sand dunes, river sediments) preserved in solid rock&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brunton&lt;/strong&gt;: a fancy dancy compass that every geologist owns. You can measure strike and dip with one of these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woo-hoo! It’s only 11:30 pm EST. I managed to post a Geology Word of the Week this week after all! Off to sleep now as I’m on the mass spectrometer again tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evelyn</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271045979835"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/rent_at_duke.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1973ad34848ded46</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Society"/><title type="html">'Rent' at Duke</title><published>2010-04-12T04:44:23Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T04:44:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/eL7dcTsRPF8/rent_at_duke.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/rent_at_duke.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rent_4C-1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Rent_4C-1.jpg" width="448" height="268" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other night I went to the opening night of &lt;a href="http://duke.edu/web/hoofnhorn/RENTatDuke/index.html" title=""&gt;RENT at Duke&lt;/a&gt;, the latest production of the &lt;a href="http://duke.edu/web/hoofnhorn/" title=""&gt;Hoof 'n' Horn&lt;/a&gt; ensemble, the 'South's oldest student-run musical theater organization' (find them on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/HoofNHorn" title=""&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/HoofNHorn" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;). Here's the promo video, released before the opening night:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/HyiJ2bXIiLc%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x2b405b%26color2%3D0x6b8ab6%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always have difficulty judging plays by amateur ensembles - at exactly which standard should I hold them? I have seen amazing high-school plays and horrible professional ones (I mentioned both in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/10/fizzler_on_the_roof.php" title=""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;), as well as, of course, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/fiddler_on_the_roof.php" title=""&gt;amazing professional ones&lt;/a&gt;. The Duke group is a mix of people with some stage experience and even Broadway aspirations and their colleagues in other majors for whom acting is fun and they take it seriously, but not in terms of a life career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was reassuring, in the car back home, that my wife and I had some very similar reactions and thoughts - this meant I was not crazy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to take this performance. One is curmudgeonly: "these kids are too young to grok it". The other is much more charitable: "they subtly and successfully adapted the early 1990s play for their 2010 audience of peers". Of course, not having interviewed the Director or anyone in the cast, I do not know what their conscious intention was with the play. But I will go with the charitable interpretation here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to 'adapt' a play? On one hand, one can take the main story and completely change the time and place, the names of characters, the details. This is what Akira Kurosawa liked to do to Shakespeare when he adapted &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bad_Sleep_Well" title=""&gt;Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne_of_Blood" title=""&gt;Macbeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ran_%28film%29" title=""&gt;King Lear&lt;/a&gt; to the large screen. The work stands on its own and the knowledge of the original is not necessary for one to understand and enjoy the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, one can take an old play and keep it in its original setting - time and place - but adapt it to a modern audience. I suspect that this is what was done to the original &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/spring_awakening.php" title=""&gt;Spring Awakening&lt;/a&gt;. I have not read the original script, but I assume that it did not contain nudity, or even stylized acts of sex and masturbation. On the other hand, the original probably contained references to geographical places, persons and events that have been lost to memory except for a handful of German historians. After all, the play happens in 19th century Germany. The adaptation also happens in 19th century Germany, but unnecessary details have probably been excised to make the play relevant to today's audiences. What is important is that the cast has to study the place/period while preparing for their roles, and the audience needs to try to transport itself into the said time and place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_(musical)" title=""&gt;RENT&lt;/a&gt; is in itself an adaptation of Puccini's opera &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_boh%C3%A8me" title=""&gt;La Boheme&lt;/a&gt;. While the original opera is set in 1830s Paris, RENT is set in 1980s New York City. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_%28musical%29#Sources_and_inspiration" title=""&gt;There are many parallels&lt;/a&gt;, even some names of main characters remain the same, and the main storyline is certainly the same. When one watches La Boheme on stage, one knows to mentally transport oneself to the 1830s Paris and the cast does its best to convey the atmosphere of that time and place. Yet even La Boheme has had &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_boh%C3%A8me#Modernizations" title=""&gt;adaptations&lt;/a&gt; done over the years - some set in Paris in 1957, some in London, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With RENT, if one has seen it before (I saw it at DPAC a couple of years ago and it was excellent) and knows what it's about (I have heard the soundtrack at home about a gazillion times), one tries to transport oneself to the NYC of the 1980s (or early 1990s). Many of us remember that time - it is so recent (I was not in the States at the time yet - arrived at JFK in 1991 - but the situation was similar around the world, and we were certainly carefully watching from the sides, with some bewilderment and fear, the soap-opera that was Reagan's America). We know the atmosphere of those times: Reagan years, marginalization of The Other, alienation, refusal to take AIDS seriously as "gay disease", etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, AIDS was very new. We did not know much about it - what kind of disease it was, how it was transmitted, who could or could not get it, how long could one harbor the virus before getting sick, if there was a way to prolong one's life or even cure the disease. AIDS at that time was absolutely terrifying! Fear of unknown, coupled with the fear of a debilitating and deadly disease, coupled with horrendous stigma attached to it by the rest of the society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIDS is still a horrible and deadly disease. But it is not as horrifying as it once was. We know much more about it today and there are much more effective treatments that can allow the patients to live decent lives carrying the virus for quite a long time before succumbing. Much of the stigma associated with it is gone as well, as most of new cases are now found among the heterosexual men and women of all ages. Thus we can now deal with AIDS in a much less emotional (and political) and much more rational way. It has become a part of the social milieu, and we have built methods to deal with this problem as a society (how good those methods are is debatable, but they exist, thus we can at least feel complacent about AIDS now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Duke play, for better or for worse, reflects that shift in attitude. AIDS in their version is not as horrifying as in other versions (e.g., at DPAC). While the script (and the stage set) is the same, the acting - posture, movement, facial expression, tone of voice - minimize the terror of AIDS. They are all so.....damned cheerful all the time! Nobody even really, truly dies in their play. Even the officially dead ones immediately hop up and dance and sing with a smile right after the dying scenes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps that is on purpose. Perhaps the new generation is trying - consciously or accidentally - to tell us something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;East Village on Manhattan is just not as dark and dreary as it once was. The artistic avant-garde has, for the most part I hear, moved to Brooklyn. Bohemia, art, drugs, AIDS, freedom, alienation, rebellion, loneliness, desperate search for community - all mixed up (often within the same person) - it's not in Manhattan (or America, for the most part) any more. So it is not in RENT any more either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Duke crew shows us how they can resist being rent apart - in this age of greater tolerance, greater connectivity and community (helped tremendously by the massive spread of cell phones and Internet since the play was written), it is harder to feel lost. One feels it is much easier to find people who can help, find communities to join. Everything is easier when one has friends - and friends are easier to find today than ever in history - just a phone-call (no need to put a coin in the public phone) or a tweet away. Perhaps the experience of 9/11 has changed the attitude of New Yorkers in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kids, just toddlers when the play was first put on stage in 1994, live in a different era - perhaps the grand ambitions are toned down compared to my generation, but the general optimism about the ability to lead a decent, happy life is much greater. Not to be snide about it, but this is Duke students experiencing life in their own social circles, where everything comes easier...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, one is left wondering - are these kids incapable of grasping how dark and desperate and lonely was life for AIDS-riven artists in 1980s NYC? Or are they trying to tell us to stop preaching to them about the bad old times and to get on with the program?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's really hard to tell - I've been thinking about it for two days now and am still not sure. How much is it on purpose, and how much is it just naturally flowing from who they are, their age, their socioeconomic stratum, their generational outlook on life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it on purpose that Mimi is blond and Maureen brunette? It is the other way round in pretty much every other version of RENT. Mimi (remember, her full name is Mimi Márquez) is supposed to be Hispanic in a very obvious, stereotypical way. In every play (or movie or novel or comic strip for that matter), most characters need to be stereotypical, to help the audience orient itself. A transformation of the character into something audience does not expect is often &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; story. Even the voices and the singing styles are reversed. Throughout the play I kept thinking to myself that Ryan Murphy would be a perfect Mimi and Allie DiMona a perfect Maureen. Yet they did it the other way round - why? Is it because of some personal deals behind the scenes, is it some kind of an inter-Duke hierarchy, or is this on purpose, to provide a different vision that should make people like me uneasy, but will make perfect sense to the 99% of their intended audience - the other Duke students? Mimi is supposed to be a dancer at a strip club and Ally does a great job acting like and moving like a dancer at a strip club - something that most Mimis don't emphasize. Is that also a generational change in sensibilities, a greater ease with sexuality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of Angel, probably still pretty shocking back in 1994, is pretty bland here. One of the key characters in traditional versions, Angel is in the background in this version, not having the energy and the seriousness that I think Angel should have. Is that also on purpose? To show that cross-dressing (and dying of AIDS) is not such a big deal any more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ensemble has huge energy whenever they sing together as a chorus. The chemistry they have as a group is palpable. Yet, this chemistry vanishes when they sing duets. Is it because they did not have much time - a few weeks in-between classes (and Blue Devils games) - to rehearse, or was that also on purpose: showcasing the community spirit at the expense of inter-personal relationships, perhaps as a poignant reminder that there are pros and cons to every generation's mindset: this one, perhaps, being more at ease in groups than one-on-one? Or was it accidental, because they are who they are, acting out their own selves? Or is that the case with every generation at that age: feeling more secure in a group than when dealing with others one-on-one, something that one gradually gains with age and maturity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RENT Production Photo.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/RENT%20Production%20Photo.jpg" width="448" height="246" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got free tickets from the producers of this show, and I am aware that this is an amateur college production. I have no inclination to be as critical about each individual's skills or performance as I would do if I paid hundreds of dollars to watch big theatrical names in a top-flight theater. Some of them are excellent singers (Amber Sembly, Brittany Duck, Aidan Stallworth), others excellent actors (Matt Campbell, Robert Francis), a few are both (notably Ryan Murphy, also Brooke Parker), and a few are really not that great, but so what?  They are all having great fun doing this, and it shows, and it was fun to watch. Most of them have no ambition to make theater their profession, so why not have fun while in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alessandra DiMona (Mimi) is interesting - a great presence on stage, and an amazing voice. Yet, listening to her sing, I was thinking of my father (who was a professional singer) and his insistence that Number One trait of a good singer is &lt;i&gt;diction&lt;/i&gt; - every syllable and every word has to be clear and understandable to the last elderly foreigner in the back row of the third balcony. It felt to me like she is in the middle of a transition of her singing training, still enjoying the amazing potential and scope of her voice, but still learning how to discipline it. She can certainly belt out a note or two, but the next note should not be barely audible (and if that is due to movement, e.g., dancing, well, that can be trained as well - general fitness training plus voice training), just to pick up again on the next syllable. I feel like she should hire some old Russian lady teacher of the Old School to drill her several hours a day until she cries....for several months, until that amazing voice is under control. She has a great potential so I hope she gets the necessary training to fulfill that potential. If she does that, she can have a career on Broadway - her voice is that powerful and pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the question of 'adaptation'. When one adapts a 19th century play for 21st century, the audience is aware of that. But how can one subtly adapt a 1980s play for 2010? The intended audience - the Duke students - may have never seen RENT before, may not be aware that it was set in 1980s, may have no idea how life in the 1980s America used to be. But a couple of old geezers in the audience, like me, are going to be confused as we remember the 1980s, the AIDS scare, the isolation and alienation of the Reagan years, and we know where and when RENT is supposed to occur - is this a case of the new generation missing the point of RENT, or is this a case of adaptation to the worldview of the 2010 set? Even if the shift was unintentional, it certainly made me think - something that should be obvious from this review you are reading right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also aware that this was the opening night. Even professionals are nervous on the premiere night. It was visible how the ensemble started out tense and relaxed as the night wore off (and they noticed that no huge disasters happened on stage). They are probably getting better and better each night. You should go and see them if you can - they still have a &lt;a href="http://duke.edu/web/hoofnhorn/RENTatDuke/tickets.html" title=""&gt;few nights to go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/rent_at_duke.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/eL7dcTsRPF8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271045964680"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4621">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fcd5ef23b48aa1b3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience/Mental Health"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="Vaccines"/><category term="age of autism"/><category term="anti-vaccine"/><category term="antivaccine"/><category term="antivax"/><category term="Autism"/><category term="Bloomington Alternative"/><category term="Dan Olmsted"/><category term="David Gorski"/><category term="Indiana"/><category term="J.

Do you notice anything different compared to the last couple of years? I do. Can you guess what it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccine movement’s usual suspects haven’t been all over the mainstream media, as they usually are this time every year, often as early as April 1 or even March 31. In fact, over the last couple of years I had come to dread April 1, not because it’s April Fools’ Day (although the things that made me dread that particular day were often indistinguishable from an April Fools’ Day prank, so full of idiocy were they), but rather the expected carpet bombing of the media by the likes of Jenny McCarthy, J. B. Handley, and their ilk, some or all of whom would show up on various talk shows to spread their propaganda that vaccines cause autism. For instance, last year Jenny McCarthy and her former boyfriend Jim Carrey &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;showed up on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Dr. Jerry Kartzinel (her co-author on her latest book of autism quackery) and J. B. Handley, the last of whom even contributed a &lt;a href="http://larrykinglive.blogs.cnn.com/2009/04/03/lkl-blog-exclusive-autism-is-preventable-and-reversible/"&gt;guest post on Larry King’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, in which he touted an &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/04/autism-and-vaccines-around-the-world-vaccine-schedules-autism-rates-and-under-5-mortality.html"&gt;incredibly bad, pseudoscientific “study”&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;. The “study” (and calling it a “study” is way too generous) was no more than cherry-picked random bits of data twisted together into a pretzel of nonsense, as I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, Jenny McCarthy was interviewed by TIME Magazine, an interview in which she &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=439"&gt;uttered these infamous words&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it’s their fucking fault that the diseases are coming back. They’re making a product that’s shit. If you give us a safe vaccine, we’ll use it. It shouldn’t be polio versus autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, Generation Rescue created a website called &lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt;, which they promoted hither, thither, and yon. The idea of the website was to attack the main studies that failed to find a link between vaccines and autism and to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;promote the pseudoscientific studies that anti-vaccinationists like&lt;/a&gt;. In 2008, it was pretty much the same — well, worse, even. When she appeared on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live!&lt;/em&gt; with our old “friend,” anti-vaccine pediatrician to the stars, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, McCarthy shouted down real experts by yelling, “&lt;a href="http://gawker.com/375647/jenny-mccarthy-calls-bullshit-on-your-medical-science"&gt;Bullshit&lt;/a&gt;!” (behavior &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/03/its-bullst-jenny-mccarthy_n_94854.html"&gt;trumpeted by Rachel Sklar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year? Oddly enough (and to me unexpectedly), there’s been almost nothing. J.B. Handley seems to be the &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/922"&gt;man who wasn’t there&lt;/a&gt;. Well, not quite. It turns out that J. B. Handley has managed to get a little bit of fawning media attention, but just a little bit, in the form of an interview in &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com"&gt;The Bloomington Alternative&lt;/a&gt; entitled &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/10362"&gt;J. B. Handley: It’s unequivocal; vaccines hurt some kids&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently Mr. Handley has come down quite a bit in the world. Where’s his appearance with Jenny on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live!&lt;/em&gt; this year? Maybe it’s coming in the second half of the month. Or maybe the mainstream media, in the wake of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3941"&gt;fall of Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;, have finally figured out how disreputable Generation Rescue is when it comes to vaccines. In the meantime Steven Higgs will have to do as a new mouthpiece for the anti-vaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;J.B. Handley: Anti-vaccine warrior that Steven Higgs loves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of this blog will be able to spot the misinformation and anti-vaccine propaganda spewed by J.B. Handley in this article. There’s no doubt that Mr. Higgs is very impressed by J.B. from the very beginning of his &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/10362"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, which contains these characterizations of Mr. Handley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not like Handley doesn’t understand the vitriol regularly aimed at him by what he routinely calls “the other side.” He is a pointed, straight-talking pain in their asses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;McCarthy’s presence, Handley said, allows him to “hang out in the cheap seats and opine and write my own stuff and challenge people.” And in that regard, his style doesn’t earn him any props with the vaccines-are-sacrosanct crowd — the AAP, the pharmaceutical companies, and the government officials and researchers they financially support. He’s described their positions as “atomic stupidity” in articles he has written. Moron is a term he uses often, in print and in conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even over the telephone from two-thirds of a continent away, J.B. Handley exudes a large personality and supreme confidence in his experiences and conclusions about his son’s autism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Atomic stupidity” describes a lot of what Mr. Handley says on a routine basis when it comes to vaccines and autism, although those of us who’ve butted heads with him in the past tend to refer to it as “burning stupid.” My sarcasm and intense dislike for Mr. Handley aside, given that most of the article consists of typical, run-of-the-mill Generation Rescue anti-vaccine nonsense that I and several of my co-bloggers have &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?cat=36"&gt;refuted time and time again&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Higgs’ little opus might hardly have been worth my notice, much less blogging about, were it not for this passage, in which Higgs swallows whole J.B. Handley’s premature gloating about a post that Steve Novella wrote for SBM in February:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Novella’s piece details a recent study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry titled ‘A Prospective Study of the Emergence of Early Behavioral Signs of Autism’ that tried to figure out when signs of autism first emerge in babies,” Handley wrote. “Ironically, the study Novella references is quite supportive of the theory that autism is caused by the environment and most notably vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The March 2010 study compared two groups of children, one at high risk for autism and one at low risk, and noted the onset of symptoms in children who developed autism. It found no difference in the frequency of visual contact, shared smiles and vocalizations at 6 months. The differences, however, “were significant by 12 months of age on most variables.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3908"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on the Web site Science-Based Medicine, Novella wrote, “What these results indicate is that clear signs of autism emerge between 6 and 12 months of age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novella concluded that the study disproved a link between autism and vaccines. “Many children are diagnosed between the age of 2 and 3, during the height of the childhood vaccine schedule. This lends itself to the assumption of correlation and causation on the part of some parents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an addendum to the blog, Novella acknowledged that he erred when he wrote that line, but he insisted, “Many parents blame their children’s autism on vaccines they received after the true onset of symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Handley didn’t comment on the addendum in his Age of Autism counterpost, he said the original line made him “shout and laugh at the same time.” Children have received 19 shots by 6 months — 52 percent of the total vaccination schedule — when the study says early symptoms of autism begin to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Mr. Handley didn’t comment on (nor did Higgs link to) &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3922"&gt;Steve’s followup post&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/02/dr-steven-novella-makes-the-case-for-vaccine-autism-link-by-mistake.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism post&lt;/a&gt;, because Steve showed very clearly that Handley was, as usual, so wrong that he wasn’t even wrong. In essence, J.B. thought he had found a “gotcha” moment and that one erroneous statement that Steve made in his post was in fact an admission by mistake that the anti-vaccine movement is correct to point out a correlation between the peak ages of autistic regression and the height of the vaccine schedule. Steve admitted his error and then went on to describe clearly why his mistake was not evidence in favor of Mr. Handley’s position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was particularly interesting about Mr. Handley’s response was how much it showed that Mr. Handley has been changing his story and shifting the goalposts over the years. In particular, I noticed this paragraph in which J.B. stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, autism is not an event, it’s a process. It is exceptionally rare that I hear the story, “my son was 100% fine, and at 2 years old after one vaccine appointment he lost everything.” I have heard that story, but very rarely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Mr. Higgs had dug a little deeper, he might have realized that that’s exactly the sort of story I see time and time again presented by anti-vaccine believers, J.B. included, as “evidence” that vaccines cause autism.” Is this the same J.B. Handley who has touted at least since 2005 how common stories of children declining right after vaccines are? Let’s see, a couple of years ago he &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/02/aap-wags-the-do.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;complained to the AAP&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Martin, let me give you a little insight into my world. If I wanted to find parents who had autistic children and who believed their child’s autism was impacted by vaccines, I wouldn’t need to email the nation’s pediatricians hoping I might find one or two. I could just open my window and yell, because these parents are everywhere in my neighborhood and town! Worse, our numbers continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, not a day goes by without Generation Rescue receiving an email from a new parent who watched their child decline following a vaccination appointment with their pediatrician. While you search for the handful of parents with autistic children who may support immunizations, we can’t respond to emails fast enough from the thousands we hear from who feel vaccines contributed to their child’s autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not a day goes by …”? To me that sounded very much as though Handley was arguing that regression after vaccination is very common. Let’s look a bit more, say, from a &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/04/jenny-mccarthy-jim-carrey-dr-kartzinel-jb-handley-stan-kurtz-on-larry-king-live-tonight.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;post J.B. wrote&lt;/a&gt; before going on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live!&lt;/em&gt; last April:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have tens of thousands of case reports of parents reporting that their child developmentally regressed, stopped talking, and was later diagnosed with autism after a vaccine appointment. The number of vaccines have risen along with autism rates, vaccines are known to cause brain damage, and parents report regression and later autism after getting them. Is it really so hard to believe we think vaccines are a trigger?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Tens of thousands of case reports! It appears to me that in his response to Steve there was more than a little bit of goalpost shifting. After all, the “stereotypical” (or “prototypical”) story of the anti-vaccine movement is of the child between the ages of 1 and 3 who is brought to the pediatrician, receives vaccines. Shortly thereafter, or so the anecdote goes, the child loses language and social skills and develops regressive autism. Never mind that, given the number of children who are vaccinated every year and the number of children who develop regressive autism, there are bound to be overlaps such that by random chance alone there will be many children who regress in reasonably close temporal proximity to vaccination. Never mind that no one has ever shown that this regression occurs more frequently in vaccinated children. Anecdotes like the ones J.B. was touting up until (apparently) now are the very “evidence” that the anti-vaccine movement uses to blame vaccination for autism. And, in all fairness, in a single child not studied in the context of populations, such an event can look all the world as though the vaccine caused the regression even when it did not. Even so, the point is that parents who believe vaccines caused their children’s autism don’t blame a process. They blame vaccines, often specific vaccines like the MMR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this article, I wrote Mr. Higgs an e-mail. I’ll admit that my tone was a bit peeved. However, it does bother me whenever a journalist give credence to the words of a man who, in addition to having a six or seven year history of spreading pseudoscience fueled by his unrelenting hostility towards vaccines, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4259"&gt;quite recently publicly gloated&lt;/a&gt; that he and his anti-vaccine movement were “early to middle stages of bringing the U.S. vaccine program to its knees.” My e-mail ultimately led to a three-way e-mail exchange between Mr. Higgs, Steve, and myself, and this led me to the definite conclusion that we have a budding &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/people_making_a_difference/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dan Olmsted&lt;/a&gt; on our hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is Dan Olmsted and why doesn’t any legitimate reporter want to be like him? Olmsted is currently the editor of &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;’s anti-vaccine propaganda blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;. What people who haven’t been following this issue a long time is that Olmsted used to be an investigative reporter and senior editor for United Press International (UPI). Between January 2005 and July 2007, he wrote a series of “investigative” reports in a series that he called &lt;a href="http://www.upi.com/search/?sp=t&amp;amp;sLocation=sStories&amp;amp;ss=%22age+of+autism%22"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; (his first installment predating the Age of Autism blog by nearly three years). In the series, he totally bought into vaccine-autism pseudoscience and presented the conspiracy theory through a combination of the same logical fallacies and bad science that undergirds the anti-vaccine movement, including confusing correlation with causation to blame thimerosal in vaccines or vaccines themselves for autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olmsted’s most infamous gaffe was to be, as far as I can tell, the man who originated the myth that the Amish don’t vaccinate and that as a consequence they don’t get autism, a fallacy that Olmsted first reported in a two-part story entitled &lt;a href="http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2005/04/19/The-Age-of-Autism-The-Amish-anomaly/UPI-95661113911795/"&gt;The Amish Anomaly&lt;/a&gt; (Part 2 &lt;a href="http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2005/04/19/The-Age-of-Autism-Julia/UPI-55491113918060/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2005/10/29/The-Age-of-Autism-The-Amish-Elephant/UPI-44901130610898/"&gt;revisited&lt;/a&gt; time and time again. Of course, the Amish do vaccinate, and there are &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2008/06/how-many-autistic-amish/"&gt;autistic Amish&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Olmsted even &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=69"&gt;missed a clinic&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of Amish country that treats autistic Amish children. Unfortunately, facts &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2008/09/dan-olmsted-suffers-by-comparison/"&gt;didn’t stand in the way&lt;/a&gt; of a good myth, which has only &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;as_q=Amish&amp;amp;as_epq=&amp;amp;as_oq=&amp;amp;as_eq=&amp;amp;num=100&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_filetype=&amp;amp;ft=i&amp;amp;as_sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com&amp;amp;as_qdr=all&amp;amp;as_rights=&amp;amp;as_occt=any&amp;amp;cr=&amp;amp;as_nlo=&amp;amp;as_nhi=&amp;amp;safe=off"&gt;grown in the five years&lt;/a&gt; since Olmsted first imagined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Dan Olmsted left UPI (whether he resigned or was fired, only he and UPI know) and is now the editor of the anti-vaccine crank blog Age of Autism, where he can “report” to his heart’s content, free of any pesky concerns about editors insisting on actual facts and science. Steven Higgs looks as though he’s ready to join him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An anti-vaccine reporter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when it comes to autism and vaccines, it’s not that uncommon for reporters to fall for the myth. The reasons aren’t hard to understand. If there’s one way for a reporter to establish a name for himself, it’s to uncover a big story, the bigger the better. One category of story that is particularly seductive is the huge health scare, particularly if it’s something seemingly benign that is causing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higgs certainly isn’t the first. After all, David Kirby was seduced by the idea that mercury in the thimerosal preservative that used to be in vaccines was the cause of autism. After he published &lt;a href="http://www.evidenceofharm.com"&gt;Evidence of Harm: Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic: A Medical Controversy&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, whatever remained of his journalistic career went into the crapper, leaving him to blog for &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=473"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; and, of course, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/david_kirby/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;. Then there’s a local connection, Steve Wilson, who up until recently was an investigative reporter for a local television station here in Detroit and who also bought into the myth that mercury in vaccines causes autism, a report that I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=71"&gt;duly criticized him for&lt;/a&gt;, even though I did it with some trepidation. My cancer center has a good relationship with the TV station that Wilson used to work for, and I was concerned that I would catch some flak for criticizing his report, which was nothing more than a rehash of the standard anti-vaccine mercury fear mongering. The sad thing is that Wilson did some absolutely outstanding work uncovering the malfeasance of our former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Unfortunately, his skepticism when it came to vaccines was in reality a pseudoskepticism, showing that even good investigative reporters can be crappy science and medical reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Higgs has any redeeming qualities in terms of investigative reporting skills, I don’t know. What I do know is that he has thoroughly drunk the Kool Aid, as demonstrated in spades in a story he published a month ago entitled &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/10323"&gt;Do Vaccines Cause Autism?&lt;/a&gt; In it, he tries to refute a contention by Dr. Phil Landrigan in a recent paper in which Dr. Landrigan stated bluntly (and correctly): “There is no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism.” In the article, Higgs repeated a number of common anti-vaccine tropes, tropes so common that I don’t feel obligated to answer them all, given that virtually all of them have been discussed before right here on this very blog. Some of them are talking points straight from Generation Rescue. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higgs confuses correlation with causation when it comes to thimerosal.&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately, there is a lot of evidence showing no correlation between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. The idea that thimerosal in vaccines cause autism is a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=14"&gt;failed hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been tested scientifically and failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higgs buys the Generation Rescue line that nations with higher vaccination rates have higher autism rates and that vaccination does not correlate with lower childhood mortality.&lt;/strong&gt; This is about &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;as bogus a study as I can imagine&lt;/a&gt;, incompetently performed using cherry-picked data and not even peer-reviewed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higgs cherry picks conclusions from a study of thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders other than autism.&lt;/strong&gt; That particular study produced results that were entirely consistent with random chance correlations from multiple comparisons. Indeed, if Higgs takes the negative correlations seriously, one wonders why he didn’t mention the positive correlations, where children receiving thimerosal-containing vaccines actually had better measurements of neurodevelopmental outcomes. In essence, Higgs &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=17"&gt;cherry picks the bad results&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/a_bad_day_for_antivaccinationists.php"&gt;ignores the good results&lt;/a&gt; when a careful reading of the study shows that, overall, the effects were consistent with random chance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, citing more articles by Mr. Higgs and more refutations of the anti-vaccine talking points that he parrots, but I think you get the idea. If you don’t, I’ll cite Mr. Higgs’ own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent most of the past 28 years journalistically investigating conflicts between environmental victims and experts in the relevant fields. And, I can say without qualification, the victims have been right and the experts wrong in every significant story I’ve covered. I can’t think of a single exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with respect to vaccines and autism, I say again, without reservation, parents like J.B. Handley and grandparents like Dan Burton are right about vaccines and autism. The experts are wrong, and their behaviors — their vitriolic attacks upon those who disagree, their underhanded political tactics — suggest they know they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Mr. Higgs denied this interpretation in his e-mails, both Steve and I interpreted this as an accusation of lying. Like Mr. Handley, Mr. Higgs seems incapable of considering the possibility that we have looked at the evidence and honestly come to a different conclusion. I don’t even think he realizes he is doing it, because he seemed surprised when we pointed out that this passage appears to be accusing us and every scientist who point out that science doesn’t support the idea that vaccines cause autism of not just being mistaken but dishonest. As for “vitriol,” I had to wonder if Mr. Higgs had actually seen some of J.B.’s antics, such as his &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2415"&gt;misogynistic attacks on Amy Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=465"&gt;attacks on Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, me. Although J.B. was apparently not responsible for it, the most infamous of all was Generation Rescue’s portrayal on its propaganda blog Age of Autism of Steve Novella and Paul Offit, along with journalists Amy Wallace and Trine Tsouderos (both of whom had written exposes of the antivaccine movement in 2009) as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4259"&gt;baby-eating cannibals sitting down to a Thanksgiving feast of baby&lt;/a&gt;, an image so vile that it disgusted a fair number of Age of Autism’s regular readers and the criticism led to the image and post being thrown down the memory hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vitriol, as “insolent” as I can be at times, Steve and I remain rank amateurs compared to the anti-vaccine movement, in particular J. B. Handley and his merry band of antivaccine propagandists at Age of Autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A closed mind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my correspondence with Mr. Higgs, to which Steve Novella contributed, I came to the distinct impression that Mr. Higgs had come to view himself as a crusader and, based on his experience, has simplified environmental issues to viewing that experts are always wrong. His experience with previous environmental catastrophes and the reactions of companies responsible for them have led him to the point where he cannot imagine even the possibility that the claim that thimerosal in vaccines causes autism can possibly be wrong or that the experts who point out that science doesn’t support such a link might actually be correct this time. That’s how anti-expert and anti-intellectual Mr. Higgs has he become. Indeed, Steve Novella even called Higgs out on his anti-intellectualism, and, incredibly, Higgs’ response was that had lived in a college town for many years around intellectuals and therefore couldn’t possibly be anti-science or anti-intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he is. His writings leave no doubt of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final example, I will mention two things Higgs cited. First, he cited this video as “the most persuasive evidence I have found thus far,” the one moment in time when he came to believe that vaccine cause autism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com"&gt;Watch CBS News Videos Online&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s Bernadine Healy, former director of the NIH, and Mr. Higgs is quite &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/10366"&gt;enamored with her&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, in recent years, she’s been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/bernadine_healy_flirtin_with_the_antivac.php"&gt;flirting with the anti-vaccine movement&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the American Academy of Pediatrics, the CDC, and other health organizations and “just asking questions” about whether there is a connection between vaccines and autism. She’s also been promoting the idea of a “vaccinated versus unvaccinated” study, apparently not realizing the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=939"&gt;inherent difficulties involved in such a study&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, Dr. Healy, despite her previous position as NIH director (a position she was &lt;a href="http://epiwonk.com/?p=134"&gt;arguably unqualified for&lt;/a&gt;), is not an authority on vaccines. In fact, if you want an idea of how far down the rabbit hole of anti-vaccine lunacy Dr. Healy’s gone, consider that she was named as &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/12/age-of-autism-awards-2008-person-of-the-year-dr-bernadine-healy.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism’s Person of the Year for 2008&lt;/a&gt;.  If there’s one virtually completely reliable indication that a scientist or physician is well on the way to becoming an antivaccine crank (or has already become one), it’s being named Person of the Year by Age of Autism. It’s like the Nobel Prize, Oscars, Pulitzer Prizes, and Congressional Medal of Freedom for antivaccine crankery and autism quackery all rolled into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Mr. Higgs cited an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/articles/2010/01/24/10291"&gt;Educating the Ohio Valley’s special kids&lt;/a&gt;. The interesting thing is that nothing in this article mentions vaccines as a cause of autism. Rather, the entire focus of the article appears to be on mercury and industrial pollution, the argument being that it is that that is correlated with the steadily increasing special education rolls in Evansville, IN. However, in his penultimate e-mail to me, Higgs cited this article and the leveling off of special ed enrollment in 2007 and 2008 as potential evidence for the thimerosal hypothesis, given that thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines by early 2002 and a 3 to 5 year delay would be expected after that happened before autism diagnoses would fall if thimerosal-containing vaccines were etiologically linked with autism. In his e-mail, Higgs asked, “I understand that two years does not constitute a long-term trend, but what other constant do you think every child in Indiana may have experienced in 2002 and 2003, other than vaccines?” Of course, as has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=14"&gt;been found in several studies in multiple locations and countries&lt;/a&gt;, there has been no convincing evidence of a leveling off or decrease in autism diagnoses five years after thimerosal was removed from vaccines in various countries, and there has been no convincing evidence of a leveling off or decrease in autism in California. The idea that thimerosal in vaccines causes autism led to a testable hypothesis. Every time this hypothesis has been tested, it has failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about Mr. Higgs’ graph, I decided to look at the numbers anyway. In this task I was assisted by some blog buddies of mine, including &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/"&gt;Liz Ditz&lt;/a&gt;, who pointed out that a large number of factors could account for such an increase in special ed numbers and a leveling off in 2007, including the starting of campaigns to identify learning disabilities and their eventual leveling off and the &lt;a href="http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_32.htm"&gt;effect of funding incentives on special ed enrollment&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple people pointed out to me that this leveling off of special ed cases appears to be occurring among all age cohorts. If thimerosal had anything to do with a leveling off in special ed case loads, it should have a far more profound effect in the youngest groups. It didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com"&gt;Joseph&lt;/a&gt; was kind enough to provide me with a spreadsheet based on actual data, with special education counts for Indiana coming from &lt;a href="https://www.ideadata.org/PartBChildCount.asp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and whole-population enrollment counts coming from the National Center for Education Statistics &lt;a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/bat/index.asp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. He produced for me four graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first graph shows all disabilities for children aged 6 to 21:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fig1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fig1.jpg" alt="fig1" title="fig1" width="480" height="329"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much of a change over the period covered, is there? Next, we have a graph of all disabilities in the age group that would be most likely to be affected; that is, if thimerosal had anything to do with developmental disabilities requiring special ed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fig2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fig2.jpg" alt="fig2" title="fig2" width="480" height="324"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we have a the same graph for the age group between ages 12 and 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fig3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fig3.jpg" alt="fig3" title="fig3" width="480" height="322"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how it looks very similar to the graph for ages 3-5. If thimerosal had anything to do with diagnoses leading to enrollment in special ed programs, you would expect to see a huge difference between the 3-5 year age cohort and the teenage cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s look at the graph for diagnoses of autism at age 6:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fig4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fig4.jpg" alt="fig4" title="fig4" width="480" height="323"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. No sign of a decrease in autism diagnoses in 2006 or later, which is what would be expected if thimerosal, which was removed from most childhood vaccines in late 2001, were a major etiological factor in autism. We can conclude from these graphs that Mr. Higgs is either very naive when it comes to data analysis or he saw what he wanted to see and stopped looking. His rush to judgment also belies one of his claims in his e-mails, namely that the science and epidemiology aren’t that hard to understand or do. That is, of course, just plain wrong. They are hard to understand and even harder to do. If they weren’t, then anyone could do them. Unintentionally, Mr. Higgs demonstrated himself that something that looks simple is not, and his looking at it simply led him to make an obvious rookie mistake that led him to the wrong conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Another Dan Olmsted?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although admittedly I started out trying to address Mr. Higgs with a bit more “insolence” than might have been advisable, I had a hard time restraining myself, given his swallowing of everything that J. B. Handley lays down and his falling for everything Handley says about Dr. Novella. In any case, I tried to be less “insolent” as the correspondence continued. It nonetheless became clear in our correspondence that Mr. Higgs is a true believer, who really does think that Andrew Wakefield has been unjustly abused by the medical establishement and, amazingly, that J. B. Handley knows what he is talking about. I tried to plant a seed by providing him with a number of links, both from SBM and elsewhere, that refuted key points of the anti-vaccine movement. He said point blank that he wasn’t going to read them, at least at first. Also, in his responses he pointedly called me “Mr.” Gorski, even though after the first e-mail he clearly must have known I am a physician, an intentional bit of disrespect that amuses me far more than offends me, given how often I’ve seen anti-vaccine advocates and alt-med practitioners use it against me. In that, if anything, Mr. Higgs appears less polite than the journalist whose path he seems to be following, Dan Olmsted, or maybe David Kirby, given his &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/articles/2010/01/03/10276"&gt;fawning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/10277"&gt;three part&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/10286"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; interviewing Kirby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mr. Higgs’ case, I rather suspect that it is really a case of being a true believer. According to him, every environmental health threat he’s seen was accompanied by industry denials and coverups. That may well be true. However, that history has apparently led Mr. Higgs to be so distrustful of what the government and medical authorities say, so suspicious of what “experts” say, that he can’t even consider the possibility that, in the case of vaccines, the experts are actually correct. There is no link between vaccines and autism that science has been able to detect. As passionate as Mr. Higgs may be about environmental pollution, he is, quite simply, on the wrong side of this particular issue and well on the way to becoming another Dan Olmsted &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/10271"&gt;supporting the quackery that is DAN!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indiana deserves better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDENDUM:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1838"&gt;Steve Novella has also blogged about thi&lt;/a&gt;s, and he has shown that I might be wrong. It’s not Dan Olmsted whom Mr. Higgs is emulating. It’s Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, &lt;a href="http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/parenting/inside-jenny-mccarthys-personal-turmoil-star-closes-school-for-autistic-children-amidst-split-from-jim-carrey-1271964/"&gt;one article suggests “Jenny McCarthy has had the worst two months of her life.&lt;/a&gt;” Why? Within the past two months she has lost the school she helped found for autistic children, Teach2Talk Academy, and lost her boyfriend of five years. It’s unknown at this time why she and Jim Carrey split up but the reason the school went bust was because of strong disagreements she had with her co-founderDr. Sarah Scheflen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jenny and her partner at the Academy, Sarah Scheflen, had different visions for the school and made a decision to go their separate ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Scheflen not on board with Jenny’s vaccine-injury unifying theory of all evil? It’s not clear but while I don’t know what kind of programs went on at that school, I’m confident that if Jenny had a large amount of involvement in it, its closing is almost certainly a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the school, Jenny had previously said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m proud to say [Teach2Talk Academy] is an absolute success in terms of the amount of progress children with autism are making. We do have a goal to open more schools around the country. If I had &lt;strong&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/strong&gt;‘ money, I would have them in every state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it’s a good thing that Gates has that money instead of Jenny &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hWjvyWEicz9AimSmXEYs-l1UZr7wD9EH36PG2"&gt;because Gates knows how to spend it wisely, on vaccines and vaccine research&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas Jenny’s little school has a more, shall we say, interesting way of spending money:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of today, the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.teach2talk.com/"&gt;Teach2Talk&lt;/a&gt; website was still selling its self-branded line of educational materials, including DVDs and nutritional supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, nutritional supplements! Of course! That makes perfect sense because no reputable medical study has ever shown they benefit autistics at all and the studies that have been done on supplement treatments have shown positive evidence that they don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know who broke up with whom, but I know that for a little bit before the school fell apart Jim was going to possibly buy out Jenny’s partner so the school would be all Jenny’s. Then, next thing I heard, [Jenny] was moving out [from Carrey&amp;#39;s house],” an insider told us about the couple’s April 4 split . “Jenny McCarthy has had…the worst two months of her life. Her school and her man all vanished in about 60 days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you’ve got to take this last quote with a grain of salt. Not that one has any reason to doubt the testimony of the famously reliable “an insider.”&lt;/p&gt;

After a period of silence, over the last week, Wakefield has started to pop up in the public eye again, most recently last week in an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/someone_didnt_nail_the_coffin_shut_andre.php"&gt;interview for an independent filmmaker&lt;/a&gt; that is getting wide play in the anti-vaccine underground but not much anywhere else. Unfortunately, without the seeming respectability of Thoughtful House to buoy him, I had predicted that Andrew Wakefield would be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/andrew_wakefield_destined_for_even_more.php"&gt;destined for even more disrepute&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out that I was quite correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wakefield has been interviewed by Dr. Mercola, who has posted the interview on his website in an article entitled &lt;a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/04/10/wakefield-interview.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Why Medical Authorities Went to Such Extremes to Silence Dr. Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;. I wonder if Wakefield knows that being featured on Joe Mercola's website is a mere step above being featured on the conspiracy website Whale.to, right next to the New World Order conspiracy theories, UFO stories, Ley lines, Chemtrails, and HIV/AIDS denialism. Oh wait, &lt;a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/wakefield.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;he's already there&lt;/a&gt;. But, to be fair, he didn't actually sit down with John Scudamore to do an interview, as he did with Mercola. Here is the first part of the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

A new case report by Bianchi-Demicheli et al. (2010) describes a unique paraphilia1 in a married 34 year old man. The authors called it Sleeping Beauty paraphilia:This [man] felt sexually aroused from seeing sleeping women as well as from taking care of their hands and nails while they were asleep.The patient came to the attention of the authors when he was brought to the emergency psychiatric unit after assaulting his wife with pepper spray while wearing a latex mask.2 More details of the case are as follows:His marriage had been in crisis for several years because over the time the patient developed a particular and progressive sexual deviant behaviour. He felt sexually aroused from seeing sleeping women as well as from taking care of their hands and nails while they were asleep, beginning mostly with the right hand. In the first time of his marriage he could control these fantasies, but over the years he lost the control of his sexual urges and he must irresistibly act his deviant behaviour. In order to realize his uncontrollable impulse, he was used to provide his wife sleeping pills to satisfy his paraphilia. In the first time his wife used to agree to take sleeping pills, but later she refused to bend to man’s freakish will. The man began secretly to administer benzodiazepines since the dosage of 23 mg of Bromazepam.In September 2006, his wife discovered this practice and refused to take sleeping pills and the couple entered in a very strong conflict.The assault occurred because the woman refused to comply with her husband&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;freakish will&amp;quot;:Because of the extremely powerful obsession with sleeping women and painting their nails, the patient disguised himself with a latex mask an attacked his wife, as she returned from work, with an Olerosin Capsicum (OC) spray, to anaesthetize her. During this episode, his wife succeeded in taking off his mask, escaped and called the police who brought him to the psychiatric emergencies.The psychiatric exam and laboratory tests all came out as normal. The patient reported no family history of mental illness. However, he sustained a head injury at the age of 10 which resulted in a four day coma.3 He was given a neurological exam, including an MRI, which showed &amp;quot;moderate atrophy in the fronto-parietal region with a diffuse and severe  white matter injury compatible with his previous head trauma (Figure  1).&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know that I would characterize the white matter damage as severe, but then again I&amp;#39;m not a neuroradiologist.Figure 1 (Bianchi-Demicheli et al., 2010). On the T2 images (A–C) one notes atrophy in the parietal and frontal lobes as well as subcortical lesions in the frontal white matter (arrows B,C); FLAIR  also shows multiple subcortical white matter lesions (arrows: D); DTI [dffusion tensor imaging] demonstrates a decrease of the fractional anisotropy in the areas seen on the right (E: arrow) and on the left (F: arrow).Bianchi-Demicheli  et al. (2010) linked the fronto-parietal damage to behavioral disinhibition and a specific disturbance in body image, which was revealed by neuropsychological testing:The patient was diagnosed with a moderate dysexecutive syndrome and a very specific body image disorder characterized by an incomplete mental image of his hands, mostly the right (i.e., personal representational hemineglect), as ascertained by his graphical representation of his body parts.The clinical hypothesis was that the paraphilia might be related to his post-traumatic disturbed body image and more specifically to the incomplete hands representation.One puzzling aspect of this case is why the &amp;quot;Sleeping beauty paraphilia&amp;quot; became uncontrollable only in adulthood, showing a progressive escalation during his marriage. This might be suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder, but that was not part of his diagnosis. And I&amp;#39;m not sure why an old traumatic brain injury would have lead to &amp;quot;moderate&amp;quot; atrophy in the fronto-parietal region. I might have expected more involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex (e.g. Burns &amp;amp; Swerdlow, 2003), given the nature of the patient&amp;#39;s behavioral changes. However, many other examples of impulsive sexual offenses (Langevin, 2006) are even less obviously related to neurological status (e.g. after head injuries when the damage might  not be visible on an MRI scan, and of course the population of offenders who have never sustained a TBI). Since the lesions were distributed and not focal, a final mystery is why the body image disturbance was confined to the right hand (implying a left hemisphere origin). This type of personal representational hemineglect (neglect for a mental representation of one side of the body) is most often associated with lesions in the right hemisphere (Ortigue et al., 2006).A final comment concerns the sort of urges or behaviors that are categorized as paraphilias. What is considered acceptable can vary widely across cultures and subcultures (Bhugra et al., 2010) and across individuals. If the patient of Bianchi-Demicheli et al. found a partner willing to have her fingernails done while sedated with sleeping pills, perhaps the classification would change from paraphilic disorder (see Footnote 1 below) to something that might be considered strange and paraphilic to most people, but causing no distress to the two willing participants.Footnotes1 According to DSM-IV, paraphilias are defined as recurrent, and intense  sexual urges, fantasies, or behaviors that involve unusual objects,  activities, or situations and cause clinically significant distress or  impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of  functioning. Changes in this set of diagnoses are being discussed for the new DSM-5 (currently under development):The  Paraphilias Subworkgroup is proposing two broad changes that affect all  or several of the paraphilia diagnoses, in addition to various  amendments to specific diagnoses. The first broad change follows from  our consensus that paraphilias are not ipso facto psychiatric disorders. We are  proposing that the DSM-V make a distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders. A paraphilia by  itself would not automatically justify or require psychiatric  intervention. A paraphilic  disorder is a paraphilia  that causes distress or impairment to the individual or harm to others.  One would ascertain a paraphilia (according to the  nature of the urges, fantasies, or behaviors) but diagnose a paraphilic disorder (on the  basis of distress and impairment). In this conception, having a  paraphilia would be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for  having a paraphilic disorder.  2 No mention of whether or not it was a Prince Charming mask.3 The authors did not speculate too much on the Freudian im...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I looked him up to figure out what the heck he was babbling about, and found his &lt;a href="http://www.spiritualgenome.com/"&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out he's a crop circle nut, and you might find a few minutes amusement in his delusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fascinating new discoveries by Russian molecular biologists have revealed that DNA has a mysterious resonance that has been termed the Phantom-DNA Effect. In addition these Russian researchers have found that DNA reacts to voice activated laser light when it is set at the specific frequency of the DNA itself. Using these methods it is possible not only to change the information patterns in the DNA, but it is also possible to communicate with the DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This "phantom DNA" effect is all over the web, surprisingly: people claim that if you shine a laser through a solution of DNA, it scatters or resonates in some particular pattern that persists even after you remove the DNA. Guess what? While it's a very popular subject on fringe websites hosted on cheap servers with crappy web design, it seems to be completely absent from the scientific literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh. Who would have guessed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering what it has to to do with crop circles. All will be explained in the following paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that there is a divine intelligence in the DNA that is capable of resonating with the natural frequency of the earth in order to create crop circles. This divine intelligence is what the Hindus refer to as the Inner Self, and there are indications that the increase in crop circle activity in recent decades is set to coincide with the end of the Mayan calendar, at which point this divine intelligence in the DNA will become generally known to the world, thus ushering in a new era in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooooo-OOoOO-ooooh. Magic DNA, lasers, quantum physics, psychic powers, vibrations, crop circles, mystical Mayan calendars, and 2012 — it&amp;#39;s got everything. Total lunatic meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not necessarily my job to "debate" with anyone.  I do not always need to attempt to educate people who clearly have no interest in being educated.

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the most useful course of action is to just point your finger and laugh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/sunday_night_addendum_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/ZqVTRtCVTtE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271035330246"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/my_windows_box_inches_is_way_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/12aa1bf881f23497</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linux"/><title type="html">My windows box inches its way towards .... the window.</title><published>2010-04-12T02:00:48Z</published><updated>2010-04-12T02:00:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/bzkRbBnJyjk/my_windows_box_inches_is_way_t.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/my_windows_box_inches_is_way_t.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while back I would have said that I have three reasons to maintain a Windows computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent description of &lt;a href="http://jayrosen.tumblr.com/post/110043432/mindcasting-defining-the-form-spreading-the-meme" title=""&gt;mindcasting&lt;/a&gt;. Its alternative, 'lifecasting' is 100% private made public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with lifecasting, of course. It is a different style of communication. It is using Twitter with a different goal in mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindcasting is a method to use Twitter for exchange of news, information, analysis and opinion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifecasting is a method to use Twitter to make friends and communicate with them, to be in a continuous presence in a community of one's liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, the difference between lifecasting and mindcasting is similar to the difference in the use of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phatic_language" title=""&gt;phatic language&lt;/a&gt; versus &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/11/21/164946/67" title=""&gt;semantic (or conceptual) language&lt;/a&gt; (aside: I have used these concepts before in discussing politics, creationism, etc., e.g., &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/05/more_than_just_resistance_of_s.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/why_creationists_need_to_be_cr.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/07/darwinist.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/06/update_on_psychology_of_creati.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many observers and analysts of online social networks, usually but not always curmudgeons who like to criticize for the sake of getting people off their lawns, &lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html" title=""&gt;focus entirely on lifecasting&lt;/a&gt; and, if they are erudite and educated, they may note its use of phatic language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phatic language is the use of words without paying too much attention to their dictionary meaning - the goal is to diffuse social tensions, to establish non-attack pacts between strangers at first meeting, or to reinforce friendship, alliance, or even love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In politics and propaganda, it is misused for nefarious purposes - drawing the walls between Us and Them, using emotional appeals (or dog-whistles, if the target audience is religious) to get people to vote against their interests, or to vote for interests of the conglomerates, parties or organizations who are paying spin-meisters (like Frank Luntz and Eric Dezenhall) to get the public opinion swayed against the facts unpleasant/expensive to them, for example duping a big proportion of the population into rejecting the fact that the climate is changing fast and that the human activity is the major factor engendering this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, mindcasting is using semantic (or conceptual) language, where words are supposed to hold their dictionary meanings. The point of mindcasting tweets is to relay information in as clear, succinct, efficient and non-confusing manner as possible. The limit of 140 characters makes tweeting - in a mindcasting sense - very difficult. It is one of the hardest forms of prose to do well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The masters of Twitter are the masters of language - able to put unambiguous, information-rich, dense yet clear messages out to their audiences. The best twitterers spend quite some time and thought writing and editing each tweet until it is as perfect a package of information as possible - clear, informative in itself, and also motivating the readers to click on the embedded link to find out more. It is not easy to use semantic language in a way that is impossible to read using a phatic mindset - to have it so obviously conceptual that no emotional reading - and thus misunderstanding - is possible. It is a high art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are good at this difficult art, mindcasting is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/new_journalistic_workflow.php" title=""&gt;just the beginning, the first step&lt;/a&gt; in communication that may progress from a series of tweets on a topic to a longer blog post, to perhaps an MSM article or even book. It has happened (ask David Dobbs - he recently &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/2009/12/coming_sort_of_soon_to_a_books.php" title=""&gt;signed a book deal&lt;/a&gt; on a topic that went pretty much through all these steps: starting on social networks, getting feedback there, leading to a couple of blog posts, leading to an article in Atlantic, leading to a book).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, keep lifecasting if you need to and want to, if that is your goal. But if you have more serious ambitions in media, journalism or science communication, consider mindcasting as your style. As Jay said, mindcasting is full of personality - it is not dry regurgitation of someone else's news, it is not just a broadcast: it is a conversation about facts and ideas. And it is 0% private. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Jay's standards are tough, perhaps too tough (even he tweeteed at least a couple of times in his years on Twitter about his private life, e.g., accomplishments of some of his family members). But having it 95% personal and only 5% private is probably good enough ratio for most of us mere mortals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/twittering_is_a_difficult_art.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/sedA6_VyqsQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271027645328"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/?p=1713">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6418bd1f75c5af7c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="free inquiry"/><category term="medical woo"/><category term="skeptical community"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><category term="BCA"/><category term="Britain"/><category term="British Chiropractic Association"/><category term="CAM"/><category term="chiropractic"/><category term="complementary medicine"/><category term="England"/><category term="First Amendment"/><category term="free speech"/><category term="law"/><category term="lawsuit"/><category term="libel"/><category term="medicine"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="sCAM"/><category term="science"/><category term="Sense About Science"/><category term="Simon Singh"/><category term="skeptical movement"/><category term="skepticism"/><category term="subluxation"/><title type="html">Update from Simon Singh &amp;amp; the Campaign for Libel Reform</title><published>2010-04-11T23:13:40Z</published><updated>2010-04-11T23:13:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/04/11/update-from-simon-singh-the-campaign-for-libel-reform/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to pass along to you a quick update concerning the ongoing United Kingdom court battle of Simon Singh vs. the British Chiropractic Association (my earlier blog posts on this matter are &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/update-on-the-sense-about-science-campaign/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/06/06/silencing-skepticism-the-case-of-simon-singh/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  In fact, Simon just recently received some very good news regarding the whole situation…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/"&gt;&lt;img title="libel-science" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/libel-science.jpg?w=234&amp;amp;h=85" alt="" width="234" height="85"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for  the silence, but it has been a ridiculously hectic (and happy) time  since last week’s victory at the Court of Appeal. However, I urgently wanted  to get in touch to update you on the status of my case, the latest news  on libel reform and what you can do today to push libel reform up the  political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BCA v Singh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April Fool’s Day 2010 was a day to remember.  The Court of Appeal  gave a ruling in my libel case with the British Chiropractic  Association. The ruling strongly backs my arguments and puts me in a  much stronger position when my trial eventually takes place. At last,  after two years of defending my article and my right to free speech, I  seem to have the upper hand and can breathe a small sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the judges made it  clear that they did not want to see scientists and science journalists being  hauled through the High Court. In particular, they endorsed the view  that a so-called comment defence should be adequate for scientific and  other articles on matters of public interest. As well as the legal technicalities, the  three wise, charming and handsome judges quoted Milton on the  persecution of Galileo and directed that the High Court should not  become an “Orwellian Ministry  of Truth”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libel Reform Campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small step forward for  libel reform, but there is still a huge battle to be fought over the  issues of costs, libel tourism, public interest defence, balancing the  burden of proof, restricting the ability of powerful corporations to  bully individuals (e.g., bloggers, journalists, scientists) and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The General Election was called  yesterday and the manifestos will be published in the next week, so we  need one last push to persuade the major parties to commit to libel  reform. Although we have already achieved a huge amount (from editorials  in all last week’s broadsheets to the Commons Select Committee  recommending libel reform), we must keep up the pressure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Labour and Conservative  parties have made encouraging sounds about libel reform, but now is the  time for them to make commitments in their manifestos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do today to  pressure politicians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent over a million  minutes and £100,000 defending my article and my right to free speech,  so I am asking you to spend just one minute and no money at all  persuading others to sign the petition for libel reform at &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.inboxsystems.com/li.aspx?cu=2182562&amp;amp;link=28491"&gt;www.libelreform.org/sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I made this  request, we doubled the number of signatories from 17,000 to 35,000. Can  we now double the number from almost 50,000 to 100,000?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could ask parents, siblings,  colleagues or friends to sign up. You could email everyone in your  address book. You could blog about it, mention it to your Facebook friends and  Twitter about it. In fact, I have pasted some possible tweets at the end  of this email – it would be great if you could twitter one, some or all  of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could forward all or part of  this email to people or just steer them to &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.inboxsystems.com/li.aspx?cu=2182562&amp;amp;link=28491"&gt;www.libelreform.org/sign&lt;/a&gt;.  Or you could persuade people that English libel law needs radical  reform by using some of the reasons listed at the end of this email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, we welcome signatories  from around the world because English libel law has a damaging impact  globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, please, please apply  maximum pressure to the politicians by encouraging as many new  signatories as possible. Please do not take my victory last week as a  sign that the battle is over. My case is still ongoing and the campaign  for libel reform is only just starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all your support – it  has been incredibly important for the campaign and a real morale  booster personally over the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins: I will arrest Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article7094310.ece"&gt;that article&lt;/a&gt; say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, the atheist author, have asked human rights lawyers to produce a case for charging Pope Benedict XVI over his alleged cover-up of sexual abuse in the Catholic church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair believe they can exploit the same legal principle used to arrest Augusto Pinochet, the late Chilean dictator, when he visited Britain in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have commissioned the barrister Geoffrey Robertson and Mark Stephens, a solicitor, to present a justification for legal action.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins and Hitchens both get accused of being arrogant, but do they actually think they can just get “their people” to walk up to the Pope and arrest him?  Surely they’re not thinking that.  That would take some chutzpah, no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how &lt;a href="http://www.skepticmoney.com/dawkins-and-hitchens-want-pope-in-jail/"&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; you &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/dawkins-hitchens-plan-legal-ambush-to.html"&gt;want it&lt;/a&gt; to happen, they’re not doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins himself has admitted &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5415"&gt;this is all untrue&lt;/a&gt;.  (What else would you expect from a newspaper owned by &lt;strong&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/strong&gt;, the man who brought you FOX News Channel?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Needless to say, I did NOT say “I will arrest Pope Benedict XVI” or anything so personally grandiloquent. You have to remember that The Sunday Times is a Murdoch newspaper, and that all newspapers follow the odd custom of entrusting headlines to a sub-editor, not the author of the article itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I DID say to Marc Horne when he telephoned me out of the blue, and I repeat it here, is that I am whole-heartedly behind the initiative by Geoffrey Robertson and Mark Stephens to mount a legal challenge to the Pope’s proposed visit to Britain. Beyond that, I declined to comment to Marc Horme, other than to refer him to my ‘Ratzinger is the Perfect Pope’ article here: &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5341"&gt;http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5341&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what really happened. Christopher Hitchens first proposed the legal challenge idea to me on March 14th. I responded enthusiastically, and suggested the name of a high profile human rights lawyer whom I know. I had lost her address, however, and set about tracking her down. Meanwhile, Christopher made the brilliant suggestion of Geoffrey Robertson. He approached him, and Mr Robertson’s subsequent ‘Put the Pope in the Dock’ article in The Guardian shows him to be ideal:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5366"&gt;http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5366&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is obviously in good hands, with him and Mark Stephens. I am especially intrigued by the proposed challenge to the legality of the Vatican as a sovereign state whose head can claim diplomatic immunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the Pope doesn’t end up in the dock, and even if the Vatican doesn’t cancel the visit, I am optimistic that we shall raise public consciousness to the point where the British government will find it very awkward indeed to go ahead with the Pope’s visit, let alone pay for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pope isn’t going to go away even if he were arrested.  If anything, that’d make a lot of people sympathize with him, and that’s not at all what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone should just continue calling for his resignation.  This is a man unfit for his position.  Even if he didn’t molest any children himself, he knew what was going on and didn’t do enough to stop it.  And he’s supposed to be a shining example of moral clarity?  Please.  He’s a fallible joke.&lt;br&gt;

All this week on the blog, I'm going to be discussing issues raised on the show--so having heard it will be kind of an essential baseline.

This post is to raise the first issue, which has to do with Eli's response to my question around minute 6, where I ask about the geoengineering techniques that scientists consider to have the most promise.  In response, Eli provided a fairly encyclopedic answer that essentially broke geoengineering schemes into two categories: 1) carbon capture/removal techniques to get the stuff out of the air, by sucking it into machines, into the ocean, into trees and plants, etc; and 2) sunlight blocking techniques, which essentially reduce the total solar radiation being absorbed by the planet.

My problem is that the carbon removal techniques (with perhaps the exception of iron fertilization) are relatively uncontroversial. Whereas the sunblocking techniques--and especially what Kintisch calls the "Pinatubo option"--are wildly so. So is it really wise to group them both together under the rubric of "geoengineering"?

Krugman now joins fellow NYT columnist &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Flat-Crowded-2-0-Revolution/dp/0312428928/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1270999838&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Tom Friedman&lt;/a&gt; as required reading in my &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=FA75A0DDB89ACCD7"&gt;Global Warming for English Majors&lt;/a&gt; class at the University of Chicago.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot here to comment on and discuss.  The extinctions at the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/08/petm-weirdness/"&gt;Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum&lt;/a&gt;, for example, were mostly limited to foraminfera, single-celled shelly protozoa living at the sea floor, not really a “mass extinction” like the end Cretaceous when the dinosaurs got feathered.  The Gulf Stream is &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/05/gulf-stream-slowdown/"&gt;not the only thing&lt;/a&gt; keeping Northern Europe warmer than Alaska.  Krugman’s four reasons why it’s dubious to compare costs of climate mitigation to adaption didn’t include the unfairness, that the people paying the costs of climate change would not be the same ones as reap the benefit of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission.  He also seems to have missed the recent revelation that what really matters to climate is the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/hit-the-brakes-hard/"&gt;total ultimate slug of emitted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, implying that unfettered emission today dooms us to more drastic cuts in the future or a higher ultimate atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, which will persist not just for “possibly centuries”, but almost certainly for &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/irreversible-does-not-mean-unstoppable/"&gt;millennia&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite a few off-notes, reading this very nicely written, beautifully laid out and argued piece felt like getting a deep sympathetic body massage after a bruising boxing match.  Thank you, Mr. Krugman.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>david</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1271013639587"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13317">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/01f295bacc1fe6b2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">AI: What’s the Harm?</title><published>2010-04-11T19:00:51Z</published><updated>2010-04-11T19:00:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/ai-whats-the-harm/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5fbe618e00e7572fe179f8952e0d6d2a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Tim Farley’s excellent &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/"&gt;What’s the Harm&lt;/a&gt; site recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a valuable resource for when people ask you, “What’s the harm in drinking your own urine?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about my own answer to this question. My first thought was of my mother, who once saw a Naturopath for a puzzling set of symptoms. The alternative therapist suggested she take iodine. Soon thereafter, a qualified doctor diagnosed her as hyperthyroid. Taking the iodine could have been deadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I thought of my Uncle Bruce, who suffered from a rare form of thyroid cancer. He had a thyroidectomy, but then vetoed chemotherapy in favor of fasting, vitamins and herbs, and a trip to the Phillipines for psychic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he died, his specialist said he could have lived an extra 5-10 years had he tried conventional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2008/04/world-homeopathy-awareness-week-day-2-the-succussion/"&gt;Celebrating World Homeopathy Awareness Week – Day 2--The Succussion&lt;/a&gt;, Elyse explores one of homeopathy's weirder notions: that shaking very dilute solutions make them "more powerful"

&lt;blockquote&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
But the key here is not to just keep adding water. Even homeopaths know that if you do that, nothing will happen. You have to awaken the spirit of the remedy (I seriously wish I was making that up) by giving it a good jolt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You gotta shake it like a Polaroid picture, yo.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ok maybe not quite like Polarioid picture. But you do have to shake it. And don’t drop it like it’s hot. You’ll only look like a nerd.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Succussion is what makes the remedy potent. Succussion is what Hahnemann, the inventor of homeopathy, believed released the “spirit-like powers” of the remedy throughout the solution. The more a remedy is shaken, the more powerful it becomes. In fact, according to homeoint.org he believed that when his remedies were shipped across country by horseback, they were shaken so much that the solutions became too powerful to use!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Initially, I had no business goals with it. I created this project recently. I was and still am a teenager myself, that is why I had a certain feeling of what other teenagers would want to see on the Internet. I myself enjoyed talking to friends with Skype using a microphone and webcam. But we got tired of talking to each other eventually. So I decided to create a little site for me and my friends where we could connect randomly with other people."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you get when you allow people to connect randomly and chat with one other random person at a time anywhere in the world?  That's the principle behind &lt;a href="http://chatroulette.com/"&gt;http://chatroulette.com&lt;/a&gt;, and it's taken off like gangbusters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I didn't really find out about any of this until I found out that the musician &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Folds"&gt;Ben Folds&lt;/a&gt; decided to play chat roulette during a concert in Charlottesville, and sing improvisational songs (in the style of a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PianoChatImprov"&gt;certain youtube star&lt;/a&gt;) to his chat partners.  The results?

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this story is getting a LOT of attention from science supporters…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the National Center for Science Education: &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/news/2010/04/what-happened-to-evolution-at-nsb-005412"&gt;What happened to evolution at the NSB?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And PZ Myers at Pharyngula chimes in: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/lets_hide_that_embarrassing_co.php"&gt;Let’s  hide that embarrassing conflict in American culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the actual Science article in question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/04/evolution-big-bang-polls-omitted.html"&gt;Evolution, Big Bang Polls Omitted From NSF Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an unusual last-minute edit that has drawn flak from the  White House and science educators, a federal advisory committee omitted  data on Americans’         knowledge of evolution and the big bang from a key report. The  data shows that Americans are far less likely than the rest of the world  to accept that         humans evolved from earlier species and that the universe began  with a big bang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re not surprising findings, but the National Science Board,  which oversees the National Science Foundation (NSF), says it chose to  leave the         section out of the 2010 edition of the biennial &lt;em&gt;Science and  Engineering Indicators&lt;/em&gt; because the survey questions used to measure  knowledge of the         two topics force respondents to choose between factual knowledge  and religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Discussing American science literacy without mentioning  evolution is intellectual malpractice” that “downplays the controversy”  over teaching         evolution in schools, says Joshua Rosenau of the National Center  for Science Education, a nonprofit that has fought to keep creationism  out of the science classroom. The story appears &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/328/5975/150"&gt;in  this week’s issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is it this information, which has been part of every previous &lt;em&gt;Indicators&lt;/em&gt; report to date, been removed at the last minute without any oversight?  Here’s a clue…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board members say the decision to drop the text was driven by a desire  for scientific accuracy. The survey questions that NSF has used for 25  years to         measure knowledge of evolution and the big bang were “flawed  indicators of scientific knowledge because responses conflated knowledge  and beliefs,”         says Louis Lanzerotti, an astrophysicist at the New Jersey  Institute of Technology who chairs NSB’s Science and Engineering  Indicators Committee. …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board member who took the lead in removing the text was John Bruer, a philosopher who heads the St. Louis, Missouri-based James S. McDonnell Foundation. He told &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;that  his reservations about the two survey questions dated back to 2007,  when he was the lead reviewer for the same         chapter in the 2008 &lt;em&gt;Indicators&lt;/em&gt;. He calls the survey  questions “very blunt instruments not designed to capture public  understanding” of the two         topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that is a nonsensical response” that reflects “the religious right’s point of view,” says Jon Miller, a science literacy researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing who authored the survey 3 decades ago and conducted it for NSF until 2001. “Evolution and the big bang are not a matter of opinion. If a person says that the earth really is at the center of the universe, even if scientists think it is not, how in the world would you call that person scientifically literate? Part of being literate is to both understand and accept scientific constructs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly was the offending material deleted from the report?  Here you go…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/assets/2010/04/08/chapter7_insider_excerpt.pdf"&gt;deleted  text&lt;/a&gt;, obtained by &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;Insider, does not differ radically  from what has appeared in previous &lt;em&gt;Indicators&lt;/em&gt;. The section, which was part of the &lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/assets/2010/04/08/chapter7_all.pdf"&gt;unedited  chapter&lt;/a&gt; on public attitudes toward science and technology, notes that 45% of Americans in 2008 answered true to the statement, “Human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals.” The figure is similar to previous years and much lower than in Japan (78%), Europe (70%), China (69%), and South Korea (64%). The same gap exists for the response to a second statement, “The universe began with a big explosion,” with which only 33% of Americans agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than report the honest truth about the state of scientific literacy in the United States on these topics, it seems the NSF has chosen to hide the embarrassing facts.  But, thankfully, it didn’t work.  We cannot change the poor state of science education in this country by hiding such information, either to save political face or to kow-tow to &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/ultrafundamentalism.html"&gt;religious fundamentalists&lt;/a&gt; who push &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Creationist_Arguments"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt;; rather, we must face the challenge head on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speech-language therapy was in part with Sarah Clifford Scheflen. Following the reported success of Evan&amp;#39;s treatment with Scheflen,  in 2007 McCarthy and Scheflen started a limited liability company, &lt;a href="http://www.teach2talk.com/about-us-2.html"&gt;Teach2Talk&lt;/a&gt;, to produce products for parents to use at home, which appears to have been marketed primarily through the internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; Teach2talk’s™ produces educational resources for children which target core speech and language, play and social skills using techniques including video modeling. Our products are created by a practicing speech language pathologist based on her clinical experience and her review of the peer–reviewed research of others, but are designed to be used by parents on their own without outside assistance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an Ocotober 2007 interview with Allison Kugel (when Evan would have been 5 years, 6 months, or eligible for kindergarten), Jenny said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He’s classified as typical, but he still has auditory processing issues. I still have him in speech [therapy]. &lt;span style="background-color:#ffff40"&gt;But he’s in typical school and completely normal functioning.&lt;/span&gt; Once in awhile we’ll talk so quickly and there will be so much information, and he’ll go, “Wait. Can you slow down?” That’s Evan’s thing though (laughs). He’s like, “You’re talking too fast!” And that’s auditory processing, where there is too much information together at once. But all of the autism is gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2009, according to an interview in &lt;a href="http://www.cookiemag.com/entertainment/2009/08/jenny-mccarthy"&gt;Cookie Magazine, McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;opened a school for
autistic children in L.A..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school&amp;#39;s description from its website:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://t2tacademy.com/"&gt;Teach2Talk Academy&lt;/a&gt; is an intensive early intervention program for the treatment of preschool aged children from two and a half to six with autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disorders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenny described the school in an interview with &lt;a href="http://www.livingwithout.com/issues/4_1/autism_jenny_mccarthy-1059-1.html"&gt;Bonnie Siegler at the  Living Without website:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school, called Teach to Talk Academy, is located in the house where I used to live. I got rid of all my furniture and converted each room into a classroom. We have about 30 kids enrolled between the ages of 3 and 6 years old. The school is an intensive treatment center for autistic kids. We’re basically teaching them how to speak, how to go to the bathroom, how to function, how to look their friends in the eyes. We’re treating autism through nutrition, as well. So I’ll be bringing all my nutritional advice to the school. We have a doctor on board who will come in and do the blood work with the kids and have them on a health regimen. The same diet, the same vitamins, the same detoxing…all the things I’ve done with Evan’s recovery. There’ll also be behavior therapy. I consider these kids in the school right now to be one of the luckiest groups around because we have the very best of the best therapists from UCLA, combined with the best doctors in the world to treat autism. I’ve just put them together under one roof—and there it is! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to several sources, including the KidsLA magazine article quoted below McCarthy&amp;#39;s long-term goal was to, with Scheflen, to open a string of schools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Also, tell us about the Teach2Talk Academy. Why did you start it and what makes it more suitable for kids with autism and other learning disorders?&lt;/strong&gt; Teach2Talk Academy opened this year and I&amp;#39;m proud to say is an absolute success in terms of the amount of progress children with autism are making. We have children age 2 to 6 and we use a combination of ABA, floor time and other therapies that help the kids progress according to their specific goals. I also teach parents and guide them toward diet/nutritional tips that can help further their progress while at the school. We also have an after school social skills program for ages 3 to 9. Evan attends social skills and it&amp;#39;s his favorite part of the week. They learn how to play freeze tag, teamwork and the importance of making a buddy. (http://t2tacademy.com/)
&lt;/p&gt;

 

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Do you plan on opening more academies, and/or growing it to include older children?&lt;/strong&gt; We do have a goal to open more schools around the country. If I had Bill Gates&amp;#39; money I would have them in every state. For now, Sherman Oaks is our home. We do plan on increasing with age in terms of social skills group. But our intensive school is only for ages 2 thru 6.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also important to note that McCarthy&amp;#39;s son Evan, who is now 8 1/2 years old, would have aged out of this school or network of schools.  (It hasn&amp;#39;t been reported where Evan is attending school today, although he may still be homeschooled.) Later in the &lt;em&gt;KidsLA&lt;/em&gt; article, McCarthy attends social skills classes at the Teach2Talk campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the February 25, 2010 interview in &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; Magazine, the Teach2Talk Academy school was located in the Thousand Oaks house that McCarthy owns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an April 9, 2010 article in &lt;em&gt;TV Guide&lt;/em&gt; McCarthy has decided to close the school.  It&amp;#39;s not clear from the reports if the school will close immediately, or if it will close at the end of the planned school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny and her partner at the Academy, Sarah Scheflen, had different visions for the school and made a decision to go their separate ways,&amp;quot; McCarthy&amp;#39;s rep said in a statement. &amp;quot;Sarah and Jenny really enjoyed their time working at the Academy and feel honored that they were able to provide such high quality early intervention services to so many children with autism and other developmental disabilities.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s  not clear why McCarthy elected to close the school, or what will happen to the Teach2Talk teaching videos enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unverified gossip posted several places on the web, including Yahoo Shine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It was Jenny&amp;#39;s pet project — but, according to a source who knew the couple well, the school&amp;#39;s demise may even have been an additional strain that contributed to the end of her five-year relationship with 48-year-old Jim Carrey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;	
	&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know who broke up with whom, but I know that for a little bit before the school fell apart Jim was going to possibly buy out Jenny&amp;#39;s partner so the school would be all Jenny&amp;#39;s. Then, next thing I heard, [Jenny] was moving out [from Carrey&amp;#39;s house],&amp;quot; an insider told us about the couple&amp;#39;s April 4 split . &amp;quot;Jenny McCarthy has had...the worst two months of her life. Her school and her man all vanished in about 60 days.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given that the school&amp;#39;s defined purpose was early intervention for autism, it would have fallen under the &lt;a href="http://www.nlacrc.org/eligibility.html"&gt;North Los Angeles County Regional Center for Developmental Disabilities.&lt;/a&gt; Some of the children enrolled in Teach2Talk Academy may have been previously served by&lt;a href="http://www.dds.ca.gov/earlystart/"&gt; California Early Start&lt;/a&gt;.  Funding for early intervention services for children with autism is &lt;a href="http://www.disabilityrightsca.org/PUBS/505201.htm"&gt;complex and confusing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What follows is speculation, not fact:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ms. McCarthy and Ms. Scheflen may have failed to secure the appropriate permits to run a school or early-intervention program from either the city of Sherman Oaks or the County of Los Angeles &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The business model for the school may have hinged on securing state, county, or school district funding for some of the students or some fraction of the program, which they were unable to obtain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The schoool may have been heavily subsidized by Mr. Carrey, a source of funding that disappeared with the end of the McCarthy-Carrey relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ms. Scheflen may not have endorsed the nutritional /&amp;quot;detoxing&amp;quot; aspects of the program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I *loved* it there and was eager to start life at Farragut High School.  But my family moved to Chicago the week before high school started.  I’ve mentioned before that that move was what initially got me questioning the existence of a god in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clearly &lt;a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/apr/04/father-wants-biology-book-ban/"&gt;missed out on all the fun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kurt Zimmerman&lt;/strong&gt; is the father of a Farragut High School student and &lt;a href="http://freethinker.co.uk/2010/04/09/tennessee-dad-wants-textbook-banned-for-dismissing-creationism-as-%E2%80%98biblical-myth%E2%80%99/"&gt;he’s offended&lt;/a&gt; because the Honors Biology textbook they use (“Asking About Life”) has the following passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://images.freethinker.co.uk/uploads/2010/04/creationism.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://images.freethinker.co.uk/uploads/2010/04/creationism.jpg" title="CreationMyth" width="367" height="201"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Creationism: the biblical myth that the universe was created by the Judeo-Christian God in 7 days.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cjgdW4SjoJcC&amp;amp;pg=PA299&amp;amp;lpg=PA299&amp;amp;dq=%22Asking+About+Life%22+biology+tobin+%22the+biblical+myth%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=rvuY2X-2jt&amp;amp;sig=uj17ycOilUBbI8y6ayb5XdAcWsU&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=a_TBS7D3E8-MnQeJpPyPCg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=5&amp;amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;the full context of the quotation&lt;/a&gt;, from a slightly different edition of the book, in a section about the Scopes trial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the 1970s and 1980s, antievolutionists in Arkansas, Tennessee, and Louisiana passed identical bills calling for “equal time” for teaching evolution and &lt;strong&gt;creationism, the biblical myth that the universe was created by the Judeo-Christian God in six days&lt;/strong&gt;. But a court ruled that the “equal time” bill was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the separation of church and state… Creationists argued that the account given in the Bible’s book of Genesis was the basis for “creation science.” But creation “science” is not science.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that’s completely accurate.  And the definition of “myth” isn’t derogatory, either.  It means something that “describe[s] a traditional or legendary story with or without a natural explanation.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school board’s &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/09/tennessee-not-doomed"&gt;reviewers agreed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One reviewer’s first impression of creationism’s definition was similar to Zimmermann’s in that “the authors must be offensively biased against this Christian view of the world,” the reviewer wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Upon further investigation, however, I quickly realized there is more than one definition of the word ‘myth.’ In this case the word is used appropriately to describe a traditional or legendary story… with or without a natural explanation,” the [school board] reviewer wrote.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for the reviewers for getting it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever Creationism is, it’s not science.  Educated people know it’s pure fiction.  And Zimmerman’s son would do well to do his own research on the subject so he realizes his father doesn’t know what he’s talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/3JQbThfN3O8%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really surprised this is taking place in Farragut.  Of all the things to criticize in that community, lack of religious fervor is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same school &lt;a href="http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/151846/19980506/indigo_girls.jhtml?_requestid=96701"&gt;made news over a decade ago&lt;/a&gt; because they wouldn’t allow the Indigo Girls to play a free concert at the school.  Administrators claimed it was because of the content of a particular song lyric, but students I knew at the time said it was really because the Indigo Girls were lesbians.)  Whatever the reason, the school is bent toward a conservative mindset.  Another friend of mine took one of those “Bible as literature” classes there and told me the line between “as literature” and “this is absolutely true” was crossed repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, you can understand why I was surprised to read about the Biology textbook story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the motion to take a second look at the textbook &lt;a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/apr/08/school-issues-put-off-for-now/"&gt;has been postponed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

How can you help promote it? Here are some suggestions:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tell other people. Do this in your skeptic meetings. Tell your family and friends. Tell your former pastor. Tell a Christian apologist or two you may know. Write about it on your blogs. Quote from it in your online forums. Buy up copies to hand out. Rather than merely argue with your Christian family and friends, hand them this book. It will save you months of arguing with them, and it's not expensive at all. Donate one to your local library, or tell librarians it's something they should get. Go into your local bookstores and ask if they have this book. If they say no, ask them to order it. Have a couple of people do that and the bookstores will order the book. Ask one of the authors to come speak at your group. Check to see which author lives the closest to you. Interview the authors on your podcast if you host one. Write reviews of it on Amazon and other online bookstores.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are passionate about Christianity it's the least you can do for our common cause.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don't have it yet check it out: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christian-Delusion-Why-Faith-Fails/dp/1616141689?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969"&gt;The Christian Delusion: Why Faith Fails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1616141689" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important;padding:0px!important"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3895960193971208795?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spotted this via a link on the &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt; website. It’s not Saturday anymore, but this is too good to keep for another six days. The cat is called Rocky, he’s two year’s old, and he lives with a young woman called Daisy in the Gard region of France. Sadly, he doesn’t do this too much now, as she’s moved the furniture. When the video was taken (November 2009), he could only see the birds if he was standing up. Now, like most domestic cats, he can watch his desired prey sitting down. Oh, and turn the sound off. For some reason Daisy and her partner, Yann, have put some very irritating music on the soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/11/sunday-felid-or-the-evolution-of-bipedalism/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/MVV_HXtEbLo/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could he do it if the sofa wasn’t so squishy? Why is this behaviour so unusual?&lt;/p&gt;

It was just a little too sensationalistic, too out of character. &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articleComments,5415,Richard-Dawkins-I-will-arrest-Pope-Benedict-XVI,Marc-Horne----TimesOnline,page2#478580"&gt;I was right&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I did NOT say "I will arrest Pope Benedict XVI" or anything so personally grandiloquent. You have to remember that The Sunday Times is a Murdoch newspaper, and that all newspapers follow the odd custom of entrusting headlines to a sub-editor, not the author of the article itself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What I DID say to Marc Horne when he telephoned me out of the blue, and I repeat it here, is that I am whole-heartedly behind the initiative by Geoffrey Robertson and Mark Stephens to mount a legal challenge to the Pope's proposed visit to Britain. Beyond that, I declined to comment to Marc Horme, other than to refer him to my 'Ratzinger is the Perfect Pope' article here: &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5341"&gt;http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5341&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here is what really happened. Christopher Hitchens first proposed the legal challenge idea to me on March 14th. I responded enthusiastically, and suggested the name of a high profile human rights lawyer whom I know. I had lost her address, however, and set about tracking her down. Meanwhile, Christopher made the brilliant suggestion of Geoffrey Robertson. He approached him, and Mr Robertson's subsequent 'Put the Pope in the Dock' article in The Guardian shows him to be ideal:
&lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5366"&gt;http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5366&lt;/a&gt;
The case is obviously in good hands, with him and Mark Stephens. I am especially intrigued by the proposed challenge to the legality of the Vatican as a sovereign state whose head can claim diplomatic immunity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Even if the Pope doesn't end up in the dock, and even if the Vatican doesn't cancel the visit, I am optimistic that we shall raise public consciousness to the point where the British government will find it very awkward indeed to go ahead with the Pope's visit, let alone pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/you_cant_trust_a_murdoch_paper.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/2gBgGe0J2Rs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270998968762"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/maybe_australians_have_particu.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1c13bea58bd988ab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Maybe Australians have particularly vigorous church services?</title><published>2010-04-11T13:55:11Z</published><updated>2010-04-11T13:55:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/6t4VrP36H1E/maybe_australians_have_particu.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/maybe_australians_have_particu.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems that it might be &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/national/aussies-safer-in-a-strip-club-than-a-church-figures-show/story-e6frfkvr-1225852345577"&gt;safer to attend an Australian strip show than to go to church&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest data, compiled by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, showed 1600 people were charged with committing a range of 27 offences in the state's "places of worship'' in 2008.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Surprisingly, the figures showed only 282 people were charged in premises classified as adult entertainment over the same offences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except — and I do hate to ruin a funny story — the newspaper article says nothing about the number of premises involved. I suspect that there may be many more churches than strip clubs, which would mean that per venue, churches would be safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that latter assumption is not true, though, let me know — it would mean Australia is actually Flying Spaghetti Monster paradise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/maybe_australians_have_particu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/6t4VrP36H1E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270996601628"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4759375024932667062">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/222cabef30f4a140</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Health" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Homeopathy Kills</title><published>2010-04-11T14:32:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-11T14:32:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/04/homeopathy-kills.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;Here's what can happen if a homeopath treats his own daughter.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BulgarianFuzzy.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BulgarianFuzzy.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bucky Katt's assumption seems to be that the dress code at a Bulgarian nightclub would be ragged and strange, thus (at least partly) explaining Rob Wilco's pre-torn and pre-soiled shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As it happens, this morning's Stone Soup featured a more familiar Bulgarian stereotype, based on the history that resulted in the name &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_delbrueckii_subsp._bulgaricus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BulgarianDip.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BulgarianDip.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought I would see what other Bulgarian stereotypes might be floating around out there, and as a result, I stumbled on a relevant story from last fall that I somehow missed at the time — &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/bulgaria/6650677/Aliens-already-exist-on-earth-Bulgarian-scientists-claim.html"&gt;Aliens 'already exist on earth', Bulgarian scientists claim&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, 11/26/2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Aliens from outer space are already among us on earth, say Bulgarian     government scientists who claim they are already in contact with extraterrestrial life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Work on deciphering a complex set of symbols sent to them is underway, scientists from the country's Space Research Institute said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;They claim aliens are currently answering 30 questions posed to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Lachezar Filipov, deputy director of the Space Research Institute of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, confirmed the research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;He said the centre's researchers were analysing 150 crop circles from around the world, which they believe answer the questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"Aliens are currently all around us, and are watching us all the time," Mr Filipov told Bulgarian media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"They are not hostile towards us, rather, they want to help us but we have not grown enough in order to establish direct contact with them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, "badmoviefan" at the site abovetopsecret &lt;a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread522403/pg1"&gt;posted a letter&lt;/a&gt; said to be from Filipov himself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This year, I had the opportunity of putting together a team of experts representing various scientific fields and walks of life. We worked together on a project based on the original work on our own Mrs M.Vezneva, a former architect and correspondence member of IAI. Mrs. Vezneva has two published books containing dictionaries of universal symbols language via which she states that pictograms may be interpreted. In her books, she engages in a dialogue regarding global issues with the crop circles “creators”. It is based on the universal symbols language, I.e. Pcychometry and telepathy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The aim of the “Dialogue 2009” experiment is to carry out a similar  dialogue regarding the use of the crop circles but using different participants. We believe that the crop circles are real existing  formations from unexplained nature, and that they carry information from  alien to us sources. We have already 36 participant replies which we are currently  analyzing. Currently, there are facts confirming our initial hypothesis, mentioned above, however we will publish our final thoughts after  careful consideration by all team members.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about Ms. Vezneva's pictogramology is available on a &lt;a href="http://www.vezneva-pictograms.com/en/index.php"&gt;special website&lt;/a&gt;, including a &lt;a href="http://www.vezneva-pictograms.com/en/dict.php"&gt;dictionary&lt;/a&gt; in which my favorite item is the remarkable entry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A book written within and on the backside” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;–  the human consciousness                 and sub-consciousness, the human memory from his past  lives;                 the human brain, “sealed by seven seals”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inexplicably, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1535"&gt;Cybertronian&lt;/a&gt; has not yet been added to the ancient writings in Ms. Vezneva's collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a topical hook, Reuters/Ipsos has just released a poll showing that "&lt;a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/One-in-Five-20-Global-Citizens-Believe-That-Alien-Beings-Have-Com-1144745.htm"&gt;One in Five (20%) Global Citizens Believe That Alien Beings Have Come&lt;/a&gt;" (4/8/2010). National alien belief rates are reported to range from a high of 45% in India to a low of 8% in the Netherlands, with the U.S. (24%) in the middle. Bulgaria isn't listed, but Italy (25%), Russia (21%), Poland (19%), Czech Republic (18%) and Hungary (14%) are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Those who believe that "alien beings have come to earth and walk amongst us in our communities disguised as us" (20%) are more likely to be men (22%) compared to women (17%), under the age of 35 (25%) compared to those aged 35-54 (16%) and those over the age of 55 (11%) and those more likely to be higher educated (22%) compared to those who are lower or middle educated (19%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poll didn't break out national Academy of Science members as a separate category, but perhaps in that case the effects of age neutralize those of sex and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[And for lagniappe, this is real science: "&lt;a href="http://www.bio.bas.bg/~phytolbalcan/PDF/15_3/15_3_10_Petrova_&amp;amp;_Vladimirov.pdf"&gt;Two new alien species of Bidens have been recorded in Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;". The alien Bidens really were found in the Varna railway station, but they turn out not to be among those that Mr. Filipov's group believes are already observing among us on earth.]&lt;/p&gt;

Money quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CDC officials are watching the Vancouver outbreak closely, as neighboring Washington state has sizable populations of vaccine refusers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If measles crossed the border into those populations, there’s a potential for a sizable outbreak,&amp;quot; says Dr. Jane Seward of the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antivaxxers are nothing if not ironic: they say they want to protect our health, and yet put it at grave risk, and the fear they monger about vaccines is the exact opposite of what we really should be afraid of: outbreaks of preventable and potentially fatal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip o’ the syringe to Evan Wilson for the NPR story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We all giggled happily, and referred to the dish as Beowulf Burlington for the rest of the evening, but later (cursed as I am with the habits of a scholar) I checked with Microsoft Word on a Mac, and it proposes no such thing (though it does suggest, in a rather desperate and flailing list, correcting &lt;i&gt;boeuf&lt;/i&gt; to one of {&lt;i&gt;beau&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;beef&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;beefs&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;beefy&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bogus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bough&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bout&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;pouf&lt;/i&gt;}; pouf bourguignon, anyone?).  Google doesn't offer the alleged correction either, of course (instead there are hundreds of mentions of the beef dish in question in recipes and menus and reviews).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes wonder if we aren't doomed to a future of suspiciously implausible and uncheckable &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino_effect"&gt;cupertino effect&lt;/a&gt; stories forever — an endless series of newly invented spell-checking chestnuts, false but enjoyed too much to be checked up on or rejected, like Eskimo words for snow, or the old story about the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001715.html"&gt;preposition-stranding correction&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002670.html"&gt;Churchill almost certainly never made&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

The basic point she makes is that vegetarians are being irrational if they refuse to eat meat even if they receive it on a pizza by accident.  Oh, and they should eat oysters also.  (Odd that she cites Peter Singer as a reason to do so, since he talks about why he doesn’t in his book).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been a vegetarian for more than 20 years, I can say that Julia really has no clue about this.  Most of the vegetarians I know do not consider meat to be food anymore.  Many are even put off by it.  So, seeing pepperoni on a pizza would render it unappealing or even unpalatable to many vegetarians, regardless of whether the animal was already dead and it was presented by accident.  Also, it should be obvious that if one chooses to stop eating meat because they associate it with suffering, then this association does not simply vanish when one hasn’t actually asked for meat but receives it accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to explain these persistent constraints to Julia?  Maybe an analogy would work.  Imagine you’re eating a delicious stew and you ask the chef what kind of meat is in it.  He says, “dog” (or, if you prefer, “cat” or perhaps “endangered black rhino”).  The animal is already dead, butchered, prepared, and served.  So, by Julia’s logic, it would be irrational for you to stop eating the stew.  In fact, given that you already do eat meat, and given that it’s pretty arbitrary which animals we consider food and which companions, any revulsion you might feel is even more irrational than a vegetarian removing pepperoni from a pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a surprising lapse in reasoning on an otherwise great blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doc takes an amusing look at our celebrity-obsessed culture, and how corporations use that obsession to sell to us. The filmmakers recorded themselves selling made-up celebrity tips to tabloids to see if any bothered with fact-checking (they didn’t: surprise!). One of the tips was about one of the girls in Girls Aloud (a brainless pop machine) secretly loving astrophysics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filmmakers also showed a PR agent arranging a fake protest against his real beauty queen client. She laughingly posed in front of them as photographers clicked away, and then they broke an egg over her head as she giggled and then tottered off. The press that followed described a distraught beauty queen tormented by evil lesbian feminazis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://starsuckersmovie.com/"&gt;DVD is available April 12&lt;/a&gt;. For those not in the UK, I found a few clips on YouTube. Here’s a clip showing the tip-selling: &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progress of spring continues apace. Earlier tonight, in Franskville, Wisconsin, I passed a chorus of &lt;a href="http://seagrant.wisc.edu/frogs/chorus.html"&gt;chorus frogs&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Pseudacris triseriata&lt;/em&gt;) in wet fields and sloughs calling so loudly that I could hear them in my car with the radio on and the windows closed at 45 mph!&lt;/p&gt;

I had a yummy brick-oven pizza with my family, including my parents and one of my sisters, and I just finished getting my cranky, over-tired child to sleep. Now I'm sitting at my kitchen table drinking some seriously killer single-malt bought for me by my loving spouse, and listening to a Haydn string quartet.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/upload/2010/04/aberlour.jpg" width="250" height="350" alt="aberlour.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just what the doctor ordered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All was well until my buddy Isis, who is several orders of magnitude hotter and smarter than I, noticed &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/wouldnt_you_expect_a_place_cal.php"&gt;a disturbance in the force&lt;/a&gt; (as manifested by a google alert, the tool of internet narcissists everywhere).  In this case, it is a group of college students at Ball State getting their jock straps all in a bunch about a text message.  Apparently, a few women on campus were assaulted by a male on a bicycle.  The campus authorities sent out a text message warning the campus community.  But because it was just some harmless grab-assery, a number of students were annoyed and started a facebook group mocking the whole incident.  Well, Dr. Isis called them out on it--by name.  And some of the boys are upset about it.  I mean, can't a bitch take a joke?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. If it is not immediately obvious to you what the problem here is, then it is time for some introspection.  I'll lay it out for those of you having trouble with some of the concepts here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing "harmless" about someone riding by a woman and grabbing or slapping her behind.  It may or may not cause immediate physical harm.  But touching someone against their will is not only a shitty thing to do, it's against the law.  The reason it's a shitty thing to do is because many women walking across a college campus are legitimately concerned about being assaulted, either by some asshat on a bike, or by some rapacious frat boy who thinks ass-grabbing is just fine. It is a power play, one that creates an environment where women feel less safe and secure.  Given that many campus rapists tend to be repeat offenders, and that smaller acts often escalate into larger ones, the authorities were right to send out a warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more interesting to me is the reaction of some on campus.  This facebook group mocks the university for "over-reacting" (you know, like girls often do).  There are a number of factors contributing to this sort of reaction. One of them is the incredulity of privilege. Most young men have no idea what it is like to be a not-man and many never acquire the empathy and knowledge to improve on this cultivated naivete.  They genuinely cannot understand what all the big deal is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many men absolutely understand what all the big deal is about, and are scared shitless of losing their position of power.  I mean, if you can be judged harshly for a little ass-grabbing, you can be judged for every little thing you say and do.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2010/04/smile_boys_it_would_make_the_w.php"&gt;You know, like women are.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time for the no-longer kids at Ball State to take a deep breath and think a little.  Or they could form a misogynist facebook group, comment on it using real names, and then whine like babies when adults call them out on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/O8OMG-R_zic" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270947871082"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/i_wouldnt_inflict_the_narwhal.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3955b84b3ff59c1f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">I wouldn't inflict the Narwhal Song on you again</title><published>2010-04-11T01:17:58Z</published><updated>2010-04-11T01:17:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/5KFI8PV2p8A/i_wouldnt_inflict_the_narwhal.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/i_wouldnt_inflict_the_narwhal.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;But I will hit you with the &lt;a href="http://www.weebls-stuff.com/songs/dugong/"&gt;Dugong Song&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now you’ve seen the new &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/videos-that-crack-us-up-nike-gives-tiger-woods-another-shot/"&gt;Nike TV ad featuring Tiger Woods&lt;/a&gt; and the voice of his inquisitive (yet deceased) dad. Genius marketing, state-of-the-art technology, top-flight manipulation. But have you heard Ward Cleaver from &lt;em&gt;Leave It to Beaver&lt;/em&gt; and Gene Wilder’s character from &lt;em&gt;Young Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; giving sage advice to ol’ Tiger? Much, much funnier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elyse at Skepchick wrote a 7 part series back in 2008.  She opened with what the homeopaths say about themselves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the ball rolling on day one of Homeopathy Awareness Week, I thought I would bring you some information from the site &lt;a href="http://www.worldhomeopathy.org" title="WARNING: this link leads to crap"&gt;WorldHomeopathy.org&lt;/a&gt;. (This is sort of their FAQ, but without the “questions” or “asking” parts. Fortunately, they don’t call actually &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt;
it a FAQ, so that’s one thing on the page that’s not misleading or
utterly false. They get one fact-based point for that.) Today I bring
you their “Top 10 Reasons to Use Homeopathy”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:117px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/RT2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="RT" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/RT2.jpg" alt="" width="107" height="129"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robbie Thomas: TOAST!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should clear up any rumors or guessing about &lt;em&gt;this &lt;/em&gt;loser in the psychic realm. If you haven’t heard the good news; thanks to some hard work on the part of several skeptics, self-proclaimed police psychic Robbie Thomas has been handed the final nail in the coffin of his “Psychic Justice Tour.”  He’s finished.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice has been served. As the biggest spook crook to come down the pike since Sylvia Browne, I’m proud to have been a part of his undoing. Although &lt;strong&gt;FORCE ONE &lt;/strong&gt;members may never know the true extent of our influence on his ruination, he has been given the boot by his promoter John Ramses, who turns out to have been put under quite a bit of stress and coercion short of being blackmailed by his one-time buddy. I knew I smelled a rat after doing only the slightest bit of research on him back in February (see my previous post “Robo-Psychic”) and I didn’t have to be psychic to smell it. Anyone can put up a glossy web page these days, but when it’s full of mis-spellings, bad grammar and ridiculous testimonials, red flags should go up. We are in the midst of an era of con artistry where Beavis and Butthead could sell off the Eiffel Tower if they had the right web master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a brief note on mis-spellings:&lt;/strong&gt; Unintentional spelling errors that appear on websites are bad enough, but according to my source; Robbie &lt;em&gt;intentionally mis spells&lt;/em&gt; the names of victims, family members and his testimonial people so that they cannot be Googled or otherwise verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few laughs, here’s his “resume”: &lt;a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/robbiethomas"&gt;http://ca.linkedin.com/in/robbiethomas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back, &lt;strong&gt;FORCE ONE &lt;/strong&gt;and a few other IIG members mounted a carefully orchestrated sting operation that would have given Robbie quite a hard time had he actually fulfilled his “TBA Tour Schedule.” He didn’t. There never was any tour booked. It was all a sham deal. Robbie was waiting until the last minute to travel to L.A., hoping to sell enough tickets to make it worth he and his partner’s time. Ironically, all the tickets he sold out here for his supposed March 26th show here in L.A. &lt;em&gt;were purchased by &lt;strong&gt;FORCE ONE&lt;/strong&gt; and IIG members&lt;/em&gt;. Now THAT would have been a roomful of fun huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what must be done with these blatant criminals. Scam artists like Thomas, Browne and Coffey spread torment and unhappiness to thousands of parents and relatives of missing and murdered children to line their pockets. Is there a lower life than that? As CFI and IIG begin to coalesce their projected plans for a future grassroots movement, I hope that groups of like-minded individuals will begin to step up and take a stand against this fiendishness. Imagine if events like Randi’s Peter Popoff Affair were to start happening here and around the world every few weeks rather than every ten years?  That’s a dream I hope I live to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we were ready for Robbie to try and lay his line of crap on us and some of the tasty little touches we worked out to mess with him are just too good to be mentioned here. Unfortunately he and Ramses backed out just two days before showtime, citing “dire family illness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion, the actions of Robbie Thomas are no better than a common crook. If you think I’m exaggerating, read the 38 page story that has been released to the public through Ramses. It starts out fairly realistic and ends up being rightfully ballistic. Thomas deserves only the worst that society can throw at him. He’s now making statements that only the wildest wing-nuts like himself would ever believe. Reports have come to me from a reliable source that a website that inclsded several blog pages, (which has since been mysteriously taken down as in the Bonnie Vent Affair) suggested that the “US Elite” and US Government are after him. He is claiming that because of these psychic powers he has, they want him stopped and have gotten to his closest friends and made them enemies and made this whole affair up to stop him. I hope he gets abducted by an alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robbie’s best friend posted this on Facebook (about Robbie):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Interesting how most psychics claim they communicate with loved ones who have passed on…too maybe read into a location or see somewhat into the future or past, but one thing they can’t seem to do…tell the truth!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read John Ramses statement here and celebrate what I hope signals yet another victory for those of us who want to make a difference. If anyone still has any doubts that speaking up, getting involved and DOING SOMETHING can’t make a huge difference, read about how the skeptical community “drove him mad” with our websites and blogs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.labyrinth-entertainment.com/statement/Official_Statement_Psychic_Justice_end.pdf"&gt;http://www.labyrinth-entertainment.com/statement/Official_Statement_Psychic_Justice_end.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:119px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/picture.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="picture" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/picture.jpg" alt="" width="109" height="124"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robbie&amp;#39;s Art&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had some real plans for Thomas, believe me. No problem. We will shelve this plan of operation for the time being until the next phony psychic comes to town. Putting our Robbie scenario together and crafting each part of it was good practice and showed me that there are people out there who are willing to stand up and get in the faces of opportunists like Robbie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the rest of you thieves, tricksters and liars best take note: &lt;em&gt;we are ready for you&lt;/em&gt;. When you come within striking distance of Hollywood, …watch your backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will never know what hit you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AND THIS JUST IN:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(MONDAY, APRIL 12TH)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robbie Thomas is seeking to gain an advantage for his “show” in Fort Wayne, Indiana by “working with”  police in their investigation of the murder of 8 year old April Tinsley. This is another cold case from 1988 that Thomas is trying to exploit. If you live in Fort Wayne: &lt;strong&gt;DO SOMETHING. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A few people responded saying we were either geeks or nerds. One person got the answer correct: it meant that we are awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, is social media that geeky? Is understanding technology geeky anymore? Or are geeks refusing to admit their schtick has gone mainstream? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m posting this from my iPhone from the pedicure chair at the spa BTW!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it time for geeks to admit that techis now what the cool kids do? And accept that this doesn’t make them cool by default?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The future Pope Benedict XVI resisted pleas to defrock a California priest with a record of sexually molesting children, citing concerns including “the good of the universal church,” according to a 1985 letter bearing his signature.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Taibbi&lt;/strong&gt; asks an &lt;a href="http://trueslant.com/matttaibbi/2010/04/09/pope-still-a-douche/"&gt;interesting (and very Taibbi-esque) question&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What’s it going to take for them to get rid of this cat? Is it going to take catching him boarding an airplane with his cock in a six year-old Little Leaguer? Prognostications welcome: &lt;strong&gt;what would have to be the “last straw” for this Pope?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anything that would force him to resign?  Anything that would show he’s fallible?  Or is that too much to ask of Catholics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt; had his own &lt;a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100031796/richard-dawkins-pope-benedict-is-a-leering-old-villain-in-a-frock/"&gt;memorable words&lt;/a&gt; about Ratzinger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Should the pope resign?” No. As the College of Cardinals must have recognized when they elected him, he is perfectly — ideally — qualified to lead the Roman Catholic Church. A leering old villain in a frock, who spent decades conspiring behind closed doors for the position he now holds; a man who believes he is infallible and acts the part; a man whose preaching of scientific falsehood is responsible for the deaths of countless AIDS victims in Africa; a man whose first instinct when his priests are caught with their pants down is to cover up the scandal and damn the young victims to silence: in short, exactly the right man for the job. He should not resign, moreover, because he is perfectly positioned to accelerate the downfall of the evil, corrupt organization whose character he fits like a glove, and of which he is the absolute and historically appropriate monarch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Pope Ratzinger should not resign. He should remain in charge of the whole rotten edifice –- the whole profiteering, woman-fearing, guilt-gorging, truth-hating, child-raping institution –- while it tumbles, amid a stench of incense and a rain of tourist-kitsch sacred hearts and preposterously crowned virgins, about his ears.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don’t get is why people are arguing that the media is treating the Catholic Church unfairly or that people are making &lt;a href="http://www.getreligion.org/?p=30825"&gt;too big a deal&lt;/a&gt; about this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I remember reading &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/21/AR2007102100144.html"&gt;this AP report&lt;/a&gt; that three children a day are inappropriately touched by public school teachers. And yet we don’t seem to see commensurate media coverage. Partly that’s because it’s more difficult to pin a “conspiracy” charge on the public school system. Partly that’s because we hold clergy to higher standards. I’m sure there are many other reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that other groups of people do these awful things doesn’t detract from the real heart of this issue — &lt;em&gt;the Catholic Church has systematically tried to cover this mess up&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Side note: Did anyone listen to &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; last week?  Here’s the &lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/404/enemy-camp-2010"&gt;main story’s summary&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Patrick Wall was a special kind of monk. He was a fixer. The Catholic church sent him to problem parishes where priests had been removed because of scandal. His job was to come in, keep events from going public and smooth things over until a permanent replacement priest was found. But after four different churches in four years, after covering up for pedophiles and adulterers and liars and embezzlers he decided to make a change.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really an incredible story. Go listen to it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m shocked that anyone would still want to be a part of this Church — sure, they may not support the way the Church is handling this issue, but they say they still love the culture and the tradition and the services.  That’s the problem.  They support the &lt;em&gt;institution&lt;/em&gt; and don’t do enough to criticize them for their faults.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Jewish scripture predates the invention of bicycles and spandex, leading to silly conflicts when &lt;a href="http://gothamist.com/2008/09/12/hasids_say_cyclists_too_sexy_for_bi.php"&gt;bike lanes run through religious neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt;.  Similarly, Catholic proscriptions on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_contraception#Background"&gt;contraception&lt;/a&gt;, which might have made sense back when people disgustingly used &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Using-a-candy-bar-wrapper-as-a-condom/300790304234#!/pages/Using-a-candy-bar-wrapper-as-a-condom/300790304234?v=info"&gt;candy bar wrappers&lt;/a&gt; as birth control, seem pretty goofy now that actual condoms are available for free in the school nurse’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, the Muslim idea that a woman should only be seen in public wearing a burqa might need rethinking now that go-carts &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1264535/Muslim-woman-strangled-burkha-freak-kart-accident.html"&gt;have become popular&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Muslim clothing the woman was wearing flew back as she sped around the track and part of it became entangled in the go-kart’s wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was strangled in a second and crashed the vehicle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only a go-kart-specific problem, either.  The same could happen with a lawn mower, with a motorbike, with a roller-coaster or a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit_%27n_Spin"&gt;Sit ‘n Spin&lt;/a&gt; or a Tower of Terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty clear that the burqa isn’t appropriate apparel for the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, I guess you could instead take the position that maybe women just shouldn’t be allowed to do any of those things, or maybe that women’s lives just aren’t that important, and a few strangulations is a small price to pay for the corresponding benefits of getting your life micro-managed by a bunch of scripture-interpreting zealots.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But religious people couldn’t be that callous.  Could they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/s/sympathetic_magic.html"&gt;All sympathetic magic is based upon two principles&lt;/a&gt;: first, &amp;quot;likes produce likes,&amp;quot; or that an effect resembles it cause; and, second, that things having been in contact with each other continue to react upon one and another at a distant even after they have been severed or disconnected. The former principle is called the &lt;a href="http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/l/law_of_similarity.html"&gt;Law of Similarity&lt;/a&gt;, while the latter is the &lt;a href="http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/l/law_of_contagion.html"&gt;Law of Contagion&lt;/a&gt; or Contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s homeopathy in a nutshell, with the addition of &amp;quot;the &lt;a href="http://www.homeowatch.org/basic/infinitesimals.html"&gt;Law of Infinitesimals&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; , in which a substance is deemed to have more effect on the human organism the more it is diluted. 

&lt;a href="http://www.1023.org.uk/"&gt;As the 10:23 campaign explained:
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Homeopathy is an unscientific and absurd pseudoscience, yet it persists today as an accepted complementary medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ask many people what they think homeopathy is, and you&amp;#39;ll be told &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s herbal medicine&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s all-natural&amp;quot;. Few realise that it&amp;#39;s been proven not to work; even fewer know it involves substances so dilute that there&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.1023.org.uk/what-is-homeopathy.php"&gt;nothing left in them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
 

&lt;/blockquote&gt; Homeopathy is pre-scientific approach, ignoring the laws of physics and the biological knowledge of disease.  So why is it still in use in the twenty-first century?  Homeopaths firmly believe in magical thinking.  However, these beliefs are being challenged.

&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedpharmacy.wordpress.com/"&gt;Science Based Pharmacist &lt;/a&gt;says, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sciencebasedpharmacy.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/world-homeopathy-awareness-week-is-coming/"&gt;It hasn’t been a good year for homeopaths&lt;/a&gt;, with the UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedpharmacy.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/british-mps-tell-govt-stop-funding-homeopathy/"&gt;determining homeopathy to be a “placebo”&lt;/a&gt;; the 10:23protesters undertaking a &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedpharmacy.wordpress.com/2010/01/30/pharmacies-targeted-in-mass-homeopathy-overdose/"&gt;mass overdose of homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; (where precisely nothing happened); and New Zealand homeopaths admitting that their products &lt;a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE1001/S00073.htm"&gt;contain no material substances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

My personal favorite of the &amp;quot;ridiculousness of homeopathy&amp;quot; awareness posts was written by &lt;a href="http://aliceingalaxyland.blogspot.com"&gt;Alice in Galaxyland&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a few of her somewhat snarky phrasings of &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Proof Homeopathy Works&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://aliceingalaxyland.blogspot.com/2010/03/and-therefore.html"&gt;Excuses for Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;THE CONSPIRACY THEORY ARGUMENT&lt;br&gt;1) Anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t like homeopathy is clearly in the pay of Big Pharma.&lt;br&gt;2) The fact that Big Pharma also makes homeopathy pills is neither here nor there.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE CHERRY PICKING ARGUMENT&lt;br&gt;1) Some quotes support homeopathy.&lt;br&gt;2) The skeptics say not if you read them properly, but that&amp;#39;s just twisting things.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/932"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE CHERRY PICKING ARGUMENT (2)&lt;br&gt;1) Some scientific papers find that homeopathy does work.&lt;br&gt;2) Others find it doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;br&gt;3) The skeptics claim that #2 are the better ones, because they have better methodology.&lt;br&gt;4) Yeah, but they were funded/invented by Big Pharma.&lt;br&gt;5) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE &amp;quot;HOLISTIC&amp;quot; ARGUMENT&lt;br&gt;1) Homeopathy treats the cause, not the symptoms.&lt;br&gt;2) The very principle of homeopathy is to find an ingredient that mimicks the symptoms. But the same symptoms can mean a host of different things. For example, a headache may mean tense muscles, eye strain, or meningitis.&lt;br&gt;3) But homeopathy is &lt;em&gt;holistic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;4) And you just don&amp;#39;t understand homeopathy.&lt;br&gt;5) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM INCOMPREHENSIBILITY&lt;br&gt;1) Quantum physics is weird.&lt;br&gt;2) I don&amp;#39;t understand it, and surely you don&amp;#39;t either.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE CONSUMER CHOICE ARGUMENT&lt;br&gt;1) For [a pharmacy] to remove homeopathic products from the shelves is to attack consumer choice and deny us our freedom.&lt;br&gt;2) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM NECESSARY OPPOSITES (1)&lt;br&gt;1) There are problems associated with conventional medicine.&lt;br&gt;2) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM NECESSARY OPPOSITES (2)&lt;br&gt;1) Homeopathy doesn&amp;#39;t cause side-effects like conventional medicine.&lt;br&gt;2) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE MYSTICAL ARGUMENT&lt;br&gt;1) You don&amp;#39;t understand how homeopathy works, which only goes to show how ignorant you are.&lt;br&gt;2) I don&amp;#39;t understand how homeopathy works, which only goes to show the mysteries of science and the life-force which narrow tick-boxes cannot define.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM POLITICAL CORRECTNESS&lt;br&gt;1) Someone had an idea!&lt;br&gt;2) It is just petty to suggest this idea might be wrong. You&amp;#39;re jealous and close-minded.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM POLITICAL CORRECTNESS (2)&lt;br&gt;1) I have an opinion.&lt;br&gt;2) I am entitled to my opinion.&lt;br&gt;5) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM POLITICAL CORRECTNESS (3)&lt;br&gt;1) My opinion is that homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;2) If I disagree with your opinion, that is my right.&lt;br&gt;3) If you disagree with my opinion, that is persecution.&lt;br&gt;4) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM INCREDULITY&lt;br&gt;1) I can&amp;#39;t believe the placebo effect would work on animals and children.&lt;br&gt;2) Apparently it does, but I don&amp;#39;t believe that.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM INCREDULITY (2)&lt;br&gt;1) If it&amp;#39;s harmless and doesn&amp;#39;t work, why are they attacking it?&lt;br&gt;2) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.homeopathyheals.me.uk/site/latest-news/224-1023-anti-homeopathy-campaign-overdose"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE&lt;br&gt;1) I don&amp;#39;t understand the science of homeopathy, but once upon a time we didn&amp;#39;t understand electricity either.&lt;br&gt;2) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;........&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM HISTORY&lt;br&gt;1) Galileo was persecuted for his belief that the Earth revolved around the Sun.&lt;br&gt;2) The fact that Galileo had deduced this with experiments rather than simply thought it up, while the Church was the source of unreasoned faith, is far too complex a matter to understand and you are simply picking holes in my argument because you have no ideas of your own.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM DIGNITY&lt;br&gt;1) Skeptics ask why water does not remember poo.&lt;br&gt;2) That is a very undignified question.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href="http://homeopathyplus.com.au/hplus/political-issues/first-they-came-for-the-homeopaths....html"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM DISLIKE OF SCIENCE&lt;br&gt;1) Double-blind randomised trials make it clear that homeopathy does not work.&lt;br&gt;2) Well, they must be wrong.&lt;br&gt;3) And I don&amp;#39;t like science anyway.&lt;br&gt;4) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM MIRACLES&lt;br&gt;1) Homeopathy cured my auntie of cancer.&lt;br&gt;2) She took chemotherapy and had an operation too, but she didn&amp;#39;t like either of them and it can&amp;#39;t have been that, chemo contains nasty &lt;em&gt;chemicals&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT&lt;/p&gt;1) I read in an article that skeptics approve of GM food and think 6 month old babies can survive 900 vaccinations in one go.&lt;br&gt;2) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/6aidnp"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE THEORETICAL ARGUMENT&lt;br&gt;1) Skeptics claim to be the guardians of universal truth.&lt;br&gt;2) Those of us who think they know everything are very annoying to those of us who do.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE THEORETICAL ARGUMENT (2)&lt;br&gt;1) Our bodies are designed to heal themselves.&lt;br&gt;2) Excuse me? Are you saying that deaths of starvation mean homeopathy doesn&amp;#39;t work?&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;.........&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM THE TOILET&lt;br&gt;1) The water in your toilet is different in more ways than in chemical composition than water out of a spring.&lt;br&gt;2) You need me to &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; that?!?!?! HA HA HA HA HA YOU ARE SO IGNORANT!&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/6aidnp"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARGUMENT FROM HUMOUR&lt;br&gt;1) We can make a lot of claims about skeptics, that will make you laugh until your throat is sore!&lt;br&gt;2) For example, they believe pregnancy is a disease, think people should be &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;vaccinated&lt;/span&gt;, and don&amp;#39;t know the difference between LIVING and DEAD FOOD!!!!!!!!&lt;br&gt;3) HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!&lt;br&gt;4) Actually, some skeptics are laughing at you for saying that.&lt;br&gt;5) But of course they are. They have nothing real to laugh at because they live such miserable lives.&lt;br&gt;6) Of course they will deny their stupidities, once said stupidities are exposed.&lt;br&gt;7) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/6aidnp"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE CONSISTENCY ARGUMENT&lt;br&gt;1) Sometimes skeptics change their minds.&lt;br&gt;2) THEY RETRACT THEIR VIEWS!!!&lt;br&gt;3) THEY ADMIT THEY WERE WRONG!!!!!!&lt;br&gt;4) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE HARMLESSNESS ARGUMENT&lt;br&gt;1) Nobody died as a result of the Ten:23 protest.&lt;br&gt;2) This only goes to show that homeopathy is not dangerous, like conventional medicine.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;........&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE ARGUMENT FOR &amp;quot;NATURE&amp;quot; (AND IGNORANCE)&lt;br&gt;1) Homeopathy is natural.&lt;br&gt;2) What, it isn&amp;#39;t herbal?&lt;br&gt;3) Well, it was invented 200 years ago.&lt;br&gt;4) My mind&amp;#39;s made up. Don&amp;#39;t confuse me with facts.&lt;br&gt;5) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT [UK Edition]&lt;br&gt;1) Homeopathy saves the NHS money.&lt;br&gt;2) It also doesn&amp;#39;t make drugs companies a profit (unless of course they&amp;#39;re the same drugs companies that manufacture conventional drugs).&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, drugs companies say homeopathy doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;br&gt;4) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/columnists/phillips/2010/02/27/homeopathic-medicine-is-nature-s-tonic-115875-22073591/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENT&lt;br&gt;1) ΨPPR = a ΨPx + b ΨPr + c ΨRx.&lt;br&gt;2) There you are - serious science!&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore, homeopathy works.&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href="http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=pdf&amp;amp;file=10.1159/000093666"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY ARGUMENT&lt;br&gt;1) Show your support for homeopathy!

The inimitable Jamy Ian Swiss will emcee the festivities, which will take place from 10AM - 6PM on Saturday, April 17. The location will be Florence Gould Hall at the French Institute, located at 55 E. 59th St. New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you missed a few posts on Blisstree this week, here are five of our favorites from the last five days. Not to brag or anything, but we like them, and hope you do, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/tackle-tax-season-with-learnvest/"&gt;Tackle Tax Season With LearnVest&lt;/a&gt;: The pros at LearnVest tell us what to do with our (hopefully sizable) tax refunds, and give us lots of other fiscal advice. Plus, they’ll answer your money-related questions if you leave them in the comments section or email them to: comments@blisstree.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/adventures-in-a-wheat-free-world-gluten-free-pastas/"&gt;Adventures in a No-Wheat World: Gluten-Free Pastas&lt;/a&gt;: Blisstree Deputy Editor Briana Rognlin gets all gluten-free on us with a good glut of products. As much as we love wheat, this post makes us think we may just want to lighten up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/feel/on-demand-c-sections-our-awesome-obgyn-cuts-to-the-chase/"&gt;On-Demand C-Sections? Our Awesome OB/GYN Cuts to the Chase&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Hi…I’d like to make an appointment to have my baby on Thursday at 4:30 p.m.&lt;/em&gt; Think that’s a joke? Nope. Dr. Edward Gill of Richmond, Virginia, chews the fat about the rising trend of C-sections on demand. An idea that’s weird and kind of cool at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/read-it-like-a-man-conspiracy-theory-books/"&gt;Read It Like a Man: Conspiracy Theory Books&lt;/a&gt;: Patrick Sauer suggests books women should read in order to understand men better (or at all). But even if you never pick up a single one (books, not men), his themed weekly column is a damn good read, if we do say so ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/eco-friendly-shopping-10-kitchen-items-under-10/"&gt;Eco-Friendly Shopping: 10 Kitchen Buys Under $10&lt;/a&gt;: Cheap, cool, and environmentally guilt-free. What’s not to like?&lt;/p&gt;

Some good news about access to the journal.  Still not satisfactory in my opinion, and doesn’t address the principle of how this all went down (which was my main problem), but a good start.  It’s a great journal and I still strongly support the editors and the mission, and I encourage you to keep reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;    We’ve submitted EE&amp;amp;O to PubMed Central, the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s free digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journals. What this means is that EE&amp;amp;O will be free to all, on the PMC site, after a 12 month embargo period (a 12 month “moving wall“). There is quite a long ‘waiting list’ at PMC. While the paperwork has all been submitted, we are looking at around a 6 month wait until all backfiles are up and visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    While we would love to open up the content on SpringerLink, PMC will not allow us to have EE&amp;amp;0 opened in full on more than one repository. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also get a personal print subscription for $40, which isn’t bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this year, at 9pm Friday, July 9th, we’re bringing The Ham Party 2 to TAM 8! We’re stepping it up even further and bringing you nothing less than the best talent program the skeptical world has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to read through this whole article for a breakdown of what you’ll get if you purchase a ticket to The Ham Party 2, as well as the guidelines for submitting yourself as a contestant. If you are chosen as one of the performers for this event, your admission to The Ham Party will be waived, and you will be eligible to win some great prizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, let me talk about what The Ham Party 2 experience will be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, all three of our judges are real Vegas performers who have the know-how required to critique your talent — but don’t worry, we haven’t brought on Simon Cowell in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, our judges are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Master jazz pianist &lt;a href="http://www.jonesjazz.com/"&gt;Mike “Jonesy” Jones&lt;/a&gt;, who you may have seen playing at the &lt;a href="http://www.pennandteller.com/"&gt;Penn &amp;amp; Teller&lt;/a&gt; show at the Rio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The hilarious Mac King of &lt;a href="http://www.mackingshow.com/"&gt;Mac King’s Comedy Magic Show&lt;/a&gt; at Harrah’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Fab musician &lt;a href="http://stevecraigmusic.com"&gt;Steve Craig&lt;/a&gt;, who performs as John Lennon in Planet Hollywood’s &lt;a href="http://fabfourlive.com/"&gt;Fab Four Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our host this year will be talent connoisseur Ed Sullivan, played by Paul Terry of Fab Four Live. That’s right — if you perform at The Ham Party 2, Ed Sullivan will support you during your judges’ critique!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance to The Ham Party 2 is a mere twenty dollars, and promises to be an excellent time, with at least ten talents showcased and a cast of hilarious, sharp-witted performers to narrate the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re interested in performing at The Ham Party 2? E-mail &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/mailto:alison@randi.org"&gt;alison@randi.org&lt;/a&gt; right away with your full name and a description of your talent for consideration. Keep in mind that all performances should be around eight minutes long (this includes setup time!) — and that after ten minutes, we will dismiss you from the stage due to time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that your performance is all you — you must bring your own props (if you have any) to the stage with you. None will be provided, and we ask that you have the ability to carry your act onto the stage and back off again by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: If you are chosen as a performer in The Ham Party 2, your admission will be waived, and you’ll be eligible to win fantastic prizes!&lt;/p&gt;

I'll wait a few months to decide for sure, as it doesn't count until I've made it through the summer heat.

So far I've been exploring town on foot and meeting all sorts of friendly people. Breakfast tacos are the staple and there are fresh avocados everywhere. Dogs and bicycles are popular, flip-flops are 'the Austin work boot', and wildflowers abound thanks to Lady Bird Johnson.

I've been hanging out with a lot of great folks involved in energy and recently toured a coal power plant. I also visited Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge which offers great birding opportunities. And since it's Austin, it was easy to find a group of talented guys to play music with. Something about this place already feels like home.

CM's on the way over to visit, so I'm hoping the city inspires him to pick up his guitar again...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F04%2F10%2Fpostcard-from-austin%2F" width="100%" height="250" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270915758540"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/deadline_stop_motion_video_mad.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b78777ef84dcc226</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Fun"/><title type="html">DEADLINE: stop motion video made of post-it notes!</title><published>2010-04-10T17:14:42Z</published><updated>2010-04-10T17:14:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/PmAMBm41NQU/deadline_stop_motion_video_mad.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/deadline_stop_motion_video_mad.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/BpWM0FNPZSs%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0xe1600f%26color2%3D0xfebd01%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/deadline_stop_motion_video_mad.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/PmAMBm41NQU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270914662800"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4646">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7dfc0218c72ad84c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Homeopathy"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="John Benneth"/><category term="world homeopathy awareness week"/><title type="html">In honor of World Homeopathy Awareness Week 2010</title><published>2010-04-10T15:15:53Z</published><updated>2010-04-10T15:15:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4646" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, April 10, is the first day of &lt;a href="http://www.worldhomeopathy.org/whaw.html"&gt;World Homeopathy Awareness Week&lt;/a&gt; (WHAW), or, as I like to call it, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/05/doctor_strange_and_the_only_way_to_make.php"&gt;World Sympathetic Magic Awareness Week&lt;/a&gt;. This week long “celebration” runs from today until April 16. Now, given the dim view of homeopathy which, I daresay, each and every blogger here at SBM shares, you’d think I wouldn’t want people to pay attention to WHAW. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I view homeopathy as nothing more than quackery based on magical thinking that I actually want people to be aware of it, starting with some of the more amusing bits that homeopaths have published over the last year. Like this bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/lpC8BvHyorg%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which Steve discussed &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1383"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and Orac had some fun with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_physics_of_h.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Steve’s deconstruction of Benneth’s nonsense brought responses calling him a &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1663"&gt;hypocrite&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/why_oh_why_cant_i_have_something_like_th.php"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; or a “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4524"&gt;slave breaker&lt;/a&gt;.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/C0c5yClip4o%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which Orac also had some fun with &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2377"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Steve had a bit of fun with &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2366"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which is why this is the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=452"&gt;best homeopathy poster ever&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;  &lt;a href="http://hellsnewsstand.blogspot.com/2009/04/we-have-posters-too.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3358/3428145260_137850a3f0.jpg" width="323" height="500" alt="HN09poster1A"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, these two videos probably demonstrate the utter ridiculousness of homeopathy better than almost anything else, which is why I present them again in honor of WHAW. First, there’s the already classic Mitchell and Webb sketch, even though it’s maybe a year old:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/HMGIbOGu8q0%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s an oldie but goodie, &lt;em&gt;Homeopathic E.R.&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/of-iOGr-Ur4%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget that stand up comedy can be perfect for deconstructing nonsense like homeopathy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/VIaV8swc-fo%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Mitchell and Dara O’Briain even talk about it a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/ZemJD-9IIqk%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=289" width="480" height="289"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There. I trust I’ve done my part to spread awareness of homeopathy in honor of World Homeopathy Awareness Week. But more can be done. For instance, I suggest you peruse the posts in the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?cat=5"&gt;homeopathy category&lt;/a&gt; of this blog. And, don’t forget, there are still six days to go. Here’s hoping we find some more fun to have with homeopaths before next Friday rolls around, after which Steve, Val, John, Kim, and I &lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org/speakers/"&gt;will see some of you at NECSS&lt;/a&gt; the following day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the most positive mainstream pieces I’ve read about the college atheism movement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Twenty years ago a public meeting of atheists and their allies at a large public university — attended by a friendly Methodist pastor, no less — would have been almost unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even five years ago it would have been highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But emboldened, in part, by best-selling books such as “The God Delusion” (2006) by Richard Dawkins and “God is Not Great” (2007) by Christopher Hitchens, young atheists are stepping forward, bonding with their fellow skeptics and reaching out to the religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were at least 195 secular student groups on college campuses in late 2009, up from only 42 in 2003, according to the Secular Student Alliance, a non-profit based in Columbus, Ohio. There are local affiliated groups at NIU in DeKalb, Elmhurst College, the Illinois Institute of Technology, DePaul University and Northwestern University.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the story of how the Northern Illinois University students got together for their first meeting &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Five people showed up for the first meeting of the NIU atheists, held a month later at the campus library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We went to the area and we were all kind of looking at each other [nervously]. Nobody wanted to say, ‘Hey, are you here for the atheist group?’ ” [group founder Katie] Panger recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Finally, someone said it, and we were all like, ‘Yeah! Yeah!’ ”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really amazing how all these college groups are popping up across the country.  The SSA is at the point where we hear from students who &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; there to be a group on campus and they’re surprised when there isn’t one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You can always help us &lt;a href="https://www.secularstudents.org/node/8"&gt;create and support these groups by going here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years, the NSF has been producing a biennial report on American attitudes (and many other statistics) about science called &lt;i&gt;Science and Engineering Indicators&lt;/i&gt;. This year, as they have every year, they got the uncomfortable news that a majority of our compatriots reject human evolution and the Big Bang (that last one might have been partly because of the dumb way the question is phrased). What's different, though, is that for the first time &lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/04/evolution-big-bang-polls-omitted.html"&gt;the NSF has decided to omit the fact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very strange. It is a serious problem in our educational system that so much of the public is vocal in their opposition to a well-established set of ideas — these ought to be relevant data in a survey of national attitudes towards science. Why were they dropped? It isn&amp;#39;t because of an overt whitewash to hide our shame away, it seems — instead, it sounds like it&amp;#39;s an accommodationist&amp;#39;s discomfort with highlighting a conflict between religion and science. At least, that&amp;#39;s how I read the excuses given. John Bruer, a philosopher who led the review team on this section of the report, is open about his reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruer proposed the changes last summer, shortly after NSF sent a draft version of Indicators containing this text to OSTP and  other government agencies. In addition to removing a section  titled "Evolution and the Big Bang," Bruer recommended that the board drop a sentence noting that "&lt;b&gt;the only circumstance in which the U.S. scores below other countries on science knowledge comparisons is when many Americans experience a conflict between accepted scientific knowledge and their religious beliefs (e.g., beliefs about evolution).&lt;/b&gt;" At a May 2009 meeting of the board's Indicators  committee, Bruer said that he "hoped indicators could be developed that were not as value-charged as evolution."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bruer, who was appointed to the 24-member NSB in 2006 and chairs the board's Education and Human Resources Committee, says he first became concerned about the two survey questions as the lead reviewer for the same chapter in the 2008 Indicators. At the time, the board settled for what Bruer calls "a halfway solution": adding a disclaimer that many Americans didn't do well on those questions because the underlying issues brought their value systems in conflict with knowledge. As evidence of that conflict, Bruer notes a 2004 study described in the 2008 Indicators that found 72% of Americans answered correctly when the statement about humans evolving from earlier species was prefaced with the phrase "according to the theory of evolution." The 2008 volume explains that the different percentages of correct answers "reflect factors beyond unfamiliarity with basic elements of science."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
George Bishop, a political scientist at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio who has studied attitudes toward evolution, believes the board's argument is defensible. "&lt;b&gt;Because of biblical traditions in American culture, that question is really a measure of belief, not knowledge,&lt;/b&gt;" he says. In European and other societies, he adds, "it may be more of a measure of knowledge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've emphasized the key phrases in that summary, and actually, I rather agree with them. These are issues in which ignorance isn't the fundamental problem (although, of course, ignorance contributes), but in which American culture has a serious and active obstacle to advancing scientific awareness, the evangelical stupidity of religion. That is something different from what we find in Europe, and it's also something more malevolent and pernicious than an inadequate educational system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me, though, that that isn't a reason to drop it from the survey and pretend it doesn't exist and isn't a problem. Instead, maybe they should promote it to a whole new section of the summary and &lt;b&gt;emphasize&lt;/b&gt; it even more, since they admit that it is an unusual feature of our culture, and one that compels people to give wrong answers on a science survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they could title the section, "The Malign Influence of Religion on American Science Education".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also rather like the answer given by Jon Miller, the fellow who has actually conducted the work of doing the survey in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller believes that removing the entire section was a clumsy attempt to hide a national embarrassment. "Nobody likes our infant death rate," he says by way of comparison, "but it doesn't go away if you quit talking about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly right. But if we do talk about it, we end up asking why it's so bad, and then we make rich people squirm as we point fingers at our deplorable health care system. And in the case of the question about evolution, we make religious people, and especially the  apologists for religion, &lt;i&gt;extremely&lt;/i&gt; uncomfortable, because they have been defending this institution of nonsense that has direct effects on measurable aspects of science literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Bruer has also been caught saying something very stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Science asked Bruer if individuals who did not accept evolution or the big bang to be true could be described as scientifically literate, he said: "There are many biologists and philosophers of science who are highly scientifically literate who question certain aspects of the theory of evolution," adding that such questioning has led to improved understanding of evolutionary theory. When asked if he expected those academics to answer "false" to the statement about humans having evolved from earlier species, Bruer said: "On that particular point, no." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was he thinking? The question on the NSF survey is not asking about details of the mechanisms of evolution, so his objection is weirdly irrelevant. I don't know if he's hiding away any creationist sympathies (that phrasing is exactly what I've heard from many creationists, after all), but it does reveal that he's not thinking at all deeply about the issue. And for a philosopher, shouldn't that be a high crime?&lt;/p&gt;

Dear Reader Jason has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/04/not_the_real_face_of_jesus.php#comment-2415489"&gt;expressed&lt;/a&gt; a need for moral absolutes that is quite common among conservatives. Wrote he,&lt;blockquote&gt;"The bane of atheistic thought based on naturalism is that it cannot account for objective moral absolutes. All that is left is societal ideals and individual preference."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are two tribes, A and B. Tribe A is composed of hunters and warriors; however, within the community itself they are loving and caring to one another. Tribe is B is composed of farmers and gatherers; they are peaceful and loving to one another. Tribe A decides that Tribe B has some things it wants, so it attacks. Tribe B is decimated; men killed, women raped, children either killed or brought in as slaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Tribe A wrong? If they have no remorse, or no feelings of guilt toward the brutality, perhaps it's because they didn't know them and were more concerned about their own needs. What do you do with these types of situations?"&lt;p&gt;My view is that morals are collectively negotiated and enforced constructs. It works fine since mentally healthy people are basically decent by nature and have a strong innate capacity for empathy and solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason rightly points out above that with my approach to morals, it is impossible to judge tribe A's behaviour as essentially evil by any independent universal standard. But I don't see the need for such a universal moral standard. I don't claim the right to judge tribes A and B from any other perspective than that negotiated in my own tribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for his question, "What do you &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; with these types of situations?", it's a separate issue. My reply is "If I have enough resources, I send peace-keeping troops and educators to teach tribe A my own tribe's opinion that we are all brothers".&lt;/p&gt;

Now, given my dim view of homeopathy, in which I view it as nothing more than, well, sympathetic magic, you'd think I wouldn't want people to pay attention to WHAW. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I view homeopathy as nothing more than quackery based on magical thinking that I actually want people to be aware of it, starting with some of the more hilarious bits that homeopaths have published over the last year. Like this bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Look past the details of a wonky discovery by a group of California scientists — that a quantum state is now observable with the human eye — and consider its implications: Time travel may be feasible. Doc Brown would be proud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The strange discovery by quantum physicists at the University of California Santa Barbara means that an object you can see in front of you may exist simultaneously in a parallel universe — a multi-state condition that has scientists theorizing that traveling through time may be much more than just the plaything of science fiction writers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A bit of web search turned up Matt Springer's blog post "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2010/04/the_worst_physics_article_ever.php"&gt;The Worst Physics Article Ever&lt;/a&gt;", which confirmed my reaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Every word in the title is wrong but &amp;quot;physics&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s not freaky, doesn&amp;#39;t prove anything we didn&amp;#39;t already know, and has nothing to do with parallel universes nor does it shed any light [on] the question of their possible existence. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I know complaining about science journalism is a staple around ScienceBlogs, but really this is just astonishing malpractice. This would be an embarrassment in a Star Trek episode.

This offers some hope to solve global overpopulation, though unfortunately the solution involves eradicating poverty and establishing global ecological sustainability, which ain't exactly easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shrinking populations become demographically top-heavy, with few young people to support the elderly. Luckily, health care is so good in e.g. Japan and Scandinavia that old folks are in much better shape than they were two generations ago. Therefore everyone agrees that the age of retirement has to be raised here. Allowing all Swedish 65-y-os to retire is ridiculous. It's like allowing all 50-y-os in 1940 to retire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where should we draw the line? Experience shows that arbitrarily deciding on a certain minimum retirement age forces us to change the rules very few decades. Instead we might look at skill levels. Swedish retirees squander their considerable energies on a range of pointless and demeaning pastimes. I propose that anyone who is physically fit enough to play golf or do square dance, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; intellectually fit enough to perform genealogical research or follow a lecture organised by the local historical society, has not yet reached retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a reform would benefit public finances immensely, and also rescue the dignity of countless Baby Boomers who in their youth very rightly scoffed at any suggestion of square dance. Imagine them being able to look their grandchildren in the eye again! It would heighten national pride no end if we could eradicate genealogical research. And golf!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the deception?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, Constance wanted to bring her lesbian girlfriend to Prom and the school refused to let her come. When an alternative prom was planned, they lied to Constance so she wouldn’t go there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, &lt;a href="http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2010-04-american-humanist-association-joins-green-day-and-lan"&gt;her supporters are putting together an *amazing* prom&lt;/a&gt; that is all-inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Second Chance Prom will be held on May 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in Downtown Tupelo, Mississippi.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is being sponsored and paid for by the American Humanist Association (and philanthropist &lt;strong&gt;Todd Stiefel&lt;/strong&gt;), the band &lt;strong&gt;Green Day&lt;/strong&gt;, former *NSYNC member &lt;strong&gt;Lance Bass&lt;/strong&gt;, celebrity chef &lt;strong&gt;Cat Cora&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.tonic.com/article/lets-throw-constance-mcmillen-the-prom-she-deserves/"&gt;tonic.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Second Chance Prom will feature dinner for guests, live entertainment, a ceremony to honor outstanding youth in Mississippi, booths highlighting organizations striving for LGBT equality and celebrity guests…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve very pleased to be able to support and promote LGBT equality alongside other sponsors,” said Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the American Humanist Association. “We’re proud to be standing on the side of love and acceptance instead of fear and prejudice, and we hope that the event will bring appreciation of the diversity within our society and encourage others to embrace it as a positive value that can continue to forge progress for all Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope this Second Chance Prom will be an opportunity to get beyond recent negativity and provide a celebration that shows the benefits of an inclusive outlook,” said Speckhardt.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No word on whether Green Day and Lance Bass will actually perform at the event but what an incredible show of support from everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s things like this that make me proud to &lt;a href="https://secure.americanhumanist.org/SSLPage.aspx?pid=214"&gt;support the AHA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope Constance gets to have a real party this time and that other students from the school put aside their pride and attend, too.  There’s nothing wrong with an all-inclusive prom and it’s a wonderful way to put a spotlight on those who would foolishly refuse to let a lesbian attend the “official” prom.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div style="width:470px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-10565" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/cryptozoological-caturday-felid-the-beast-of-bodmin-and-its-relatives/bigcat_1591562c/"&gt;&lt;img title="bigcat_1591562c" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bigcat_1591562c.jpg?w=460&amp;amp;h=288" alt="" width="460" height="288"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still of &amp;quot;big cat&amp;quot; in Scotland. See the video below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every country seems to have its cryptozoological fantasies. Tibet has the Yeti, the US has Bigfoot, the Congo has Mokele-mbembe. And Britain has… the Beast of Bodmin. Or the Beast of Exmoor. Or the Beast of Bevendean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases, people sight something that looks like a big cat – as in a panther or a leopard. None of these sightings claim to be of tigers or African lions. Strictly speaking, this is not the realm of cryptozoology, as no one is claiming these are unknown species. The argument is that they are animals that have escaped from zoos, circuses or the homes of rich people with massive underground bunkers who tend to have plans for world domination and go “Mwah-haa-haaa”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/cryptozoological-caturday-felid-the-beast-of-bodmin-and-its-relatives/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/vQYrszfSbUE/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural England – a government organisation that does what it says on the tin – has been studying claims of alien animals in the UK, and has found 38 sightings of “big cats” that cannot be explained. They have concluded that some of the claims might be true, but there is no evidence for breeding populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Wilson of Natural England is reported as saying: “The evidence is there that there are the odd, escaped, released dumped animals occurring in the wild every now and then.” None of this applied to the alleged big cats, for which there was no confirmation beyond exaggerated claims (“it was as big as a car”) or the usual blurry photos. “It is very unlikely that there are any big cats at large” was the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; “newspaper” &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2918837/Official-No-big-cats-in-the-UK.html"&gt;reported this&lt;/a&gt; as “Official: No Big Cats in UK”, and printed this picture with the caption “Big cats are a myth … but if they don’t exist then how does the government explain these?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-10566" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/cryptozoological-caturday-felid-the-beast-of-bodmin-and-its-relatives/bigcats_682_1017707a/"&gt;&lt;img title="BIGCATS_682_1017707a" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bigcats_682_1017707a.jpg?w=477&amp;amp;h=343" alt="" width="477" height="343"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Natural History Museum has &lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/mammals/beast-of-bodmin-moor/"&gt;a neat little web page&lt;/a&gt; explaining how they were called in to examine what appeared to be the skull of a big cat, found on Bodmin Moor in the south of England. Discovering the truth involved not only comparative anatomy but also forensic entomology, and is quite enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-10567" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/cryptozoological-caturday-felid-the-beast-of-bodmin-and-its-relatives/bmp1/"&gt;&lt;img title="bmp1" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bmp1.gif?w=185&amp;amp;h=230" alt="" width="185" height="230"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the not-terribly-interesting possibility that a handful of poor Alien Big Cats (ABCs) may be roaming the British countryside, it’s probably more interesting to ask the question why people are so keen to believe in them…&lt;/p&gt;

This episode is now my highest-rating in terms of downloads, even after one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://tokenskeptic.libsyn.com/rss"&gt;Download episode #16 featuring Taslima Nasrin’s speech from the Global Atheist Convention.&lt;/a&gt; There’s also &lt;a href="http://tokenskeptic.org/2010/04/09/listen-to-token-skeptic-podcast/"&gt; iTunes, mp3 and Zune!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode features one of the most engaging speakers from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/"&gt;The Rise Of Atheism, 2010 Global Atheist Convention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. When I started researching all the presenters that I was going to introduce, I knew that: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a) most people in the audience would have no idea who she was, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;b) they were going to be completely blown away by her story when they did hear her speak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is &lt;a href="http://taslimanasrin.com/"&gt;Taslima Nasrin &lt;/a&gt;that you’re going to hear. From my own perspective, it was incredibly daunting to be on a stage when there were bodyguards surrounding it, because of the threats to her life. You can hear for yourself at the end of this recording, how there was a solid minute and a half of applause for her presentation, called &lt;strong&gt;‘On my Struggle for Secularism, Human Rights, Freedom of Expression and For Women’s Freedom’.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taslima Nasrin is from Bangladesh, was raised as a Muslim and has long been targeted by Muslim extremists. In 1994, she was forced into exile from her native country after mass demonstrations demanded her death for blasphemy and the government charged her with ‘hurting religious feelings’. In 2007, after moving to the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal, Muslim protests forced Taslima out of India. She is able only to visit, and even that seems quite tentative. In an editorial comment on the riots, The Hindu newspaper strongly defended Taslima Nasrin and noted that ‘By violently protesting every instance of publication of her articles, the religious fundamentalists obviously want to force a ban, otherwise legally unsustainable, on her critical and creative works.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://taslimanasrin.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taslima Nasrin’s official site is at: &lt;/strong&gt;http://taslimanasrin.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So, don’t expect my usual updates or essay-length blog-posts, beyond some favorite YouTube videos.&lt;em&gt; I’m meant to be on a break!&lt;/em&gt; Gah…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8610136.stm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Picture-4.png" alt="" width="244" height="127"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But I was intrigued by an interchange on Facebook. In response to this news item, a bit of a discussion got going.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8610136.stm"&gt;Childhood deafness gene uncovered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8610136.stm"&gt; on BBC News:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new genetic fault which may account for some cases of inherited deafness has been revealed by Dutch researchers. It means that parents with the hereditary condition may be able to predict more accurately the chances of passing it on to their children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new find, documented in the American Journal of Human Genetics, could even one day contribute to treatments, say the scientists. One child in 750 is born with severe hearing loss or profound deafness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://newly-nerfed.net/"&gt; Joey Haban&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href="http://newly-nerfed.net/"&gt;http://newly-nerfed.net&lt;/a&gt; wrote in response to Facebook comments about the BBC article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t take issue at all with the fact that most hearing people can’t conceive of life without hearing. Of course it’s a strange, foreign, and frightening notion. My problem is when deaf people who don’t feel that way (which, again is not all of them) are judged from a hearing person’s perspective. Look at it this way: to them, it’s like a black &lt;span&gt;person being offered a pill that will turn them white. “Why don’t you want it? Your life will be so much easier!” Deafness is as much a part of some people’s identity as race is to others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first response to a few people’s comments which were less than complimentary to Deaf culture, was to refer to &lt;a href="http://www.oliversacks.com/books/seeing-voices/"&gt;Oliver Sacks’ Seeing Voices.&lt;/a&gt; It’s a little dated now, dealing with things like the protests at &lt;a href="http://www.gallaudet.edu/"&gt;Gallaudet University&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, but back when it was printed in 1989, I was studying sign language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly studied Auslan (Australian sign language) at TAFE, back when I was starting out as a teacher, because hearing difficulties are found in significant numbers in remote communities in Australia. As an English as a Second Language teacher, I thought it would benefit my teaching to gain a better understanding of the Deaf culture in my country. It was only for two years, part-time, but I really enjoyed it and the challenges it presented. My career has since demonstrated that indeed, you never know where you’re going to end up as an educator!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colleague of mine in Kalgoorlie, learned sign-language directly from the parents of one of her students who was profoundly deaf. We discovered that although there were some signs we had in common, there were some that didn’t match at all, which introduced me to the influence of dialect in signing. There’s a few films (beyond fictional ones like &lt;em&gt;Mr Holland’s Opus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Children of a Lesser God&lt;/em&gt;) that have been up for awards and have been commended for the way they approach Deaf culture – &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/soundandfury/"&gt;‘Sound and Fury’ – Oscar for Documentary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The Australian documentary – &lt;em&gt;‘&lt;a href="http://www.360degreefilms.com.au/welcome-2-my-deaf-world"&gt;Welcome 2 My Deaf World&lt;/a&gt;‘.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So – is there a place for Deaf culture in skepticism? Can we say that Deaf people can’t be skeptics, that there aren’t frauds, scams, concerns about the paranormal and pseudoscience that affect them as well? Or is there a bigger division that is being formed, one that skeptics aren’t addressing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Skeptic Zone presentation at Melbourne University, we had an Auslan signer at the front of the stage during Dr Rachie and Richard’s talks. We’re still working on transcripts of our podcast, being aware that our show may be of interest to those if it wasn’t just in audio form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be interested in learning if it’s like ongoing discussions on “&lt;em&gt;whether the small number of people who identify as skeptically-minded somehow means we naturally tend towards &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2010/03/tam-australia-announcement-leslie-cannold-raises-the-ratio-question-yes-that-again/"&gt;promoting the stereotype of the ‘bearded-white man’&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/atheist-barbie.html"&gt;token ‘hot woman’ by default at conferences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” [my response was &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;oh please, &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;...' to this parody by Blag Hag of &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/atheist-barbie.html"&gt;Atheist Barbie]&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…or even what I see as a far bigger issue of “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://idoubtit.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/tilted/"&gt;can we ever have female representation as skeptics – when women are not represented fairly in society anyway?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” [Post by I Doubt It on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title="Permanent Link to The tilted playing field" rel="bookmark" href="http://idoubtit.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/tilted/"&gt;The tilted playing field]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Are there are other people who have views about how this is another minority group (is it?) within skepticism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pope Benedict XVI has become embroiled in new revelations over child sexual abuse, over a letter he is said to have signed in 1985 before becoming pontiff.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Associated Press said it had obtained the letter, signed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, resisting the defrocking of offending US priest Stephen Kiesle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Cardinal Ratzinger said the "good of the universal Church" needed to be considered in defrocking, AP reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good of the innocent seems to be much, much lower in the church's priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what will happen, though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I predict…absolutely nothing. The church will hunker down and change nothing, the flock will make excuses for the abuses as they&amp;#39;ve always done, and the story will repeat year after year. We just have to hope that the scandals will erode church membership further, and that secular authorities will be quicker to protect the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'll just keep on dreaming of the Pope making a visit to some secular country, getting arrested, and being forced to do a perp walk in front of broadcast cameras. It's not going to happen, but it would be so sweet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/popebusted.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/d2lPyzHonIo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270868959609"><id gr:original-id="http://ultimo167.wordpress.com/articles-on-men/the-bad-male-habit-of-dropping-dead-early/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/080cc7dc80a3b7bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The Bad Male Habit of Dropping Dead Early</title><published>2010-04-09T22:29:58Z</published><updated>2010-04-09T22:29:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/mxDK7486qkI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://ultimo167.wordpress.com/articles-on-men/the-bad-male-habit-of-dropping-dead-early/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Pinkhasov et al.

If you’ve done any first  year university maths subjects, this should make immediate sense to you —  the rest of you, likely, are going to require a bit more convincing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's not often that we get to dive a little deeper into a topic encountered at a recent pizza lunch talk. But we will this month. In March, Geoff Ginsburg from Duke briefed us well on the current science regarding genomic (or personalized) medicine and its promising applications. At noon on Tuesday, April 20, Jim Evans from UNC-Chapel Hill will discuss the complexity of implementing this new medicine with a talk entitled: Personalized Medicine: Too Much Information / Too Little Information. Like Dr. Ginsburg, Dr. Evans is a doctor-scientist. He is also editor of the journal Genetics in Medicine and sits on an advisory committee to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services on genetics, health and society.

&lt;p&gt;American Scientist Pizza Lunch is free and open to science journalists and science communicators of all stripes. Feel free to forward this message to anyone who might want to attend. RSVPs are required (for the slice count) to cclabby@amsci.org&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, we'll be back at our home base, Sigma Xi in Research Triangle Park. You'll find directions here:&lt;br&gt;

That&amp;#39;s kinship altruism - the idea that it makes evolutionary sense to sacrifice yourself to benefit close relatives (who share a lot of your genes). But there&amp;#39;s another side to kinship altruism, as described by two Oxford University biologists, Stuart West and Andy Gardner, in a recent paper in Science.They point out that spiteful behaviour - acting cruelly for no gain to yourself - actually makes sense (in certain circumstances) for the same reason kinship altruism does. If your relatives benefit from your spiteful behaviour (or even if the target of your spite is less related to you than  the average stranger) then then your genes could benefit.In fact, from an evolutionary perspective, spite and kinship altruism are the same thing (they&amp;#39;re both explained in mathematical terms using &amp;#39;Hamilton&amp;#39;s Rule&amp;#39;).Now, West &amp;amp; Gardner don&amp;#39;t mention religion, but this fact has interesting implications. As the anthropologist Lyle Steadman has pointed out, almost all the world&amp;#39;s religions use kinship terms (mother, father, brother, sister) to refer to their co-religionists.The idea is that religion helps to stabilise large societies by subverting our intuitive kinship altruism and extending it to non-relatives. Which is all well and good for co-religionists, but the downside is that people of a different religion then become emphatically non-kin (failing both real and religious kinship criteria).Which might help to explain the spiteful actions that often occur between followers of different gods.West and Gardner also discuss so-called &amp;#39;green beards&amp;#39;. This refers to genes (or gene-complexes) that code for an altruistic trait and also for a signal. Dawkins coined the term to describe the hypothetical case of a gene that simultaneously codes for the green beard itself and also for co-operative behaviour towards fellow green beards.It&amp;#39;s been suggested that just such a linkage could explain the rise of religion - if religious displays are a reliable guide to honest behaviour.However, West &amp;amp; Gardner put the kybosh on that idea. Green beards are unlikely to be relevant to human evolution, because personality traits are complex and not due to genes that could also code for a visible signal:Some models for altruism in humans and social insects implicitly invoke greenbeard mechanisms without realizing this, such as the suggestion that altruistic individuals differ from individuals who are not altruistic in some observable characteristic [such as being more likely to smile and laugh] or models of “strong reciprocity” that assume punishment and altruism to be genetically linked. However, there is no reason to suspect that traits such as smiling or punishment will be encoded by the same gene or closely linked genes as those that lead to altruism. Consequently, falsebeards could arise, and these proposed explanations for altruism would not be evolutionarily stable.And finally... I actually learned about this article from a Christian blogger, who picked up on one sentence about how kinship altruism can lead to a particular kind of social behaviour. He says the authors:... point out that &amp;quot;strict lifetime monogamy, in which females only  mate  with one male in their entire life, is crucial for the   evolution of eusociality.&amp;quot;  This provides a very natural  scientific basis for understanding the critical importance of &amp;quot;thou  shalt not commit adultery&amp;quot;Now, this is very funny when you know that &amp;#39;eusocial&amp;#39; is a very specific term used to describe the kind of society exemplified by honey bees - one dominant queen, with a slavish workforce comprising her sterile daughters. It sounds like adultery is the only way to save us from a bleak future!I don&amp;#39;t think the blogger is actually hoping for a bible-based eusocial future for humans. Most likely he simply doesn&amp;#39;t realise what eusocial means - hard to believe when the paper illustrates it with pictures of termites and sterile worker shrimps!West SA, &amp;amp; Gardner A (2010).

I've been telling you about the Big Bang, the greatest story ever told, and the entire natural history of the Universe.  Let's remind you -- historically -- of how our conception of the Universe changed as we learned more about our surroundings.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/winter_solstice_pivato.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/winter_solstice_pivato-thumb-500x216-44368.jpeg" width="500" height="216" alt="winter_solstice_pivato.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the first astronomical observation ever made was that the Sun rises in the East, passes overhead, and sets in the West.  And it does this day after day, every day.  It's no wonder that our first "cosmological model" of the Universe was that the Earth is stationary, and the Sun orbits around it once every day.  Why not, after all?  That's what we &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; on Earth!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as we started making careful observations of the night sky, we discovered that the motions of planets were inconsistent with that picture.  While the Sun looks like it orbits the Earth, another explanation could be that the Earth is &lt;b&gt;rotating&lt;/b&gt;, and so the Sun would simply &lt;i&gt;appear&lt;/i&gt; to revolve around the Earth.  The better picture that superseded the old one was to put the Sun at the center, and let the Earth be just like any other planet: orbiting the Sun.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/zd6f8yul5e63g1ozmz.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/zd6f8yul5e63g1ozmz-thumb-500x391-44370.jpeg" width="500" height="391" alt="zd6f8yul5e63g1ozmz.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn't long before we realized our Sun wasn't unique, and that nearly all of those points of light in the night sky were &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; Suns, just like our own.  So rather than the Sun being the center of the Universe, it became just another star -- one of &lt;i&gt;billions&lt;/i&gt; -- in our galaxy: the Milky Way.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/milkyway_brunier-large.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/milkyway_brunier-large-thumb-500x333-44372.jpeg" width="500" height="333" alt="milkyway_brunier-large.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And amazingly, we thought that our single galaxy made up the &lt;b&gt;entire Universe&lt;/b&gt; until the 1920s!  (You can read about the discovery that changed everyone's mind &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1929_hubble.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  But now we know that our galaxy is just one of many billions in the entire Universe, which is billions of light years across, expanding, and which started with the big bang just under 14 billion years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our telescopes see farther than ever before, the amount of information we have about space is vastly greater than at any point in history, and you can find some of the most amazing images ever taken simply by using google. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/hudf_ir_full.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/hudf_ir_full-thumb-500x500-44374.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="hudf_ir_full.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But surely the current cosmological model -- the Big Bang -- isn't the final, complete story.  So I thought I'd point out the three greatest problems (in my opinion, anyway) with the current cosmic model of the Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/bigbang.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/bigbang-thumb-500x491-44376.jpeg" width="500" height="491" alt="bigbang.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.) What happened before the Big Bang?&lt;/b&gt;  The big bang wasn't the beginning; something had to have happened to create the Universe we have today with the properties it has.  We have a word describing what must've happened before -- inflation -- but we don't know &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; inflation happened, or even which model of inflation is the right one!  So if we want to understand where our Universe came from, we'll need to answer this question, and inflation -- while brilliant and compelling -- isn't a complete answer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/galaxy-cluster-abell1689-desk-1280.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/galaxy-cluster-abell1689-desk-1280-thumb-500x400-44378.jpeg" width="500" height="400" alt="galaxy-cluster-abell1689-desk-1280.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.) What the hell is most of the matter in the Universe made of?&lt;/b&gt;  When you look out at the Universe, you can measure the amount of &lt;i&gt;mass&lt;/i&gt; out there (thank you, laws of gravity), and you can also measure how much &lt;i&gt;normal matter&lt;/i&gt; is out there (thanks to light).  It turns out that when we add up all the normal stuff out there -- stars, planets, gas, dust, plasma, etc. -- it's only about &lt;b&gt;15%&lt;/b&gt; of the total amount of matter in the Universe that gravity tells us needs to be there!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is this matter, and where is it?  Or, quite possibly, are our laws of gravity fundamentally flawed, and is our understanding of how gravitation works on the largest scales in the Universe simply incomplete?  That's the second great mystery, known as the dark matter problem.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/Universe_fate.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the/Universe_fate-thumb-500x283-44383.jpeg" width="500" height="283" alt="Universe_fate.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.) Why is the Universe's expansion &lt;i&gt;speeding up&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;  You can imagine that if things start off hot, dense, and expanding, that there are three possibilities.  Gravity is going to fight that expansion, and try to pull everything back together.  Maybe gravity wins, and will eventually pull things back together, causing the Universe to recollapse?  Or maybe the expansion wins and gravity loses, and everything flies off into the infinite abyss?  Or maybe we're in this wonderful balance between gravity and the expansion, where the expansion rate will asymptote to zero, but will never quite run away and will never reverse into a recollapsing state.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we actually &lt;i&gt;observe&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;b&gt;none&lt;/b&gt; of these.  It looks -- for the first few billion years of the Universe -- like it's in this perfectly balanced state.  But then all of a sudden, the expansion rate picks up again, and the farthest galaxies from us &lt;b&gt;accelerate&lt;/b&gt; away!  This is known as the dark energy problem, and (while there are many speculative theories at this point) there is &lt;b&gt;no compelling explanation&lt;/b&gt; for this phenomenon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those are the three biggest problems, from my point of view, facing cosmology today.  What will the resolution be?  Right now, nobody knows.  But these are the questions, and now &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; can go think about them, and tell me what &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; think the solutions might be!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/the_greatest_problems_with_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270856634150"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/waving_your_hands_more_vigorou.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a976c94db62283c9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Waving your hands more vigorously is not an answer</title><published>2010-04-09T22:43:20Z</published><updated>2010-04-09T22:43:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/LtS-x4UWQZM/waving_your_hands_more_vigorou.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/waving_your_hands_more_vigorou.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;After tweaking Paul Nelson on his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/happy_monkey_paul_nelson_its_b.php"&gt;six year delay in explaining Ontogenetic Depth&lt;/a&gt;, he has &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/04/ontogenetic_depth_20_the_prequ.html"&gt;posted a reply&lt;/a&gt;. No, it's not the long promised explanation. Instead, here's what he's got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PZ Myers' criticisms don't count and were all wrong!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, well, he now realizes Ontogenetic Depth is a "a poorly expressed and unusable idea." (He's quoting &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; there.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he has invented Ontogenetic Depth 2.0!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he still hasn't defined it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he promises to write a whole series of posts explaining why I was wrong!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jebus. I tend to avoid the ID blogs because I'm not interested in  watching someone masturbate in public. Nelson hasn't persuaded me &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt; that he has anything sensible to contribute. But sure, moving his hands more will accomplish the end he's actually working towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of expert and professional wanking, would you believe &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/04/william_dembski_robert_marks_a.html"&gt;Casey Luskin and Dembski are still obsessing&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/of-weasels-and.html"&gt;Dawkins' old "weasel" program&lt;/a&gt;?

I&amp;#39;m sitting, trying to type while waiting, and it&amp;#39;s just noise, noise, noise, noise — there&amp;#39;s the horrible repetition of &amp;quot;You are approaching the end of the moving walkway&amp;amp;hellip:You are approaching the end of the moving walkway&amp;amp;hellip:You are approaching the end of the moving walkway&amp;amp;hellip:You are approaching the end of…&amp;quot;, the frequent intercom warnings that &amp;quot;The TSA has determined that the current threat level is &lt;i&gt;orange&lt;/i&gt;…&amp;quot;, which means &lt;i&gt;nothing at all&lt;/i&gt;, and worst of all are the televisions located everywhere, blaring out the "news". I've been thoroughly packed full of all the most important news, thanks to CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there's the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was involuntarily subjected to full-on CNN at sampling intervals of approximately an hour and a half, with over an hour of their news coverage at a sitting. There was only one story, one all-important story that soaked up all the air time all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiger Woods is whacking a little ball with a stick again, and he's doing a good job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His score at some tournament was reported repeatedly, and then some self-important sports pundit would come on and seriously tell us what this meant to Woods' self-esteem, and to the psychological state of millions of little-ball-whackers all around the world. I kept hoping at least one of these guys would stop, look incredulously at his fellow panelists, and point out that this soul-crushing inanity is not news, and definitely not worth hours of masturbatory reflection. Jeez, CNN programmers should just look at the front page of the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and plan on spending 50 minutes of every hour covering the important stuff. I&amp;#39;ll allow that they can spend 10 minutes of every hour covering pop culture trivia — golf scores, Lindsey Lohan vulva sightings, the Kardashians, celebrity face lifts, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because right now I'm just going to have to assume the media is packed full of mindless morons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of mindless morons, my &lt;a href="http://reportermag.com/article/04-09-2010/pz-myers-offends-first-reasons-later"&gt;talk at RIT was 'reviewed' by a student named Joe McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt;. I see a bright future for him in American media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember him well. I gave a talk on the conflict between science and religion, and afterwards, he came down and asked me some questions. Well, first he declared firmly that he was a Catholic…which told me right away he wasn&amp;#39;t going to have much intelligent to say. I could give a rat&amp;#39;s pungent patootie for his Catholicism — if he wants to ask a question, nothing is gained by declaiming his ideological position at the outset, and my answer wouldn&amp;#39;t change whether he&amp;#39;s Catholic or Cathar. But yes, I had to get his testimonial first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he asked about the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php"&gt;infamous cracker incident&lt;/a&gt;: Why did I offend Catholics? Didn&amp;#39;t I know the host was sacred? Why did I pick on Catholics and not other believers? It was the usual drivel. I answered him seriously, told him the multiple reasons I had carried out my protest, and asked him if he had read what I had written…he hadn&amp;#39;t. He&amp;#39;d looked me up on Wikipedia, and hadn&amp;#39;t followed a single link to the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me mention…not once in my talk had I even mentioned desecrating crackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read his article, you'll discover that it begins with McLaughlin announcing his Catholic credentials, talks only about the desecration of communion wafers, and despite the fact that I took the time to explain to him personally at some length about the actual motivations for the event, he declares &lt;span&gt;"He just did it to offend Catholics."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He affirms my opinion of most journalists so well. He ought to think about pursuing the profession. Either that, or he can practice moving walkway announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am getting a bit exasperated at the obtuse cracker questions I still get. They're all asking precisely the wrong questions. Here are two hypothetical newspaper headlines; which of them is trivial, and which is High Crazy, needing more explanation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headline A:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size:28px;font-weight:bold;text-align:center"&gt;MAN THROWS BREAD IN TRASH&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:18px"&gt;It's just a cracker, he says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or Headline B?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size:28px;font-weight:bold;text-align:center"&gt;MAN BELIEVES BREAD IS GOD&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:18px"&gt;It's the most precious object in the world, milllions say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are getting worked up about Headline A, which is ridiculously trivial (and that was the point of the exercise), but everyone who interviews me seems to sail obliviously past the weird world of Headline B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, please, please don't ask me about how I dared to abuse a cracker, or about Tiger Woods, for that matter. Neither are important. I'd like to consider the insanity of a world obsessed with trivia and delusions, instead.&lt;/p&gt;

But these four sites are run by people who know what they're talking about. All are former Christians, one is a former minister and another is a former apologist professor. They also post something almost daily.

Today, after church, my 5-year-old son asked me about God, so I answered his questions in full. We talked about God for over 2 hours. At the end of it all, he pondered for a moment, before saying to me “That’s the stupidest thing I ever heard. You’re dumb.” FML
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heh.  Though, before you enjoy that too much, remember: 5-year-olds are fickle and there’s a good chance he’ll just change his mind the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little did I know what type of interest this would generate.  A few weeks after I wrote it, I found that my article was reprinted -- verbatim -- in the &lt;a href="http://www.tampabay.com/"&gt;St. Petersburg Times&lt;/a&gt;, and then was featured in &lt;a href="http://www2.macleans.ca/"&gt;MacLean's&lt;/a&gt;.  And I thought that was going to be it.

&lt;p&gt;And then &lt;a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/usain-bolt-bio-0410"&gt;Esquire Magazine&lt;/a&gt; called.  I'm featured on page 133 and 134 of this month's (April 2010) issue, and you can read the article &lt;a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/usain-bolt-bio-0410"&gt;online here&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nothing prepared me for what I saw on &lt;a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=5070282"&gt;ESPN today&lt;/a&gt;:

Good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Some of us unabashedly and not very artfully seize the smallest opportunity to bring the topic into any conversation. Friend: “I have a new recipe for cookies.” You: “Sylvia Browne looks like she eats lots of cookies. Speaking of which, here is what the evidence says about psychics…” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Some of us find subtler ways. How many of you, like me, keep a copy of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Why People Believe Weird Things&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; in plain sight in hopes of prompting questions?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Once we get a conversation started, we trot out evidence, debunk, and recommend websites, books, magazines and podcasts. We hope that at least some of the people we thus regale will embrace skepticism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;There’s a word for that kind of activity. “Selling.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; 

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Sure, you can call it something else. “Presenting,” “sharing,” “enthusing,” “helping,” whatever, but let’s be honest. When we rave about skepticism, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;selling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;is exactly what we’re trying to do. And we hope that what our listener is doing is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;buying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;There’s nothing wrong with that. To paraphrase what early American patriot Patrick Henry probably never said: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;If this be selling, then make the most of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;In that spirit, here’s a tip to make selling-presenting-sharing-helping-enthusing-whatever go over a little better: People buy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;benefits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; more than they buy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; is an attribute. Like: “This pole is 11 feet long.” A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;benefit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; is what the feature does for you. Like: “Keeps you safe from cooties.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;You can identify a benefit by following the feature with the words “so that.” Say you want to sell parents on child immunizations. The feature by itself, “serum delivered by means of sticking a needle in your child’s arm,” is hardly compelling. But by adding “so that,” you might end up with, “…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;so that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;your child can escape pain and possible death from a horrible disease.” I don’t know about you, but I find that a bit more persuasive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;You might think that benefits are implicit and that people don’t need you to connect dots. Tests show that you would be mistaken. Pointing out benefits increases sales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;That’s important to remember when we talk about skepticism — because the likes of evidence, logical fallacies, the scientific method, what has been debunked, what has been proved, the Million Dollar Challenge, and so on, though exciting to us, are all &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;. Listing them without drawing dots to the benefits they represent risks missing an opportunity to help people understand skepticism in terms of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;what’s in it for them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;This may be tough for some skeptics to fathom. To many of us, skepticism’s benefits appear self-evident. One obvious benefit, for instance, might be knowledge for its own sake. As Michael Shermer wrote, “I’m a skeptic not because I do not want to believe but because I want to know.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Another obvious though less talked-about benefit is what I refer to as the “neener-neener” factor: Some of us love lobbing disruptive contradictions into a conversation, confounding the unsuspecting, looking smug, and later bragging to our skeptical friends. I’m not going to call it laudable or effective. But let’s concede that it tempts a lot of us, a lot of the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;The prospect of broadened horizons or the allure of the neener-neener factor may be all you need to attract some people to skepticism. Often, however, you will be presenting skepticism to someone who doesn’t love knowledge for its own sake and has no interest in showing off. In that case, the first step to coming up with a relevant benefit will be to figure out what matters to the person in front of you. This requires recognizing that what intrigues &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; about skepticism may &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; intrigue him or her. You’re going to need some empathy, along with the discipline to listen — to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;hear &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;— before launching into the admittedly more tempting activity of lecturing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Such discovery can be fruitful. When a friend recently asked about skepticism, I drew a breath to indulge my woo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;peeve du jour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; when, at the last minute, it occurred to me to ask what prompted his question. He was thinking about investing big in a scheme represented to him as inspired by a deity. Setting aside my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;peeve du jour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;, I joined him for a look at the scheme’s features. Namely: No supporting, yet ample refuting, evidence. But again, features have limited power, especially in the face of a hoped-for benefit like quick riches. So, next, we looked at the benefits of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; investing. These included avoiding the overwhelming likelihood of an unsustainable loss, of having to feel stupid and — the real clincher — of having to explain to his wife why 30 years of savings had suddenly vanished. These benefits dramatized for him the flimsiness of the quick-riches hope. He declined the scheme, later saw it fail from a safe distance, and emerged not a full-fledged skeptic, but with greater appreciation for critical thinking. It was a step. One that I’d have utterly blown had I not bothered to find out what mattered to him instead of to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;While failing to point out benefits can mean a missed opportunity, so can failing to recognize how skepticism threatens benefits that people have already “bought.” Suppose you’re talking with astrology buffs. To them, astrology offers benefits like knowledge of the future, purpose, entertainment, hope, pick-up lines for singles bars, and more. Trot out all the real astronomy and empirical tests you want, and see how far you get. From the buff’s perspective, all you’re offering to do is remove their fun and leave nothing in its place. Good intentions aside, that’s not a smart way to go about selling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Let’s see if we can come up with some benefits of skepticism for astrology buffs (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;so that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; you’ll have a better chance of making inroads). We might tell them, “You can trade alleged knowledge of the future for real data, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;so that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; you increase your odds of sound decisions. You can quit waiting for the stars and planets to guide you, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;so that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; you’re free to take action and seek your own purpose. There’s “Mythbusters,” “Penn &amp;amp; Teller’s Bullshit,” BadAstronomy.com, TAM, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Quirkology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;, etc., etc., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;so that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; you can enjoy plenty of entertainment. And, as for hope, there is no better resource than critical thinking. It gives you tools &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;so that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; you can truly have ‘…the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;(I shall remain silent on the subject of pick-up lines for singles bars. I never was very good at that sort of thing. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that I don’t imbibe and I never was an adept flirt.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Let me not be guilty of overselling benefits as a tool of persuasion. I am not suggesting that infusing your pitch with benefits will compel millions of zealots to beat their zodiacs into astronomy textbooks. Most proven selling techniques, including this one, work no such miracle. When you hear marketers talk about “techniques that work,” they could equally say, “techniques that fail less often.” It’s not unusual for a direct marketer to celebrate when an offer jumps from earning a 0.25 percent to a 0.50 percent response — even though that’s the same as going from not selling to 99.75 percent of the market to not selling to 99.50 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Why do they celebrate such a small gain? Because when the gross numbers are big enough, incremental increases add up. So it is with “selling” skepticism. By presenting skepticism’s features with meaningful benefits, we increase our chances of getting through. And with enough of us out there speaking up, even an incremental increase can make a significant difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Scholarship donations are kept confidential. &lt;strong&gt;Donations are&lt;span&gt; tax-deductible&lt;/span&gt;! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you'd like to be considered for a scholarship, please send an e-mail to Paul at &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/mailto:forumgrants@randi.org?subject=Question%20from%20randi.org"&gt;this e-mail address&lt;/a&gt;. He will give you all the information you need.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions and Answers: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;CAN I APPLY?&lt;br&gt; Yes, applications are open to all. You can apply by sending an e-mail with your request to our coordinator, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/mailto:forumgrants@randi.org?subject=Question%20from%20randi.org"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;WHO SHOULD APPLY?&lt;br&gt; Anyone who will be unable to attend TAM8 without financial assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;HOW IS THE MONEY SPLIT UP?&lt;br&gt; Every time we raise enough money to pay for a TAM8 registration, an award is given on a first come, first served basis. Any money left over will be applied to next year's scholarship. If for any reason money is unable to be awarded, it will become a donation to the JREF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;IS THIS A CONTEST?&lt;br&gt; No. You will not be asked to submit an essay or any financial records. We trust that if you apply, you are someone who honestly needs the money or would otherwise be unable to attend TAM8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;HOW DO WE KNOW THE MONEY IS GOING TO SCHOLARSHIPS?&lt;br&gt; We wish to preserve the privacy of those who apply and those who donate, so we can't offer any form of proof that a scholarship was awarded. If you trust the JREF, rest assured that the money is going to people who need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;WHO STARTED THE FORUM GRANTS?&lt;br&gt; This scholarship is the result of a grassroots effort by several caring members of the JREF community who didn't want money to be a barrier to those who are passionate about the mission of the JREF. It is rather informal, but has worked well in years past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;WHERE CAN I FIND THE ANSWER TO SPECIFIC QUESTION?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Please e-mail our coordinator, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/mailto:forumgrants@randi.org?subject=Question%20from%20randi.org"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Open-source interfaces might sound like something made in a Taiwanese sweat shop, but these actually come from husband-and-wife team Brian Crabtree and Kelli Cain. The couple sources and assembles the devices from their home in upstate New York, using as many local materials and suppliers as possible. Plus, the thing just looks really cool. Its backlit keypads illuminate according to what you’re programming on your computer or instruments. (They’re popular with musicians, and you can see Brian using Monome with his keyboard, below.) Okay, we’ll admit that we don’t &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; understand everything Monome does, but this gadget is beautiful, and it’s made from mostly recyclable materials. All you tech and music mavens: Delight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it may be a little funny (and even adorable) to hear your toddler saying a bad word. However, the initial laughs will quiet down once your kid begins to tell others the swear word she learned from mommy. At that point, you’ll feel like the lousiest parent on earth. So how do you prevent or stop your kids from cursing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch Your (Potty) Mouth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be asking a lot, but avoid using foul language in front of your children as much as possible. Youngsters absorb new words like a sponge – especially ones spoken with a lot of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid the Wrong Crowd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an article on &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89127830"&gt;NPR.org&lt;/a&gt;, Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker explains why you should monitor who your kids hang out with on a daily basis. Says Pinker: “Children are far more influenced by peers. That’s why kids of immigrants end up with the accent of their peer group rather than their parents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Freak Out!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you blow a gasket when your kid drops the F-bomb, you may be making the problem worse. Your child will soon figure out that using expletives is a sure-fire way to get attention. In fact, an &lt;a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/7402128/"&gt;MSNBC article&lt;/a&gt; suggests that ignoring their little potty mouths is often the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shamelessly Bribe Them&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than getting angry and washing their mouths out with soap as punishment, try the opposite approach. Be proactive and reward your child for going a period of time without swearing. You’ll be surprised how far a child will go to get their hands on that latest and greatest toy.&lt;/p&gt;

These stars came up with some sparkling monikers for their mini constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:206px"&gt;&lt;img title="wenn2798507" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/wenn2798507-196x300.jpg" alt="Willow and Jaden Smith" width="196" height="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willow and Jaden Smith (Image: WENN)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willow and Jaden&lt;/strong&gt; – Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith’s kids&lt;br&gt;
Their daughter’s name relates to daddy, and their son’s to mom. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tallulah&lt;/strong&gt; – Demi Moore and Bruce Willis’ daughter&lt;br&gt;
Scout and Rumer might be hip, but Tallulah takes the cake. Too bad she changed her name to Lula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ripley and Nico&lt;/strong&gt; – Thandie Newton’s daughters&lt;br&gt;
Thandie’s daughters were named after the character Ellen Ripley in the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; films, and Nico, the Velvet Underground singer and Warhol Superstar, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satchel &lt;/strong&gt;– Spike Lee’s son&lt;br&gt;
A tribute to baseball history! Spike Lee might be obnoxious at times, but he got this one right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddox&lt;/strong&gt; – Brangelina’s son&lt;br&gt;
Brad and Angelina’s kids all have pretty names (as well as pretty parents), but Maddox is the front-runner for the #1 spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iris &lt;/strong&gt;– Daughter of Jude Law and Sadie Frost&lt;br&gt;
This flowery name hasn’t been on the scene for a while, but a mom named Sadie and a dad named Jude can make anything cool again.&lt;/p&gt;

Probably all of us have asked our self from time to time if our thoughts, feelings, or behavior at any single moment is &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;. Actually, there are different answers for each one of these.

Normal behavior is, like it or not, defined by our legal, community (family, neighborhood, social group) and religious institutions. The law is enforced by our local police, and sanctioned by our courts. Religious values might be said to be collectively defined by our church going population and it&amp;#39;s leadership. If we are observed behaving outside of legal boundaries, we may find ourselves in a court room facing a judge. If we stretch our community or religious values, we might be ostracized, and separated from the kind of support we have been reliant on through our life. 

Our internal life, our thoughts and feelings, that which goes on within ourselves may be our last real privacy. And that is indeed fortunate. Our internal creativity is uncomfortably broad. We are capable of thinking and feeling most anything from time to time. Under provocation, we are capable of thinking about things we would never do. Angry enough, we may think of assault, even murder. Seeing a pretty woman, a married man might think about cheating on his wife, but never act on that thought. Shocked about a death in the family, our first thoughts may be directed at the inconvenience of disrupting out usual routine and our feelings might be closer to annoyed. Our thoughts and our feelings often contradict each other. In a real sense, we live a dual existence. 

Duality

Our body speaks to us through our feelings. Messages are typically fast, automatic, effortless, associative, not available to reflection, and often emotionally charged. Messages are also governed by habit and are therefore difficult to control or modify without time and significant effort. Curiously, since the messages do not require conscious awareness, they do not cause or suffer much interference when combined with other tasks. 

Our thoughts, however, are relatively slower, serial, effortful, more likely to be consciously monitored and deliberately controlled. Compared to feelings, thoughts are relatively flexible and thus change readily and can be directed by conscious or habitual rules. Because thoughts are effortful, they tend to disrupt each other. Thus monitoring mental operations for quality interferes with monitoring overt behavior. People who are occupied by a demanding mental activity are more likely to respond to another task by blurting out whatever comes to mind. 

Intuitive judgments combine the function of feelings and thoughts. The perceptual system and intuitive about perceptions generate impressions of the attributes of objects. These impressions are neither voluntary nor verbally explicit. Judgments are always intentional and explicit even when they are not overtly expressed. Thus, thinking is involved in all judgments and can be reflected upon, whether they originate in impressions or in deliberate reasoning. Monitoring of intuitive judgments is normally quite lax and allows many to be expressed, including some that are erroneous (Kahneman, 2003).

We perceive reality by these two interactive, parallel processing systems. 

The rational system , a relative newcomer on the evolutionary scene, is a deliberative, verbally mediated, primarily conscious analytical system that functions by a person&amp;#39;s understanding of conventionally established rules of logic and evidence. The experiential system, which is considered to be shared by all higher order organisms (although more complex in humans), has a much longer evolutionary history, operates in an automatic, holistic, associationistic manner, is intimately associated with the experience of affect, represents events in the form of concrete exemplars and schemas inductively derived from emotionally significant past experiences, and is able to generalize and to construct relatively complex models for organizing experience and directing behavior by the use of prototypes, metaphors, scripts, and narratives. Although the experimental system is generally adaptive in natural situations, it is often maladaptive in unnatural situations that cannot be solved on the basis of generalizations from past experience but require logical analysis and an understanding of abstract relations.

[B]ehavior is guided by the joint operation of the two systems, with their relative influence being determined by the nature of the situation and the degree of emotional involvement. Certain situations (e.g., solving mathematical problems) are readily identified as requiring analytical processing, whereas others (e.g., interpersonal behaviors) are more likely to be responded to in an automatic, experientially determined manner. Holding such situational features constant, the greater the emotional involvement, the greater the shift in the balance of influence from the rational to the experiential system (Denes-Raj &amp;amp; Epstein, 1994). 

One might ask, why are there two systems? Many of us have at times wished that our emotions could quiet themselves or even go away. Our culture has a bias towards logic and is suspicious of our emotional side. To quote Ayn Rand:

A philosophic system is an integrated view of existence. As a human being, you have no choice about the fact that you need a philosophy. Your only choice is whether you define your philosophy by a conscious, rational, disciplined process of thought and scrupulously logical deliberation - or let your subconscious accumulate a junk heap of unwarranted conclusions, false generalizations, undefined contradictions, undigested slogans, unidentified wishes, doubts and fears, thrown together by chance, but integrated by your subconscious into a kind of mongrel philosophy and fused into a single, solid weight: self-doubt, like a bail and chain in the place where your mind&amp;#39;s wings should have grown...

Not matter how much we wish we could be logical and rational, there is a burgeoning literature that says otherwise. Our decisions are evident in our brain activity long before we are consciously aware (For example, see Libet et al., 1983 and Dennett, 2003). We have a dual system of decision making because it works. Think about it. How often to we make decisions where we have all the information we need to be absolutely sure that our logical deduction is correct? I would venture to say that being sure is limited to only our most simple and concrete decisions. Most every other decision involves weighing facts, impressions, intuitions, and feelings and making as best a decision as possible.

Phineas Gage is perhaps the most famous neurology patient of all time. After a gruesome injury in which he was impaled through his skull by a metal rod and then miraculously recovered, poor Phineas retained all the logic he ever had, but was completely unable to make a decision. He was also left without any awareness or expression of emotion (Demasio, 1994). The very act of making a decision is an emotional process. We choose our decisions among competing alternatives based not only the evidence, but what feels best to us, our &amp;quot;gut level&amp;quot; reaction. 

The story behind this dual system is most evident in normal social development. 

The Attachment Relationship

John Bowlby (1969/1982) is credited as the founder of Attachment Theory, based on his observations that the quality of a child&amp;#39;s social development was largely determined by the quality of the child&amp;#39;s relationship with her caregiver. Mary Ainsworth and Mary Main began the research that would ultimately follow children over their first 20 years of development demonstrating Bowlby&amp;#39;s concepts to be true and elaborating that theory to account for how, as a child and adult, how freely and effectively she can think, feel, remember, and act (Ainsworth et al., 1978, Main et al., 1985 &amp;amp; Fonagy et al., 2002). Fonagy went on to find that a pa...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This link was sent in by Jerry – even on his Paris jaunt, he’s keeping a close eye on debates over evolution and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at Evolutionblog, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2010/04/is_id_blasphemous.php"&gt;Jason Rosenhouse reports&lt;/a&gt; that Peter Hess, Faith Project Director for the National Center for Science Education, has decided that ID is blasphemous. Jason’s thought-provoking piece provides a nice parallel with &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/a-c-grayling-on-david-lewis-williams-and-the-evolution-of-religion/"&gt;the Grayling review we posted here earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/us-national-science-board-tries-to-suppress-knowledge-of-americans-scientific-illiteracy/"&gt;Greg’s previous post on the National Science Board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But Jack and Crystal Buckner’s daughters are in the middle of a uniquely controversial case in northern Texas. &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125670601&amp;amp;ps=cprs"&gt;NPR reports&lt;/a&gt; that when the couple’s eight-year-old started having behavioral problems, she went to a therapist, and eventually told the therapist that her Dad had been showing both of his daughters adult porn on the computer – and Daddy told the girls it was to teach them about sex. The therapist called Family and Protective Services (we’d do the same), but Texas law isn’t so straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the Texas penal code makes it possible to prosecute anyone who sells or shows harmful material to a minor (and defines pornography as harmful), it doesn’t apply when children are accompanied by parents or legal guardians. Texas District Attorney James Farren would like to prosecute the girls’ father, but he has to work around the law and prosecute Buckner for “child endangerment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the therapist and the D.A. feel strongly that the law should intervene, others consider this a murkier case. It involves parental rights, and judging the way parents choose to educate their children about sex. What do you think? Take our poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.scienceandreligiontoday.com/2010/04/08/does-christianity-contribute-to-racism/"&gt;gist of the experiment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They subliminally primed one group of students with neutral words like “butter” and “hammer” and another group of students with Christian words like “gospel” and “heaven,” each of which flashed on a computer screen for half a second while the students were performing a task. Then the researchers tested the students attitudes toward blacks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Christian-primed group had an increased level of racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kate&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.chron.com/believeitornot/2010/04/a_baylor_university_study_link_1.html"&gt;summarizes the conclusions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Researchers offer some possible explanations for why these Christian terms have such negative effects. They can cue fundamentalism or political conservatism, which can isolate “out-groups,” or echo the notion of the Protestant work ethic, which has been connected with anti-Black attitudes, the study said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does it do that?  The researchers don’t know.  They admit (as I do) that this doesn’t mean all (or most or even a large minority of) Christians are racist.  Obviously, some of our greatest civil rights leaders were in part motivated by their faith.  To me, the study just suggests that Christian thinking can lead to an us vs. them mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If their research is accurate, I imagine the same results would be found of Christian-primed attitudes toward gays, lesbians, atheists, people of other religions, Democrats, and pro-choicers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one commenter &lt;a href="http://blogs.chron.com/believeitornot/2010/04/a_baylor_university_study_link_1.html"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Absolutely shocking! I can understand Christianity… being associated with war, genocide, torture, corruption, and greed. But racism? Shocking!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it dismissed Biblical creationism as a myth. So he took his case to the school board and complained, asking that the book be banned. Their response was actually very cool: they said no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One reviewer’s first impression of creationism’s definition was similar to Zimmermann’s in that “the authors must be offensively biased against this Christian view of the world,” the reviewer wrote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Upon further investigation, however, I quickly realized there is more than one definition of the word ‘myth.’ In this case the word is used appropriately to describe a traditional or legendary story … with or without a natural explanation,&amp;quot; the [school board] reviewer wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the use of the phrase &amp;quot;offensively biased&amp;quot;, indicating to me that the reviewer him or herself may be sympathetic to creationist claims. But they still came to the correct conclusion: the word &lt;em&gt;myth&lt;/em&gt; just means an explanatory story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad the board dismissed Mr. Zimmerman’s claims, and I’ll take whatever victory I can when it comes to stopping the forces of antireality. But still, it makes me flinch somewhat to hear this. Sure, we can’t teach creationism in public school because it would be a clear violation of the First Amendment. But I can hope that in the future, everyone will know that we won’t teach creationism &lt;em&gt;because it’s wrong&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Even with years under their belt, an older person may get overlooked in favor of a younger candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="writer-desk_feat" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/writer-desk_feat-300x126.jpg" alt="Working woman" width="300" height="126"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An employer may think that an older job-seeker doesn’t know the latest computer skills, social media techniques, and other technologies. Or he may just think that it’s easier to train a younger, cheaper employee instead of trying to teach an old dog new tricks. In order to put yourself ahead of the younger crowd, follow these simple tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Date Yourself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There’s no reason to age yourself by listing the year that you graduated college – just list the university and your degree are fine. Rather than a chronological resume, create a functional one that emphasizes your skills, attributes, and accolades rather than dates of employment. This is also helpful if you have gaps in your work history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare Yourself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Do your research about the company for which you’re applying. Learn about their products and services before heading to the interview. You’ll impress the hiring manager with your knowledge and ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Yourself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t expect to get the job just because you’ve racked up years of experience. Have a list of talking points (in your head) about what you can offer the company. Be confident without being cocky; and show your enthusiasm for the opportunity. Present yourself as professional, open to new ideas, technically current, flexible and coachable.&lt;/p&gt;

I have to say, I think this is the best episode of Point of Inquiry that I've hosted yet. But judge for yourself; here's the write up:
For two decades now, we’ve failed to seriously address climate change. So the planet just keeps warming—and it could get very bad. Picture major droughts, calving of gigantic ice sheets, increasingly dramatic sea level rise, and much more.
Against this backdrop, the idea of a technological fix to solve the problem—like seeding the stratosphere with reflective sulfur particles, so as to reduce sunlight—starts to sound pretty attractive. Interest in so-called “geoengineering” is growing, and so is media attention to the idea. There are even conspiracy theorists who think a secret government plan to geoengineer the planet is already afoot.
Leading scientists, meanwhile, have begun to seriously study our geoengineering options—not necessarily because they want to, but because they fear there may be no other choice.
This week’s Point of Inquiry guest, Eli Kintisch, has followed these scientists’ endeavors—and their ethical quandaries—like perhaps no other journalist. He has broken stories about Bill Gates’ funding of geoengineering research, DARPA’s exploration of the idea, and ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F04%2F09%2Fnew-point-of-inquiry-eli-kintisch-is-planet-hacking-inevitable%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270833589368"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=13790">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c811b353ef20448f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><category term="Idunn Mons"/><category term="Imdr"/><category term="Venus"/><category term="Venus Express"/><category term="VIRTIS"/><category term="volcano"/><title type="html">I’m your Venus, I’m your fire</title><published>2010-04-09T17:17:39Z</published><updated>2010-04-09T17:17:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/SPw8gHd8CLM/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/09/im-your-venus-im-your-fire/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goddess on the mountain top&lt;br&gt;

   –Shocking Blue/Bananarama&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Venus dead? Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a way cool picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/figures/PIA13001_fig1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/idunnmons_venus.jpg" alt="idunnmons_venus" title="idunnmons_venus" width="610" height="343"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click to &lt;em&gt;hugely&lt;/em&gt; embiggen.] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s &lt;a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA13001"&gt;Idunn Mons&lt;/a&gt;, a mountain on Venus as radar mapped a few years back by the Magellan space probe. The color overlay is a brand spanking new thermal (temperature) map using an infrared detector on the European Venus Express probe, currently orbiting our sister planet. Red is warmer, and as you can see, Idunn appears to be trying to tell us something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s it saying? OK, here’s the back story:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you needed to write a compare-and-contrast essay about Earth and another planet, you could hardly pick a better one than Venus. It’s a lot like the Earth: it has almost the same diameter (12,100 km versus Earth’s 12,740), it possesses about the same mass (5 versus 6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kilos), it orbits the Sun a bit closer in than we do (109 million km versus 147). The total carbon content of the planet is similar to ours, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also a lot different. While ours is locked up in the oceans and rocks, Venus has all of its  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in its atmosphere, which has caused a runaway greenhouse effect. The pressure at the surface is 90 times ours, and the surface temperature is 460° C (almost &lt;strong&gt;900° F&lt;/strong&gt;). It’s an alien planet, in every sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also thought it was dead, geologically speaking. Despite showing mountains and other interesting features, maps of Venus indicate that the surface hasn’t appeared to change much over geologic times. We have a pretty good grasp of how its atmosphere works, and the weathering processes it subjects the surface to — which is not be to be trifled with, since the air there is laced with sulfuric acid and a hint of fluorine and chlorine compounds, too. According to all that, the surface looks to have been pretty stable for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that idea might be changing. &lt;a href="http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-11/129_read-23529%22"&gt;New studies indicate&lt;/a&gt; Venus may have been volcanically active in the recent past, and may indeed &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; be active! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere of Venus is opaque to our eyes (and highly reflective, which is why Venus looks so bright to us from Earth), but the VIRTIS instrument — which stands for the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer — on Venus Express was specifically designed to peer through the muck and look at the planet’s surface. It can see temperature differences on the ground there, and when scientists studied the maps, they found several spots where the surface appears to be slightly warmer than you’d expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; interestingly, at least some of these spots on Venus are also associated with raised features (0.5 to 2.5 km (.3 to 1.8 miles)) above the average surface height — mountains, or, perhaps, volcanoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image at the top of this post shows one such area, which is clearly a mountain of some kind in the Imdr Regio area of Venus. The surface on the top of the mountain is a few degrees warmer than the area around it, suggesting the existence of a hot spot under the surface. It’s very hard to look at that and not think it’s a volcano with a magma chamber under it. The data also indicate flow features that are much less weathered than expected, and therefore most likely very young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How young is young? According to the team of scientists who took this data, this indicates that Venus was geologically active no more than 2.5 million years ago, and these features may have formed as little as 250,000 years ago! That’s very young indeed when talking about the geologic clock of a planet — that’s more recent than the last Yellowstone eruption in the American northwest, for example. And the fact that the hot spots are still around is a strong indicator that activity is still present on Venus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the planets in the solar system, Venus gets closest to Earth — it can be as little as about 40 million km (24 million miles) away, compared to Mars which can only get as close as 55 million km (33 million miles). Yet we know less about Venus than Mars. There are many reasons: Venus never strays far from the Sun in the sky, making it more difficult to observe than Mars, and as mentioned above its atmosphere is opaque. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s very much worthy of our study. Why did Venus suffer such a catastrophic runaway greenhouse effect? Why is its surface apparently pretty much all one age (except for this new result)? Why are there hot spots, and are they like ours here on Earth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying the Earth is obviously an incredibly and critically important job for science. And as much as we learn studying it, &lt;em&gt;we need other examples of planets to help us test our ideas&lt;/em&gt;. When I was a kid in middle school, I hated having to write those compare-and-contrast essays. But as a scientist — and as a human living in a thin habitable bubble on a planet we have barely begun to understand — I know we need them desperately.&lt;/p&gt;

I love simple physical activity interventions.  We all know that physical activity is a good thing, and yet it can be really difficult for people to increase their physical activity levels, especially over the long-term.  So it&amp;#39;s exciting whenever any intervention is shown to be effective, but even more so when it is simple.  And an intervention that is both simple and inexpensive is pure gold.  I wrote about one such intervention a few weeks ago, when I described a British study that showed that simply painting lines on a school-yard playground resulted in a dramatic increase in physical activity levels during recess.  The intervention was simple, it was inexpensive and extremely easy to implement, and yet it had an impressive positive impact.  What more could you ask for?

Earlier this week I came across a similarly simple intervention published in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health, this time focused on adults.  In this new study, Megan Grimstvedt and colleagues placed signs near the elevators of 4 university buildings in San Antonio.  The sign said simply &amp;quot;Walking up stairs burns almost 5 times as many calories as riding an elevator&amp;quot; and included an arrow directing people to the nearest staircase, as well as a cartoon of the school mascot walking up a flight of stairs.  Two of the buildings had very visible staircases, while two of the buildings had staircases that were relatively hidden.  The buildings with hidden staircases had an additional sign on the staircase door to tell people that the stairs were accessible (e.g. no fire alarm would sound). The researchers then positioned themselves in &amp;quot;inconspicuous&amp;quot; locations for 2 hours per day, Monday-Thursday, and tallied the number of people using the staircase and elevator.

V.S. Ramachandran famously wrote that they will &amp;#39;do for psychology what DNA did for biology&amp;#39;. Although recordings from single cells in the brains of monkeys have identified &amp;#39;mirror&amp;#39; neurons that respond both to the execution of a movement and the observation of another agent performing that same movement, the existence of such cells in humans has, up until now, been inferred only from indirect evidence, particularly brain imaging. Now, for the first time, Roy Mukamel and colleagues have provided direct evidence, using implanted electrode recordings of single cells, for the existence of mirror neurons in humans.Mukamel&amp;#39;s team seized the opportunity for single cell recording provided by the clinical investigations that were being carried out on patients with intractable epilepsy. These patients had electrodes implanted into their brains to identify the loci of their seizures. Mukamel and his colleagues recruited 21 of these patients and had them look at videos of hand gestures or facial expressions on a laptop in one condition, and perform those same gestures and expressions in another condition.Most of the 1177 cells that were recorded showed a response either to the execution of an action or the sight of that action, not both. However, there was a significant subset of &amp;#39;mirror&amp;#39; neurons in the front of the brain, including the supplementary motor area, and in the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, that responded to the sight and execution of the very same actions.Critics could argue that rather than having mirror properties, these cells were responding to a concept. For example, according to this argument, a cell that responded to the sight of a smile and the execution of a smile, was actually being activated by the smile concept. Mukamel&amp;#39;s group reject that argument. They had a control condition in which the words for actions appeared on a screen, rather than those actions being seen or performed. The postulated mirror neurons responded to the sight and execution of an action, but not the word.Another potential criticism is that the execution-related activity of a postulated mirror neuron is triggered by the sight of one&amp;#39;s own action, rather than by motor-output per se. However, this can&amp;#39;t explain the mirror neurons that responded both to the sight of a given facial expression and one&amp;#39;s own execution of that facial expression (although proprioceptive feedback could still be a potential confound). Mirror neurons make functional sense in relation to empathy and imitative learning, but a drawback could be unwanted imitation and confusion regarding ownership over actions. The researchers uncovered another subset of cells that could help reduce these risks - these cells were activated by the execution of a given movement but inhibited by the sight of someone else performing that same movement (or vice versa). &amp;#39;Taken together,&amp;#39; the researchers concluded, &amp;#39;these findings suggest the existence of multiple systems in the brain endowed with neural mirroring mechanisms for flexible integration and differentiation of the perceptual and motor aspects of actions performed by self and others.&amp;#39; _________________________________Roy Mukamel, Arne D Ekstrom, Jonas Kaplan, Maraco Iacoboni, &amp;amp; Itzhak Fried (2010).

If you don’t have the time to read through all of the more than 200 comments, I’ve plucked a few gems out for special recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, three more ICP-related thoughts before I stop talking about them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Did you know ICP is an evangelical (Christian?) group&lt;/strong&gt; that tried to trick juggalos into believing in their god? It’s true! This past December, &lt;a href="http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20091204/ENTERTAINMENT01/91201031/Insane-Clown-Posse-gets-topical-on-latest-CD"&gt;Violent J gave an interview&lt;/a&gt; in which he laid it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With “The Unveiling,” the 17th and final song on “The Wraith,” the group seemingly had closed the book on that saga, saying that the story had been about following God and the hope that the group’s fans (affectionately known as “juggalos” and “jugalettes”) would find God as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Violent J:] “You have to interest them, gain their trust, talk to them and show you’re one of them. You’re a person from the street and speak of your experiences. Then at the end you can tell them God has helped me out like this and it might transfer over instead of just come straight out and just speak straight out of religion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t believe it, go read &lt;em&gt;The Unveiling&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Thy-Unveiling-lyrics-ICP-Insane-Clown-Posse/4B9BFF93E07AF51448256C690009ACF8"&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; and marvel. Also: equal rights for the &lt;a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/12w33d/petition.html"&gt;juggalo religion petition&lt;/a&gt; [ED: I can't believe I originally posted this without the link to that petition. Read it. Hilariously religious.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Did you know that the juggalo who was raging in the comments made a sock puppet account to support his assertion that he isn’t pathetic? &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/fuckin-magnets-how-do-they-work/#comment-99757"&gt;It’s true&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Did you know ICP was a plot device in a recent Aqua Teen Hunger Force? &lt;a href="http://videogum.com/165511/juggalo-teen-hunger-force/music-related-content/"&gt;Here’s the video&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. On to the COTW(s)!&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, you can nominate comments by logging in, clicking the arrow by the comment, and writing “COTW!” somewhere in your posted response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/fuckin-magnets-how-do-they-work/comment-page-5/#comment-99751"&gt;delphi_ote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did anyone else notice the irony that the only reason we can hear this asshole wondering how magnets work is that some scientists figured out how magnetism and electricity work? In the recording studio, the dumbass probably literally spoke these words to a magnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists took “fucking magnets” and converted music “just there in the air” into something “15,000 juggalos together” can hear.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s inspiring that the Juggalos were able to come back after being hunted nearly to extinction on the old frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, at least the Native Americans used EVERY PART of the Juggalo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was a juggalo soldier in the heart of America&lt;br&gt;
Stolen from New Jersey, brought to Albequerque&lt;br&gt;
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it dangerous to join a church out of pure social interest? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I attended a very small conservative church with a friend of mine. The women wear scarves over their head, and it is taught that men are servants to God, and women are servants to men. This was mentioned twice at the sermon. The church is very small and in a bible belt state, and not part of a larger denomination. It borders on being a cult, as most of the members are related in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went there this weekend, one thing led to another, and a friend was my “witness” as I professed giving my soul up to Jesus and the Lord. I felt very coerced into the whole thing, and my interest in seeing what sort of culture exists in this small congregation got me in over my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do I proceed from here? I know too many of the people – from being secular friends – to back out and not have them chastise me and try to ’save’ me again. Is it wrong to go to this church socially, and lie to their faces, just to gain knowledge of the workings of this small cult-like church? Is there any knowledge to be gained, or am I playing some sort of dangerous game with my mind? I do not wish to be brainwashed, but take it from me – two days have already been very detrimental to my atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Brad,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you describe being curious about the culture and workings of this church with a kind of intellectual detachment, you sound as if cultural anthropology is a hobby of yours. Well, there’s nothing wrong with that.  I know a guy named Hemant Mehta who had a similar curiosity, and he turned it into an excellent book.  Your mistake was to investigate a church too close to your home, with people whom you know. Now you’re wondering how you can disengage yourself from their church with the least amount of disappointment or offense to them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question arises whether or not you actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to disengage from it. I hear both a difficulty in being assertive, and a little uncertainty about your own beliefs.  Maybe you simply have a hard time saying “no” to your friends, and so you felt pressured into making that ritual commitment. Some church services can be very emotionally compelling or manipulative, and some people can get swept up in it in ways that feel coerced or less than voluntary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re just lonely.  I can certainly understand that, but there are other ways to remedy that without the entanglements that you are describing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you also sound like you are not sure that you can keep your wits about you, and that you will somehow be seduced into really becoming a believer.  You speak of playing a dangerous game in your mind and not wanting to be brainwashed, saying that the exposure so far has been detrimental to your atheism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If in your own mind you are very clear, settled and confident about your atheistic views, then you’re not at any risk to end up believing something that you don’t want to believe. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; if you are ambiguous in your position, or if to some extent you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to believe what they believe, then by hanging around there you will probably get what you want. That is, after all, what they do there. They practice on each other, convincing each other to believe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first thing to do is to know your own mind, and then to make up your mind. &lt;b&gt;If&lt;/b&gt; you want to get away from this group, then given that you have some difficulty asserting yourself, I recommend that your best course is to quietly back away.  Disappear for a while. Take a vacation.  Out of sight is out of mind. When you come back home, don’t go to more meetings, and don’t bring up the subject with anybody. If and only if a member whom you know invites you to attend again, say “Thanks, but I decided that I’m not interested,” and then change the subject. Do not volunteer any further details or reasons. Your responses should be neutral, bland and uninteresting, supplying nothing against which they can argue. The less you say the better. You must bore them away. One or two might persist, but if you always respond with the minimum, being flat and opaque, they’ll eventually give up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you might have to pay some kind of social penalty. They might accept your decision, or they might chastise you or try to save you again, but I think it will be worth whatever awkward or uncomfortable moments you have to face to get out of this self-set trap of pretending. If they reject your friendship over this, then frankly such agenda-laden friends are not much of a loss. You can find better friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer you wait the harder it will be.  Better that they are disappointed now than really angered later, if they find that you have been deceiving them for a long time in order to observe them as if they were rain forest aborigines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for your ethical question, &lt;em&gt;“Is it wrong to go to this church socially, and lie to their faces, just to gain knowledge of the workings of this small cult-like church?”&lt;/em&gt; Yes, I think it is wrong for you to mislead them, appearing to agree with them just to satisfy your intellectual curiosity, or just to have some company, if that is all it is. There’s no need to confess that to them, just stop doing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the longer term Brad, begin to find ways to nurture more self-confidence so that you can have friendships without having to please people by going along with things you’d rather not do, and making commitments you’d rather not make.  You might benefit from taking a course on assertion, so that you don’t let “one thing lead to another,”  as happened in the church.  Then you can be intellectually curious about what people do, but still be able to have boundaries and keep whatever limits of involvement you feel are appropriate for you.  Eventually, you will be comfortable and self-assured, and able to frankly tell people what you believe and don’t believe.  You will have attracted friends who accept you as you are, so no one has to pretend in order to gain the approval of anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;Blisstree announced our first giveaway on Monday (see below for details)  – remember to leave a comment by tonight at 9 p.m. ET for a chance to  win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://youcastcorp.com/r/frappuccino?r=mochaLightBottle"&gt;&lt;img src="http://youcastcorp.com/starbucks/frappuccino/images/mochalight_asset.jpg" border="0" alt="STARBUCKS FRAPPUCCINO" width="300" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://youcastcorp.com/r/frappuccino?r=vanillaLightBottle"&gt;&lt;img style="border:0pt none" src="http://youcastcorp.com/starbucks/frappuccino/images/vanillalight_asset.jpg" border="0" alt="STARBUCKS FRAPPUCCINO" width="300" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look! It’s our very first reader giveaway since we launched! (But it won’t be our last.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the sweet prizes come from a little Seattle-based coffee shop called Starbucks. Heard of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Starbucks buys 75 percent of all its coffee from &lt;a href="http://www.starbucks.com/sharedplanet/index.aspx"&gt;responsibly grown, ethically traded sources&lt;/a&gt;, and the company aims to up that number to 100 percent by 2015. (Last year, Starbucks also bought 40 million pounds of &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/definition-decoder-fair-trade/"&gt;Fair Trade Certified&lt;/a&gt; coffee, which means it purchases more Fair Trade Certified coffee than anyone else in the world.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, huh? So Blisstree partnered with Starbucks to give a little something back to our readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two lucky Blisstree readers* will win:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Four Bottles of New Starbucks Frappuccino Light – 100 calories each (two Mocha Light, two Vanilla Light)&lt;br&gt;
• One $15 Starbucks Gift Card&lt;br&gt;
• One &lt;a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/home"&gt;Timbuk2 Messenger Bag&lt;/a&gt; (a $110 value)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter our exclusive giveaway, just tell us by 9 p.m. ET this  Friday, April 9, 2010, which Starbucks drink is your “desert island”  favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave your comment below, and comment as many times as you like!  (You’ll have to register with your email address, but we promise we’ll  only use it to tell you if you’ve won.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Giveaway open to residents of the U.S. and Canada. Blisstree will select two winners at random and contact them after April 9, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s issue of &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;contains a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/328/5975/150.pdf"&gt;news article&lt;/a&gt; (first pointed out to me by Matthew) about a clumsy (and now failed) attempt by the US’s National Science Board (NSB) to suppress a finding by a National Science Foundation (NSF) survey that Americans’ knowledge of evolution and cosmology remains poor, and well behind that of European and east Asian industrial nations. I am shocked and disconcerted that the NSB, the governing board of the NSF and official science advisers to the president and Congres, would do this. (&lt;strong&gt;Update below.&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every two years, the NSF issues a report on “a broad base of quantitative information on the U.S. and international science and engineering enterprise”, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind10/"&gt;Science and Engineering Indicators&lt;/a&gt;.  Since 1983, the  NSF has conducted a national survey of scientific knowledge, the results of which have been included in the report. Until now. NSB members &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/members/bio.jsp?pers=23500"&gt;John Bruer&lt;/a&gt;, a philosopher at the James McDonnell Foundation of St. Louis, and &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/members/bio.jsp?pers=22465"&gt;Louis Lanzerotti&lt;/a&gt;, an astrophysicist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, successfully prevailed upon the NSB to remove the survey results related to questions on evolution and the big bang. While Bruer has no evident expertise in (or concern for) evolution or cosmology, Lanzerotti spent most of his career at Bell Labs, whose most signal contribution to science has been the discovery of the &lt;a href="http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/beginners/introduction.html"&gt;cosmic background radiation&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/penzias-autobio.html"&gt;Arno Penzias&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/wilson-autobio.html"&gt;Robert Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, which is the key empirical evidence for &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-powered-the-big-bang/"&gt;the big bang&lt;/a&gt;. The irony– it burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two editions of the report contained sections on “&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c7/c7s2.htm#sb1"&gt;More Than a Century After Darwin, Evolution Still Under Attack in Schools&lt;/a&gt;” (&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;) and “&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/c7/c7s.htm#c7sb6"&gt;Evolution and the Schools&lt;/a&gt;” (&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;). The equivalent section and accompanying discussion, included in the 2010 report by the report’s authors, were removed by the NSB. Fortunately, the authors, and even the White House (to whom the report was submitted) objected. The report was not revised in light of these objections, but &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; obtained the deleted text, and thus the attempted suppression failed. Here’s &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;’s summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science has obtained a copy of the deleted text, which does not differ substantially from what has appeared in previous Indicators. The two questions (see graphic) have been part of an NSF-funded survey on scientific understanding and attitudes toward science since 1983. The deleted section notes that the 45% of Americans who answered “true” to the statement: “Human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals” is similar to the percentage in previous years and much lower than in Japan (78%), Europe (70%), China (69%), and South Korea (64%). A similar gap exists for the response to the statement: “The universe began with a big explosion,” with which only 33% of Americans agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving evolution and the big bang out of a discussion of American scientific literacy and attitudes toward science (especially after the &lt;em&gt;authors&lt;/em&gt; of the discussion included them) is mind boggling. These are two of the key issues in the scientific literacy problem in the United States, and one could easily argue they are &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; issues in scientific illiteracy. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/"&gt;Josh Rosenau&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/"&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, who said that, “Discussing American science literacy without mentioning evolution is intellectual malpractice.” &lt;a href="http://dsme.msu.edu/people/jomiller.htm"&gt;Jon Miller&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://dsme.msu.edu/about.htm"&gt;Michigan State&lt;/a&gt;, who had conducted the NSF survey in prior years, told &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; that “Evolution and the big bang are not a matter of opinion… If a person says that the earth really is at the center of the universe, … how in the world would you call that person scientifically literate?” &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;’s final take, quoting Miller again, was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller believes that removing the entire section was a clumsy attempt to hide a national embarrassment. “Nobody likes our infant death rate,” he says by way of comparison, “but it doesn’t go away if you quit talking about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the text of the 2008 report on &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/c7/c7s2.htm"&gt;evolution and the big bang&lt;/a&gt;; the full text of the report can be found &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Evolution and the “Big Bang”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In international comparisons, U.S. scores on two science knowledge questions are significantly lower than those in almost all other countries where the questions have been asked. Americans were less likely to answer true to the following scientific knowledge questions: “human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals” and “the universe began with a huge explosion.” In the United States, 43% of &lt;acronym title="General Social Survey"&gt;GSS&lt;/acronym&gt; respondents answered true to the first question in 2006, about the same percentage as in every year (except one) that the question has been asked. In other countries and in Europe, the comparable figures were substantially larger: 78% in Japan, 70% in China and Europe, and more than 60% in South Korea. Only in Russia did less than half of respondents (44%) answer true. Among the individual countries covered in the 2005 Eurobarometer survey, only Turkey’s percentage answering true to this question was lower than the U.S. percentage (&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/c7/c7r.htm"&gt;Miller, Scott, and Okamoto 2006&lt;/a&gt;). Similarly, Americans were less likely than other survey respondents (except the Chinese) to answer true to the big bang question. In the most recent surveys, less than 40% of Americans answered this question correctly compared with over 60% of Japanese and South Korean survey respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans’ responses to questions about evolution and the big bang appear to reflect factors beyond unfamiliarity with basic elements of science. The 2004 Michigan Survey of Consumer Attitudes administered two different versions of these questions to different groups of respondents. Some were asked questions that tested knowledge about the natural world (“human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals” and “the universe began with a big explosion”). Others were asked questions that tested knowledge about what a scientific theory asserts or a group of scientists believes (“according to the theory of evolution, human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals” and “according to astronomers, the universe began with a big explosion”). Respondents were much more likely to answer correctly if the question was framed as being about scientific theories or ideas rather than as about the natural world. When the question about evolution was prefaced by “according to the theory of evolution,” 74% answered true; only 42% answered true when it was not. Similarly, 62% agreed with the prefaced question about the big bang, but only 33% agreed when the prefatory phrase was omitted. These differences probably indicate that many Americans hold religious beliefs that cause them to be skeptical of established scientific ideas, even when they have some basic familiarity with those ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys conducted by the Gallup Organization provide similar evidence. An ongoing Gallup survey, conducted most recently in 2004, found that only about a third of Americans agreed that Darwin’s theory of evolution has been well supported by evidence (&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/c7/c7r.htm"&gt;Newport 2004&lt;/a&gt;). The same percentage agreed with the alternative statement that Darwin’s theory was not supported by the evidence, and an additional 29% said they didn’t know enough to say. Data from 2001 were similar. Those agreeing with the first statement were more likely to be men (42%), have more years of education (65% of those with postgraduate education and 52% of those with a bachelor’s degree), and live in the West (47%) or East (42%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to another group of questions on evolution asked by Gallup in 2004, about half (49%) of those surveyed agreed with either of two statements compatible with evolution: that human beings developed over millions of years either with or without God’s guidance in the process. However, 46% agreed with a third statement, that “God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so.” These views on the origin of human beings have remained virtually unchanged (in seven surveys) since the questions were first asked in 1982 (&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/c7/c7r.htm"&gt;Newport 2006&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For almost a century, whether and how evolution should be taught in U.S. public school classrooms has been a frequent source of controversy (see sidebar, “&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/c7/c7s.htm#c7sb6"&gt;Evolution and the Schools&lt;/a&gt;“). The role of alternative perspectives on human origins, including creationism and intelligent design, and their relevance to the teaching of science, has likewise been contentious. When Gallup asked survey respondents in 2005 whether they thought each of three “explanations about the origin and development of life on earth (evolution, creationism, and intelligent design) should or should not be taught in public school science classes” or whether they were “unsure,” for each explanation more Americans chose “should” than chose either of the other alternatives (&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/c7/tt07-06.htm"&gt;table 7-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img title="table." src="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/graphics/table.gif" alt="table." width="15" height="14"&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other developed countries, controversies about evolution in the schools have also occurred, but more rarely. However, signs of opposition to the theory of evolution are emerging in Europe (&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/c7/c7r.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 2006&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE.&lt;/strong&gt; In a &lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/04/evolution-big-bang-polls-omitted.html"&gt;different version of the &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;news article&lt;/a&gt; posted on Science’s website, but not published in today’s issue, Bruer gives a response to Science that indicates he may harbor creationist sympathies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;asked Bruer if individuals who did not accept evolution or the big bang to be true could be described as scientifically literate, he said: “There are many biologists and philosophers of science who are highly scientifically literate who question certain aspects of the theory of evolution,” adding that such questioning has led to improved understanding of evolutionary theory. When asked if he expected those academics to answer “false” to the statement about humans having evolved from earlier species, Bruer said: “On that particular point, no.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE II.&lt;/strong&gt; Josh Rosenau, who was quoted above in the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; news article, provides some further details on the affair at his blog, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2010/04/nsf_governing_board_spikes_evo.php?utm_source=mostactive&amp;amp;utm_medium=link"&gt;Thoughts From Kansas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patrick Sauer is funny. This is his second “Read It Like a Man” weekly column for Blisstree. Read the first installment &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/read-it-like-a-man-books-for-guys-that-women-should-borrow/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 2: Conspiracy Theories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Overton Window is a political theory that goes something like this: Previously unaccepted theories become more mainstream when ideas from the fringe are thrown out, thus making the previously stated ideas seem less radical and extreme. (It’s also the title of Glenn Beck’s upcoming novel, natch.) The Overton Window explains why conspiracy theories are no longer the provenance of loons and how they root themselves in mainstream thought. In a word, the Internet. Remember a year ago when everyone believed in global warming? &lt;a href="http://www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php"&gt;HOAX!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, conspiracy theories are everywhere, but they’re losing the magic. It used to be a badge of honor to come up with, get supporters of, and virulently defend a preposterous thesis that flew in the face of sane reason. There used to be admirable kooks like Heribert Illig, who concocted the “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis"&gt;phantom time hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;” proving that the Dark Ages are a myth, the years 614–911 (9/11??) never happened, and Charlemagne is a fictional character. Now &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; what I call crazy! Today, we’re stuck with the “&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/03/orly-taitz-melts-down-on_n_250441.html"&gt;Birthers&lt;/a&gt;” and their easily-debunked Obama Ain’t ‘Merican thing. It’s boring, unoriginal, and passe. Besides, head cheerleader Orly Taitz is no Illig. She seems to be the living result of what happened when Tinkerbell and Myron Byron De La Beckwith breeded. &lt;em&gt;If you believe, clap your hands, and we’ll make the scary black man disappear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Hunter S. said, there’s no such thing as paranoia. It’s all true.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/80-Greatest-Conspiracies-All-Time/dp/0806525312/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1270779414&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The 80 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Jonathan Vankin and John Whalen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cock-Up Theory:&lt;/strong&gt; Trust no one. Absolutely. But at least get your conspiracy theory underpinnings from the dubious duo of Vankin and Whalen. They’re the historians of an alternative shadowy universe in which the government covers up the colonization of Mars and created AIDS to wipe out gay men, that either Yoko Ono or Richard Nixon (or both?) assassinated John Lennon, and that the all-seeing NSA superspy eye-in-the-sky Echelon is watching you right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Consensus: &lt;/strong&gt;Vankin and Whalen have turned conspiracy theories into a cottage industry; the first version of their book I read had a measly 50 and no mention of how Dick Cheney and Enron conspired with the sun to bleed California dry. (The truth really is out there. Look up.) &lt;em&gt;The 80 Greatest Conspiracies&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect primer because the authors, while skeptical and logical, aren’t out to debunk everything in a scholarly manner and take the fun out of the Communist candy cabal’s plot to get Mothers feeding their children mind-altering fluoride. The authors do their research, but leave enough open-ended conclusions that the books shrewdly have appeal for deniers, believers, and those of us who just enjoy pondering the idea that Princess Diana was rubbed out because she refused to marry Bill Clinton, titular head of an international group of Satanists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Women Need to Read:&lt;/strong&gt; Guys love conspiracy theories because they liven up our staid. boring workaday existences. In the same way that women can’t get enough of family gossip, men can’t get enough of the idea that the New World Order is upon us, possibly utilizing a Mexican Zombie army to take over the world. It’s good stuff and allows us to daydream of leading a rebel band of outsiders against the Mexizombs. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_Razor"&gt;Occam and his razor&lt;/a&gt; can get bent. I’ll take black helicopters and Tupac Shakur faking his own death any day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.jonronson.com/them.html"&gt;Them: Adventures With Extremists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Jon Ronson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cock-Up Theory:&lt;/strong&gt; Ronson is a low-key British journalist who hosted the documentary series Secret Rulers of the World, and Them is its literary sidekick. Ronson is such an unassuming wise-ass that many of the world’s premier paranoids trust him and let him into their inner circle. Nut jobs as varied as radical Islamist Omar Bakri Muhammad, Ku Klux Klan leader Thomas Robb and Northern Irish anti-Catholic politician Ian Paisley all give Ronson the access to hang themselves with their own unhinged ropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Consensus:&lt;/strong&gt; In an unorthodox combo of amusement and terror, Ronson deftly proves two things about the world’s wingnuts. They’re both off-their-rockers-like-nobody-you’ll-ever-meet, and more or less like everyone you know. For example, Omar Bakri Muhammad is believed to have strong ties to al-Qaeda, but he also loves &lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt; and fart jokes. On the one hand, British writer David Icke believes the world’s elites are descended from 12-foot shape-shifting blood-drinking lizards. On the other hand, no wonder the fat-cat bankers get whatever they want – Congress is scared of their killer reptilian overlords. Yes, it all makes sense! Greenspan is a Gecko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Women Need to Read:&lt;/strong&gt; What women really need to do is listen – to any &lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/contributors/jon-ronson"&gt;Jon Ronson podcast&lt;/a&gt; with the lunatic fringe you can find. He’s living out the fantasy, hiding out in the woods with guys hell-bent on proving that the exclusive, uber-wealthy &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group"&gt;Bilderberg Group&lt;/a&gt; is plotting a godless-one-world-government. Imagine, if you will, that the tin-foil hat crowd turns out to be onto something real and Ronson is our only witness. He’ll be murdered of course, and there will be inevitable cover-up, and some freedom fighter/underemployed blogger would have to take up the mantle of truth. Man, that’s gonna be awesome.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;FYI:&lt;/strong&gt; You should also read &lt;em&gt;Them&lt;/em&gt; because Ronson spends an amazing afternoon with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Weaver"&gt;Randy Weaver’&lt;/a&gt;s daughter Rachel. They shoot guns as she candidly discusses the siege at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Ridge"&gt;Ruby Ridge&lt;/a&gt; (with a Jew, no less!) that left her mother dead, her brother shot, and her father in jail. She comes off as a tragic hero and made me empathize with the white-separatist government-haters. Nifty trick, that.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The Plot Against America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Philip Roth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cock-Up Theory:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2004, Roth dropped the “old man’s wang doesn’t work right anymore” mode he’s been in and delivered &lt;em&gt;The Plot Against America&lt;/em&gt;, a thrilling addition to the cannon of great conspiratorial novels. It’s an alternative American history type of book in which Charles Lindbergh (a notorious anti-Semite who praised Hitler) beats FDR in the 1940 presidential election through a message of isolationism, blaming the Jews for getting the U.S. into World War II and getting our troops killed in combat. Lindbergh signs “understandings” with Germany and Japan and sets out to remake America into a blond-haired blue-eyed Teutonic homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Consensus: &lt;/strong&gt;The book is narrated by a seven-year-old Roth, which isn’t some postmodern meta-conceit, but a surprisingly plausible reimaging of what life could have been like if Lindbergh had been elected. Would Newark have had its own North Jersey Kristallnacht? (And what would the inevitable Bruce Springsteen song about the events have sounded like? Big Man sax solo or no?) The paranoia in the book that’s destroying America is not a fiendish Jewish plot, but the simple turning of neighbor-against-neighbor, friend-against-friend, and family-member-against-family-member during wartime. Fortunately, there are solutions for young Jews, like the “Just Folks” program that sends Philip’s older brother Sandy to work on a Kentucky farm. Presumably, he’ll learn the lessons of “Real America,” like how to make White Lightning strong enough to bed your sister. Roth is wielding an angry pen because in an age where every loon with a laptop gets their message out there, whether you go crazy right or crazy left, the conspiracies end up in the same place. The Jews. It’s always the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Women Need to Read:&lt;/strong&gt; When done right, &lt;em&gt;What If?&lt;/em&gt; novels offer the blueprint for what happens when the conspiracy theorists are right. (Especially when they involve Nazis, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fatherland-Novel-Mortalis-Robert-Harris/dp/0812977211/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1270781032&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Fatherland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is another great choice). Too often, they’re done in broad, stupidly drawn strokes (paging Robert Langdon’s mullet), but &lt;em&gt;The Plot Against America &lt;/em&gt;isn’t. Change the Roth name to Suzuki, uproot them to California, and stick them in an internment camp and you don’t have paranoid fantasy. You have 20th century history. Fortunately, we’ve evolved as a people. No matter what Michele Bachmann says, there will be no more rounding up of the citizenry. The next great alternative history won’t be written by an American Jew (too assimilated) and it won’t take place on U.S. soil. We’ve changed. When an author we’ll call Abed Abdullah writes his &lt;em&gt;What If?&lt;/em&gt;, it’ll take place 90 miles south, in Guantanamo Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: What is a sellable idea? How do you develop one? Is your idea enough for a book, is there more you can do to develop it, or should it just be a magazine article or series of blog posts? This will be a hands-on nuts and bolts workshop: Come with ideas to pitch. Better yet, bring a &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; (1 page or less) written proposal to read and workshop. This workshop will provide handouts on proposal writing as well as sample proposals you can use to help develop your own in the future. Useful for anyone hoping to someday write for print or online publications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_writing_fo_6.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ortLOz4cagY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270820189412"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=172982">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a13ab4bd27676eee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="adopting a child"/><category term="adoption"/><category term="adoption costs"/><category term="adoption requirements"/><category term="domestic adoption"/><category term="foster care"/><category term="foster children"/><category term="international adoption"/><category term="Parenting"/><title type="html">Parenting: Is Adoption Right for You?</title><published>2010-04-09T13:32:33Z</published><updated>2010-04-09T13:32:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/parenting-is-adoption-right-for-you/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/83109967.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="83109967" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/83109967-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoption is a permanent lifelong commitment to a child that can be extremely rewarding. You may be thinking of adopting because you have fertility problems, because you don’t want to give birth to a biological child, or just because you’ve always felt that you wanted to adopt. Before making a decision, be sure that you’re prepared to give the child all the love, attention, and support they will need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state or country where the adoption will take place has adoption laws and procedures in place. In addition, adoption agencies may have specific criteria for adoptive parents including minimum and maximum age limits. In an open independent adoption, the birth parents may also be involved in the selection of the adoptive family. Therefore, they may have additional expectations that you will need to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoptive parents can be married or single, gay or straight, childless or already parents. Though you don’t need to be rich or own your own home to adopt, you do need to be financially stable and able to provide for a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For domestic infant adoption, many agencies only consider couples between the ages of 25 and 40 who have been married at least two years, and have steady employment. Other agencies may be more flexible, or require that one parent stay home for at least six months after the adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoption through foster care has very little or no cost. However, other types of adoption can cost upwards of $40,000. Generally, domestic private adoption costs between $10,000 and $40,000, while international adoption varies tremendously by country, starting at around $7,500. Some agencies have a sliding scale depending on income, while others have flat fees for their services.&lt;/p&gt;

As there&amp;#39;s no unpublished data there, and a long-awaited paper on the subject has just been submitted, I believe it should be fair game for blogging. Coming from a vicious field (Arabidopsis, sigh...), I&amp;#39;m generally rather cautious about blogging department talks and such, but Constructive Neutral Evolution is a subject in need to spreading, and not a particularly competitive area at the moment...Rosie has another summary of today&amp;#39;s yesterday&amp;#39;s talk, with an executive summary therein; she tried to scoop me, so clearly this means I must outdo her in length and verbosity =P[If anything doesn&amp;#39;t make sense, it&amp;#39;s very likely an error on my part]-----Irremediable Complexity - Ford Doolittle, 07 Apr 2010[paraphrased from notes; own comments in grey]- Is each step in the evolution of a complex machine useful?Irremediable complexity involves three factors: Tinkering, small populations, ratchets (Constructive Neutral Evolution). [prior to that, must discuss common views on complexity first]Common views on complexity- Directionality: 19th century - divine forces guide evolution; 20th century - orthogenesis - evolution exhibits a drive towards perfection (and complexity)- Progress: Life started off being simple and became increasingly complexBut is there necessarily a trend?(Gould 1996 Full House) The Drunkard&amp;#39;s Walk: if one starts off at a limit that cannot be passed, random steps will eventually lead away from this limit. Presumably, life began more or less at the lower limit of complexity (specialised parasites aside), so it&amp;#39;s bound to get more complex as it&amp;#39;s the only way to go.In fact, complexity is increased only in a few lineages, which also happen to be the ones we really like to look at.So is the evolution of multicellular animals and plants from choanoflagellate-like and chlamydomonas-like organisms, respectively, a drunkard&amp;#39;s walk or driven by something (eg. selection)?Selectionist explanations- Accumulation of specific adaptations  results in complexity (eg. The Eye)Another example: larger genome size is an adaptation for more gene regulation which is required in more complex organisms. [Note: C-value paradox, etc] Molecular biologists have an obsession with &amp;#39;mystery DNA&amp;#39; having regulatory roles...- Arms races, sexual selectionGreater biodiversity/more competition between organisms stimulates greater complexity, eg through niche specialisation and sex selection- Evolving evolvabilityOutdoing one&amp;#39;s environmental changes by evolving faster. Eg. Exon shuffling as a function of introns: introns space out exons allowing more novel combinations of these exons to occur, which may be adaptive.Caveat with evolvability -- it&amp;#39;s a clade-selection level trait, not individual level.Neutral forces - should be our null hypotheses- Tinkering (François Jacob) -- will still have traces of an apparatus&amp;#39; past functions along with new ones --&amp;gt; life is full of Rube Goldberg machines.- Small population size -- mildly deleterious traits more likely to be fixed in smaller populations (Michael Lynch; more info in Part I of my Neutral Evolution series) Eukaryotes are a case of smaller population size relative to prokaryotes.- Ratchets -- 1. Maynard-Smith &amp;amp; Szathmary&amp;#39;s Major Transitions; 2. Stoltzfus &amp;amp; Covello&amp;#39;s Constructive Neutral EvolutionMajor Transitions: There are steps in evolution that are difficult or impossible to reverse -- act as ratchets.Constructive Neutral Evolution: a previously fortuitous (non-functional) interaction can enable an otherwise-deleterious mutation to occur, resulting in a dependency upon this interaction. [a diagram is in the making]More interactions evoke more opportunity for Constructive Neutral Evolution to drive (via ratchetting) an increase in complexity. [thus, the result would be an explosion of complexity past a certain threshold]The dependency can be built up by other mutations, thus further solidifying the requirement for a given interaction.Note that no positive selection is required at any step [only purifying], would also be more drastic in smaller populations where more deleterious mutations are fixed by drift. That said,  positive selection can still play a role in parallel.Examples:Lambowitz&amp;#39;s maturase-requiring group I self-splicing intron. [will be discussed in further detail in impending post] A derived Neurospora lineage requires a maturase for the splicing of group I introns whereas nearby relatives do not. Lambowitz later (2006) argues that maturase-mediated splicing evolved in response to the splicing problem, as opposed to enabling it to arise. This is putting the cart before the horse.kDNA editosome (Trypanosomes et al.) [Can be summed up in one interjection: whyyyyyyyyyyyyy???]In summary, genes coded by the mitochondrial genome are non-sensical, and right after transcription the pre-mRNAs are edited by the complicated process involving templates and inserting various U&amp;#39;s where they are needed.There are several explanations that have been proposed:- relic of the RNA world -- for starters, tryps are derived. - to correct pre-existing mutations -- backwards logic again (cart before the horse)- regulation[Digression to discuss the two oft-conflated meanings of function]1. Selected function -- how a trait got to be there2. Current function -- what happens if trait is removedExample from Maynard-Smith: Stiff back of the horse. Removal thereof would prevent humans from riding it, but no one can argue that the horse&amp;#39;s back evolved so that humans could ride it in the future!How editing really arose -- CNE [see Stoltzfus 1999 JME and Lukes et al 2009 PNAS(and subsequent correspondence)]: once the process started, it couldn&amp;#39;t be reversed, thus complexity reached an absurd level.&amp;quot;Absurdly complex spliceosome&amp;quot;- if you think about it, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;incredibly stupid&amp;quot; to have such a complex machine for removing introns- cites &amp;quot;Five Easy Pieces&amp;quot; Sharp 1991 Science laying out a hypothesis for the evolution of group II introns- see Lambowitz example for how the spliceosome may have arisen through initially-neutral protein interactionsRibosomeAlso by CNE. Roughly put, the RNA does most of the enzymatic work in the ribosome, with the proteins taking on more of a structural function. Presumably, initially the ribosome could&amp;#39;ve been entirely a ribozyme, picking up various proteins for supporting structural roles, like the Lambowitz intron, with the help of constructive neutral evolution.Cited TW O&amp;#39;Brien 2003 IUBMB Life paper: the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome is smaller than that of its host (eukaryotic) yet larger than the prokaryotic counterpart; furthermore, many of the extra mitochondrial ribosomal proteins do not come from the eukaryote! This is a great example of convergence between the two separate...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

But if you qualify that by saying, mind control of a cockroach, you might think, “Dude, it’s a roach. How hard can controlling its mind be?”

While roaches may not be among nature’s deepest thinkers, jewel wasps (Ampulex compressa, below) pull off an impressive level of control of a cockroach after the roach is stung. The wasp walks the roach to the wasp’s nest, lays an egg on the roach, and the roach remains inside the nest and allows itself to be eaten by baby wasps. Importantly, the cockroach isn’t dying or immobilized or paralyzed – it just isn’t running away.

Obviously the wasp is injecting some sort of complex chemical cocktail in its venom, but what does it do to the roach’s nervous system? Gal and Libersat perform a series of experiments to pinpoint just how the wasp venom is working.

The wasp stings near the front end of the cockroach, where there are two major cluster of neurons: the brain (which gets called the supra-esophageal ganglion here) and the sub-esophageal ganglion (or, as some countries foppishly call it, the sub-oesophageal ganglion). The brain sits ahead of the “throat,” as it were, and the sub-esophageal ganglion sits just behind it.

Intuitively, you’d expect that the wasp would be targeting the roach’s brain. When we think of the place that actions are started, that’s what we think of. But this is a somewhat backbone-centric view of things, as most invertebrates have taken an “eggs in many baskets” approach to their nervous systems: they’re less concentrated in one place. It was already known that the wasps do sting the brain, but do they also work their hoodoo on the sub-esophageal ganglion?

Gal and Libersat first showed that when they removed the sub-esophageal ganglion from a cockroach, wasps given the opportunity to sting it took much, much longer compared to control. They interpret this as the wasp “looking” for its target, and it just keeps digging around in the roach’s body, looking for the missing neural tissue.

Then, they showed in intact roaches that placing a small drop of venom on the sub-esophageal ganglion significantly impaired the cockroach’s walking and escape running. When the venom was placed on the brain, though, there was no difference in behaviour compared to the control animals.

Not only did they see behaviour of whole animals depressed, when Gal and Libersat recorded from isolated sub-esophageal ganglia in a dish, they saw a significant decline in both spontaneous spiking, and spiking elicited by either wind or touch. And, as anyone who’s ever tried to hit a cockroach knows, these animals are very sensitive to wind and touch are normally very effective at running away from them. It looks like the initial movement away from these stimuli is not broken, but the normal running afterwards is messed up by the venom.

All of these experiments suggest that the sub-esophageal ganglion is really critical for the wasp’s mind control trick. This region is probably involved in controlling the initiation of voluntary locomotion (much like some of the command neurons in crayfish I wrote about a while ago).

But if so much of the wasp&amp;#39;s strange hypnotic power is exerted by controlling the sub-esophageal ganglion, the authors can only speculate on this: why does the wasp sting the roach’s brain?

But I wasn't sure what to make of that fact, so I shrugged and moved on.

But now, Science magazine has investigated, and in turns out a lot of folks are extremely upset at this omission. That includes the National Center for Science Education and even the White House. There are charges of a whitewash--that these data were cut precisely because evolution and the Big Bang are the subjects where Americans appear the most "scientifically illiterate" in comparison with citizens from other countries:
The deleted text, obtained by ScienceInsider, does not differ radically from what has appeared in previous Indicators. The section, which was part of the unedited chapter on public attitudes toward science and technology, notes that 45% of Americans in 2008 answered true to the statement, "Human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals." The figure is similar to previous years and much lower than in Japan (78%), Europe (70%), China (69%), and South Korea (64%).

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I don&amp;#39;t disagree with John&amp;#39;s observation that Sarah Palin&amp;#39;s speech style is folksy and informal. As for his comment that &amp;quot;Palin […] has grown up squarely within a period of American history when the old-fashioned sense of a speech as a carefully planned recitation, and public pronouncements as performative oratory, has been quite obsolete&amp;quot;, we could quibble over details — how much of the difference is in what public figures say, as opposed to what gets transmitted and reported? — but let&amp;#39;s grant that John is right about this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I think that John may go wrong is in his analysis of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there's no doubt that Sarah Palin tends to use certain demonstratives more often than most other public figures, and also tends to use them in a different way. In "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=674"&gt;Affective demonstratives&lt;/a&gt;", 10/5/2008, I noted differences as great as 15-to-1 between her and Joe Biden in the 10/4/2008 vice-presidential debate. Her  demonstratives often seemed qualitatively as well as quantitatively different, in characteristic examples like "Americans are craving that straight talk". &lt;em&gt;Straight talk&lt;/em&gt; was John McCain's slogan, but "craving that straight talk" was pure Palin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's John McWhorter's diagnosis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;What truly distinguishes Palin’s speech is its utter subjectivity: that is, she speaks very much from the inside of her head, as someone watching the issues from a considerable distance. The &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; fetish, for instance — Palin frequently displaces statements with an appended “there,” as in “We realize that more and more Americans are starting to see the light there…” But where? Why the distancing gesture? At another time, she referred to Condoleezza Rice trying to “forge that peace.” That peace? You mean that peace way over there — as opposed to &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; peace that you as Vice-President would have been responsible for forging? She’s far, far away from &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;All of us use &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in this way in casual speech — it’s a way of placing topics as separate from us on a kind of abstract “desktop” that the conversation encompasses. “The people in accounting down there think they can just ….” But Palin, doing this even when speaking to the whole nation, is no further outside of her head than we are when talking about what’s going on at work over a beer. The issues, American people, you name it, are “there” — in other words, not in her head 24/7. She hasn’t given them much thought before; they are not her. They’re &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, over &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's another set of reasons for using &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; — not to signal distance from the referent, but to establish fellowship with the audience. The OED&amp;#39;s entry for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; as a "demonstrative adjective" sketches the cause and the effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. a. &lt;/strong&gt;The simple demonstrative used (as adjective in concord with a n.), to indicate a thing or person either as being actually pointed out or present, or as having just been mentioned and being thus mentally pointed out. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b.&lt;/strong&gt; Indicating a person or thing assumed to be known, or to be known to be such as is stated. Often (esp. before a person's name: cf. L. &lt;em&gt;iste&lt;/em&gt;) implying censure, dislike, or scorn; but sometimes commendation or admiration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly in the entry for &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.b. &lt;/strong&gt;Pointing out a person or object with approval or commendation, or the contrary. Also in anticipatory commendation of the person addressed; cf. THAT dem. pron. B. I. 1b.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Frank Sinatra sings about "that old black magic", or about "Chicago, that toddlin' town", it's not because the magic and the city are "&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, over &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, things that he &amp;quot;hasn&amp;#39;t given … much thought [to] before&amp;quot;. On the contrary, they&amp;#39;re a familiar part of his mental life, and by treating them as &amp;quot;assumed to be known&amp;quot; to the audience, he draws us in as well. Similarly, Billie Holiday&amp;#39;s reference to &amp;quot;them there eyes&amp;quot; is a form of endearment, not a distancing mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as the OED's entries indicate, familiarity can also signal contempt, as in the case of Ronald Reagan's famous line "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_you_go_again"&gt;There you go again&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John's reaction shows that he gets the implication of shared familiarity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This reminds me of toddlers who speak from inside their own experience in a related way: they will come up to you and comment about something said by a neighbor you’ve never met, or recount to you the plot of an episode of a TV show they have no way of knowing you’ve ever heard of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But using distal demonstratives as a rhetorical device to imply familiarity is an entirely grown-up trick. The phrasal lexicon of adult discourse is full of collocations like "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=%22that+good+old+American%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai="&gt;that good old American ___&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/"&gt;vice-presidential debate&lt;/a&gt; of October 2008, Sarah Palin's first turn included this passage (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The barometer &lt;strong&gt;there&lt;/strong&gt;, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that any other prominent American politician would have thrown in that semantically superfluous &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. But its force is not to distance Palin from her resounding barometer, prudent though it might have been to do so. Rather, this verbal tic is an attempt to draw us all in to her metaphor. The barometer, you know, the one we're all familiar with, that good old barometer there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She goes on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform. Two years ago, remember, it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures. He sounded &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; warning bell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know the warning bell she's talking about, right? That one over there, always in the back of our shared experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didn't want to listen to him and wouldn't go towards &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; reform that was needed then. I think that the alarm has been heard, though, and there will be &lt;strong&gt;that &lt;/strong&gt;greater oversight, again thanks to John McCain's bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week, even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, Sarah Palin uses distal demonstratives more than other public figures do, and she often uses them in different ways. This is partly a folksy regionalism, and partly a personal quirk, but contrary to John's analysis, it's not because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The issues, American people, you name it, are “there” — in other words, not in her head 24/7. She hasn’t given them much thought before; they are not her. They’re &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, over &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, it's because she's welcoming all of us into the familiar space of that good old American experience there.&lt;/p&gt;

In the 2010 edition the NSB made the odd and controversial decision to&lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/04/evolution-big-bang-polls-omitted.html"&gt; omit the data regarding belief by Americans in evolution and the Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;. Hiding data is never a good idea. Science thrives on transparency – better to publish the data with an explanation than just sweep it under the rug. As usually happens, the data is now going to get far more attention than it otherwise would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the NSB did this on purpose, to draw attention to the problem. They would have been exceptionally clever, but I doubt that’s what happened. It is much more likely to have been a bone-headed political move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stated reason for the omission is that the results reflect religious attitudes more than scientific knowledge. This is a reasonable inference from the data, but it is not clear how strong each factor is. Further, the NSB should have just released the data with that discussion – which they actually did quite nicely in that section of the report that was deleted. Here are parts of &lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/assets/2010/04/08/chapter7_insider_excerpt.pdf"&gt;the deleted section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In international comparisons, U.S. scores on two science knowledge questions are considerably lower than those in almost all other countries where the questions have&lt;br&gt;
been asked. Americans were less likely to answer “true” to the following scientific knowledge questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals.”&lt;br&gt;
“The universe began with a huge explosion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, 45% of GSS respondents answered true to the first question in 2008, similar to other years when the question was asked. In other countries and in Europe, the comparable figures were higher: 78% in Japan, 70% in Europe, 69% in China, and 64% in South Korea. Russia and Turkey were the only countries where less than half of respondents responded correctly (44% and 27% respectively) (Gokhberg and Shuvalova, 2004; EC 2005). Similarly, Americans were less likely than survey respondents in South Korea and Japan to answer the big bang question correctly: one third of Americans answered this question correctly compared with 67% of South Korean and 63% of Japanese respondents (figure 7-11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 45% figure is not different than previous years. The report goes on to discuss, quite nicely, that the way survey questions are phrased greatly affect the outcome. If the question about evolution, for example, is prefaced with “according to the theory of evolution” – then more people will endorse it as true. This does suggest that more people understand at least the basic concept of evolution than believe in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSB explanation also does not make sense because this section is labeled “Public Attitudes and Understanding” – so why omit data on the premise that it reflects attitudes more than understanding? The report is about both – so publish the data and discuss the complex relationship between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the very complexity they claim they are trying to avoid is exactly what they should be exploring. They should also endeavor to design a survey in the future that further fleshes out this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think it does a very superficial job of assessing understanding. Knowing that, according to evolution, species change over time is so basic that it does not really tell us much about the public understanding of evolution. How about asking about the evidence for evolution, how natural selection works as a mechanism, or how genetics reflects evolutionary history. Start with the basics, and then see how deep public understanding goes – at least scratch beneath the surface a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather – the federal organization dedicated to promoting science education in this country decided to sweep their most pressing issue under the rug. Fail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the NSF does much that is good. &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7290/full/464813b.html"&gt;A recent editorial in Nature&lt;/a&gt; discusses the fact that most people learn most of their science outside the classroom – so-called informal science education. They also report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSF, to its credit, is funding research into this area, and many  others relating to informal learning. It should continue to do so. In  the meantime, however, education authorities need to recognize the  importance of informal science education and do more to promote it — if  only as a way to motivate students in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a huge issue that will only increase over time. You, dear reader, are engaging in informal science education when you read this blog or other science blogs. Science podcasts are also becoming increasingly popular. And science programming has long been a part of television programming. Popular science magazines are still huge, and most are learning to increase their presence on the web. This is all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also reflects what I have long believed about science education – the most important thing to teach people is how to learn, how to assess and evaluate science information, and to instill them with a desire to do so – an appreciation for the power and beauty of science. The ultimate goal is to give people a sound theoretical grounding in science and a working fund of scientific knowledge. But this approach follows the proverb – give someone a fish and you feed them for a day, teach them how to fish and you feed them for life. So my approach has been to teach people how to fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in my opinion, that should be the primary goal of formal science education – to create life-long self-learners in science. As the Nature article points out, as adults many of the issues that are relevant to us now (genetically modified foods, stem cell research, global climate change) did not even exist or were minor issues when we were in school. We need to be preparing students today for the scientific controversies of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, our experience with attitudes toward evolution reflects the fact that if we don’t effectively deal with these issues today they will continue to be problems decades into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad to see that attention is being paid to this issue. Hopefully this snafu from the NSB will inadvertently draw more attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270816057384"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/04/why_am_i_not_agnostic_about_go.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8d4ea83d0b8a367</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Why Am I Not Agnostic About Gods?</title><published>2010-04-09T13:20:24Z</published><updated>2010-04-09T13:20:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/nUZCMU6fjaw/why_am_i_not_agnostic_about_go.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/04/why_am_i_not_agnostic_about_go.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The comment thread on the entry about the shroud of Turin grows daily and is (perhaps not surprisingly) mainly not about the shroud but about Christianity and atheism. Some people are praying for me and my family, others are calling me names, just because I identify as an atheist and offer the scientific consensus view of that piece of Medieval linen along with some hypotheses about its context of manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henrik commented that anybody who is not agnostic about gods has an unscientific attitude to the question. Owlmirror simply and wisely replied "Parsimony". This is in my opinion worth a few extra words of explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my mind, atheism, defined as "not believing in any gods", is the standard scientific attitude. The reason that I am not agnostic about gods, invisible pink unicorns etc. is a central scientific principle known as Ockham's razor. It states that when attempting to explain observations, a person should be parsimonious, frugal, economic in their hypotheses. Do not hypothesise more things than necessary. No observation of the world demands the existence of gods or invisible unicorns in order to be explained. Science is doing fine without those hypotheses. Thus there is no reason to believe that they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But note also that being a secularised Swede, I am not emotionally invested in the issue of gods. I believe equally little in gods, invisible unicorns, Santa Claus, Bilbo Baggins and Bigfoot. And I see no reason to treat the question of gods separately from other scientific issues. (I mean, if there were immensely powerful incorporeal consciousnesses out there, they would be a hot research topic in any number of scientific disciplines.) The reason that I identify as an atheist in my byline top left isn't that I spend lots of time thinking about my unbelief. It's that most Sb readers are in the US. And I know that in the religiously crazed United States, atheists are a beleaguered, even hated, minority. But they're my peeps, and I support them as best I can. The right to freedom of religion is a fine thing. And so is the right to freedom from religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm often asked that question, and my answer has usually been something along the lines of, "It depends on what it is used for." Of course, there's no doubt that the "theory" behind chiropractic, namely that so-called "subluxations" of the spine are the source of nearly all disease, is a load of the purest woo. After all, going back to the origin of chiropractic in 1895, you will recall that Daniel David Palmer essentially made up chiropractic out of whole cloth when he claimed to have restored the hearing of a deaf janitor by "adjusting" a bump on his spine. As a result of this, he concluded that "subluxations" somehow mess up the body's expression of "innate intelligence." When you come right down to it, though, "innate intelligence" comes off sounding very much like the Eastern concept of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;, or life energy, and adjustments of "subluxations," in concept relative to &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;, are not unlike acupuncture in that chiropractors claim that "adjusting" these subluxations release "nerve interference" and thus cure disease caused by this interference, much as acupuncturists claim to "unblock" the flow of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, my answer to the question of whether or not chiropractic is woo is multifaceted. The theory of chiropractic is, without a doubt, pure woo, but many modern day chiropractors try to downplay the woo part and "mix" with modern medicine. Chiropractic might have value in back pain and other spinal problems, but, if it does, it is the same sort of value that a good physical therapist provides with physical manipulation of the spine, which is why I have sometimes referred to chirpractors as physical therapists with delusions of grandeur. (In fact, for back pain I'd far rather have a good physical therapist than a chiropractor.) A man's got to know his limitations, and many chiropractors don't know theirs, claiming to treat asthma, sinus diseases, diabetes, infectious diseases, and infant colic. Indeed, criticizing chiropractors for claiming to be able to treat infant colic when there is no valid scientific evidence to support such a claim is what got Simon Singh into trouble when the British Chiropractic Association sued for libel. In any case, apparently there is almost nothing chirpractors can't treat, at least if you believe their claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also &lt;a href="http://business.scoop.co.nz/2010/04/08/research-on-chiropractic-for-pregnant-women/"&gt;seem to think that they know how to treat pregnant women during labor&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_annals_of_quackademic_medicine_testi.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_annals_of_quackademic_medicine_testi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/fWS9K38GdPU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270814396872"><id gr:original-id="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/?p=817">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/42b43d88b5fc034f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The FIH have appointed a (former?) supporter of AIDS denialism as Chief Executive</title><published>2010-04-09T10:26:32Z</published><updated>2010-04-09T10:26:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/the-fih-have-appointed-a-former-supporter-of-aids-denialism-as-chief-executive/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">The Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH) have been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons.  £300,000 has apparently gone missing from their accounts, the police are now investigating, and it is claimed their 2006 Smallwood report was funded by shamed politician, Dame Shirley Porter.  They have now appointed a former writer for [...]&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gimpyblog.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=1769773&amp;amp;post=817&amp;amp;subd=gimpyblog&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>gimpy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270812974285"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=173888">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9ec39ea545f20d7f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="Chelsea Handler"/><category term="cougar"/><category term="Justin Bieber"/><category term="Star Magazine"/><title type="html">Video of the Day: Is Chelsea Handler a Cougar?</title><published>2010-04-09T11:29:16Z</published><updated>2010-04-09T11:29:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/video-of-the-day-is-chelsea-handler-a-cougar/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/chelseahandler.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He filed &lt;a href="http://www.robsherman.com/news/pdf/CapitalBill/Complaint100407.pdf"&gt;a federal lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) “to block $2.3 billion in Illinois grants from the $31 billion Capital Bill that was enacted into law last year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something he has been working on for a &lt;a href="http://www.robsherman.com/news/2010/01/18.htm"&gt;few months now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/02/06/illinois-legislators-give-million-to-sponsor-their-own-faith-based-wishes/"&gt;written about before&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of those Illinois grants are going to religious organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.robsherman.com/news/pdf/CapitalBill/ExhibitB.pdf"&gt;Not just Christian ones&lt;/a&gt;, either (PDF):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Grants to houses of worship that are being challenged in this lawsuit include $150,000 for Louis Farrakhan’s &lt;a href="http://www.seventhfam.com/"&gt;Nation of Islam Temple&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago.  The Nation of Islam is best known for advocating the hatred of white people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grants to parochial schools that are being challenged include $500,000 for a new school building for &lt;a href="http://www.ctkjesuit.org/"&gt;Christ the King Jesuit College Prep&lt;/a&gt; (Roman Catholic high school) in Chicago.  The sponsor of this grant of tax dollars, &lt;a href="http://www.ilga.gov/house/Rep.asp?GA=96&amp;amp;MemberID=1526"&gt;State Representative LaShawn Ford&lt;/a&gt;, is on the &lt;a href="http://www.ctkjesuit.org/about/board.html"&gt;Board of Trustees&lt;/a&gt; of Christ the King College Prep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grants to religious ministries that are being challenged include $35,000 to the &lt;a href="http://www.nuhillel.org/"&gt;Hillel Foundation&lt;/a&gt; at Northwestern University, whose mission is “to inspire every Jewish student to make an enduring commitment to Jewish life.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a $100,00 grant requested for the discriminatory Boy Scouts in Rockford — a group that openly excludes atheists and homosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sherman, the most &lt;a href="http://www.robsherman.com/news/pdf/CapitalBill/ExhibitC.pdf"&gt;problematic grant&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) being requested is for $2,300,000,000… to &lt;strong&gt;Governor Pat Quinn&lt;/strong&gt;… for “discretionary grants to unspecified providers.”  In other words, “[t}he grant allows the Governor to essentially play Santa Claus and give the money to pretty much anybody or any organization that he wants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first hearing about this case in court should occur in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to know how state legislators defend their requests on behalf of these religious groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they &lt;a href="http://qctimes.com/news/local/government-and-politics/article_3f953736-4367-11df-8b02-001cc4c002e0.html"&gt;take a cue&lt;/a&gt; from State Senator &lt;strong&gt;Bill Brady&lt;/strong&gt; (R-Bloomington), Sherman should have a slam-dunk case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One of the organizations listed in the suit is the St. Robert Bellarmine Catholic Newman Center, located on the campus of Illinois State University. The facility serves Catholic university students and is set to receive $200,000 in state funds. State Sen. Bill Brady, R-Bloomington, who is running for governor, requested money for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Brady previously said it was appropriate to spend public money for the Newman Center project in Normal because it could behalf all students, not just Catholic students.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right… because the Newman Center is where *all* the students go to just hang out…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These groups do not deserve taxpayer money, nor is it legal for them to receive it.  I would hope the courts know this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherman is a polarizing figure, no doubt, but in this case he has earned the support of anyone, religious or not, who believes in the separation of church and state.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;There have been, in the last 20 years, natural, or perhaps unnatural experiments that have helped shed light on the efficacy of vaccines.  Many societies, for reason of political unrest, religion or a lack of understanding of medicine have seen the rates of vaccines decline and with it an increase in the cases of vaccine preventable disease,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Disease spread in population is not simple.  Hygiene, nutrition, access to health care and education all play a role in the spread of communicable diseases,  Vaccine are critical in driving the rates of vaccine preventable illness to zero, but they are not the only intervention in our armamentarium.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;When the old soviet union fell apart in the 1990’s, its medial system followed.  Some totalitarian states have been especially good at getting their populations vaccinated.  However, after the fall of Communism, the rates of vaccination fell and pertussis, whooping cough and diphtheria returned all the states of the former soviet union.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11236494&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;“…Diphtheria morbidity in Moscow in 1958-1999 are presented. The last epidemic which started at the end of the 1980s and reached its peak in 1994, giving a 59-fold rise in morbidity in comparison with the pre-epidemic period, is characterized in detail. During the epidemic 12,267 persons fell ill, 454 of them died (mortality rate was 4%). Having started in Moscow, the epidemic gradually spread not only over the territory of Russia, but also over some other republics of the former Soviet Union (Ukraine, Belarus, etc.). Possible causes of this epidemic emergency are considered. The ever increasing share of adult population among persons affected by the epidemic (75%) is noted. The infection adults is characterized by severity of clinical manifestations and increased morbidity among adults, is shown. Under complicated social and economic conditions (crisis situation) the increase of groups of high risk which included unemployed adults of working age, retirees as well as socially non-adapted persons, was registered.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;“The massive diphtheria epidemic in the former Soviet Union provides important lessons for all diphtheria immunization programs: It is important to achieve a high level of childhood immunization, maintain immunity against diphtheria in older age groups, and use anti-epidemic measures, including immunization, to control epidemics in the early phase. The immunization coverage among children should be at least 90%.” http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10657222&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“Failure to achieve high levels of immunity among children contributed to the epidemic of diphtheria that occurred in the Russian Federation during the 1990s. A major factor in this failure was the extensive list of contraindications to vaccination that was in use throughout the countries of the former Soviet Union. In 1980, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of the Soviet Union adopted an extensive list of contraindications for use of the diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-pertussis (DTP) vaccine. In 1994, the MOH of the Russian Federation revised the list of contraindications to vaccination to be largely in accord with World Health Organization recommendations. Since then, age-appropriate vaccination coverage has increased markedly: In 1996, DTP3 coverage among children 12 months of age had increased to 87% from 60% in 1990. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10657219”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;In the end the only way diphtheria came under control was by increasing vaccination rates.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Similar problems were seen with pertussis&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;“The aim of the current study was to assess the epidemiological situation concerning the emergence of a pertussis outbreak, as well as potential contributing factors and vaccine effectiveness. A retrospective epidemiological description and an analysis of the outbreak among students were performed. The basic school in Adavere had a total of 150 students in 2003. Of these, 54 cases of pertussis, with median age 12 y, all corresponding to clinical case definition, were identified with an attack rate of 36%. Regarding confirmation of the diagnosis, out of all clinical cases, 18 were confirmed by laboratory testing (2 by isolation of B. pertussis and 16 serologically based on single sera) and 36 with epidemiological linkage only. Of all the students with pertussis, 35 (65%) had received 4 doses and 6 (11%) 3 doses of DTwP vaccine; 13 (24%) students had received fewer than 3 doses or were unvaccinated. The contributing factors in generating this outbreak were close epidemiological contacts, late identification of pertussis diagnosis in the primary, secondary and later cases, as well as a too late initiated active surveillance. In this outbreak, low vaccine effectiveness and low vaccination coverage also played an important role.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16126567”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;As well as rubella and measles&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;“In 1999, the Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan adopted the goal of measles elimination. This opportunity was used to launch a rubella and congenital rubella syndrome prevention program. Between January and August 2001, a rubella outbreak occurred in Bishkek City and Chui Oblast. Rubella surveillance data were reviewed for Kyrgyzstan (1981-2000) and rubella case-patient and laboratory information from Bishkek City and Chui Oblast during the outbreak. The data suggest that rubella is endemic in Kyrgyzstan with periodic epidemics every 3-5 years. From January to August 2001, 1936 rubella case-patients were reported from Bishkek City and Chui Oblast; 242 were tested and 176 (73%) were laboratory confirmed. Most case-patients were 3-14 years old. However, the incidence rate per 100,000 among persons aged 15-35 years increased &amp;gt;/=40-fold from 1 in 2000 to 41 in 2001. These findings highlight the importance of introducing rubella-containing vaccine in conjunction with measles elimination activities. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12721919”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The interesting aspect is how little decline in herd immunity it took for these diseases to become endemic in the these countries and the control was expensive and resource intensive in countries with little economic reserve.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Polio&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Polio was almost eradicated in Africa.  In the 2003, religious leaders in the Northern part of the country banned the polio vaccine under the idea that the vaccine was being used as a vector by the west to spread both HIV and sterility, specifically targeted against Muslims.  And you thought formaldehyde in the vaccine was bad. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831725/&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;“In northern Nigeria in 2003, the political and religious leaders of Kano, Zamfara, and Kaduna states brought the immunization campaign to a halt by calling on parents not to allow their children to be immunized. These leaders argued that the vaccine could be contaminated with anti-fertility agents (estradiol hormone), HIV, and cancerous agents.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Even though the ban lasted a mere 11 months, Nigeria saw a resurgence in polio.  Nigeria also served as a reservoir for disease that then spread to 15 other African countries. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5814a1.htm&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“After the 1988 World Health Assembly resolution to eradicate poliomyelitis globally,* the number of polio-endemic countries decreased from 125 in 1988 to six† (Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Niger, Nigeria, and Pakistan) in 2003 (1). However, during 2002–2005, a total of 21 previously polio-free countries§ were affected by importations of wild poliovirus (WPV) type 1 from the six remaining countries (primarily Nigeria) where WPV was endemic http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5506a1.htm”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Polio  has again come under control with vaccination, with case falling from  1,129 in 2006 to 285 in 2007. http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5841a3.htm&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;There damage, however, has been done and even though education programs have increased the utilization of the polio vaccine, there are still those who will not let their child have the vaccine due to fears of contamination with birth control.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-02-17-voa48-68672337.html&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;As a result, cases of wild type polio continue in Nigeria with 258 cases in 2009 http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_07_17/en/index.html.  Remember that most kids who get ill with the polio virus do not get polio, that is a complication of about 1% of the infections.  So 258 cases are the tip of an iceberg (will this metaphor die in the next 100 years?) of disease.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Most of the world uses the live polio vaccine as it gives better immunity.  The problem I that it is a live virus and, like any virus, likes to mutate when it multiplies.  If the immunity of the immunity to the virus is high in a population and the hosts are good, a live vaccine has no place to go.  However, if there are people whose immune function is compromised by poor nutrition or HIV and there are large numbers of unvaccinated people in the community, then odd things may happen.  Because of the perfect storm in Nigeria, the vaccine strain was able to perpetuate in a vulnerable community and now there is a mutated strain of polio vaccine that is causing disease in Nigeria.  The strain escaped and, thanks to a little evolution, changed to have increased virulence.  This would not have occurred it population had maintained their herd immunity&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;“The number of polio cases caused by the vaccine has doubled: 124 children have so far been paralyzed, compared to 62 in 2008, out of about 42 million children vaccinated.  There have been at least 7 outbreaks in Nigeria from the vaccine strain http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5836a3.htm.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;The point, and I cannot wait for some of the comments this little factoid will engender, is that vaccine work best when everyone participates, and as soon as compliance slips even a little, the replicative and mutational capacity of infections guarantees that they will evolve and escape into the wild.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;And even stranger things have happen http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11080491&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“The biological properties of poxvirus isolates from skin lesions on dairy cows and milkers during recent exanthem episodes in Cantagalo County, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were more like vaccinia virus (VV) than cowpox virus. PCR amplification of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene substantiated the isolate classification as an Old World orthopoxvirus, and alignment of the HA sequences with those of other orthopoxviruses indicated that all the isolates represented a single strain of VV, which we have designated Cantagalo virus (CTGV). HA sequences of the Brazilian smallpox vaccine strain (VV-IOC), used over 20 years ago, and CTGV showed 98.2% identity; phylogeny inference of CTGV, VV-IOC, and 12 VV strains placed VV-IOC and CTGV together in a distinct clade. Viral DNA restriction patterns and protein profiles showed a few differences between VV-IOC and CTGV. Together, the data suggested that CTGV may have derived from VV-IOC by persisting in an indigenous animal(s), accumulating polymorphisms, and now emerging in cattle and milkers as CTGV. CTGV may represent the first case of long-term persistence of vaccinia in the New World”&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Of course, the West doesn’t, yet, have a meltdown of the medical industrial complex nor do have religious leaders saying vaccines are designed to spread disease and sterility. Still, we have our problems with vaccines.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;H. influenzae:  there have been two mini outbreaks in the US, on in Minn. with five cases and one death and another in Philadelphia with 6 cases and 2 deaths.  In both outbreaks, the deaths were in unvaccinated children.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Measles has been on the upswing in Great Britain thanks to a decrease in vaccination&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“The national average in Great Britain is 84 percent, but in some areas of London the vaccination rate hovers at a dangerously low 65 percent. Areas with vaccination rates that are consistently below 80 percent run a high risk of an outbreak.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;There have been over 1200 cases in Britain with one death&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;and in the US&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;“During 2008, more measles cases were reported than in any other year since 1997. More than 90% of those infected had not been vaccinated, or their vaccination status was unknown. http://www.cdc.gov/measles/outbreaks.html”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;“The number of measles cases reported during January 1–July 31, 2008, is the highest year-to-date since 1996. This increase was not the result of a greater number of imported cases, but was the result of greater viral transmission after importation into the United States, leading to a greater number of importation-associated cases. These importation-associated cases have occurred largely among school-aged children who were eligible for vaccination but whose parents chose not to have them vaccinated.http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5733a1.htm”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Mumps is making a come back.  The index case acquired his disease in Great Britain (over 7900 cases) and brought it to the NE, another failure of homeland security.  Since  “ As of January 29, 2010, a total of 1,521 cases had been reported, with onset dates from June 28, 2009, through January 29, 2010, a substantial increase from the 179 cases reported as of October 30, 2009 (1). The outbreak has remained confined primarily to the tradition-observant Jewish community, with &amp;lt;3% of cases occurring among persons outside the community. The largest percentage of cases (61%) has occurred among persons aged 7–18 years, and 76% of the patients are male. Among the patients for whom vaccination status was reported, 88% had received at least 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine, and 75% had received 2 doses. This is the largest mumps outbreak that has occurred in the United States since 2006. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5905a1.htm”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;While letting vaccination rates is associated with increasing disease from vaccine preventable illnesses in part due to waning herd immunity, a recent study in Jama demonstrated the converse: increasing vaccination rates leads to decreased disease in unvaccinated populations.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;They vaccinated the children of 25 Hutterite communities with the influenza vaccine and the children of 24 communities with the hepatitis A vaccine and then looked at the rates of PCR proven influenza in those that did not get the vaccine.  In the influenza group, 39 (3.1%) of those who did not get the vaccine developed influenza while 80 (7.6%) of the unvaccinated in the hepatitis A vaccine groups developed influenza.  This  made the overall effectiveness of the vaccine in protecting those who did not get the vaccine, herd immunity, at 60%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;“Immunizing children and adolescents with inactivated influenza vaccine significantly protected unimmunized residents of rural communities against influenza.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20215608&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;So vaccines help.  They help those who get the vaccine and they can help those that do not or cannot get them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Unfortunately, fear of vaccines in increasing in the US http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-1962v1.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;“Our study indicates that a disturbingly high proportion of parents, &amp;gt; 1 in 5, continue to believe that some vaccines cause autism in otherwise healthy children”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;Despite now 15 studies that show no link between autism and vaccines, the unwarranted fear persists. Irrational fear, as Nigeria has demonstrated is hard to remove.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:1px;height:1px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:hidden"&gt;If I were convinced that vaccines were the cause of autism and I were to read the that fear of vaccines was up and vaccine use was down, I hope I would not gloat.  I would not be proud that my actions have lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality in children.  I would hope it would be a bittersweet, sad victory, since my success at burning down the vaccine house will take many children with it.  http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/tinderbox-us-vaccine-fears-up-700-in-7-years.html&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been, in the last 20 years, natural, or perhaps unnatural,  experiments that have helped shed light on the efficacy of vaccines.  Many societies, for reason of political unrest, religion, or a lack of understanding of science and medicine have seen the rates of vaccination decline and with that decline, an increase in the cases of vaccine preventable diseases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease spread in populations is not simple.  Hygiene, nutrition, access to health care, and education all play a role in the spread of communicable diseases.  Vaccines have been critical in driving the rates of vaccine preventable illnesses to almost zero, but they are not the only intervention in our armamentarium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Soviet Experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Soviet Union fell apart in the 1980’s, its medical system followed.  Some totalitarian states have been especially good at getting their populations vaccinated.  However, after the fall of Communism, the vaccination rates declined and the diseases they prevented surged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“.&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11236494"&gt;..Diphtheria morbidity in Moscow in 1958-1999 are presented&lt;/a&gt;. The last epidemic which started at the end of the 1980s and reached its peak in 1994, giving a 59-fold rise in morbidity in comparison with the pre-epidemic period, is characterized in detail. During the epidemic 12,267 persons fell ill, 454 of them died (mortality rate was 4%). Having started in Moscow, the epidemic gradually spread not only over the territory of Russia, but also over some other republics of the former Soviet Union (Ukraine, Belarus, etc.). Possible causes of this epidemic emergency are considered. The ever increasing share of adult population among persons affected by the epidemic (75%) is noted. The infection adults is characterized by severity of clinical manifestations and increased morbidity among adults, is shown. Under complicated social and economic conditions (crisis situation) the increase of groups of high risk which included unemployed adults of working age, retirees as well as socially non-adapted persons, was registered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10657222"&gt;The massive diphtheria epidemic in the former Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; provides important lessons for all diphtheria immunization programs: It is important to achieve a high level of childhood immunization, maintain immunity against diphtheria in older age groups, and use anti-epidemic measures, including immunization, to control epidemics in the early phase. The immunization coverage among children should be at least 90%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10657219"&gt;Failure to achieve high levels of immunity among children contributed to the epidemic of diphtheria that occurred in the Russian Federation&lt;/a&gt; during the 1990s. A major factor in this failure was the extensive list of contraindications to vaccination that was in use throughout the countries of the former Soviet Union. In 1980, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of the Soviet Union adopted an extensive list of contraindications for use of the diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-pertussis (DTP) vaccine. In 1994, the MOH of the Russian Federation revised the list of contraindications to vaccination to be largely in accord with World Health Organization recommendations. Since then, age-appropriate vaccination coverage has increased markedly: In 1996, DTP3 coverage among children 12 months of age had increased to 87% from 60% in 1990. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end the only way diphtheria came under control was by increasing vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar problems were seen with pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The aim of the current study was to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16126567"&gt;assess the epidemiological situation concerning the emergence of a pertussis outbreak, &lt;/a&gt;as well as potential contributing factors and vaccine effectiveness. A retrospective epidemiological description and an analysis of the outbreak among students were performed. The basic school in Adavere had a total of 150 students in 2003. Of these, 54 cases of pertussis, with median age 12 y, all corresponding to clinical case definition, were identified with an attack rate of 36%. Regarding confirmation of the diagnosis, out of all clinical cases, 18 were confirmed by laboratory testing (2 by isolation of B. pertussis and 16 serologically based on single sera) and 36 with epidemiological linkage only. Of all the students with pertussis, 35 (65%) had received 4 doses and 6 (11%) 3 doses of DTwP vaccine; 13 (24%) students had received fewer than 3 doses or were unvaccinated. The contributing factors in generating this outbreak were close epidemiological contacts, late identification of pertussis diagnosis in the primary, secondary and later cases, as well as a too late initiated active surveillance. In this outbreak, low vaccine effectiveness and low vaccination coverage also played an important role. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as rubella and measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12721919"&gt;The data suggest that rubella is endemic in Kyrgyzstan with periodic epidemics every 3-5 years&lt;/a&gt;. From January to August 2001, 1936 rubella case-patients were reported from Bishkek City and Chui Oblast; 242 were tested and 176 (73%) were laboratory confirmed. Most case-patients were 3-14 years old. However, the incidence rate per 100,000 among persons aged 15-35 years increased &amp;gt;/=40-fold from 1 in 2000 to 41 in 2001. These findings highlight the importance of introducing rubella-containing vaccine in conjunction with measles elimination activities. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the cause of the outbreaks was multi-factorial, it is interesting how rapidly these infections returned with only a small decline in herd immunity. The control of these diseases was expensive and resource intensive in countries with little economic reserve. These outbreaks represent a subset of the countries that were plagued by vaccine preventable infections after the disintegration of the USSR.  Pubmed (to my mind a verb like google) almost any of the states of the former USSR and you will find other examples of the outbreaks from the decline in the use of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polio was almost eradicated in Africa.  So close you almost wanted to close down the crutch factories.  Then, in the 2003, religious leaders in Northern Nigeria &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831725/"&gt;banned the polio vaccine&lt;/a&gt; under the belief that the vaccine was being used as a vector by the West to spread both HIV and sterility, specifically targeting Muslims.  And you thought formaldehyde in the vaccine was bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In northern Nigeria in 2003, the political and religious leaders of Kano, Zamfara, and Kaduna states brought the immunization campaign to a halt by calling on parents not to allow their children to be immunized. These leaders argued that the vaccine could be contaminated with anti-fertility agents (estradiol hormone), HIV, and cancerous agents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the ban lasted a mere 11 months, Nigeria saw a resurgence in polio.  Again, we remain at the edge of the infectious precipice and it takes only a tiny push to send people over the edge.    &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5814a1.htm"&gt;Nigeria also served as a reservoir for polio&lt;/a&gt; that subsequently spread to 15 other African countries and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the 1988 World Health Assembly resolution to eradicate poliomyelitis globally,  the number of polio-endemic countries decreased from 125 in 1988 to six (Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Niger, Nigeria, and Pakistan) in 2003 . However, during 2002–2005, &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5506a1.htm%E2%80%9D"&gt;a total of 21 previously polio-free countries were affected by importations of wild poliovirus (WPV) type 1 from the six remaining countries (primarily Nigeria)&lt;/a&gt; where WPV was endemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5841a3.htm"&gt;Polio is coming under control in Nigeria with increased vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, with case falling from 1,129 in 2006 to 285 in 2007. Remember that most children who get ill with the polio virus do not develop clinical polio,  a complication of about 1% of the infections.  So 258 cases represent the tip of the polio iceberg (will this metaphor die in the next 100 years? And if so, what will be the replacement be in a world without icebergs?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damage, however, has been done and even though education programs have increased the utilization of the polio vaccine, there are still &lt;a href="http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-02-17-voa48-68672337.html"&gt;those who will not let their child receive the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; due to fears of contamination with birth control. And this in a society without internet connections.  Fear is much more contagious than infection and harder to prevent or treat. As a result of ongoing fear of vaccines, cases of wild type polio continue in Northern Nigeria with&lt;a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_07_17/en/index.html"&gt; 258 cases in 2009&lt;/a&gt;, primarily in the Muslim community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the world uses the live-attenuated oral polio vaccine as it results in a better response.  The problem with live-attenuated viruses, like any virus, is it likes to mutate when it multiplies.  If the immunity to the virus is high in a population and the hosts are immunologically sound, a live vaccine has no place to go even if it mutates.  It requires non-immune hosts to perpetuate.  Herd immunity keeps any mutated strain at bay.  However, if there are populations whose immune function is compromised by poor nutrition or HIV and there are large numbers of unvaccinated people in the community, then odd things may happen. Vaccine strains can spread.  Because of the perfect storm in Nigeria, the vaccine strain was able to perpetuate in a vulnerable community and now there is a mutated strain of polio vaccine that is causing disease in Nigeria.  The vaccine strain escaped and, thanks to a little evolution, changed to have increased virulence.  This would have been much less likely to occur if the population had maintained their herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of polio cases caused by the vaccine has doubled: 124 children have so far been paralyzed, compared to 62 in 2008, out of about 42 million children vaccinated.  &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5836a3.htm."&gt;There have been at least 7 outbreaks in Nigeria from the vaccine strain&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point, and I cannot wait for some of the comments this little factoid will engender (not), is that vaccines work best when everyone participates, and as soon as compliance slips even a little, the replicative and mutational capacity of germs guarantees that they may evolve and escape into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/19738346"&gt;And even stranger things have happened&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biological properties of poxvirus isolates from skin lesions on dairy cows and milkers during recent exanthem episodes in Cantagalo County, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were more like vaccinia virus (VV) than cowpox virus.

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the West does not, yet, have a meltdown of the medical-industrial complex nor do we have religious leaders saying vaccines are designed to spread disease and sterility.  Our vaccines cause autism. Hah. Take that Nigeria. Still, we have our own problems with declining vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US  and Great Britain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H. influenzae is killing again.  There have been two mini-outbreaks in the US, one in Minnesota, with five cases and one death and another in Philadelphia, with 6 cases and 2 deaths.  In both outbreaks, the deaths were in unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles has been on the upswing in Great Britain, in large part to a decrease in vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The national average (of MMR) in Great Britain is 84 percent, but in some areas of London the vaccination rate hovers at a dangerously low 65 percent. Areas with vaccination rates that are consistently below 80 percent run a high risk of an outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been over measles 1200 cases in Britain with one death.  At work one of the social workers has been collecting a three word sentence from everyone  that would be your legacy, three words you would want to be remembered by.  I chose “Left them laughing.”  Dr Wakefields may be “Let measles return.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is back in the US as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/measles/outbreaks.html%E2%80%9D"&gt;During 2008, more measles cases were reported than in any other year since 1997&lt;/a&gt;. More than 90% of those infected had not been vaccinated, or their vaccination status was unknown. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5733a1.htm"&gt;The number of measles cases reported during January 1–July 31, 2008, is the highest year-to-date since 1996&lt;/a&gt;. This increase was not the result of a greater number of imported cases, but was the result of greater viral transmission after importation into the United States, leading to a greater number of importation-associated cases. These importation-associated cases have occurred largely among school-aged children who were eligible for vaccination but whose parents chose not to have them vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mumps is also making a comeback in the US.  The index case acquired his disease in Great Britain (over 7900 cases) and brought it to the NE, another failure of homeland security.  Since&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5905a1.htm"&gt;January 29, 2010, a total of 1,521 cases had been reported&lt;/a&gt;, with onset dates from June 28, 2009, through January 29, 2010, a substantial increase from the 179 cases reported as of October 30, 2009 (1). The outbreak has remained confined primarily to the tradition-observant Jewish community, with &amp;lt;3% of cases occurring among persons outside the community.

This is the largest mumps outbreak that has occurred in the United States since 2006.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting vaccination rates decine is associated with increasing disease from vaccine preventable illnesses in part due to a decline in herd immunity.  A recent &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20215608"&gt;study in Jama&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated the converse: increasing vaccination rates leads to decreased disease in unvaccinated populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They vaccinated the children of 25 Hutterite colonies with the influenza vaccine and the children of  another 24 colonies with the hepatitis A vaccine and then looked at the rates of PCR proven influenza in those that did not get the vaccine.  In the influenza group, 39 (3.1%) of those who did not get the vaccine developed influenza while 80 (7.6%) of the unvaccinated in the hepatitis A vaccine groups developed influenza.  This  suggested the overall effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in protecting those who did not get the vaccine, herd immunity, at 60%.  Herd immunity, it seems works. And do let Dr. Jefferson know that the rates of influenza in the influenza colonies was  about half that of the hepatitis A vaccinated colonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Immunizing children and adolescents with inactivated influenza vaccine significantly protected unimmunized residents of rural communities against influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So vaccines work.  They prevent disease in those who get the vaccine and they can prevent disease those that do not or can not get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-1962v1"&gt;fear of vaccines is increasing in the US&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study indicates that a disturbingly high proportion of parents, &amp;gt; 1 in 5, continue to believe that some vaccines cause autism in otherwise healthy children”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite at least 15 studies that show no link between autism and vaccines (except the recent study from Poland that suggested the MMR may protect against autism), the unwarranted fear persists. Irrational fear, as Nigeria has demonstrated, is hard to remove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were convinced that vaccines, despite all the evidence to the contrary,  were the cause of autism or other disease s, and I were to read the that fear of vaccines was up and vaccine use was down, I hope &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/tinderbox-us-vaccine-fears-up-700-in-7-years.html"&gt; I would not gloat&lt;/a&gt;.  In medicine I am used to bad outcomes occurring as a consequence of what I know to be the correct course of action.  No good deed ever goes unpunished in health care.  I would not be proud that my actions have lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality in children.  I would hope it would be a bittersweet, sad victory, since my success at burning down the vaccine house will take many children with it.  If vaccine rates fall further, some may have the legacy of “Helped plagues return.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the British magazine &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt; carried &lt;a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/04/religion-religious-lewis"&gt;a thought-provoking review by A C Grayling &lt;/a&gt;of David Lewis-Williams’ new book &lt;em&gt;Conceiving God: The Cognitive Origin and Evolution of Religion&lt;/em&gt;. Lewis-Williams is an anthropologist who specialises in cave and rock art (in particular from South Africa). He has written two brilliant and highly-recommended popular books on prehistoric cave art, the &lt;em&gt;Mind in the Cave: Consciousness and the Origins of Art&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Inside the Neolithic Mind&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his new book (which I haven’t read), Lewis-Williams casts his anthropologist’s eye over the origins and continued existence of religion, and the reasons for it. He also kindly quotes a letter Jerry and I wrote to &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, protesting about their coverage of the Templeton Foundation. I hope that Jerry – or myself, or Greg – will have the time to write our own review here at WEIT, but for the moment Grayling’s review will more than suffice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are direct arguments against religious beliefs likely to dissuade their votaries? The anecdotal evidence seems to suggest not; robust attacks by Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, it is said, only annoy the faithful and make them dig further in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not so sure about this. In my experience, waverers and Sunday-only observers can find forthright challenges to religious pretensions a relief and a liberation. They give them the reason, sometimes the courage, to abandon those shreds of early-acquired religious habit that cling around their ankles and trip them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Darwin and David Lewis-Williams have a point in thinking, as the former put it, that “direct arguments against [religion] produce hardly any effect on the public, and freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men’s minds which follows from the advance of science”. In the preface to this book, Lewis-Williams says that he intends to follow Darwin’s strategy, seeking to achieve by flanking manoeuvres what Dawkins and Hitchens attempt by cavalry charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually Lewis-Williams does both. There is quite a lot of galloping straight at the opposition with flashing sabre. But the main thrust of the book is incremental: a well-informed and steady march through the history of religion and its conflict with science, reprising what the author describes as the evolution of his own thought about these matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the years I pondered the long history of religion. In particular, I thought about the implications of the earliest archaeological evidence for religion . . . I found it salutary to explore social (cultural) anthropology . . . As we look over this sorry tapestry, we must face a fundamental question – one that many today, believers and non-believers alike, try to avoid: Is there really a spirit realm occupied by supernatural beings and forces that are concerned with human life on earth? By contemplating the history of religion and science we are able to answer that question in a way that gradually leads to “freedom of thought”.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to do so is all the more urgent, the author notes, because the great dividing line in the world today is between opponents defined by religious commitment or tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis-Williams is a highly distinguished archaeologist and palaeoanthropologist who has written some of the definitive works on ancient cave art, in particular the rock art of the San (Bushman) people of his native South Africa. He wrote the classic Believing and Seeing: Symbolic Meaning in Southern San Rock Paintings (1981), whose ideas animate his account of Stone Age religion and the nature of religious belief and experience in three chapters of this book. His descriptions and interpretations are fascinating, though highly speculative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Lewis-Williams’s expertise in Stone Age art is one plank for the argument of the book, the other is the adventure of thought in the epochs that have elapsed since classical antiquity. He traces the development of both religious and scientific thinking from ancient Greece to the 19th century – from Plato to Darwin – which includes the establishment, from Constantine onwards, of religious orthodoxy against all comers (“heretics” and pagans alike). It is an instructive review; it leads Lewis-Williams to remind us that large sections of official Christianity now merely shrug their shoulders over the question of the position of Planet Earth in the universe, a matter on which they were once prepared to kill people for taking the wrong view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historical chapters constitute a lucid survey of the background, from which certain patterns can be deduced that Lewis-Williams explores in chapters on religious experience, belief and origins. Together, these suggest an analysis of the nature of religion itself. They are the most original parts of his discussion. He summarises the conclusion he arrives at as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Religion is one possible explanation, not for natural phenomena, but for highly complex experiences that the human brain generates. It does so in such a way that a whole range of further explanations (for natural events, death and so forth) becomes available. Moreover, religion makes possible powerful social and political hierarchies not based on sex or brute strength. The persistence of the neurology of the brain through time ensures that the “origin” of religion is always with us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last remark explains what he means by the phrase “origin-as-process”, and his reason for thinking that the stock analysis of earlier anthropology – that religion evolves from animism through totemism to polytheism and thence monotheism – is incorrect. He has an interesting point here. Polytheism persists in both actual and disguised forms: actual in the Hindu pantheon; disguised in the “Trinity” or in any religion, including Islam and Judaism, that admits the existence of angels and demons (and, in the former at least, a populated afterlife) along with the deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis-Williams does not leave matters at the level of analysis. In a long and thoughtful concluding chapter entitled “God’s Empire Strikes Back”, he considers the current tensions and conflicts generated by the revived debate about religion. He concludes that there is no future in attempting reconciliation between theistic and non-theistic world-views, and that our hope must be that Darwin will be proved right eventually, that science will finally cut the taproot of religion. He ends by quoting Matthew Cobb and Jerry Coyne: “In reality, the only contribution that science can make to the ideas of religion is atheism.” That is surely right, and it serves as the guiding principle of Lewis-Williams’s endeavours in these rich and educative pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, accordingly, a great deal to applaud in this book. One aspect of it left me intrigued, however: the chapter on Stone Age religion, describing and offering interpretations of cave paintings from tens of thousands of years ago, long before the dawn of history. Did our remotest ancestors really distinguish between natural and supernatural realms? Or did they regard the significant agencies that controlled nature as part of nature, and such that they could be encountered and communicated with, just like any other part of nature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis-Williams thinks that cave walls were viewed as the sacred interface between human beings and chthonic forces. Can we really know? Perhaps he can appeal to the continuity of brain structure and function to suggest that religious experience is likewise continuous. However, he is careful enough to talk often of “maybe” and “perhaps”; and to an amateur being offered the explanation, it is the tentativeness that sounds most persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The particular interest of this course was that it was being run at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, the vice-chancellor  which was Michael Pittilo, until his recent premature death. Pittilo is the person who recommended to the government that herbalists and Chinese medicine practitioners should get honours degrees and be regulated like doctors.  His report, was, in my opinions, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235"&gt;disastrously bad&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It recently emerged that this, very bad, advice would not be accepted by the Department of Health (DH), so the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2329"&gt;campaign against the Pittilo proposals&lt;/a&gt;, on this blog and elsewhere was successful. The alternative DH proposals &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235"&gt;look pretty silly&lt;/a&gt;, but we won’t really know until after the election exactly what will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Gordon University (RGU): is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Universities"&gt;‘post-1992′ university&lt;/a&gt; in Aberdeen, as opposed the the &lt;a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/"&gt;University of Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt; (where my son is at the moment). Much of RGU does an excellent job, but like so many post-1992 universities they harm themselves by running courses in barmy alternative medicine. RGU ran an &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/rgo-homeopathy-page-090410.pdf"&gt;Introduction To Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; module (saved 9 April 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2009, I asked RGU to see some samples of the teaching materials on this module, partly as part of the campaign against Pittilo’s proposals. I asked to see the powerpoints and handouts for three lectures, (1) evidence for homeopathy, (2) first aid remedies, and (3) allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2009, this request, made under the Freedom of Information Act (Scotland),&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2747"&gt; was, as always, rejected&lt;/a&gt; by RGU, though they did tell me that the evidence lecture had been produced by a lecturer from The Faculty of Homeopathy and the other two had been produced by a local GP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as usual, I asked for the mandatory internal review of the decision. In October, the review upheld the original decision, as they almost always do. I referred the decision to the Scottish Information Commissioner (the law is slightly different in Scotland) and they have still not responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on 8 April 2010 I got a letter from RGU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The above course  requested is no longer part of the School of Nursing and Midwifery’s provision, and it was cessated [sic] in Semester One 2009/10.  This followed a formal review of all Nursing and Midwifery modules and their viability.  In the light of this the university has decided to release the information.”
	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yet another university has done the sensible thing.  The course has been shut.  Just for the record, I’ll reproduce a few of the slides from the lecture on “homeopathic remedies for allergies”.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergies can be dangerous, and occasionally lethal.  To treat them with homeopathic pills, medicines that contain no medicine, is not just delusion, but a dangerous  delusion which risks the lives of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;remedies&amp;quot; include nettles, sulphur, petroleum and arsenic.  They’d be pretty scary but in fact the pills contain, in most cases, not a jot of nettle, sulphur, petroleum or arsenic.  Homeopathic  pharmacies stock thousands of bottles of &lt;em&gt;identical&lt;/em&gt; sugar pills, each with a different label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Homeopathyinallergy2002-5s.jpg" alt="slide 5" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Homeopathyinallergy2002-9s.jpg" alt="slide 9" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These dangerous delusions were being taught as fact in a UK university.  The shame of it..&lt;/p&gt;

(it really does look like this)

Unfortunately, once the weather is warm for a few days, it looks like this.

(Sci's car this morning, only it was worse than that.  RUN FOR YOUR LIVES.)

As you might be able to imagine, this sort of thing means that the sneezing rate in the south has a remarkable uptick in the spring (though there's no data on this, and compared to fall and summer allergies and winter colds, Sci might indeed just be spouting off lies right now).  

But did you know that there are some people who will sneeze on a bright, sunny day, regardless of the pollen count?  Did you know WHY?!

 Langer et al. "When the Sun Prickles Your Nose: An EEG Study Identifying Neural Bases of Photic Sneezing" PLoS ONE, 2010.

And the best part of this study, what do you CALL the "photic sneeze reflex"?

ACHOO (Autosomal Cholinergic Helio-Ophtalmologic Outburst) syndrome.  Some grad students who came up with this were probably giggling hysterically over their beers for this one.

(Sci would like to note that she sneezed no less than about 5 times during this write-up, though probably not due to sunlight) Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

James Carrion, the International Director for the Mutual Unidentified Flying Object Network (MUFON) has resigned from his position. &lt;a href="http://followthemagicthread.blogspot.com/2010/04/goodbye-ufology-hello-truth.html"&gt;But he didn’t go without explaining himself&lt;/a&gt;. And here’s where it gets very interesting. Carrion essentially denounces the entire “scientific” field of UFOlogy, which plays a central role in the alien visitation believing movement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That in a nutshell is the sad state of Ufology  today, humans deceiving&lt;br&gt;
humans. If there is a real phenomenon, I  have yet to see any evidence of&lt;br&gt;
it that would stand under scientific  scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d asked me to guess who said this quote yesterday I might have said Michael Shermer or Phil Plait. But no, this came from one of the leaders of the UFO/alien visitation community! That is fuckin’ unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I discovered was that the phenomenon is based in deception – of the  human kind –and that there is no way ANYONE will understand the real  truth unless they are willing to first accept that. No, I am not talking  about some grandiose cover-up of alien visitation, but instead the  documented manipulation of people and information for purposes that I  can only speculate on. How do I unequivocally know this to be true? Well  let me lay it out for you in laymen’s terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are easily  manipulated because we are all subject to the psychological pressures of  ego, biased beliefs and tunnel vision. For example, those that KNOW  that earth is being visited by aliens have blinders on and no amount of  alternative explanation will convince them otherwise. They are the die  hard in the wool believers for whom Ufology serves as a religion to  confirm their beliefs that they take on faith. On the other end of the  spectrum are the debunkers who must counter every claim with a reason  why it can’t be so, without bothering to examine the data or lift a  finger in conducting original research of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa! Wait a  minute, what about those who don’t take things on faith and actually  collect data and conduct investigation? Good question. I decided to  examine the data collection and investigative practices in Ufology, and  after poring over thousands of historical case files from MUFON, NICAP  and APRO investigators in the MUFON archives, what I found, was  inconsistent investigation with a total lack of evidentiary standards. I  also found a paper trail of disinformation and misinformation that has  kept Ufology in check through infighting and red herrings, rabbit holes  and elaborate deception operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to give Carrion a lot of credit for overcoming what I can only imagine was extraordinary cognitive dissonance. To have devoted all that time to this community, so much so that you were among its leaders, and then take a real critical look at it and essentially denounce. That takes a lot of courage. It also takes a lot of courage because he’ll no doubt be receiving lots of vitriolic hate mail from people within the movement he’s forsaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations James. You’re one of us now.&lt;/p&gt;

Novella is a major reason I call myself a skeptic today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been an outspoken atheist for some time but it’s only been about three years that I’ve even known about the skeptical movement. It was the autumn 2007 that I first discovered James Randi. Randi was being interviewed by an internet atheist radio show I listened to and on their website, they’d linked to some videos of Randi on YouTube. One of those videos was a lecture Randi gave to Yale University years ago. It was the standard Randi lecture but it was the first time I’d seen it. And at the time I was still a bit of a believer in a number of classic paranormal claims but was already sort of realizing that there wasn’t much to them. Randi’s Yale lecture pushed me one small step closer to renouncing my woo woo beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around that same time I discovered YouTube videos of Michael Shermer, editor of &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; Magazine. And I found myself liking a lot of what he had to say. And by the time, later that fall, I caught Shermer debating the evidence for alien visitation on The Larry King Show, I’d already moved to a position where I completely agreed with Shermer that the evidence just wasn’t there. Shermer’s opponents in that debate were Stanton Friedman and Buzz Aldrin, both long-time heroes of mine. It was during that debate though that I realized my hero Stanton Friedman was a complete nut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mohitmalhan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/science_religion_070703_ms.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://mohitmalhan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/science_religion_070703_ms.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="183"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The one issue that I did take issue with Shermer on though was that in many of the videos I’d caught of him on YouTube, he rejected the label “atheist” and embraced the label “agnostic.” Then on November 15, 2007 I attended an atheist event where several famous faces were in attendance, one of whom was Michael Shermer. I briefly talked to him about the current Uri Geller television show at the time that also featured skeptical magician Criss Angel. I wanted to ask him about the “atheist” label issue but didn’t get around to it. But when I heard him use the label himself later that night my concerns were alleviated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was leaving that night I saw several fliers for other upcoming events and one of them was a Saturday afternoon lecture hosted by a group calling itself the New York City Skeptics. The speaker was someone I’d never heard of by the name of Steven Novella. It sounded interesting enough and so I attended. And I was so impressed by Dr. Novella’s lecture that when he mentioned that he hosted a podcast, I decided to check it out. And today, it’s my favorite podcast. I also now write for the New York City Skeptic’s official blog, the Gotham Skeptic. But since that lecture, Novella and the other skeptical rogues on the podcast have become my biggest skeptical influences and were the biggest reason I’m part of this movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2010/04/05/science-and-religion-again/"&gt;But as Steven Novella reminded me this week&lt;/a&gt;, there is at least one issue we do not see eye to eye on, and that’s whether science and religion can coexist peacefully. While he identifies as an “agnostic” and feels science is agnostic  toward the untestable claims of religion, I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I have with this position is that just about every issue  skeptics address is unfalsifiable. Maybe our primitive science just  can’t detect the water memory of homeopathy and anyone testing the  efficacy of homeopathy is sending out negative vibrations that screw up  the tests. Maybe vaccines really do cause autism but all the data to the  contrary has just been faked by an omnipotent evil conspiratorial force  that will stop at nothing to poison us with toxins in the vaccines.  Sooner or later, every form of pseudoscience, denialism, and paranormal  claims moves its goalpost outside the bounds of falsifiability. And yet  we never seem to have this conversation when it comes to homeopathy or  ghosts or vaccines. But some skeptics seem to feel they need to apply  special pleading to religion because it’s religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few people seriously argue the “hard atheist” position that we know  with certainty that no gods exist. The principle argument is that  there’s no evidence to believe that one exists and the burden of proof  lies with those claiming otherwise. And it’s because the burden of proof  is on the believer, that once they introduce an unfalsifiable position, they  fail to meet the burden of proof and thus automatically lose the  debate. This is true whether we’re talking about homeopathy or religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for all intents and purposes one can reasonably conclude that  gods almost certainly don’t exist. It seems that some don’t want to put  their nickel down on a position and risk the minute possibility that  they could be wrong. But I have no problem being wrong. I’ve been wrong  before and I’ll be wrong again. And if one day new evidence is presented  that proves a god does exist I’ll gladly admit that I’m wrong. But  until then I have not been sufficiently persuaded that I am wrong. Take  the Bible. The very first verse of the book is objectively and  scientifically wrong by many orders of magnitude. And it only gets worse  from there. It’s scary to me that in another universe we might all be  having this same insane discussion over whether science can conclusively  dismiss &lt;em&gt;The Cat In The Hat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point it’s unreasonable to keep a case open. If Judge  Ito was an agnostic, the OJ case would still be running because maybe  one day new evidence would drop from the sky. No, make a bloody  decision, at least provisionally, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to be fair to Steven Novella’s position, he does address the unfalsifiable claims of pseudosciences like homeopathy. However, I don’t happen to find his answer particularly satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel that once the true believer makes it a faith argument  that the skeptic just has to take it on the chin and has to concede that  they can’t disprove it. There are certain ideas that are simply too  idiotic to even entertain in intellectual discourse and that line in the  sand is falsifiability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfalsifiable claims about reality have no place in intellectual  discourse and are cause an immediate disqualification from the realm of  science. The believer hasn’t met their burden of proof so they’re done.  Case dismissed. We can proceed to mock them. What you don’t do is keep a  case open indefinitely just in case new evidence one day comes to  light. It’s about practicality. If a claim can’t be demonstrated or  doesn’t say anything useful about our reality, why am I paying lip  service to it? It’s utterly useless. It’s garbage. And I have no problem  being honest enough to tell the believer this, especially since it’s  proven far more persuasive than being coy and overly agreeable. And at  least they’ll know that I respect them enough to be honest with them  instead of treating them like fragile children. And sure there are  skeptics who believe in some god or another. There are skeptics who  believe in ghosts too. They’re simply wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

Those who questioned the sensibility of vaccines for fighting the flu were attacked as &amp;quot;baby killers&amp;quot; for not kow-towing to the vaccine mythology that drives Big Pharma&amp;#39;s profits to record profits nearly every flu season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Care to guess what the study found? In short, it found that &lt;strong&gt;people who received the seasonal flu vaccine shot in 2008 were up to 274% more likely to be infected by H1N1 swine flu than those who skipped the season flu shots&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Bold in original.]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that the CDC recommended getting both the seasonal and H1N1 vaccines.  Also note that 274% figure that Adams quotes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What did this study do, and what does it say?  The study is titled &lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000259"&gt;Does Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Increase the Risk of Illness with the 2009 A/H1N1 Pandemic Virus?&lt;/a&gt;  First, you’ll note it starts “Does..” and ends with a question mark.  Compare that with Adams’s “…vaccines increase risk…” and no question about it.  Adams seems to be a lot more sure than the people who published the actual study.  What did they do in this study?  Well, they took patients who presented with influenza-like illness at  a network of Canadian doctors, and tested them for H1N1 and seasonal influenza.  They also determined if the patients had been vaccinated against the seasonal flu.  They used this information to compare vaccination status among influenza-positive (both seasonal and H1N1) patients with influenza-negative controls.  What did they find?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;… receipt of [the seasonal flu vaccine] in the previous season (autumn 2008) appeared to &lt;strong&gt;increase the risk of pH1N1 illness by 1.03- to 2.74-fold&lt;/strong&gt;, even after adjustment for comorbidities, age, and geography &lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000259#pmed.1000259-Skowronski1"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. The investigators were prudent and conducted multiple sensitivity analyses to attempt to explain their perplexing findings. Importantly, &lt;strong&gt;[the seasonal flu vaccine] remained protective against seasonal influenza viruses circulating in April through May 2009, with an effectiveness estimated at 56%&lt;/strong&gt; (41%–67%)  [My bold.]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note, they reported that the increased risk was 1.03 to 2.74 fold. Now, I suppose Adams is technically correct in saying the increased risk was “up to 274%” as high, since the phrase “up to” includes the figure zero.  Technically correct, but intellectually dishonest.  (I guess &amp;quot;more than 1.03 times the risk&amp;quot; wouldn&amp;#39;t have sounded so scary.)  Also, note that the seasonal vaccine was 56% effective against the seasonal flu – a tidbit that Adams somehow managed to overlook.  More importantly, note that the study did not show the merits of getting both a seasonal flu shot as well as an H1N1 pandemic flu shot (compared with no vaccine at all) as Adams himself admits was the CDC’s recommendation.  (Presumably they didn’t do this because the H1N1 vaccine wasn’t widely available at the time.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, this did seem (as far as I can tell) to be a decent study, and its results certainly warrant further investigation into this phenomenon.  Does this study prove that the seasonal flu vaccine increases the risk of getting H1N1, as Adams thinks?  Well, not really.  From the report, again:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the uncertainty associated with observational studies, we believe it would be premature to conclude that TIV increased the risk of 2009 pandemic illness, especially in light of &lt;strong&gt;six other contemporaneous observational studies in civilian populations that have produced highly conflicting results&lt;/strong&gt; (see Table 1 for details on study design, population sampled, and results) [10]–[15]. We note the large spread of vaccine effectiveness estimates in those studies; indeed, &lt;strong&gt;four of the studies set in the US and Australia did not show any association [12]–[15], whereas two Mexican studies suggested a protective effect of 35%–73%&lt;/strong&gt; [10],[11]. The most recent Canadian study in this issue of PLoS Medicine [4] is clearly at odds with these results, with an estimated average negative effectiveness of −68% based on their Sentinel system. Only one study, set in the US military population, potentially corroborated the findings of the Canadian study [16].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[My bold.]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So there are numerous other studies, many of which show no difference, and two that actually show the seasonal vaccine &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; the risk of getting H1N1. Nothing wrong with that – real world studies are not always as clear cut as we would like, which is why science requires replication, especially where the results are hard to explain or surprising, based on current knowledge.  Strange that Adams didn’t notice that bit, though.  Well, it did come nearer the end of the paper - perhaps Adams got so excited by the first part that he didn’t finish reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize Adam’s technique, he:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Cherry picks a study that has results he likes, and ignores at least six other studies (that were even reported in the actual paper he cited) that report different results&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Exaggerates the risk - “1.03 to to 2.74” increased risk becomes “up to 274%”&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Ignores the fact that the seasonal vaccine is 56% effective against seasonal flu anyway&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Ignores the fact that the CDC recommendation is to get &lt;em&gt;both the seasonal and the H1N1 vaccine&lt;/em&gt; – something that was not covered by this study.  (And presumably the H1N1 will be included in next season’s seasonal fu vaccine.)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Jumps from all of this to state that therefore “vaccines are a medical scam, folks! A Big Pharma hoax,” and that the real solution to protect you against the flu is vitamin D.  Seriously. &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Adams will quote a scientific study if it supports his point of view (even if it doesn’t, really), but then he rails against the rest of science that doesn’t.  That’s what makes him a crank.  The truth is, this is an interesting but inconclusive study that should probably be investigated further.  Possibly there is some reason that the seasonal vaccine could make people more susceptible to the H1N1 virus.  If so, real scientists would like to find out what it is - although it is almost certainly not that the flu vaccine &amp;quot;weakens the immune system&amp;quot; as Adams claims, but some other reason.  More likely (given the numerous confounding studies), there is no real effect here.  Either way, it will be real scientists doing real science, not cranks like Mike Adams, who will come up with the actual answer.  And you are almost certainly going to be better off getting both seasonal &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; H1N1 vaccines, than getting neither.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1986, Deborah Rabinowitz identified seven forms of rarity, where rarity could mean several things depending on range size, habitat specificity and population sizes. When considering rarity, it often feels intuitive to look for environmental causes for these different forms of rarity. Habitat alteration is an obvious environmental change that affects abundance and distribution, but are rare species generally limited by habitat or resource availability? The alternative cause of rarity could just be that sufficient habitat exists, but that the rare species is simply unable to find or disperse to other sites. An extreme example of this would be the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Hole_pupfish"&gt;Devil's Hole pupfish&lt;/a&gt; which exists at only a single pool. It can survive elsewhere (such as in artificial tanks) but natural dispersal is impossible as its pool is in a desert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_3pWCVt_KnR4/S76L2ToOOtI/AAAAAAAAAaY/TjEvilWGmz8/s1600/Picture+9.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:280px;height:320px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_3pWCVt_KnR4/S76L2ToOOtI/AAAAAAAAAaY/TjEvilWGmz8/s320/Picture+9.png" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Photo taken by Kristian Peters and available through GNU free documentation license&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a recent paper by &lt;a href="http://www.bio.uni-potsdam.de/professuren/biodiversitaet-botanik/personen/birgit-seifert"&gt;Birgit Seifert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.botany.unibe.ch/planteco/index.php"&gt;Markus Fischer&lt;/a&gt; in Biological Conservation, they examine whether an endangered plant, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Armeria maritima&lt;/span&gt; subsp. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;elongata&lt;/span&gt;, was limited because of a lack of habitats or if it was dispersal limited. They collected seeds from eight populations and experimentally added these seeds to their original populations and to uninhabited, but apparently appropriate sites. They found that seeds germinated equally well in inhabited and uninhabited sites and seedlings had similar survivorships. They found that variation in germination rates were likely caused by originating population size and that low genetic diversity and inbreeding reduce viability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These results reinforce two things. First is that conserving species may only require specific activities, such as collect and distributing seeds. Here ideas like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_migration"&gt;assisted migration&lt;/a&gt; seem like valuable conservation strategies. Secondly, we really need to be doing these simple experiments to better understand why species are rare. If we fail to understand the causes of rarity, we may be wasting valuable resources when try to protect rare species.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Biological+Conservation&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2Fj.biocon.2010.02.028&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Experimental+establishment+of+a+declining+dry-grassland+flagship+species+in+relation+to+seed+origin+and+target+environment&amp;amp;rft.issn=00063207&amp;amp;rft.date=2010&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=&amp;amp;rft.epage=&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0006320710000698&amp;amp;rft.au=Seifert%2C+B.&amp;amp;rft.au=Fischer%2C+M.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CEcology%2C+Evolutionary+Biology%2C+Botany%2C+Zoology"&gt;Seifert, B., &amp;amp; Fischer, M.

Among his honors, Schoenherr earned a Caldecott Award for his paintings for the book &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl_Moon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Owl Moon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His dark, textured artwork did justice to all manner of life, from a Canada goose to a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/06/20/john-hodgman-i-hear-theyre-going-to-make-evolution-legal/"&gt;giant sandworm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Jack when I was just ten years old, through his son &lt;a href="http://www.ianschoenherr.com/"&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt;. He was not the typical father of your fifth-grade friends. He got up not long before noon, sat for a while at the kitchen table with some coffee, making a few  jokes, and then headed to his barn, where he would paint till midnight or later. His barn was filled with dismantled MG’s, Japanese swords, a complete collection of &lt;em&gt;National Geographics&lt;/em&gt;, snapping tortoise shells, camera equipment, years’ worth of paintings, and an atmosphere suffused with good cheer. We kids were always welcome, whether we wanted to ask questions about the latest painting on his easel, or if we just wanted to wander along his rough bookshelves and be alone in his company. I learned some of my most important early lessons about nature from Jack, and I also learned from him what it’s like to love the act of creation, day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/04/jackbear.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="jackbear" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/04/jackbear.jpg" alt="jackbear" width="220" height="217"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The kids in the studio eventually grew up, but kept coming back. His son Ian became a fine artist and children’s book illustrator in his own right. I’m sure that much of my interest in natural history stems from my time in that barn, too. When I got older, I was proud to come back there, where Jack was still painting, his beard gray now, his shoulders stooped, and tell him about my own encounters with walking whales and enchanting flatworms. Everyone always joked that Jack was a great bear. It wasn’t just his ursine cast that earned him that name; it was also his  combination of grouchiness and loyalty. Bears are also strong, and over the past few years Jack showed amazing strength as well, as he struggled with his failing health. Now the Great Bear of &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;q=locktown+new+jersey&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ei=f5i-S4bFH6iGiAO-5eymDA&amp;amp;ved=0CBMQpQY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;view=map&amp;amp;geocode=FQfBaQIdwg6I-w&amp;amp;split=0&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Locktown,+New+Jersey&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;iwloc=A"&gt;Locktown&lt;/a&gt; has left us, but we will not forget him.&lt;/p&gt;

And we achieved that goal. The book is superb. Every chapter is fantastic, some more than others, but all are great. It doesn't cover every subject it could have, but the subjects it does cover, it covers thoroughly, leaving nowhere left to run. It's all readable (nothing will be above anyone's head). Much of it will even be fresh and new to you (and that's saying something). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of all, taken together, its fifteen chapters are sufficient to establish that Christianity is a delusion. The Christian religion is so manifestly contrary to the facts, belief in it can only be held with the most delusional gerrymandering imaginable. That's a bold statement. I wouldn't have made it myself before reading this book, but now that I have seen it all in one place, I am forced to agree.&lt;/blockquote&gt;To read his whole review &lt;a href="http://richardcarrier.blogspot.com/2010/04/christian-delusion.html"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3426125182950645640?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It’s sort of a low brow version of Andrew Marvell’s &lt;em&gt;To his coy mistress&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of Time’s wingéd chariot, we should do what mammals do on the Discovery Channel. Except, humans don’t. They do something &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt;. Think about it. We aren’t dogs, monkeys, dolphins or bowerbirds, we’re &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt;. We are a &lt;em&gt;species&lt;/em&gt; (which, as I keep reminding folk, is the noun of “special”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when Phillip Johnson, the father of the modern intelligent design movement, &lt;a href="http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=23-02-009-c" rel="external "&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt; Christopher Hitchens for calling “great men” “mammals”, and points out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Hitchens never refers to the authorities on his side as “mammals,” reserving that category for those whom he wishes to belittle, it will not escape the reader that if “great men” are only mammals, then so are scientists, including the esteemed Charles Darwin and the not-quite-so-esteemed Richard Dawkins, and so, of course, is Hitchens himself. Which raises the question: Why should we take seriously any speculation by a mere mammal, or even the consensus of mammal opinion, about the origin of its species, no matter how much evidence the mammals imagine themselves to have gathered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… we might be inclined to agree. If we’re just mammals, then we shouldn’t pay attention to Hitchens or Dawkins or Darwin, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call this Darwin’s Monkey Mind Puzzle. Darwin wrote near the end of his life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then with me the horrid doubt always arises whether the convictions of man’s mind, which has been developed from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value or at all trustworthy. Would any one trust in the convictions of a monkey’s mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind? [Letter to William Graham, 1881]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is recently the argument presented by Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga against evolutionary theory - it’s self defeating. If evolution is true, then we have no warrant for thinking that evolution is true, ergo Augustine is right. Or something. I would like to discuss this a little, reprising some arguments Paul Griffiths and I have presented in a forthcoming paper. &lt;a href="http://evolvingthoughts.net/2010/04/07/you-and-me-baby-aint-nothing-but-mammals/" rel="external "&gt;On my blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The ubiquitous fast food mascot, or “Chief Happiness Consultant”, has been around since 1963, marketing happy meals, milkshakes, and chicken nuggets to kids. But &lt;a href="http://retireronald.org/press/index"&gt;RetireRonald.org&lt;/a&gt; thinks that, far from spreading happiness, he’s causing widespread child obesity, and they want him to retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retire Ronald, started by Stacey Folsom, national spokesperson for Corporate Accountability International, wants McDonald’s to quit using the clown to market harmful products to kids, and is trying to gain public support of the cause. They conducted their own U.S. poll in March, asking whether Americans thought it was time for Ronald to go. Their poll showed that 65% of Americans view the fast food mascot in a positive light, but 52% think corporations should stop using cartoons and other kid-friendly characters to sell harmful products to children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Should McDonald’s stop marketing unhealthy food to kids?&lt;/p&gt;

We've already see one &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/parliament-endorses-libel-reform-on-day.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;cross-party body taking on board a large proportion of the Campaign's findings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;, but how many of these proposals will be translated into exact details in each party election manifesto remains to be seen - a critic might point out that, honourable exceptions aside, the Tory party has been the most reluctant to get behind libel reform, and that today's announcement of 'a review' is not the strongest endorsement - nonetheless, Conservative support for the cause is indeed welcome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="border-collapse:collapse"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="border-collapse:collapse"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;The reform of one aspect of libel law, that of the success fees charged by lawyers as party of 'conditional fee arrangements' (CFAs), has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/overhaul-of-libel-laws-will-have-to-wait-1938715.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;already fallen by the wayside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;; a victim of the 'wash-up' at the end of Parliament, infamous for pushing through the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.talktalkblog.co.uk/author/AH-xH9KzE/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;'draconian and oppressive' (not my words, but those of Andrew Heaney of the TalkTalk Group)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/apr/08/digital-economy-bill-exposes-broken-system"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;Digital Economy Act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;, the reforms were initially blocked by several MPs and then not deemed high-priority enough to be revisited as Parliamentary business drew to a close.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="border-collapse:collapse"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="border-collapse:collapse"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;The lesson, then, must be that whilst cross-party support for the principles of libel reform are welcome advances in the right direction, the Campaign will continue to press the government until reform is realised, until our freedom to debate is enshrined in a balanced law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/488262047686109051-18804070821009112?l=teekblog.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (teekblog)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">consider, evaluate, act</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270769862918"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=173429">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44aa34f56b1c1ecb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="50 Cent"/><category term="Andre-3000"/><category term="baby names"/><category term="bad baby names"/><category term="Big Boi"/><category term="Bono"/><category term="celebrity baby names"/><category term="Courteney Cox"/><category term="David Arquette"/><category term="Geri Halliwell"/><category term="Outkast"/><category term="Robert Downey"/><category term="Robin Wright Penn"/><category term="Sean Penn"/><category term="Spice Girls"/><category term="Toni Braxton"/><category term="U2"/><category term="worst baby names"/><title type="html">10 More Completely Ridiculous Celebrity Baby Names</title><published>2010-04-08T22:56:03Z</published><updated>2010-04-08T22:56:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/10-more-completely-ridiculous-celebrity-baby-names/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, we discussed some of the &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/what-not-to-name-your-kid/"&gt;worst celebrity baby names&lt;/a&gt; out there.

I wish I could go; &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalcon.org/speakers"&gt;speakers include&lt;/a&gt; Genie Scott, Kiki Sanford, Brian Dunning, Karen Stollznow, Seth Shostak — all friends and wonderful lecturers — and I hate to miss something like this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you should go! It’s a one day event, and the cost is only $40. Not bad. That would only buy you like one minute on the phone with Sylvia Browne, or 0.0007 bomb-sniffing wands, or a Deepak Chopra book — all of which are worth far, far less. &lt;/p&gt;

Here are a few good reasons why you should homeschool your child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="homeschool" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/homeschool-300x203.jpg" alt="Homeschool" width="300" height="203"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parent-teacher ratios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In some schools, teachers have to teach upwards of 40 children at a time. With homeschooling, your child will be educated by you in a one-on-one environment, or at most with their siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family bonding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Homeschooling allows more time for children and parents to bond and nourish family relationships. Studies show that children who are homeschooled tend to value family more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer influence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Of course you shouldn’t shelter your children completely from their peers. But homeschooling can reduce the bad peer influence in terms of smoking, drinking, drugs, violence, and sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed of education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Traditional schools follow daily lesson plans and calendared curriculum. With homeschooling, you can educate your children as quickly or as slowly as their capabilities warrant. You can also teach creative subject areas that may not be covered in depth at your local school, and provide more opportunities for field trips and hands-on education. As long as you’re meeting the basic requirements of your state, you have free reign to educate your children as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socialization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One common misconception about homeschooling is that children don’t interact with other kids outside their family. That simply isn’t true. Most areas have homeschool support groups, where families get together for special outings, field trips, and social time. In many locations, homeschooled children are eligible to play sports in local high schools, even though they’re not enrolled students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right school for your child can be an agonizing decision. With so many pros and cons between public schools and private schools, prioritizing the most important details isn’t an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, getting a recommendation for a school, even from someone you trust, isn’t a flawless solution. Michael Pelman, an educational psychologist, explained why in an interview with&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8743221/"&gt; MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;: “I certainly worry when people talk about a school’s reputation. When many people discuss schools — good or bad — what they’re talking about is their own belief system, not real information gathered through research and experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When comparing private schools and public schools, do your homework (no pun intended). Don’t just assume a private school is better because it’s more prestigious. &lt;a href="http://privateschool.about.com/cs/employment/a/teachingcond.htm"&gt;About.com&lt;/a&gt; recommends considering tangible assets when comparing schools such as the school’s facilities, the average class size, the school’s annual budget, and the classes offered at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=55"&gt;National Center for Education Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, private schools typically have smaller class sizes and offer safer learning environments. However, public schools also have their advantages. First of all, public school teachers are generally better compensated than teachers at private schools, which can lead to a more motivated workforce. The NCES also found that standardized test scores are virtually the same when comparing students from public schools and private schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve done the research and still can’t make up your mind, take a tour of each school. Talk with the teachers and members of the administration. Once you’ve considered all the factors, trust your instincts. Either that or let your husband make the decision, and then blame him if it ends up being the wrong choice.&lt;/p&gt;

However, preparing for two babies can be very stressful, so here are five must-have products that a twin mother will need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="twin-stroller" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/twin-stroller.jpg" alt="Double Stroller" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stroller Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can easily carry around one baby. But when you’re on the go, a stroller is a must for doubles. Look for the travel system type of stroller that allows you to put the car seats in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pump It Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, you can breastfeed twins – just make sure that you have a breast pump. Also, get a twin-nursing pillow so that you can nurse both infants at the same time. (Ouch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swingers!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Baby swings are a godsend. Even the most difficult baby should easily fall asleep in a comfy swing. But don’t make the mistake of getting just one and thinking your twins will share. Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boppy Pillows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Voted America’s favorite baby product several times over, the &lt;a href="http://shopboppy.com/"&gt;Boppy pillow&lt;/a&gt; allows babies to feed, play, sit, and relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diapers, Diapers, and More Diapers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For your baby shower, ask for diapers and onesies. They’ll be far more valuable than any cutesy toys you might get. You’ll be amazed (and horrified) at how many diapers you’ll go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you can get a lot of free stuff for twins (and other multiples)? &lt;a href="http://www.raising-twins.com/free-stuff-for-twins.html"&gt;Raising-twins.com&lt;/a&gt; features a list of available freebies and discounts.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope you don’t mind my addressing you directly, since you are now apparently a reader of our webpage.  And I hope you don’t mind if I am the first JREF staff member to publicly congratulate you for winning a Pigasus Award last week. Congrats, you old devil. You’ve earned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Of course, I &lt;em&gt;would &lt;/em&gt;think so, since I’m the one that nominated you. I’m also the one that wrote &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/837-how-come-we-always-have-to-wait-until-night-to-do-this.html"&gt;the scathing editorial&lt;/a&gt; about your &lt;a href="http://www.aetv.com/psychic-kids/meet-hosts/index.jsp"&gt;vicious, exploitive show&lt;/a&gt; — the one that sent you into spasms of frenzied Tweeting when you finally laid eyes on the thing last Friday. That’s right, Chip — it wasn’t James Randi. It was &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;. But how did you respond? By accusing Randi and the JREF of gay-bashing. Here’s your Tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday 2nd April 2010, &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/chipcoffey"&gt;@chipcoffey&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;How ironic is it that an article on Randi's website - written before he came out of the closet recently - negatively alludes to me being gay. Pot. Kettle. Black!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heady stuff, that — and eerily reminiscent of the last time I was accused of homophobia. That was at my other job. (I am, by night, a professional theater critic.) When it was learned that &lt;a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com"&gt;The Westboro Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt; was coming to Fort Lauderdale to protest a production of Paul Rudnick’s deliriously sacrilegious play, &lt;em&gt;The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told&lt;/em&gt;, the entire community went batty. The little theater producing the play — which had a history of shoddy work and poor audience turnouts — was suddenly receiving messages from the mayor, from local Democratic Party big-wigs, from the Gay and Lesbian Community Center. A counter-protest was planned. Writeups appeared in the local dailies, painting the theater’s personnel as brave, politically enlightened victims of homophobic bullying. For the first time in the theater’s history, ticket sales boomed. No one ever stopped to wonder how it was that The Westboro Baptist Church even &lt;em&gt;found out &lt;/em&gt;that a little-known theater near the bottom of the Floridian peninsula was producing &lt;em&gt;The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for me, Chip. I wondered. So I did what any sane and well-composed person would do under those circumstances. I called the church and spoke to Shirley Phelps-Roper, who told me she’d found out about the play &lt;em&gt;from the theater itself. &lt;/em&gt;She forwarded me the press release she’d received, and it looked just like the one the theater had sent to my office at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.browardpalmbeach.com"&gt;The New Times&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— except that Shirley’s copy came with a foreword, which said: “This is the most blasphemous play ever produced; it depicts sodomy in the Garden of Eden; and if you protest it you will generate a storm of press coverage and reach a vast media market of 5+ million souls.” (That’s a paraphrase, but you get the idea.) The thinking was: Come, protest us, and we’ll both get something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I believed then and still believe now that it was downright sleazy for the theater company to pretend to victimhood when they’d brought on their own damned trouble, and I said so in a blog on our paper’s website. Perhaps it was too strongly worded — I may have referred to the theater’s Executive Director as a “swine with thumbs,” or something like that — but it echoed what a lot of my colleagues at the dailies were thinking at the time. My analysis of the situation was correct, if not polite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response? The theater in question set about informing the world, through press releases and mass mailings, that I was a “gay-hating bigot” who “sided with the Westboro Baptist Church over a gay theater in his own community.”  Of course, that wasn’t true. I’d sided with my community against some dishonest hacks who, as happens from time to time, happened to be gay. (And, as a result of my calling “foul,” the Westboroans gave Fort Lauderdale a miss altogether. As Phelps-Roper told me later: “We don’t like to be manipulated.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chip: It is my opinion that you, too, are a dishonest hack who happens to be gay, though it wasn’t until this very article that I’d thought to mention your sexual orientation in print. What I did write in that &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/837-how-come-we-always-have-to-wait-until-night-to-do-this.html"&gt;previous editorial&lt;/a&gt; was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;So we are expected to nod wisely when co-host psychic Chris Fleming and a pubescent medium, apparently independently, both detect a “female” spirit at the top of a staircase; or when one of the kids, channeling Coffey’s dearly departed mum, says something that makes Coffey smile. “That’s just like her,” he says. If this is an attempt to convince us of something, it’s breathtakingly lazy. In these moments, Coffey reminds me of Michael Jackson in his guise as the Pied Piper of Neverland; gaily leading children into a fantasy world of their mutual devise. It looks harmless, like two lonely and immature souls bucking up each others’ lovely delusions. In fact, Coffey often seems like the loneliest, most immature person of them all. Walking his charges up the darkened staircase of an allegedly haunted house, holding aloft a tiny lantern as though it were the only thing staving back the devil himself, he stubbornly ignores the question posed by one young medium: “How come we always have to wait until night to do this?” Because, sweetie, nobody’s afraid of the monster under the bed at high noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume this is the passage you referenced in your Tweet, and I assume the word that got your knickers all a’twist was “gaily.” Was that it? Are you really unaware that “gay” is a word with multiple meanings? Is it possible that a man to whom parents entrust their children could be so dense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so. It has not escaped my attention that in the whole, withering critique, “gaily” was the one word you found worthy of rebuttal. Never mind that the paragraph in question actually does, and very explicitly, accuse you of being infantile, and that elsewhere I strongly hint that you earn a living by imperiling the psyches of children. These are points beneath your consideration. You’d rather forget them, and discuss instead an issue on which you actually &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;claim the moral high ground: Gay rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart gambit, Chip. Men and women of goodwill all over the world support gay rights and are instinctively sympathetic to those who claim “discrimination.” (Which, as some writer or other pointed out, is actually the opposite of “discrimination” — though that’s a whole messy digression that we should perhaps pursue some other time.) Unfortunately, when the issue under discussion is neither gayness, nor straightness, nor blackness, nor yellowness, nor whiteness/oldness/youthiness/Puerto Rican-ness/whathaveyou, but is in fact the rather less delicate question of &lt;strong&gt;whether or not one is a child-exploiting liar with an immature mind and wonky ideas&lt;/strong&gt;… well, making the issue one of prejudice is really just a craven way of changing the subject. &lt;em&gt;Ignoratio elenchi&lt;/em&gt;, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry if I’m coming down on you rather too harshly for what was, after all, just a Tweet, but please understand — this is how rumors get started. Anyway, my boyfriend, &lt;a href="http://reason.com/archives/2009/09/01/friedman-economics"&gt;the journalist Penn Bullock&lt;/a&gt;, gets very antsy when he hears that I’ve gone gay-bashing, and I can’t have you disrupting my domestic tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you’re a ridiculous man and I’m going to try not to write about you anymore. But for now, I thank you for ramming home an important lesson: Beware of people who change the subject, especially when politics are involved. It may be that they’re trying to distract you from something sickening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that sickening thing, that point you still fail to address, is this: You almost certainly cannot do what you claim to do, and you are messing with children's minds. Take our challenge, please. We'd be delighted to be proved wrong. But until you at least &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt;, take your award and hush.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefbrandon@gmail.com (Brandon K.

Large-scale studies of type I and type II diabetics have shown that better control of blood sugar levels (to an extent: data indicate that &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/24/2545"&gt;being too aggressive can increase mortality&lt;/a&gt;) reduces the incidence of microvascular complications) . Control of cholesterol and blood pressure have been shown to prevent macrovascular complications in type II diabetes. (&lt;a href="http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/control/#study" style="text-decoration:none;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;outline-width:0px;outline-style:initial;outline-color:initial;font-size:12px;vertical-align:baseline;background-image:initial;background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,84,166)"&gt;DCCT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/index.php?maindoc=/ukpds/" style="text-decoration:none;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;outline-width:0px;outline-style:initial;outline-color:initial;font-size:12px;vertical-align:baseline;background-image:initial;background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,84,166)"&gt;UKPDS&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:18px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;outline-width:0px;outline-style:initial;outline-color:initial;font-size:12px;vertical-align:baseline;background-image:initial;background-color:transparent;background-repeat:initial initial"&gt;What does this mean in the day to day life of a diabetic? One of the most devastating complications of diabetes is amputation, which is often due to both the macrovascular and microvascular complication of peripheral neuropathy. This can begin as a tingling, burning pain in the feet, but can lead to loss of sensation. Small injuries can rapidly become limb-threatening. &lt;strong style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;outline-width:0px;outline-style:initial;outline-color:initial;font-size:12px;vertical-align:baseline;background-image:initial;background-color:transparent;background-repeat:initial initial"&gt;(Warning: Yucky picture under the fold)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is often a precursor to foot ulceration and amputation.  The evidence supports control of blood sugar as the primary way to prevent neuropathy, and the above interventions to prevent complications.  There are a number of drugs that can be used to treat the symptoms of DPN, although none is perfect.  There is also interest in newer agents, such as &lt;a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/11/2365.abstract"&gt;alpha-lipoic acid&lt;/a&gt;, in the treatment of DPN.  But now, one of the health gurus at the Huffington Post is weighing in,

style="font-size:13px"&gt;In my opinion, one of the biggest misconceptions in modern medicine is the assumption that diabetes can be controlled by medication alone. The truth is that it simply can't be. Somehow our culture has developed this fantasy that people can eat anything they want, do no exercise, and any health complications will be resolved with a few pills or injections. Nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;His opinion is not the same as evidence.  &amp;quot;The truth&amp;quot; is that diabetes can, and often is, well-controlled by medicine alone. This isn&amp;#39;t because real doctors prefer it that way; it is because many diabetics cannot adhere to diet and exercise programs, and many diabetics do not have enough pancreatic beta cell function left to avoid medications.  Kornfeld&amp;#39;s musings on the limitations of various sorts of laboratory measurements are interesting, but are simply his opinion.  We can and must have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/06/what_is_disease_diabetes_diagn.php"&gt;proxy measurements for diabetic control&lt;/a&gt;. Fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C have been studied extensively, and rising measurements directly correlate with the pathologic vascular changes of diabetes. This, and the fact that it is possible to correlate peripheral neuropathy and measurements of glucose control such as HbA1C renders Kornfield's beliefs moot.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t to say dietary modification isn&amp;#39;t useful, but to imply that this is the only way to prevent diabetic complications is fallacious.  Kornfield goes on to give dietary advice which may or may not be good, but as a professor of mine once said, &amp;quot;there is a reason podiatrists are only licensed to practice below the leg.&amp;quot; His assertion that organic foods are less &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; and an important part of a diabetic diet is simply ridiculous.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As the image above should illustrate, diabetes is a serious problem, a threat to life and limb, and people who litter the world with bad advice are as much a part of the problem as a big piece of chocolate cake---but not quite as yummy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/rMSJNzP9JJo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270762381917"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=173786">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4988553e96f4ffff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="charitable donations"/><category term="ebay"/><category term="finances"/><category term="financial questions"/><category term="LearnVest"/><category term="money matters"/><category term="personal finances"/><category term="tax credits"/><category term="tax law"/><category term="tax questions"/><category term="tax refunds"/><category term="taxes"/><category term="Wisen Your Wallet"/><title type="html">Tackle Tax Season With LearnVest</title><published>2010-04-08T21:01:17Z</published><updated>2010-04-08T21:01:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/tackle-tax-season-with-learnvest/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/83590515.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="83590515" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/83590515-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="122"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We recently told you to “&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/wisen-your-wallet-woman/"&gt;Wisen Your Wallet&lt;/a&gt;” and check out &lt;a href="http://www.learnvest.com/"&gt;LearnVest.com&lt;/a&gt;, a new website designed to teach women about money. Too lazy to take a gander at their site? Don’t despair. LearnVest has agreed to periodically pay us a visit, to answer your questions about all things fiscal. Send your capitalist questions to comments@blisstree.com or leave them in the comments section, below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re kicking off this series with a seasonally appropriate Q&amp;amp;A about – taxes. LearnVest teamed with Inna Merzheritsky – a partner specializing in international tax law at Burr Pilger Mayer accounting firm in San Francisco – to tackle some common queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love getting cash back from my tax refund, but some of my friends say  it’s a bad thing. Why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t think of your refund as some sort of bonus. It’s &lt;em&gt;your own  money&lt;/em&gt; that you’re getting back, which means that you’ve basically given an interest-free loan to the government. Put it this way: If you could stash money under your mattress and get nothing from it, or invest it in a CD so you earn interest over time, which would be the better thing to do? (The latter, of course!) Getting a tax refund is like stuffing money under your mattress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I donate to charity, can I deduct it all?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably, if you donate within a certain range. The general upper limit is 50% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). So, if your AGI is $100,000, you could donate and deduct up to $50,000. But, if your total itemized deductions are less than the standard deduction you’d get anyway, then you would simply take the standard deduction ($5,700 for single people filing 2009 taxes). That means you either need to donate more than $5,700 to charity during the year, or have additional deductions that you list in the tax form Schedule A, in order to make the charity deductions worth your while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just had a baby. Are there any tax credits for 2009?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a tax credit of $1,000 per kid, though it’s phased out for people with higher income, starting at $110,000 for joint filers. Additionally, you can earn an additional personal exemption for your new dependent, in the amount of $3,650 in 2009. If you’re married and both spouses work, you can receive a child-care credit. If your employer has a 125 Plan (often called a dependent care spending account), which lets you contribute pre-tax money to pay for daycare, Inna always recommends that you use it. You can’t take the tax credit &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; use the pre-tax spending account, so you’re usually better off with the 125 Plan. Of course, take the credit if your employer doesn’t offer such a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t have an expense account at work, but I do a lot of networking anyway. Can I write off my cocktails and lunches?  Taxi fares or fees for professional events?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write off unreimbursed expenses if they amount to more than 2% of your AGI. You need to itemize your deductions to get credit for the expenses, and things like coffees and lunches are only 50% deductible. Inna cautions, “If you want to take this deduction, you should keep receipts as well as…logs of who you met with and why.” She recommends keeping these records in your Outlook calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if I’m changing  professions? Can I write off my tuition for tax purposes? (I’m a teacher, but want to get my M.B.A.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, you couldn’t write off tuition if you were changing fields, but that’s changed. There’s a new and temporary deduction for any type of tuition and fees. It won’t be available beyond the 2009 tax year, unless a new law comes into effect. The deduction is $4,000, limited like many others by your level of income; it phases out for AGIs between $65,000 and $85,000. Note that you don’t have to itemize your deductions to take it. There are other credits and tax breaks for education (like the HOPE credit), but you can’t take the credit &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;the  deduction. So, calculate your income tax bill with both scenarios, and  take the one that gives you bigger savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;I sold about $3,000 worth of jewelry on eBay; how do I deal with the  taxes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a business, or was this jewelry you inherited from Grandma that you weren’t so crazy about? If the latter, then this would count as a capital gain and you would have to fill out Schedule D. Now, if you have a business that sells jewelry, you’ll need to fill out schedule C, which is for people who are self-employed.&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Ernie Hood to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around the Clock.  Would you please tell my readers a little bit more about yourself?  Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)?  What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ernie Hood pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Ernie%20Hood%20pic.jpg" width="270" height="448" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;Hi Bora.  Thanks for your interest, and for all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm one of those science writers who comes to the profession from the writing side as opposed to the science side.  I have a BA in English from Brown University and an MA in Communications from UNC-Chapel Hill.  After grad school, I worked in local television news for a few years (great training for working on tight deadlines), and then a partner and I started a video and audio production company, where I plied my trade for the ensuing twenty years.  Working with science-based corporate clients such as Glaxo-GlaxoWellcome-GSK, Rhone Poulenc, Ciba Giegy, Organon Teknika and many more, I eventually discovered my love of science and an ability to communicate scientific concepts simply and effectively.  In 2003, after dabbling in science writing on the side for a few years, I elected to pursue it full time.  Becoming a freelancer was and is nerve-wracking (just ask one), but I've never looked back and thoroughly enjoy what I do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think that my work makes some small contribution to bettering the world through enhanced appreciation of science--that's much more rewarding than contributing to some corporation's profit margin.  And I've found that scientists are much easier to work with and more appreciative of quality work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geographically, I was born and raised in a suburb of Boston (go Sox!), spent some years in Florida, moved to Chapel Hill in 1976 to attend grad school (go Heels!), and have been here in the Triangle ever since.  I couldn't imagine living anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been fortunate to work on a wide variety of engaging projects over the course of my career. For example, in the mid-90s my production company produced a weekly, national magazine show on PBS called BreakThrough: Television's Journal of Science and Medicine, which aired on more than 200 stations, won several international awards, and was warmly received by the scientific community.  I was Senior Writer on the show, contributing studio and promotional copy while supervising and editing the work of our team of reporter/field producers.  It was an intense experience that has served me well to this day in terms of developing a passion for the science and for getting it right without pandering or sensationalizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my second career as a science writer, I've written more than 80 articles for Environmental Health Perspectives, the monthly journal published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the flagship journal in the environmental health field.  I've attended numerous scientific conferences and written meeting reports.  I've written or edited several book chapters, including twice contributing chapters to the NIH Director's Biennial Report to Congress.  I've even been a co-author of two peer-reviewed publications, which was quite a thrill for this English major.  I also perform a variety of writing and editing tasks for several academicians around the country.  More recently, drawing on my media production experience, I've been producing podcasts for several clients--great fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up most of your time and passion these days?  What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much (too much!) of my time these days is taken up by two volunteer labors of love--my radio show and &lt;a href="http://sconc.org/" title=""&gt;SCONC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past four years, I've hosted a weekly science interview radio show on &lt;a href="http://wcomfm.org/" title=""&gt;WCOM-FM&lt;/a&gt; in Carrboro, North Carolina, called &lt;a href="http://radioinvivo.net/" title=""&gt;Radio In Vivo&lt;/a&gt;: Your Link to the Triangle Science Community.  Each week I bring in a Triangle-area scientist and we discuss his or her work for an hour, which allows a thorough, in-depth examination.  I've had guests from all walks of science (including Bora Z himself, of course!).  It's quite a challenge to book new guests and prepare for each week's show, sometimes on a rather steep learning curve, but I never tire of helping scientists communicate about their work and promoting the scientific enterprise here in the Triangle.  There are now more than 140 hour-long shows in the archive at the program's website, &lt;a href="http://radioinvivo.net/" title=""&gt;radioinvivo.net&lt;/a&gt;.  I also serve on three different committees at the radio station, doing what I can to help support and sustain WCOM--a remarkable example of all-volunteer community radio at its best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also had the honor and privilege of serving as president of Science Communicators of North Carolina (&lt;a href="http://sconc.org/" title=""&gt;SCONC&lt;/a&gt;) since 2009.  We put on events monthly at area venues, typically featuring a speaker or two along with time for socializing, networking, and good food and drink.  We seek to aid our members' work opportunities and professional development, and to showcase the extremely important function our profession fulfills, serving as the vital liaison between the scientific community and the diverse audiences to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals?  Well, the chances of playing left field for the Red Sox or being a rock star or a pro bass fisherman seem increasingly remote these days, so I guess today I'll settle for maintaining my health, watching my daughters thrive as adults, and eventually, dare I say it, hanging out with some grand-kids!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my favorite element of science communication is simply the joy of constantly discovering fascinating new developments, and sometimes having the opportunity to introduce them to a wider audience.  I don't need to remind your readers how cool science is, and it's thrilling to use the many new tools at our disposal to send that message out to folks who do need to be reminded--or informed in the first place...or disabused of misconceptions and misinformed opinions.  We need all of the virtual weapons we can get in our ongoing battle against ignorance, apathy, and politically motivated misrepresentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does blogging figure in your work?  How about social networks?  Do you find all of this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I don't blog, and I marvel at people like you who do, and who generate so much material all the time.  When you say &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" title=""&gt;A Blog Around the Clock&lt;/a&gt;, I think you must mean that you actually do blog around the clock, and I can't begin to understand how you aren't chronically sleep-deprived.  I do follow several blogs, such as yours, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/" title=""&gt;Terra Sigillata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/" title=""&gt;Deep Sea News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceinthetriangle.org/blog/" title=""&gt;Science in the Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://mistersugar.com/" title=""&gt;Mister Sugar&lt;/a&gt;, for example.  Also I consult blogs frequently in the course of my reporting and writing work and when preparing for radio interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for social networks, I am on Facebook and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/bkthrough" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, although I tend to lurk more than actively post. I just can't imagine anyone caring what mood I might be in at any given time, or the fact that I'm drinking coffee somewhere.  With that caveat in mind, I do find the networks to be valuable for staying in touch with the professional community and for publicizing &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Radio-In-Vivo-Your-Link-to-the-Triangle-Science-Community/160844703882" title=""&gt;new editions of the radio show&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Science-Communicators-of-North-Carolina-SCONC/112880282954" title=""&gt;upcoming SCONC events&lt;/a&gt;.  Sometimes it's difficult to ignore all the chatter - the social networks are quite addictive and can be a distraction.  On the other hand, they're a great way to keep one's ears to the ground.  Does the word ambivalent come to mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of Science Online 2010 for you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my third year at the conference, and it just keeps getting better and more valuable.  I was especially pleased at the breadth of the content this year, with the program expanding far beyond its roots in strictly covering science blogging.  As we've seen, the many disparate elements of science communication are blending together in exciting new ways, and the meeting certainly reflected that trend.  Also, as so many of your respondents have mentioned, it was a terrific opportunity to meet and interact with some of the most accomplished people in our field, face to face in "meat space."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was one of the recipients of a Flip video camera at the conference, and spent a good bit of time shooting interviews and posting them to YouTube.  I was amazed by the quality of the image emerging from a camera the size of a transistor radio, the 2-hour digital recording capacity of the device, and the ease of operation and uploading.  Took me way back to my TV news days, when it took two people and a camera and recorder weighing 40 pounds each to shoot on 15-minute tapes the size of a hard-back book.  We've come a very long way!  It's exciting to contemplate the potential uses for this groundbreaking technology - I'm sure we're just seeing our first glimpses of its capabilities and possible applications.  From now on, there's little excuse not to have video in our scientific communications when it's become so easy and so powerful.  I just hope we'll keep the quality up and not put out mediocre material just because we can.  We don't do that in our writing, and we should not succumb to the temptation to do so in other communications.  Small soapbox issue there...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;Blisstree announced our first giveaway on Monday (see below for details) – remember to leave a comment by Friday at 9 p.m. ET for a chance to win!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://youcastcorp.com/r/frappuccino?r=mochaLightBottle"&gt;&lt;img src="http://youcastcorp.com/starbucks/frappuccino/images/mochalight_asset.jpg" border="0" alt="STARBUCKS FRAPPUCCINO" width="300" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://youcastcorp.com/r/frappuccino?r=vanillaLightBottle"&gt;&lt;img style="border:0pt none" src="http://youcastcorp.com/starbucks/frappuccino/images/vanillalight_asset.jpg" border="0" alt="STARBUCKS FRAPPUCCINO" width="300" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look! It’s our very first reader giveaway since we launched! (But it won’t be our last.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the sweet prizes come from a little Seattle-based coffee shop called Starbucks. Heard of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Starbucks buys 75 percent of all its coffee from &lt;a href="http://www.starbucks.com/sharedplanet/index.aspx"&gt;responsibly grown, ethically traded sources&lt;/a&gt;, and the company aims to up that number to 100 percent by 2015. (Last year, Starbucks also bought 40 million pounds of &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/definition-decoder-fair-trade/"&gt;Fair Trade Certified&lt;/a&gt; coffee, which means it purchases more Fair Trade Certified coffee than anyone else in the world.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, huh? So Blisstree partnered with Starbucks to give a little something back to our readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two lucky Blisstree readers* will win:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Four Bottles of New Starbucks Frappuccino Light – 100 calories each (two Mocha Light, two Vanilla Light)&lt;br&gt;
• One $15 Starbucks Gift Card&lt;br&gt;
• One &lt;a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/home"&gt;Timbuk2 Messenger Bag&lt;/a&gt; (a $110 value)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter our exclusive giveaway, just tell us by 9 p.m. ET this  Friday, April 9, 2010, which Starbucks drink is your “desert island”  favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave your comment below, and comment as many times as you like!  (You’ll have to register with your email address, but we promise we’ll  only use it to tell you if you’ve won.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Giveaway open to residents of the U.S. and Canada. Blisstree will select two winners at random and contact them after April 9, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop using Paper Towels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean up your mess without clearing out a forest: Stock up on kitchen towels and cloth napkins instead of paper towels, and use old newspapers to wipe your windows (they won’t leave streaks). The vast majority of paper towels in American supermarkets are made of virgin paper rather than recycled paper, so thousands of trees are still getting cut down each year to made our disposable cleaner-uppers. Using cloth napkins, kitchen towels, and newspapers instead cuts back on paper use, and it also saves money in the long-run. If you absolutely must buy paper towels, try to find post-consumer recycled paper towels.&lt;/p&gt;

I was particularly enthralled with these two small worlds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ciclops.org/view_event/133/Rev129_Flyby_Raw_Preview?js=1"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/cassini_janus_epimetheus.jpg" alt="cassini_janus_epimetheus" title="cassini_janus_epimetheus" width="592" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left is the moon &lt;a href="http://www.ciclops.org/view/6315/Janus_Rev_129_Flyby_Raw_Preview_1"&gt;Janus&lt;/a&gt; and on the right is &lt;a href="http://www.ciclops.org/view/6316/Epimetheus_Rev_129_Flyby_Raw_Preview_1"&gt; Epimetheus&lt;/a&gt;. The scales are not quite the same; Janus is roughly half again as big as Epimetheus’ size of 135 x 110 x 105 km (81 x 66 x 63 miles). Cassini was a little over 100,000 km from Epimetheus and 75,000 km from Janus when these images a were taken.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These are raw images, so they haven’t been processed yet to remove cosmic ray hits, brightness variations, and so on. But they are still fascinating. Epimetheus looks to me exactly how I picture a big asteroid; beaten, battered, looming. The low angle of sunlight on the side accentuates the craters there, making this almost a caricature of what an asteroid looks like. Technically it’s not an asteroid; it’s a moon. And even if it weren’t orbiting Saturn we might not call it an asteroid; it has a high reflectivity indicating a lot of ice on the surface (and a low density consistent with that too). If it orbited the Sun on an elliptical path, we might very well call it a comet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s more to these moons. Amazingly, Janus and Epimetheus are on almost — but not &lt;em&gt;quite &lt;/em&gt; — the same orbit around Saturn! Currently, Janus is a bit closer to Saturn than Epimetheus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say &amp;quot;currently&amp;quot;, because every four years &lt;em&gt;these moons swap orbits!&lt;/em&gt; Since Janus has an orbit slightly closer to Saturn, it is moving faster around the planet than Epimetheus. It slowly but eventually catches up to the outer moon. As they approach, Janus pulls back slightly on Epimetheus, and Epimetheus pulls Janus forward. In other words, Janus steals orbital energy Epimetheus! This means Epimetheus drops into a slightly lower orbit, and Janus gets boosted into a slightly higher one, effectively swapping the orbits of the two moons. Although the two orbital paths are separated by only about 50 km (30 miles) — smaller than the radii of either moon — they never collide.  The swap takes place when the moons are still more than 10,000 km apart, so they never get a chance to bump uglies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this weird situation arise? Perhaps, in the distant past, there was one bigger moon orbiting Saturn, and it got whacked by an interloper. The moon disrupted, breaking into two big pieces and lots of littler ones. The debris got cleaned up by the gravity of the two big pieces and other gravitational effects, leaving these two square-dancing satellites on slightly different but still interacting paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the actual cause of this still isn’t known for sure. Cassini observations like this one may help astronomers figure out how it is these two little moons came to be, and why it is that although they can always approach each other, they can never actually touch.&lt;/p&gt;

Many sociable animal species, including mammals, birds and even insects, have shown the ability to learn by observing others doing things. It&amp;#39;s often seen as a distinct form of cognition, separate to &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; learning, which evolved to facilitate group living. It&amp;#39;s one of the things that everyone&amp;#39;s favourite brain cells, mirror neurons, have been invoked to explain.But if observational learning is a specifically social adaptation, then non-social animals would be predicted to lack this ability. One distinctly unfriendly animal species is the South American red-footed                      tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria), which is naturally solitary. In the wild, they hatch from their eggs alone, and get no parental care; they live most of their lives without interacting with others.Wilkinson et al found that red-footed                      tortoises can, nevertheless, learn by observation. They took four tortoises and got them to watch another &amp;quot;demonstrator&amp;quot; tortoise completing a difficult task: walking around an obstacle to get to some food (it&amp;#39;s hard if you&amp;#39;re a tortoise).The observing animals all learned to do the task. In most cases, they walked around the obstacle to the right, which is what the demonstrators did, but sometimes they went left, showing that they were not simply copying the movements of the demonstrators. The wood chips on the floor of the floor of the cage were mixed up after each trial, to rule out the possibility that the tortoises were just following the smell of the demonstrator. None of four control tortoises, who got no demonstrations, managed to figure it out on their own.The authors conclude thatThe dominant hypothesis in this field claims that social learning evolved as a result of social living and therefore predicts that the tortoises would have difficulty with this task. They did not. The findings suggest that, in this case, social learning may be the result of a general ability to learn. Although the brain mechanisms that underlie the tortoises’ ability to learn socially remain unclear, it seems most likely that it is the product of a general learning mechanism that allows the tortoises to learn, through associative processes, to use the behaviour of another animal just as they would learn to use any cue in the environment.This is a nice experiment, and the result is important: the idea that social learning is somehow evolutionarily and neurally &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; underlies a lot of modern social neuroscience. However, I&amp;#39;m not fully convinced that these tortoises can be accurately described as &amp;quot;non-social&amp;quot;. Even the most anti-social species have to socialize in order to mate: no animal is an island. According to Wikipedia the red-footed                      tortoise has some quite elaborate (and hilarious) mating behaviours...male to male combat is important in inducing breeding in redfoots. Male to male combat begins with a round of head bobbing from each male  involved, and then proceeds to a wresting match where the males attempt  to turn one another over. The succeeding male (usually the largest male) then attempts to mate  with the females.  The ritualistic head movements displayed by male red-foots are thought  to be a method of species recognition. Other tortoise species have  different challenging head movements....The unique body shape of the male redfooted tortoise facilitates the  mating process by allowing him to maintain his balance during copulation  while the female walks around, seemingly attempting to dislodge the  male by walking under low-hanging vegetation.Wilkinson, A., Kuenstner, K., Mueller, J., &amp;amp; Huber, L.

You see, not long ago I was informed that Skepchick was going to be held at a different location than its original spot. Apparently there was a problem with the ice machine or something at Skepchick HQ, so they had to change the location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think twice about it, and I innocently arrived at the new location, expecting all the Chicks to be there blogging. But I was surprised to discover the only contributors there were me, the president of the &lt;em&gt;Twilight &lt;/em&gt;fan club, that one guy who never takes a bath, and for some reason, Gene Shalit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after realizing I’d been duped, I left the fake Skepchick, and came back here with ass-whoopin’ on my mind. Coincidentally, “Ass-Whoopin’ on My Mind” is also one of the songs on my upcoming Country album, &lt;em&gt;Whiskey Bottles &amp;amp; Cheatin’ Songs&lt;/em&gt;. Keep an eye out for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, now that the rambling nonsense is out of the way, I want to know about anger. I suspect that being in the rat race, or raising kids, or just dealing with other people for any length of time can cause anger to bubble in people, and they just don’t show it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you express anger openly? How? Do you suppress it? Channel it to something else? Ever tripped soomeone’s hair-trigger? What happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community. Look for it to appear Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays at 3pm ET.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270753119510"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=3051">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a59c80435878253f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Gaming"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Technology"/><category term="You Tube"/><category term="film"/><category term="movie"/><category term="Patrick Jean"/><category term="Pixels"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Little Kitten – Pixels</title><published>2010-04-08T17:54:43Z</published><updated>2010-04-08T17:54:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/h0MIsanr0Mg/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2010/04/little-kitten-pixels/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.dailymotion.com/swf/video/xcv6dv&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=270" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The topic is &amp;quot;The Quest for a Living World&amp;quot;: how modern astronomy is edging closer to finding another Earth orbiting a distant star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/misc/images/TMT_flyer_950.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2768/4503164458_60c2d85489_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click for a higher-res version.]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The panelists are all-stars in the field: Caltech astronomy professor John Johnson, Berkeley astronomer Gibor Basri, MIT planetary astronomer Sara Seager, and NASA Ames Research Center’s Tori Hoehler. We’ll be talking about how we’re looking for these new worlds, what the state of the art is, and perhaps toss around some of the philosophy of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we’re looking for them. You might think the answer is obvious, but I’ve found that astronomers have lots of intriguing reasons for why they do the work they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is sponsored by Discover Magazine, the Thirty Meter Telescope (yes, a project to build a telescope with a 30 meter mirror!), and Caltech. &lt;a href="http://events.caltech.edu/events/event-7421.html"&gt;It will be at 7:30 p.m. at Caltech’s Beckman auditorium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;It’s also free!&lt;/strong&gt; Send an email to &lt;em&gt;exoplanets@tmt.org&lt;/em&gt; if you want to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll be taking questions from the audience, and if you have a question you’d like to submit in advance then &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/events/the-quest-for-a-living-world-event/"&gt;we have an online form where you can send it it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/02/mysteries-of-the-cosmos/"&gt;Last year’s panel on astronomy frontiers&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of fun, and very well-attended. If you’re in the LA area, then I highly recommend you come! I know you’ll have a great time, and you’ll get a taste for some of the astronomical adventures in store for us in the next couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I fell for a cleaning product was back in 2006, when I discovered Mr. Right – I mean – &lt;a href="http://www.mrclean.com/en_US/magic-eraser.do?gclid=CJfluJj59aACFSFy5Qod8DEKwQ"&gt;Mr. Clean® Magic Eraser®&lt;/a&gt;. It really does cast a spell, with its scuff-busting, mildew-melting ways. I owe the return of quite a few rental deposits to that supernatural sponge. But after having a kid, I worried whether using it to mop up all my surfaces – especially the ones my two-year-old tongues on a regular basis – was such a great idea. (Note: the makers of Magic Eraser say it contains no “harsh chemicals.” Ah, semantics!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spring cleaning season, I became intrigued by two so-called “green” launches. Could we be more than just eco-friendly, I wondered? The &lt;a href="http://www.marthastewartclean.com/"&gt;Martha Stewart Clean&lt;/a&gt; line sounded full of potential: 99+% plant-and mineral-based, fragrance-free, biodegradable, recyclable (from $3.99 at Home Depot, Publix, A&amp;amp;P, and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=Martha+Stewart+Clean&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;). Then there was Suitor #2 – the Ionator HOM, which sprays electrolyzed water that’s strong enough to kill salmonella, yet safe enough to drink. It seemed like a dream ($169; &lt;a href="http://www.activeion.com/"&gt;Activeion Cleaning Solutions&lt;/a&gt;). Never heard of this miracle liquid? Me neither, until Allen Rathey, founder of &lt;a href="http://www.housekeepingchannel.com/"&gt;housekeeping channel&lt;/a&gt;, spoke to me of its virtues. It consists of tap water that’s been zapped with an electric current, charging the ions to help them bond with dirt particles and kill germs. I don’t entirely understand that, but, hey, I never figured out the “magic” behind the Magic Eraser either (or took chemistry in high school, for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:226px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/ionator_1_consumerwhite.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="ionator_1_consumerwhite" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/ionator_1_consumerwhite-216x300.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ionator HOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several days of testing the Ionator HOM and Martha’s all-purpose and glass &amp;amp; mirror cleaners, I can say they lived up to their billing – for the most part. (I did, however, refrain from rubbing raw chicken on my countertops.) With microfiber cloths and a few paper towels, I washed windows, made mirrors sparkle, wiped up a syrup-smeared dining table, and removed soap scum from the shower door. The products surface-cleaned remarkably well. I was most impressed with the mirror &amp;amp; glass cleaner, which left no streaks (though it did leave behind a faint vinegar smell). Overall, the electrolyzed water required more effort to wipe dry, and was less effective on dried-on detritus. And, alas, it did nothing for my carpet stains, even though the literature claimed it would do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. (Full disclosure: those dog paw prints are years old.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve enjoyed getting acquainted with the Ionator and Martha Clean. They’re admirable, effective, and (yawn) reliable, but my feelings toward them remain strictly platonic. See, I’ve recently heard rumors of off-label upholstery uses for the Magic Eraser. Can it get rid of blue chalk on my wingbacks? Be still, my relatively eco-conscious heart.&lt;/p&gt;

Willis &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theyworkforthebpi.com/"&gt;doesn't seem to have turned up&lt;/a&gt; to vote on the bill, but I don't hold much of a grudge against him for that: scheduling a vote this important during "wash up" and forcing weeks of consideration into the space of a few hours is a despicable mockery of democracy. Can't we just vote not to let anyone back into Commons in a months' time? Then maybe we could replace the whole Palace of Westminster with a sculpture &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.coverbrowser.com/image/mad/166-3.jpg"&gt;shaped like this&lt;/a&gt;, which seems an accurate reflection of the relationship we have with our own elected representatives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, there are a few good eggs.

That's a scary thought, although not exactly a surprising one. You can read Barrett's academic paper on the topic here, and head over here to join in the dialogue it has occasioned.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.profleeberger.com/"&gt;Lee Berger&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://web.wits.ac.za/Academic/Research/IHE/"&gt;University of the Witwatersrand&lt;/a&gt; and several colleagues will be describing a new species of &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A. sediba&lt;/em&gt;, from 1.78 to 1.95 million-year-old deposits in South Africa, in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/extra/sediba/328_195.pdf"&gt;tomorrow’s issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The issue will also have a geological article on the find by Paul H.G.M. Dirks of James Cook University, Queensland, and colleagues, and a news item, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/extra/sediba/"&gt;all available now at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;’s website&lt;/a&gt; (plus a podcast and video). The description is based on two partial skeletons, including a well preserved juvenile skull, most of the right arm and shoulder girdle, parts of the hip and leg, and various other bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:230px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-10523" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/new-australopithecine-described/sedibajuvenileskull/"&gt;&lt;img title="http://web.wits.ac.za/Academic/Research/IHE/" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/sedibajuvenileskull.jpg?w=220&amp;amp;h=146" alt="" width="220" height="146"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skull of juvenile &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus sediba&lt;/em&gt;. Image from University of the Witwatersrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new species has a long arm, but the pelvis and leg indicate that it was bipedal (i.e. it could both climb and walk upright). The general evolutionary conclusion the authors draw is the mosaic nature of the origin of &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; features: some &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;-like characters evolved before others, e.g. bipedality preceding cranial enlargement. They find specific features linking the new species to &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;, and posit it to be intermediate between earlier australopithecines and &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age and overall morphology of &lt;em&gt;Au. sediba&lt;/em&gt; imply that it is most likely descended from &lt;em&gt;Au. africanus&lt;/em&gt;, and appears more derived toward &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; than do &lt;em&gt;Au. afarensis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Au. garhi&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Au. africanus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I rather liked about the paper is that it is quite data rich, having tables of comparison of traits and measurements of the new find and several other fossil hominids. Such data-richness is unusual for papers in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, which prefers short papers, with data often being relegated to electronic appendices or other papers; the Berger et al. paper is an unusual ten pages long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news has already reached media websites (e.g. the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/science/09fossil.html?hp"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8609192.stm"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7567733/Two-million-year-old-fossils-could-help-understanding-of-how-man-evolved-from-apes.html"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;). Unlike the case of &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/26/review-of-the-link-a-book-about-a-fossil-primate/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darwinius masillae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, in which premature press coverage, which included the name and its diagnostic characters, and web posting of the description, led to &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/darwinius-whats-at-issue/"&gt;questions about the proper authorship and publication of the name&lt;/a&gt;, the authors and journalists in this case have done everything right. The news accounts are appearing coincident with the name being published (i.e. printed on paper), not prior to its publication. (The newspaper pieces linked to above are online now, but they won’t be published in the sense of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?nfv=&amp;amp;article=8#2"&gt;International Code of Zoological Nomenclature &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;until tomorrow, when the scientific paper itself will be published.) There will thus be no questions about the publication of the name; the authors have made sure that, as the ICZN recommends, &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus sediba&lt;/em&gt; is “self-evidently published within the meaning of the Code” (ICZN, Rec. 8B)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the most complete version here: &lt;a href="http://205.234.252.67/book/export/html/2"&gt;http://205.234.252.67/book/export/html/2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2000 (or so) Edward T. Welch, M.Div., Ph.D., published the article &amp;quot;What You Should Know About Attention Deficit Disorder&amp;quot;  in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Biblical Counseling&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;a href="http://ccefcommunity.org/store6.asp?sku=CD100015"&gt;which ceased publication in 2005&lt;/a&gt;. (It should be noted that Ed Welsh&amp;#39;s opinions in 2000 may not be his opinions today. ) Douglas L. Cowan, Psy.D., M.S., published a response to Welch&amp;#39;s article, which I reproduce below. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is ADHD Real?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is a REAL &lt;strong&gt;mental health&lt;/strong&gt; problem - it really is an attention deficit &lt;em&gt;disorder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are lots of objections to ADHD made below, and they are in BOLD&lt;/strong&gt;. And my answers follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At best it was a dialogue, at worst a debate of sorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000 I was homebound with pneumonia when someone brought me a copy of the&lt;em&gt; Journal of Biblical Counseling &lt;/em&gt;with an article by Ed Welch on ADD ADHD. Since I am both a Pastor, and a Family Therapist, they wanted my opinion on the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opinions are clear below. Please use this response to the article as a teaching tool - a tool that I hope will both sharpen critical thinking skills, and lay out sufficient evidence for Attention Deficit Disorder to stand as a valid medical problem in the minds of those who wish it were not so... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To: David Powlison, Editor. Journal of Biblical Counseling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RE: What You Should Know About Attention Deficit Disorder by Edward T. Welch &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was with some interest that I read the article &lt;strong&gt;What You Should Know About Attention Deficit Disorder &lt;/strong&gt;by Edward Welch after having it handed to me by a member of our church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were elements of the article that were insightful, helpful, and needed to be said in a public forum, especially the discussion of the moral and spiritual dimensions of behavior. For this part of the article I applaud Mr. Welch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Mr. Welch&amp;#39;s discussion on the physiological and biological aspects of ADD ADHD was lacking to the point of being misleading to the readers. I am sure that Mr. Welch had no intention of misleading any readers, as that would hardly reflect the &amp;quot;biblical guidelines with which to understand ADD&amp;quot; that he seeks to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, for the sake of clarifying some details, may I present the following evidence. Perhaps in the near future you would run an article that would present some of this information to your readers, so that they have an accurate understanding of the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;As with everything we read and hear, Christians should assimilate this information with biblical discernment. The material on ADD is often interesting and helpful, but it is not Scriptural. Therefore, it can be prone to unbiblical assumptions and errors.&amp;quot; - p 58 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is true. Yet it would be better placed in the context that all Truth is from God, and that there is extensive research data, objective research data, which seeks to discover Truth. Though this data can be incorrectly interpreted and wrongly used, valid research data describes the objective functioning of a system, person, brain, or whatever is being studied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Other books use a biological approach, claiming that brain functioning explains every behavior.&amp;quot; - p 58 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might say that I have read several books on the biological realities of ADD ADHD, and brain functioning in general, and none of them have claimed &amp;quot;that brain functioning explains every behavior.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do, however, point out the differences in both structure and function of a brain with ADD ADHD, or other disorders, vs. brains without these disorders. It is misleading to suggest that &amp;quot;books (using) a biological approach&amp;quot; make such a claim. Perhaps one or two do, but I am not familiar with any at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;In other words, their attention is inconsistent rather than universally poor.&amp;quot; - 59 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fair description, although a better description would be that their attention is &amp;quot;inflexible.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with neurological difficulties, whether ADHD, head injuries, autism, fetal alcohol syndrome, forms of depression, or dementias, have varying degrees of neurological inflexibility . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurological flexibility is a sign of a healthy brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the ability to move attention from &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; forms of attention to &amp;quot;specific&amp;quot; forms of attention at will, in a fraction of a second. These various types of attention are objective and observable (with PETS, SPECTs, EEGs, QEEGs, and other technologies). People with ADD have difficulty moving from specific to global, or global to specific, styles of attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that inflexibility of attention is a marker of a neurological problem, though by itself is not diagnostic of any specific problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;First, ADHD is not a precisely circumscribed set of symptoms. The ever-present &amp;quot;often&amp;quot; in the diagnostic criteria betrays the loose boundaries of ADD, and it explains why Americans use the diagnosis so frequently. Almost anyone can squeeze into the parameters - at least on certain days.&amp;quot; - p 59 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement is also potentially misleading to the readers . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The ever-present &amp;#39;often&amp;#39; in the diagnostic criteria.&amp;quot; is very similar to the &amp;quot;ever present&amp;quot; &amp;quot;nearly every day&amp;quot; in the diagnostic criteria for Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;often&amp;quot; is simply a realistic description of life for individuals with ADHD. It is not &amp;quot;always&amp;quot; as with a structural head injury. It is &amp;quot;often&amp;quot; because it is the result of neurological mechanisms being &amp;quot;often&amp;quot; under-aroused and &amp;quot;often&amp;quot; under-performing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;. . . and it explains why Americans use the diagnosis so frequently.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that about 5% of the population has ADHD. Over-diagnosis, if there is any, is not due to the diagnostic criteria, but rather to a lack of a comprehensive diagnostic work-ups by most physicians. Many physicians are simply lazy or too rushed to make a careful diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Almost anyone can squeeze into the parameters - at least on certain days.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is misleading to the readers, and simply not true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the DSM-IV also includes these important, and highly discriminating, criteria: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Six or more symptoms of Inattention, having lasted at least six months , to a degree that is maladaptive ;&lt;br&gt;
• Six or more symptoms of Impulsivity-Hyperactivity, having lasted at least six months , to a degree that is maladaptive ;&lt;br&gt;
• Symptoms of the disorder were present before the age of seven ;&lt;br&gt;

• Impairment is present in a variety of settings ; and&lt;br&gt;
• There is clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that barely anyone can &amp;quot;squeeze into these parameters.&amp;quot; But about 5% of the population does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is careless to suggest that &amp;quot;anyone. at least on certain days&amp;quot; can meet the diagnostic criteria. It also conveys a negative picture of those who do actually suffer with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you publish a statement that read, &amp;quot;Almost anyone can squeeze into the parameters of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s - at least on certain days?&amp;quot; I would certainly hope not, and yet it is published in connection with ADHD. This is disappointing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Second, ADHD is a description of behavior, not an explanation . It tries to describe symptoms rather than explain the causes of those symptoms.&amp;quot; - 59 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again misleading, and out of context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the DSM-IV themselves point out that they make no attempts to describe the etiology of any of the 300 or more diagnostic categories ranging from Alzheimer&amp;#39;s to Trichotillomania. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not the purpose of the diagnostic criteria to explain the cause of a disorder, only to categorize the disorder in a realistic manner so that it can (1) be treated successfully, and (2) be researched effectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is from the research that we find the explanation of the causes of ADHD, not from the diagnostic criteria. It is also disappointing that no research in the field was noted, as it would have been helpful to your readers. This leads to the next quote from Mr. Welch: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The reason it is important to distinguish between description and explanation is that the ADHD literature typically does not distinguish between them. Most discussions about ADHD assume that the list of descriptions is equivalent to establishing a medical diagnosis.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that the purpose of the diagnostic criteria is to establish a medical diagnosis. And the purpose of the diagnosis is for successful treatment and efficient research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The popular assumption is that there is an underlying biological cause for the behaviors, but the assumption is unfounded. Although there are dozens of biological theories to explain ADHD, there are presently no physical markers for it; there are no medical tests that detect its presence. Food additives, birth and delivery problems, inner ear problems, and brain differences are only a few of the theories that are unsupported by evidence.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, in fact, biological causes for the behaviors. We cite just a few examples of the research below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what are these &amp;quot;behaviors&amp;quot; that we are talking about? The &amp;quot;behaviors&amp;quot; of the diagnostic criteria. We are not talking about behaviors with a moral basis such as hitting your sister. We are talking about the specific behaviors of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Although there are dozens of biological theories to explain ADHD, there are presently no physical markers for it;.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because there are dozens of theories, most of which will prove to be wrong and go away, does not mean that one (or more) of the theories are not accurate descriptions of reality. In fact, research shows that there are several &amp;quot;physical markers&amp;quot; of ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few articles, both from peer reviewed journals and from the media discussing peer reviewed journal articles, that might be of interest to your readers. They are just 15 studies or articles about the various biological underpinnings of ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is certainly not a comprehensive list, as there have probably been more than 200 similar studies published in the past ten years alone. These are just the studies that I looked up last weekend for another project and already had in my word processor: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Brain Scan Found Effective in Diagnosing Attention Disorder &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times Syndicate - December 16, 1999&lt;br&gt;
RICHARD SALTUS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans have identified a clear-cut chemical abnormality in people with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, a problem that makes life difficult for an estimated 3 to 5 percent of US schoolchildren, scientists say..&lt;br&gt;

It could be a first step toward a long-sought objective test for ADHD, say researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://neuroscience.about.com/science/neuroscience/library/pr/blpr991216c.htm?terms=attention+deficit+hyperactivity+disorder" title="http://neuroscience.about.com/science/neuroscience/library/pr/blpr991216c.htm?terms=attention+deficit+hyperactivity+disorder"&gt;http://neuroscience.about.com/science/neuroscience/library/pr/blpr991216...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Do executive function deficits differentiate between adolescents with ADHD and oppositional defiant/conduct disorder?

[Record supplied by publisher] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two neuropsychological measures of executive functions--Six Elements Tests (SET) and Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT)-were administered to 110 adolescents, aged 12-15 years. Participants comprised four groups: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) only (n = 35). ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder/Conduct Disorder (ODD/CD) (n = 38), ODD/CD only (n = 11), and a normal community control group (n = 26). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results indicated that adolescents with ADHD performed significantly worse on both the SET and HSCT than those without ADHD, whether or not they also had ODD/CD. The adolescents with ADHD and with comorbid ADHD and ODD/CD were significantly more impaired in their ability to generate strategies and to monitor their ongoing behavior compared with age-matched controls and adolescents with ODD/CD only. It is argued that among adolescents with clinically significant levels of externalizing behavior problems, executive function deficits are specific to those with ADHD. The findings support the sensitivity of these two relatively new tests of executive functions and their ecological validity in tapping into everyday situations, which are potentially problematic for individuals with ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Executive functions and developmental psychopathology. &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;J Child Psychol Psychiatry 1996 Jan;37(1):51-87&lt;br&gt;
Pennington BF, Ozonoff S&lt;br&gt;
Department of Psychology, University of Denver, CO 80208, USA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we consider the domain of executive functions (EFs) and their possible role in developmental psychopathologies. We first consider general theoretical and measurement issues involved in studying EFs and then review studies of EFs in four developmental psychopathologies: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD), autism, and Tourette syndrome (TS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our review reveals that EF deficits are consistently found in both ADHD and autism but not in CD (without ADHD) or in TS. Moreover, both the severity and profile of EF deficits appears to differ across ADHD and autism. Molar EF deficits are more severe in the latter than the former. In the few studies of more specific EF tasks, there are impairments in motor inhibition in ADHD but not in autism, whereas there are impairments in verbal working memory in autism but not ADHD. We close with a discussion of implications for future research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Brain Differences in Attention Deficit Disorder &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have strong new evidence that attention deficit disorder (ADD)--a condition in which children are hyperactive and have difficulty concentrating--stems from an abnormality in the brain. According to a report in today&amp;#39;s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, children with ADD have elevated nerve firing in a brain region involved in motor activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers found, Ritalin--the drug most commonly prescribed for the disorder--triggers a surprisingly different biochemical response in the brains of children with ADD than in those without the condition.&lt;br&gt;

There were significant negative correlations between Bmax and the Externalizing or Aggressive factors of the Child Behavior Checklist when the CD plus ADDH prepubertal patients were combined with their matched controls and within the adolescent inpatient group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that a decreased platelet imipramine binding Bmax value, as an index of disturbed presynaptic serotonergic activity, is not specific to depression and may be used as a biologic marker for the lack of behavioral constraint in heterogeneous. populations of psychiatric patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological findings in conduct disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 1994 Summer;6(3):245-9&lt;br&gt;

The CD + ADHD group had increased left-sided soft signs compared with the CD group. CD + ADHD subjects significantly underperformed CD subjects on several executive functioning measures, with no differences on Verbal IQ subtests. Results are discrepant with previous findings of deficient verbal functioning in delinquent populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;NIMH: Genetics Fact Sheets:Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phenotype:Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has its onset in childhood and is characterized by developmentally inappropriate degrees of inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiology: In a large sample from the U.S. population, the prevalence of ADHD (male: female ratio) in school-age children was 6.7 percent (5.1:1)[2]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the use of adaptive functioning ratings to define definite maladjustment, prevalence estimates of 6.6 percent and 9.5 percent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family Studies: Several studies demonstrate that ADHD aggregates in families [13-15]. The rates in probands&amp;#39; sibs in three older studies [16-18] ranged from 17 percent to 41 percent, with respective rates in controls&amp;#39; sibs ranging from zero to 8 percent [16, 17]. Rates of childhood ADHD in parents of hyperactive probands in several older studies ranged from 15 percent to 44 percent for fathers and 4 percent to 38 percent for mothers [19-22], although one study found no evidence of an increased rate of childhood ADHD in parents of ADHD probands &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twin Studies: Two small twin studies found that 4 of 4 [34] and 3 of 3 [35] MZ twins were concordant for ADHD. A larger twin study [33] reported respective MZ and dizygotic (DZ) probandwise concordance rates of 51 percent and 33 percent, with a heritability estimate of 64 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption Studies: Increased rates of hyperactivity or a history of hyperactivity have been found among both adopted-away sibs of children with ADHD [43] and the biological parents of hyperactive boys compared with controls [21, 44, 45]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mode of Inheritance: Deutsch and colleagues found limited evidence in a small sample [46] for an incompletely penetrant autosomal dominant single major locus transmission. A segregation analysis of a different data set [25] also resulted in statistical evidence -- including estimates of transmission parameters that were not significantly different from Mendelian expectations -- for an incompletely penetrant dominant or additive autosomal single major locus [47]. Low penetrance estimates predicted that only 46 percent of boys and 31 percent of girls with the ADHD gene would develop the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular Genetic Studies: A population-based association study reported evidence of an association between ADHD and an allele at the dopamine D2 receptor gene on 11q (p = 0.0003) [48], but this finding has not been replicated and was most likely an artifact of population stratification. The Tranmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) [49] was used in a family-based association study to identify an association between ADHD and a specific allele at the dopamine transporter locus on 5p (p = 0.006) [50]. Another population-based association study found an association between ADHD and an allele at the dopamine D4 receptor on 11p (p = 0.01) [51]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/genetics.htm#gen12a" title="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/genetics.htm#gen12a"&gt;http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/genetics.htm#gen12a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Quantitative EEG and Auditory Event-Related Potentials in the Evaluation of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Effects of Methylphenidate and Implications for Neurofeedback Training &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.

University of Tennessee &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurophysiological correlates of Attention Deficit Disorder with and without Hyperactivity (ADD/HD) and effects of methylphenidate are explored using electroencephalographic (EEG) and auditory eventrelated potentials (ERPs). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first of four studies, a database of ADD/HD individuals of varying ages and matched adolescent/adult controls is presented. Study 2 compares controls and age-matched children with ADD, and children with ADHD on and off methylphenidate. Study 3 examines habituation of the auditory ERPs of controls and children with ADHD both on and off methylphenidate. The relationship between successful neurofeedback training and EEG changes is presented in Study 4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these studies support a neurologic basis for AD/HD and raise questions regarding the role of methylphenidate in modulating cortical processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Establishing an EEG Norm-Base for ADD v. non-ADD &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review of a journal article by Troy Janzen, Ken Graap, Stephan Stephanson, Wilma Marshall, and George Fitzsimmons, &amp;quot;Differences in Baseline EEG Measures for ADD and Normally Achieving Preadolescent Males&amp;quot; Biofeedback and Self-Regulation, Vol. 20, No. 1, 1995, pp. 65-82. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three well known tests (WISC-R, WRMT-R, WRAT-R) were administered to all subjects prior to the main part of the study, a series of cognitive tests performed while connected to a 19 lead EEG cap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most consistent finding was that ADD subjects have significantly higher theta amplitudes (p &amp;lt; .05) for all sites at both baseline and while performing cognitive tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also differences in the ratios of theta to beta and theta to SMR for baseline and all tasks at all sites, but the differences were significant only for some tasks at the parietal sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raw beta and SMR amplitudes themselves were not significantly different between the two groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that although the number of subjects was small, there were significant differences that could be observed. These findings form a starter set of data for additional efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;ADHD PET Scan &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scan images produced by positron emision tomography (PET) show differences between an adult with Attention deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (right) and an adult free of the disease (left). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: Alan Zametkin, M.D.&lt;br&gt;

Department of Psychology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A random population sample of 1479 Chinese boys from Hong Kong was screened and diagnosed in a two-stage epidemiological study. Four groups, age 7-8, were distinguished: (1) a pure hyperactive group (HA), (2) a mixed hyperactive/conduct-disordered group (HA+CD), (3) a pure conduct-disordered group (CD), and (4) a normal control group (N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a visual search task, only the HA children showed a specific processing deficit in performance. This confirms the diagnostic value of such a deficit for hyperactivity, differentiating it from conduct disorder. The failure to find a similar deficit in the HA+CD group raises questions concerning the clinical identity of these children. Each group showed a performance decrement over time in the visual search task but the decrement did not differ between the four groups. This observation is not congruent with the reports of a short attention span in hyperactive children; explanations of this apparent contradiction are considered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Researchers Identify Key Area of Brain Implicated in Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 28, 2000 McLean Hospital AScribe Newswire &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BELMONT, Mass., March 28 (AScribe News) -- Researchers at McLean Hospital, using a new brain imaging technique they developed, have identified a key area of the brain that is underactive in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The technique, a new form of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), also enabled the researchers to show how Ritalin restored function in ADHD children who were demonstrably hyperactive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://neuroscience.about.com/science/neuroscience/library/pr/blpr000328.htm?terms=attention+deficit+hyperactivity+disorder" title="http://neuroscience.about.com/science/neuroscience/library/pr/blpr000328.htm?terms=attention+deficit+hyperactivity+disorder"&gt;http://neuroscience.about.com/science/neuroscience/library/pr/blpr000328...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The role of genetic factors in conduct disorder based on studies of Tourette syndrome and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder probands and their relatives. &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;J Dev Behav Pediatr 1995 Jun;16(3):142-57&lt;br&gt;

When significant, the latter rules out ascertainment bias and inappropriate controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For TS, the results were significant with most p values less than 10(-8). The same trends were seen in the smaller number of ADHD families. A polygenic model is proposed in which TS and ADHD alone represent lesser degrees of genetic loading and expression, and TS + CD not equal to ADHD represents a higher degree of genetic loading and expression of genes common to all three disorders. These studies emphasize the important role of genetic factors in ODD and CD. The therapeutic implications are discussed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;New genetic link to ADHD &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sep 15 (Reuters Health) - Researchers have found a gene alteration that may contribute to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in some children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk levels associated with the new alteration, in the dopamine receptor gene DRD4, are similar to those linked to a previously identified variant of DRD4, the researchers note.&lt;br&gt;

Walker AJ, Shores EA, Trollor JN, Lee T, Sachdev PS&lt;br&gt;
Neuropsychiatric Institute, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuropsychological functioning of adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was compared to that of healthy controls and individuals with mild psychiatric disorders including attentional complaints. Thirty adults in each group were examined on the Conners&amp;#39; Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and measures of attention, executive function, psychomotor speed, and arithmetic skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


































































































&lt;blockquote&gt;The ADHD group performed lower than healthy controls on most measures. However when compared to the psychiatric group, the performances of the ADHD group were not significantly lower on any of the measures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://mentalhelp.net/adhd/research/" title="http://mentalhelp.net/adhd/research/"&gt;http://mentalhelp.net/adhd/research/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, these studies focus on different issues, though most examine either executive functions, or the locations of the brain involved in executive functions, attention, or memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be hard to conclude that because there are several neurological differences in the brains of ADHD individuals vs. non-ADHD individuals, that somehow that equated to there being no neurological differences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The popular assumption is that there is an underlying biological cause for the behaviors, but the assumption is unfounded. Although there are dozens of biological theories to explain ADD, there are presently no physical markers for it; there are no medical tests that detect its presence. Food additives, birth and delivery problems, inner ear problems, and brain differences are only a few of the theories that are. unsupported by evidence.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;. . . there are presently no physical markers for it;&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown above, this statement is not supported by research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many physical markers for it. One just needs a fMRI, SPECT scan, QEEG, or PET scan, to see them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have personally performed hundreds of EEGs and some QEEGs, and can attest first hand to the differences in brainwave patterns of ADD ADHD individuals vs. non-ADD ADHD subjects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;. . . there are no medical tests that detect its presence.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also misleading to the readers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, if not most, biologically based medical conditions are diagnosed by the observation and experience of a trained clinician or physician. Many medical conditions have no &amp;quot;medical tests&amp;quot; that detect its presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I am presently house-bound recovering from pneumonia which has nearly killed me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until July, 2000, there were no &amp;quot;medical tests&amp;quot; that detect the presence of pneumonia. Just last summer a urine test was approved by the FDA which is between 75% and 80% accurate in diagnosing pneumonia. There are no blood tests, or other forms of &amp;quot;medical tests&amp;quot; to diagnose it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pneumonia was diagnosed solely on the observation and experience of the physician, after another physician the day before examined me and told me I had the flu. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctor who made the life-saving diagnosis listened to my breathing and coughing. He observed and interpreted a chest x-ray. Then he made a judgment, a diagnosis, based on observation and experience (not on empirical, objective results from any medical tests), and began treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The x-ray, my coughing, etc., gave him evidence of a condition only. He had no &amp;quot;medical tests&amp;quot; (he did not try the new urine test) to tell him if I had viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, or mycoplasmic pneumonia. Yet based on observation and experience he started a course of treatment. The treatment involved the use of powerful medications, and the treatment has so far been beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there are no blood tests - &amp;quot;medical tests&amp;quot; - to diagnose pneumonia is hardly evidence that I am not suffering from a medical condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD is also diagnosed by clinicians through observation and experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinician would rely on developmental, family, academic, and genetic histories, behavioral rating scales, and objective testing. There are tests, psychological and neurocognitive tests, that are extremely helpful in making a diagnosis, such as continuous performance tests and other tests of executive functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t any blood or urine tests - &amp;quot;medical tests&amp;quot; - as Mr. Welch would say. But that does not invalidate the biological basis for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;There are some medical problems that can provoke ADD symptoms. For example, thyroid problems can affect energy level, and hearing or visual impairments can make paying attention difficult.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, these are true. But they describe thyroid problems, and hearing or visual problems, completely separate medical conditions which happen to share some symptoms with ADHD. They do not cause Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Depression and anxiety can cause symptoms that look like ADD, but they are not ADD. A head injury can cause symptoms that look like ADD, but a head injury is not ADD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neurological problems that cause ADHD are the cause of ADHD. Mr. Welch is simply unwilling to admit that there is a neurological, biological, physiological basis for a very real condition called ADHD. His position, however, is not supported by the reality presented in the research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;That a stimulant drug would help some children focus seems paradoxical. You would expect that children would be even more physically and mentally excitable when taking it.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the effects of Ritalin, or any stimulant including caffeine, are not &amp;quot;paradoxical&amp;quot; in ADHD individuals. They are predictable. And they are effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two significant contributors to ADHD are a lack of dopamine, or an effective lack of dopamine, in the frontal lobes, and a restriction of blood flow in the frontal lobes. Research supports this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulants, from caffeine to Ritalin, are known to do two things well: increase blood flow, and increase dopamine levels in the brain. Therefore it is not paradoxical at all. One would expect that stimulants would increase performance for individuals with this condition, and they do in about 75% to 80% of the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;One thing, however, is clear. Ritalin does not treat any known chemical deficiency in a child&amp;#39;s brain.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What research supports this position? Why is this &amp;quot;clear?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritalin does in fact &amp;quot;treat known chemical (deficiencies) in a child&amp;#39;s brain.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does in fact increase the utilization of dopamine. This is similar to other medications, such as antidepressants, used treat other known brain chemical deficiencies such as a lack of seratonin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is true that stimulants to not &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; the condition, this does not take away from its usefulness. Insulin does not &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; diabetes either. But in the short-term stimulants, like Insulin, works to &amp;quot;normalize&amp;quot; or at least &amp;quot;improve&amp;quot; the situation. To say that stimulants &amp;quot;are not a cure&amp;quot; is true. Insulin is not a &amp;quot;cure&amp;quot; either. But both are helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time in considering this perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, &lt;/p&gt;

Bold or cautious? Individuals with a particular gene variant are very curious -- 

but only in some populations.

Research shows that personality variations are heritable in humans and other animal species, and there are many hypotheses as to why differences in personality exist and are maintained. One approach for investigating the heritability of personality lies in identifying which genes underlie specific personality traits so scientists can then determine how the frequencies of specific variants of personality-related genes change in both space and time as well as in relation to changing environmental influences.

I forgot to put my CDs in the car this time so, for almost the entire drive, I was forced to listen to country radio stations. Within one hour, I found at least segments of programming that highlight some of my main issues with religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first was a program for “Christian women” which was essentially a segment on anti-feminism; Be subservient to your husband kinda things. That alone is enough to irk me pretty well, but heaped on top of that, the host (a woman herself) then made comments about how, unless you followed Biblical rules and were such a woman, you weren't a “real” woman or a good woman. She claimed that, unless a woman did this, she could never be fulfilled and every endeavor of hers would be subject to failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many people claim that religion is not falsifiable, but comments like this are easily testable. I think I know a few good women who are not “with Christ” that are fulfilled in ways the host will never be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another program was on a spiritual method of investigating how “God is acting in your life.” The way it works is a person will keep a journal, noting the high points and low points of their day. Then, after some time, they should look back over it and try to discover how God was helping them in their life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holy confirmation bias, Batman!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is just the sort of sloppy thinking that pisses me off. Any other practice that would suggest throwing basic logic out the window and encouraged this sort of retroactive interpretation based on... oh, no evidence would just be laughed at outright. But in religion, it's considered deep and intelligent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last topic was on more of a conservative talk news. The big topic right now is Obama not unilaterally supporting Israel in their desire to do new building in contested territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not going to pretend for an instant I'm knowledgeable enough to weigh in on the base situation. But for the way the argument was made on this program, I really don't need to, to realize there was something seriously insane about the approach the commentators were taking. The entire argument was that Israel is our ally, thus we must support them &lt;i&gt;no.matter.what&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Huh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't know what's going on with the situation and openly admit that it needs a careful look to really decide whether it should be supported or not, but the point is, it needs a look. We don't blindly charge in with support without checking to make sure our allies are still acting in good faith and in manners of deserving to be our allies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of daring to question and actually analyze, the commentators simply said that “we should follow Israel no matter what because the Bible says so and any nation that's gone against them historically, hasn't fared too well.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really? We shouldn't choose our allies based on actual thinking and the good of international peace, but instead because God commands it.... when we're a secular nation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, religious non-thinking is leaking into places that take religion out of the realm of being just silly and closer to being dangerous on an international level.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-7278455175645004511?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270744345716"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=13436">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b5b0fe510a8200af</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Area 51"/><category term="UFOs"/><title type="html">Area 51 used to – GASP – test secret planes, not flying saucers</title><published>2010-04-08T16:22:09Z</published><updated>2010-04-08T16:22:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/08/area-51-used-to-gasp-test-secret-planes-not-flying-saucers/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/ufos_zapping.jpg" alt="ufos_zapping" title="ufos_zapping" width="300" height="177"&gt;When the topic of flying saucers comes up, someone inevitably talks about the government’s secret installation in the Nevada desert called Area 51. The base has been public knowledge for a long time, though I suspect a lot of folks heard about it through the movie &amp;quot;Independence Day&amp;quot;. The idea is that the alien spaceships that crashed at Roswell New Mexico and other sites were carted off to Area 51, and the technology there examined and reverse engineered to create a lot of modern tech today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can just guess what I think of this &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ll spell it out: it’s nonsense. Yes, Area 51 exists, but the idea that we keep alien tech there is pretty silly. First, all our technology has a clear line of antecedents; the transistor, velcro, smart metals, and so on didn’t just pop up &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt; as some UFO enthusiasts claim.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Second, we have a simpler and more logical line of reasoning here. We know that the military has a black budget to create advanced tech. They don’t want our enemies to know what’s going on, and the Nevada desert is pretty isolated. When the news came out that a base was out there, of course the government’s first line of defense is to deny it. When the rumors and evidence pile up, they admit it exists, but won’t say what it’s for. &lt;em&gt;Of course they don’t!&lt;/em&gt; That’s kinda the point of it being a secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we know that advanced tech comes from the military; the SR 71 Blackbird is an incredible piece of engineering, and it was designed in the 1960s. Stealth tech can be thought of in a similar way, and it’s decades old as well. They are clearly designing amazing stuff at Area 51 and perhaps other locations, and this is exactly the sort of hardware that we need to keep secret. Like it or not, there are bad guys out there who would love to see America fall, and this kind of technology helps prevent that from happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/11/www_alien_mccain.jpg" alt="Weekly World News: Alien cries for McCain" title="Weekly World News: Alien cries for McCain" width="375" height="200"&gt;Jumping from that to harboring aliens and their flying saucers is a wee bit of jump of logic. Of course, I have said for years that I’m sure the government loves the UFO rumors, since it takes the pressure off the real secrets there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it goes: &lt;a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/nation/area-51area-51-veterans-dispel-rumors-about-space-aliens-497606.html"&gt;an article in the Statesman&lt;/a&gt; corroborates that view. Several Area 51 vets have come out and discussed recently declassified information. My favorite bit is at the very end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Area 51 radar specialist] Barnes thinks the Air Force and the CIA didn’t mind the stories about alien spacecraft. They helped cover up the real secret planes that were being tested.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ya think? Anyway, while I may not be happy with everything that supposedly goes on at Area 51, I can be reasonably — stress the word &lt;em&gt;reasonably&lt;/em&gt; — sure that it involves stuff developed right here on good old planet Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

From Dirks et al, 2010.

A little less than two million years ago, in what is now South Africa, a torrential downpour washed the bodies of two humans into the deep recesses of a cave. Just how their remains came to be in the cave in the first place is a mystery. Perhaps they fell in through the gaping hole in the cave roof just as hyenas, saber-toothed cats, horses, and other animals had, but, however the humans entered the cave, their bones ultimately came to rest in a natural bowl carved into the rock. This mode of preservation would keep their remains in good condition until their discovery in 2008, and today in the journal Science a team of researchers has described them as the latest addition to our family tree, Australopithecus sediba.

While we're on the subject of bonobos, it's worth mentioning that readers in Durham, NC are in for a treat from April 14-17  as the Blue Devils host 'Primate Palooza'--an initiative to raise awareness for primates. Internationally renowned conservationist Claudine André will be speaking at the university.  From the press release:

 

André founded and runs the world’s only sanctuary and release program for orphaned bonobos in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, are our closest living relative and are highly endangered. However, unlike chimpanzees and humans, bonobos are the only ape that has found a way to maintain peace in their groups.

"Having Claudine here at Duke is a wonderful opportunity to share with students and the general public the difference a single individual can make," says Duke researcher Brian Hare. "Claudine has done more for bonobo conservation than anyone else in the world. If you want to meet a conservation heroine this is your chance."
These events are open to the public:

&lt;p&gt;I always think it’s a bad sign if a man doesn’t pick up the check, at least on the first couple of dates. I never let this be a deal breaker for me, but I’ve also never walked away from a date where I had to pay for myself feeling good. That’s no way to start a relationship. I should have heeded my feelings. In every case, those men who betrayed a lack of fiscal generosity at the outset exhibited an emotional one down the road. Monetary stinginess and emotional withholding go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dated those men so you don’t have to. I won’t tell you not to go out with a man who lets you pony up your share of the check, but I will tell you to tuck that information away. He’s giving you a message when he takes your money, be it ten dollars or fifty. If he’s unwilling to share his wealth (no matter how much or little he has), I suspect that he’ll be unable to share his heart in any real and satisfying way. A man should plan a date within his means (pretending he has more than he does adds dishonesty to the already mounting problems), and pay for it. There are fun, romantic places to go at any price point. There’s nothing so unromantic as the Dutch treat – a date so unsexy you may as well wear wooden shoes on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument that the women’s movement has confused this issue is utter nonsense. The idea that feminists burn bras and take offense at chivalry is a fallacy perpetrated by those who wish to hold us back. Feminism is about women being empowered to do anything they want to do, be it running the House or staying at home. There’s no power in buying dinner. The powerful one is always the one who is being courted. As it is in business, so it is in romance – the client doesn’t buy. Eventually, the host benefits from the client’s resources, but he has to woo her first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This custom may have been born out of an all-but-dead tradition of the male breadwinner, but it’s still valid, because what money signifies holds much more currency than actual dollar signs. In the early stages of courtship, the price of dinner is not a down payment; rather, it’s a way of saying: &lt;em&gt;I want to take care of you&lt;/em&gt;. Not financially, but in all the ways we support each other in healthy relationships. The man has to make that declaration first, just as it’s the man who has to ask for the date, call after it, and make all the pursuing moves. It’s been roundly established that feminism hasn’t altered that, nor should it. Feminism is about women having choices. And I choose to date a generous man.&lt;/p&gt;

However, they want to be cool. And you can help – here are some easy ways to raise cool kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy them stylish clothes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Stay up-to-date with the latest trends. Buy your kids the most popular brand name clothing in the coolest styles whenever possible. Money should be no object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get them an iPhone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though most schools have rules against calling/texting during school hours, you should buy your young child an iPhone to flash around on the playground and on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="soccer" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/soccer.jpg" alt="Soccer" width="300" height="244"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: sxc.hu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign them up for sports.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get your kids into sports at a young age. Sports will keep them healthy, active, and popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attend every party possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t turn down any invitations for birthday parties or sleepovers. This will ensure your child stays social and in-the-know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All kidding aside, if you teach your kids the importance of honesty, respect, humor, kindness, and individuality, they’ll grow up to be very well-rounded. Foster their self esteem, involve them in extra curricular activities, and show them lots of unconditional love. Then they’ll be cool where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

Hasn't that been a constant refrain over the years from public health authorities? Certainly, I have. The benefits of eating fruits and vegetables have been widely touted, and seemingly with good reason. A diet high in fruits and vegetables, it is said, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. In the case of the latter, it as claimed that potential decreases in the risks of some cancers could be as high as 50% a day. As a result, the National Cancer Institute developed the 5-A-Day program, whose goal was to increase people's consumption of fruits and vegetables to five or more servings a day. Indeed, on the NCI website, this effort is described thusly:

In 1981, Doll and Peto concluded that about 35 percent of all cancer deaths were related to nutrition, with a plausible range of 10 to 70 percent.26 This conclusion was driven largely by data on dietary behaviors that might increase risk. Evidence for the role of plant foods in cancer risk coalesced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, based on summaries of the epidemiologic literature specific to the relationship between vegetables and fruit and cancer.

The evidence supporting the role of vegetables and fruit in cancer prevention provided a foundation for several documents that were the basis of national nutrition policy in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1982, the National Research Council (NRC) published the seminal document, Diet, Nutrition and Cancer, which summarized the research literature on the relationship between various chronic diseases and dietary patterns.36 Other Federal documents followed such as Healthy People 2000, the first Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition, Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the Food Guide Pyramid.

There's no doubt that diet is critically important to health, but does it have that dramatic an effect on cancer, with a possible effect size potentially as large as 70%? Answering that question has been difficult and has been very dependent on the methodology of the studies used to address the question. Studies have been conflicting regarding the existence and magnitude of benefit of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables when it comes to preventing cancer. Enter the EPIC Study (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition), whose results were just published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI) this week and have made the news all over the world, with some news stories having titles like Fruit and vegetables have little effect on cancer risk, study finds. Is it true? Should you stop worrying about eating five portions a day of fruits and vegetables. (Given how bad I am at trying to be healthy, I never came close to that on an average day, anyway.)

It&amp;#39;s a part of quack medicine that&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; medicine. Real medicine is based on scientific evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many people don't know what homeopathy is all about. They confuse homeopathy with a host of other forms of non evidence-based medicine like naturopathy and herbalism. That's a big mistake. Homeopathy is a form of treatment where you drink water that supposed to contain the magical imprint of some chemical. The chemical is often quite dangerous but, don't be worried, it's not really present in the treatment you pay for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's the Wikipedia description of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Homeopathy (also spelled homoeopathy or homœopathy) is a form of alternative medicine, first proposed by German physician Samuel Hahnemann in 1796, that attempts to treat patients with heavily diluted preparations. Based on an ipse dixit[1]  axiom[2]  formulated by Hahnemann which he called the "law of similars", preparations which cause certain symptoms in healthy individuals are given as the treatment for patients exhibiting similar symptoms. Homeopathic remedies are prepared by serial dilution with shaking by forceful striking, which homeopaths term "succussion," after each dilution under the assumption that this increases the effect of the treatment. Homeopaths call this process "potentization". Dilution often continues until none of the original substance remains.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Don't confuse it with anything else. There's absolutely no evidence that homeopathy works. The scientific data, taken as a whole, is conclusive. Be wary of those who believe in homeopathy because their advice on other forms of treatment may not be based on evidence either. Homeopathy is bad enough but it often keeps even worse company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-5495705790276887765?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270734787191"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13298">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/38e9c1c60edbdd5f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 4.8</title><published>2010-04-08T13:15:22Z</published><updated>2010-04-08T13:15:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/skepchick-quickies-4-8/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: What is a sellable idea? How do you develop one? Is your idea enough for a book, is there more you can do to develop it, or should it just be a magazine article or series of blog posts? This will be a hands-on nuts and bolts workshop: Come with ideas to pitch. Better yet, bring a &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; (1 page or less) written proposal to read and workshop. This workshop will provide handouts on proposal writing as well as sample proposals you can use to help develop your own in the future. Useful for anyone hoping to someday write for print or online publications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_writing_fo_5.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/szzNkjTa1zs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270732918972"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=173694">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8fa1202b99808db</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="Dead or Alive"/><category term="Dead or Alive Paradise"/><category term="DOA Paradise"/><category term="video game"/><category term="X-Play"/><title type="html">You Know You're Unwell If … You Play "Dead or Alive Paradise"</title><published>2010-04-08T12:05:47Z</published><updated>2010-04-08T12:05:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/you-know-youre-unwell-if-%e2%80%a6-you-play-dead-or-alive-paradise/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/93508520060913screen003bp7.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hasn't that been a constant refrain over the years from public health authorities? Certainly, I have. The benefits of eating fruits and vegetables have been widely touted, and seemingly with good reason. A diet high in fruits and vegetables, it is said, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. In the case of the latter, it as claimed that potential decreases in the risks of some cancers could be as high as 50% a day. As a result, the National Cancer Institute developed the &lt;a href="http://dccps.nci.nih.gov/5ad_3_origins.html"&gt;5-A-Day&lt;/a&gt; program, whose goal was to increase people's consumption of fruits and vegetables to five or more servings a day. Indeed, on the NCI website, this effort is described thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1981, Doll and Peto concluded that about 35 percent of all cancer deaths were related to nutrition, with a plausible range of 10 to 70 percent.26 This conclusion was driven largely by data on dietary behaviors that might increase risk. Evidence for the role of plant foods in cancer risk coalesced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, based on summaries of the epidemiologic literature specific to the relationship between vegetables and fruit and cancer.

&lt;p&gt;The evidence supporting the role of vegetables and fruit in cancer prevention provided a foundation for several documents that were the basis of national nutrition policy in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1982, the National Research Council (NRC) published the seminal document, Diet, Nutrition and Cancer, which summarized the research literature on the relationship between various chronic diseases and dietary patterns.36 Other Federal documents followed such as Healthy People 2000, the first Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition, Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the Food Guide Pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt that diet is critically important to health, but does it have that dramatic an effect on cancer, with a possible effect size potentially as large as 70%? Answering that question has been difficult and has been very dependent on the methodology of the studies used to address the question. Studies have been conflicting regarding the existence and magnitude of benefit of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables when it comes to preventing cancer. Enter the &lt;a href="http://epic.iarc.fr/"&gt;EPIC Study&lt;/a&gt; (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition), whose results were just &lt;a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/djq072"&gt;published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI)&lt;/a&gt; this week and have made the news all over the world, with some news stories having titles like &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/07/fruit-vegetables-cancer-protection"&gt;Fruit and vegetables have little effect on cancer risk, study finds&lt;/a&gt;. Is it true? Should you stop worrying about eating five portions a day of fruits and vegetables. (Given how bad I am at trying to be healthy, I never came close to that on an average day, anyway.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/eat_your_fruit_and_veggies.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/eat_your_fruit_and_veggies.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/458uHWQvQDg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270730891060"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1826">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7c849c477cb80fce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="Buttar"/><category term="Hammesfahr"/><category term="health care freedom"/><title type="html">Springtime for Charlatans</title><published>2010-04-08T12:46:46Z</published><updated>2010-04-08T12:46:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1826" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine a ring of car thieves lobbying the government to soften the laws against stealing cars. Don’t blame the thieves – people should be more responsible for their own cars, and that is just the chance you take when you own a car. Under the radar, without any comment by the media, in state after state they successfully lobby the legislatures to pass laws that make it more difficult to prosecute and punish car thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is outrageous, but not just because it’s silly to consider that something like stealing a car should not be a serious crime. It is also outrageous for someone who is violating regulations to lobby for those very regulations to be weakened so that they can continue to break the regulations without fear of action being taken against them. At the very least such action should garner significant attention and debate, and lawmakers should consider carefully if the public’s best interest is being met, or simply the person who doesn’t want to be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what is happening in many states with so-called “&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=280"&gt;health care freedom laws&lt;/a&gt;” – practitioners of dubious treatments are lobbying state legislatures to weaken regulations against practicing dubious treatments. There are even specific cases in which an individual practitioner was found to be practicing below the acceptable standard of care, but was able to escape regulation because of laws specifically passed to protect substandard care. This is exactly what happened with &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=351#more-351"&gt;Dr. William Hammesfahr&lt;/a&gt; – he was found to be practicing substandard care by the State of Florida, but was able to appeal and win on the grounds that his treatment was “alternative” and therefore magically exempt from the standard of care under Florida’s new health care freedom law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing has now happened with respect to Dr. Rashid Buttar – the North Carolina Medical Board (NCMB) has been investigating him for charging patients tens of thousands of dollars for dubious treatment for cancer, autism, and other indications. These includes using chelation therapy for autism, based upon the discredited notion that autism is mercury toxicity.  The NCMB was making their case that Buttar was using questionable, and at best highly speculative and experimental treatments, while misleading patients into thinking they were effective (creating undue expectations) and charging exorbitant amounts. In fact a board of inquiry recommended that Buttar have his license restricted so that he cannot treat children or cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that recommendation was set aside for technical reasons. While a hearing before a judge was pending, Buttar and others successfully lobbied the North Carlina legislature to &lt;a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2010/03/31/1347104/reprimand-lets-doctor-continue.html"&gt;pass a health care freedom law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mansfield, the board’s attorney, said a change in state law, which took  effect in October, was partly the reason. The law, one of those that  Buttar had pushed for, prevents the medical board from disciplining a  physician for using non-traditional or experimental treatments unless it  can prove they are ineffective or more harmful that prevailing  treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially the hands of the NCMB were tied, in the middle of their investigation of Buttar, and he was let off the hook with a slap on the wrist. He is now free to continue to practice his dubious medicine on the unsuspecting patients of North Carolina and beyond. The board now has the burden of proof that a treatment is ineffective, which is impossible for treatments that have not been adequately studied. In fact, such laws create another disincentive for practitioners of dubious modalities to study their treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Standard of Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this into perspective, we need to back up and discuss the standard of care. Practicing medicine is a profession, which means we grant certain individuals the privilege of practicing but demand from them certain assurances, ethical guidelines, and standards. Without a standard of care, then anything would be fair game and the principle of caveat emptor would rule. If that is what the majority of our society really wants, then so be it. But I don’t think that is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we agree that there should be some standard of care, then the only question then is how to determine what that standard should be and how to enforce it. For the most part, the standard is determined by the prevailing accepted practice among experts, which in turn should be based upon scientific evidence. Practitioners are expected to know what the standard of care is and to abide by it, unless they have a very good reason for doing otherwise (and are willing to defend their actions in court). In the US each state has a medical board tasked with investigating any practitioners who are alleged to be practicing significantly below the standard of care. In my experience they do not micromanage or get involved in minor cases, but only egregious violations of well accepted standards. It takes a lot to get their attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the standard of care is being steadily eroded in this country, without any media attention or public debate. Practitioners of substandard or dubious methods are successfully lobbying their state legislatures to weaken the boards of health that are supposed to maintain the standard of care. They call what they are advocating “health care freedom” and claim it is the freedom of patients to get whatever treatment they want. But in reality it is freedom for practitioners to practice whatever they want – even outright deception and quackery – without being held to any standard. In most states, as in the slap on the wrist for Buttar, all that is required is that patients are informed that the treatment is “alternative” – but “alternative” is not defined. It’s basically anything the practitioner wants it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some states specific treatments or practices are targeted. For example, recently Connecticut passed a law &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=551"&gt;exempting practitioners who treat chronic lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; from the standard of care. Chelation therapists have also been successful in protecting their pseudoscientific practices. But increasingly, blanket exemption is being granted to anything “alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard of care is vitally important in our complex health care system. We should be looking for ways to enhance it, not erode it. Ineffective treatments victimize patients and are a waste of resources. It is unethical to charge large sums of money for experimental treatments by creating an expectation of benefit, and in fact experimental treatments should only be given as part of research protocols, or under strict conditions of compassionate care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Buttar, Hammesfahr, and others have created a lucrative practice out of dubious treatments and have successfully hidden behind laws specifically designed to hamper state regulators. In Buttar’s case he apparently lobbied for such laws while under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media is nowhere on this issue. The public is largely unaware. No one I speak to (outside my small group of colleagues) has any idea this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also part of a broader problem – by labeling unscientific or questionable practices (what used to be called “health fraud”) as “alternative” or “complementary”, charlatans have succeeded in getting appointed as the foxes in charge of the hen house. They are now their own gatekeepers in the bizarro world of CAM. On some morbid level I have to admire their chutzpah – they have pulled off the greatest scam in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three cool pieces of science have been retrieved from the depths.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the L'Atalante basin, one of the Mediterranean sea's deep hypersaline anoxic basins, anoxic metazoans have &lt;a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/30/abstract"&gt;been discovered&lt;/a&gt;. That means multicellular beings like you, Dear Reader, who live without oxygen. They're &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loricifera"&gt;loriciferans&lt;/a&gt;, Sw. &lt;i&gt;korsettdjur&lt;/i&gt;, each less than a millimetre long.  Instead of breathing like you, aided by endosymbiotic mitochondria, these beasties have another kind of power plant inside their cells similar to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenosome"&gt;hydrogenosomes&lt;/a&gt;, that is, they're chemotrophic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bog on the high wooded hills of temperate Hanveden near Stockholm, my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/02/ancient_beetles_will_date_meso.php"&gt;Mesolithic friends&lt;/a&gt; have now lifted sediment drill cores in which a paleobotanist has found seeds of Alpine mouse-ear chickweed, &lt;i&gt;Cerastium alpinum, fjällarv&lt;/i&gt;. In a letter, Roger Wikell remarks that when those little flowers bloomed, the hilltop was a island in the Yoldia sea, part of an archipelago far from the mainland, and the retreating edge of the inland ice was not far away. Today, Alpine mouse-ear chickweed is a common feature of the mountain flora in northernmost Sweden around the polar circle. The various names of the plant all speak of frigid mountaintops.&lt;br&gt;

Here I describe his lecture to the second-year class on legal and ethical aspects of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. P began his lecture by describing CAM using the now-familiar &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/overview.htm#types"&gt;NCCAM classification&lt;/a&gt;. He gave the NCCAM definition of CAM as “a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.” To illustrate how this definition can lead to surprises, he asked us if the therapeutic use of maggots is CAM or conventional. Although it sounds rather CAM-ish, maggot therapy is used at some surgical centers for wound debridement, he told us, and therefore is part of “conventional medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to be surprised that thoughtful fans of CAM use this garbage pail definition (anything that doesn’t fit into conventional medicine), because it means that (1) no quackery can be easily excluded from the CAM tent and (2) the only common thread among the sundry modalities is a lack of acceptance from the mainstream medical community. One of Dr. P’s case studies of ethical challenges in CAM use involved a patient’s family that insisted on treating his persistent vegetative state with hyperbaric oxygen therapy — the utility of which Dr. P was highly doubtful — and later Dr. P mentioned intravenous chelation therapy as an example of a CAM treatment that he considered high-risk (compared to, say, parsley supplements). However, both hyperbaric oxygen and IV chelation have uncontroversial indications. Why are they called CAM when used in certain diseases? Presumably only because they are so poorly supported or implausible in those contexts as to be shunned by the medical community, the same community that apparently has adopted as weird (dare I say, unconventional) a therapy as maggot debridement. That maggots won acceptance leads me to be &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; skeptical of any therapy currently defined as CAM, particularly an old one (it still hasn’t been proven). Dr. P appears more optimistic than I, because he seems to interpret the same story as a reason to stay open-minded about most CAM therapies (it still might be proven).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the last time, Dr. P stressed that advocacy for use of CAM/IM was not a goal of his lecture. I infer from many of the points and tangential comments he made throughout the lecture, however, that he has a goal of normalizing CAM/IM for us. A frequent refrain was that some ethical precept or legal consideration regarding CAM use was “just the same” as for conventional medicine. Often I agreed with him — all therapeutic options should meet the same standards of efficacy and safety, and many ethical or legal concerns are common for either conventional or alternative approaches — but some of his comparisons seemed questionable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, after acknowledging that “&lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/GenerallyRecognizedasSafeGRAS/default.htm"&gt;generally recognized as safe&lt;/a&gt;” substances may have unexpected side effects when taken as high-dose supplements (he gave the example of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedra"&gt;ephedra&lt;/a&gt;), Dr. P suggested that in many cases the physician can monitor a patient for side effects while using the supplement, just like we do for patients using pharmaceuticals. Outside of a research context, I would argue that most such monitoring is done for previously characterized adverse effects (e.g., known effects of statins or neuroleptics) and as such can be done more effectively and efficiently than screening for unknown reactions from a mystery drug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At one point he mentioned that we accept the 10,000 yearly deaths from NSAIDs in exchange for its benefits; again, it seems to me that the benefits of aspirin are well-defined and understood, in contrast to CAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. P also compared use of CAM to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-trackback.php?p=1116"&gt;off-label use of pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, implying that both practices are, in a sense, unconventional. Is this a fair comparison?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He further mentioned that some unethical CAM providers may be more concerned about the health of their income stream than the health of their patients, as evidenced by recommending products they sell. He pointed to similar behavior on the “conventional” side with the example of internists giving cosmetic Botox injections to supplement their low reimbursement rates. I thought this was a bizarre example and a completely false analogy; we could argue about appropriateness, but no one is mislead about health benefits of such a procedure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, Dr. P talked about how an IM doc would refer patients to qualified CAM practitioners, much like all physicians refer to appropriate specialists when a patient needs care beyond the scope of their practice. He mentioned, for example, that he will refer a patient to a licensed acupuncturist or a credentialed Reiki master if the patient wants those therapies. Professor Edzard Ernst’s infamous &lt;a href="http://saveyourself.ca/bibliography.php?ern7"&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; regarding regulation of CAM comes to mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the lecture was devoted to how a physician should respond to a patient request for or use of CAM. Dr. P began by asserting that a physician should neither categorically refuse nor automatically agree to cooperate with CAM administration. Each request should be evaluated in terms of risks and benefits, with consideration given to the patient’s beliefs, cultural values, therapeutic goals, and severity of illness. In doing so, physicians should uphold the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Dr. P spoke well on enabling patient autonomy, which he said involved correcting misinformation as much as supporting unconventional choices. When a patient comes to Dr. P with a bag of supplements, Dr. P will go through them and ask non-judgmentally for each, “Why do you take this?” He is then able to gently correct misconceptions or guide towards better information sources, and he has more luck paring down the list when he is knowledgeable about and accepting of the ones more likely to be useful. (Glucosamine? Sure, that may help. But I’m not so sure about this shark cartilage.) Beneficence and non-maleficence speak to risk-benefit considerations; here was the line about deaths from NSAIDs. Justice is about societal fairness and access to care. Dr. P expressed frustration that proven CAM interventions like acupuncture for osteoarthritis (he referenced twice a “definitive” study by Brian Berman, discussed on this blog &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-trackback.php?p=351"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-trackback.php?p=356"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) are often not reimbursed by Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. P described three important factors to consider when evaluating a patient request for CAM: safety, efficacy, and curability. “Curability” refers to the patient’s clinical state and prognosis. Dr. P recommends greater tolerance for ineffective or even unsafe interventions if the patient is unlikely to suffer ill effects, perhaps due to comatose state or imminent death. He pointed out that physicians often provide interventions at the end of life that are more for the family’s sake than the patient’s, such as futile resuscitation attempts, and the same leeway should be granted for last-ditch CAM efforts when no standard therapies are available. In the aforementioned (real-life) case of the coma patient treated with hyperbaric oxygen, the family was wealthy enough to easily afford the treatment and was willing to reimburse hospital resources (nursing, ambulance) spent shuttling the patient to and from the hyperbaric quack (for a planned 30+ treatments). As expected, Dr. P spoke eloquently on the need to tease out family dynamics, goals for treatment, unreasonable expectations, etc., and I agree with him that theses thorny ethical issues regarding chronic disease or end-of-life care are independent of CAM use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On “safety” Dr. P said that CAM (or any) interventions could be classified as proven safe (within reason of course, not in any absolute sense), not proven safe, or proven not safe. He started by telling us that patient’s requests and beliefs never excuse the physician from the professional duty not to harm. Then, with the caveat that some of us may disagree with the following statement, Dr. P read from his slide, “A treatment proven to be safe &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; be administered out of respect for the patient and/or family autonomy, and to promote an open and cooperative relationship” (my emphasis). Although Dr. P did not mention any such consequence, I believe that this mandate would necessarily lead to physician acceptance of the use of homeopathy and Reiki, even if we all agreed they had no specific efficacy. In my opinion, a more broad-based (dare I say, holistic) consideration of adverse effects of CAM may instead conclude that physicians have a professional and societal responsibility to discourage magical thinking… As for interventions “not proven safe,” here is where Dr. P suggested that cautious use with careful monitoring was appropriate (see my third paragraph). Interventions that are “proven not safe” should be avoided except as allowed by issues of “curability” (previous paragraph).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the slide for “efficacy” that described the requirement for physicians to “do good” in addition to “do no harm,” Dr. P read a statement that made me sit up with interest: “However, providing some CAM modalities, though not scientifically validated, may have significant benefits for patients by reason of the placebo effect or by improving psychological well-being by demonstrating concern and regard for the patients’ and/or families’ wishes.” But he immediately said that although he included this argument for completeness, he does not actually agree with it; when he uses or recommends a piece of CAM, it is because he truly believes it may have specific benefits. One factor that influences his beliefs and clinical decision making, he next mentioned, is personal experience with a CAM therapy. I must quote him directly: “if I’ve recommended glucosamine 20 times for my patients or 200 times and I’ve seen some benefit, even if a study comes out saying it may not work, that may not change how I’m practicing.” He commented that one can always find flaws in any study’s design (I agree), that one’s biases influence this critical analysis (I agree), and that only rarely does a single article change one’s practice (I agree). Where it seems we disagree is on the value of a single clinician’s uncontrolled observations; I tend to think that such data is hopelessly flawed compared to a consensus view based on the totality of scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly, Dr. P segued from this interesting epistemological point to the banal assertion of the importance of listening to patients and engaging in a therapeutic relationship that may lead to &lt;em&gt;healing&lt;/em&gt;, not just curing. The next slide implored us to administer any therapy that is proven effective “regardless of its origins.” Again, the maggot story tells me that this is done, but Dr. P seems to feel that CAM is often given short shrift. For example, although several studies have shown efficacy of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=51"&gt;glucosamine&lt;/a&gt; for osteoarthritis (he asserted that many rheumatologists both prescribe and personally use it), Dr. P was annoyed to read press reports of one particular study (&lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/gait/qa.htm"&gt;GAIT&lt;/a&gt;, I presume) that described a limited effect of glucosamine without mentioning that Celebrex had similarly poor effects in some of the study groups. I guess we also agree that mainstream media reporting on science is often misleading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dispersed through the lecture were presentations of three cases that illustrated ethical challenges surrounding CAM use: hyperbaric oxygen for a comatose patient, a mother of five who insisted on only alternative therapies for early-stage breast cancer (he tried everything, even called a psychiatrist, to convince her to accept definitive treatment but she refused), and a terminal leukemia patient who asked his advice on an absurd alt-med regimen (massive supplement use, coffee enemas). He stressed that these three patients, like sensational public reports of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=496"&gt;chemotherapy refuseniks&lt;/a&gt;, are very rare exceptions and that the vast majority of his patients use CAM as a safe complement to standard care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion of legal implications was brief. In Charell v. Gonzalez, a New York court found that “no practitioner of alternative medicine could prevail…as…the term ‘non-convention’ may well necessitate a finding that the doctor who practices such medicine deviates from ‘accepted’ medical standards.” (Interestingly, Dr. P called Gonzalez a “famous” physician and mentioned that after this case he won an NIH grant for a large trial of his anticancer regimen. As of November 2009, Dr. P apparently had not yet heard about the disastrous conclusion of that trial, made public in August 2009 and described &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-trackback.php?p=1430"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-trackback.php?p=1545"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) In Schneider v. Revici, another cancer quack was exonerated because the patient had signed a detailed consent form that marked an “expressed assumption of risk.” Dr. P pointed out that CAM providers are very rarely sued because they tend to have very good relationships with patients. For protection against malpractice charges when using CAM (or any) therapies, he recommended meticulous documentation, clear communication, and a willingness to apologize for failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture ended with a touching story about how the husband of the terminal leukemia patient (who went to the Revici clinic against Dr. P’s advice) came back to visit Dr. P after his wife’s death. The husband thanked Dr. P for talking with them frankly and compassionately about their goals and expectations for her final months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this talk, like the previous one, must have seemed attractive and reasonable to the student with no more than a passing interest in CAM. However, few details were directly relevant to the ultimate question, “Do particular CAM therapies have specific effects?” I am intrigued by how often Dr. P and I agree, such as when he suggested that selection bias may help account for success stories from heroic alternative cancer regimens (i.e., only healthy patients can tolerate them). But if I watch carefully and dig deeply I can pick out issues of contention between us. The forums where we might argue over the evidence for this or that indication, or have the general discussion about interpretation of evidence, are the elective CAM courses presumably attended only by the enthusiastic. Most of my classmates get little more than the vague and rosy exposure that I describe here and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4036"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and in one more future post on third year. I fear that these lectures, while making CAM/IM more palatable, do not adequately equip students for critical analysis of unusual claims.&lt;/p&gt;

Besides being one of my best friends, Woods is a fantastic and funny writer, and her forthcoming book Bonobo Handshake debuts in June. Here's a sample from Tuesday:
'Can animals be gay?' - are you serious NYT?
 Having a story about same  sex sex in animals then leaving out bonobos is like writing an  article about big ears without mentioning elephants.The science  of homosexuality in animals (or socio-sexual behavior) and then you talk about albatrosses?? that don't even have a clitoris?? Or do they? the point is, even if they do have them, it's not like you would ever notice. I know the albatrosses are the latest thing, and I love albatross and think it's really cool the female raise babies together, but does that really compete with two females rubbing their clitorises together with ever increasing frenzy until they orgasm - which by the way helps them reduce social tension and ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F04%2F08%2Fyour-inner-bonobo%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270727041584"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=23205">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/950c8169c6a5fce0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Advertising"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Atheist Billboard Comes to Fayetteville, Arkansas</title><published>2010-04-08T11:00:36Z</published><updated>2010-04-08T11:00:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/08/atheist-billboard-comes-to-fayetteville-arkansas/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The latest atheist billboard (and corresponding bus ads) can be found in Fayetteville, Arkansas, thanks to the &lt;a href="http://nwa.unitedcor.org"&gt;Northwest Arkansas Coalition of Reason&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“We… want everyone to know that those of us who don’t believe in a supreme being happen to be your neighbors,” added Randall Fleck, coordinator of NWA CoR. “Folks like us can be found everywhere. We’re family members, friends and coworkers. One of us might even be in the pew next to you in church. So it’s about time we started talking about our views, just as others talk about theirs.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This billboard stands out partly because of its hilarious placement…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sits just above a billboard for the &lt;a href="http://www.cumcrogers.com/"&gt;Central United Methodist Church&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.freethoughtnwa.com/sites/default/files/images/IMG_0874%20close.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0874-close.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0874 close" width="550" height="319"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“That was a complete coincidence. We didn’t know that until we went and took a picture of the sign and said. Oh, we had no idea,” said [co-founder of Fayetteville Free Thinkers Darrel] Henschell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And neither Henschell, nor the church’s pastor thinks it’s a bad thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That could be a metaphor for how secular people and church minded people can co-exist peacefully in our society,” Henschell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first reaction is it breaks my heart,” said CUMC Senior Pastor Carness Vaughan. “But on second thought, any opportunity to get people thinking about God is a good thing.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure the screams of horror from the religious community will be heard shortly…&lt;br&gt;

These pictures from the orbiting HiRISE camera never get old because they’re frakking amazing! &lt;a href="http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_016423_2640"&gt;Here is another awesome avalanche&lt;/a&gt; caught in the act… on Mars!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/2560/ESP_016423_2640.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/hirise_avalanche_april2010.jpg" alt="hirise_avalanche_april2010" title="hirise_avalanche_april2010" width="610" height="458"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Haleakala! Coooool. Click the pic to nobly embiggen. And oh yes, you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to embiggen this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be my favorite Red Planet avalanche of them all. On the left you can see the surface of Mars: that’s frozen carbon dioxide — dry ice — covering the ground. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The red brick-like pattern to the right of the ice is actually the face of a scarp, a steep cliff. We’re looking almost straight down on it, so it’s foreshortened, but don’t let that fool you; it’s 700 meters (2000 feet) high! On the right is the greyish floor, dusty basaltic rock. You can see sand dunes rippling across it, as well as a few boulders here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But right there is the plume of a large avalanche, the cloud still rising above the floor! Clearly this was caught within seconds of the landslide hitting the floor of the scarp. The shadow of the plume is clear and obvious below and to the left. That’s particularly cool because knowing the Sun angle in the image means the plume height can be determined. They generally rise to 50 or more meters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s spring in the northern hemisphere of Mars, and the warming temperatures are sublimating the dry ice. This may be causing the slides; the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gets in the cracks of the rocks and dust, and when it goes away the loose debris can be free to fall. The folks at HiRISE have been targeting scarps like this one just in case they can catch avalanches like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this avalanche shot in particular because you can really see the contrast between the layer of ice, the scarp wall, and the floor. It makes for a wonderfully complete scene, and for some reason reminds me of Earth… maybe it’s because I live in Boulder, and I’m used to seeing ice covered red rocks with lots of interesting geological bits around. I’m not sure. But like all the other avalanche shots, it reminds me that Mars is a planet, a world, a location, an actual &lt;em&gt;place&lt;/em&gt;. It may lack the dynamic and diverse weather we get here on Earth, but there’s still plenty going on at that little ball.&lt;/p&gt;

In the Information Revolution of the 21st century, however, industrial productivity is increasingly driven by software algorithms and the exponential rise of computer processing power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Middle-class industries from accountancy to marketing, tourism to the stock market, are being transformed by powerful software and technologies that improve economic efficiency tenfold, while eradicating the need for human labour.

&lt;p&gt;ICP posit many fascinating questions here, and in this post I will attempt to answer some of them for Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. Don’t worry, guys! I’m not a scientist. I know you don’t like them “motherfuckers,” as per your new song. I’m just a concerned citizen hoping to quell your insatiable curiosity about nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While watching that video for the first time, I couldn’t help but picture the brainstorming session between J and Shaggy that led to this masterpiece. And upon finishing the video, I couldn’t help but imagine an alternate universe in which one of the ICP – probably the fat one, but let’s just say Shaggy, to pick one at random since I can’t tell which is which – is actually intelligent. I’ve crafted a script based on that universe, which you can enjoy below. The full lyrics follow. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
Yeah, you know. Like their long necks and shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Actually Violent J, the giraffe’s long neck is the natural result of millions of years of evolution. While it was once thought that a longer neck gave an animal an advantage due to the ability to reach tall food sources during times of drought, these days there’s also a fairly strong case to be made for the idea that males with longer, stronger necks were better able to win “necking” fights with other males, thereby enabling them to reproduce and give way to offspring that shared their traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
That’s some crazy shit Shaggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Which part?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
Saying that baby giraffes look like their dads and shit. That’s gotta be a miracle. Yo I have a dope rhyme about it, it goes like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Picture-7.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Tears of a Clown" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Picture-7-300x230.png" alt="Tears of a Clown: Violent J&amp;#39;s boy" width="300" height="230"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;VIOLENT J (&lt;em&gt;rapping&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
Shaggy’s little boys look just like Shaggy/And my little boy looks just like daddy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Oh Violent J, how you amuse. First of all, “Shaggy” doesn’t actually rhyme with “daddy.” Second of all, our sons’ resemblance to us is due to genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
Bitch what you talkin about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Genetics is the science of heredity. You see, you have genes inside you, and those genes were combined with your baby mama’s genes to create offspring that resembles both of you in color and shape. That’s why a long-necked giraffe is likely to give birth to a long-necked baby giraffe, and why your son has a similar face to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
Aw you mean like how he’s got clown face paint on and shit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J’S SON peers into the room sullenly through the sliding glass doors that lead to the backyard. His face is covered in clown paint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Naw man. You put that on him this morning, like you do every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OUTSIDE, a rainstorm erupts. VIOLENT J’S SON is drenched, his clown paint face slowly melting off onto the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J (pointing OUTSIDE)&lt;br&gt;
Well what about the weather, right? Now that shit is a mother fucking miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
On the contrary, we know enough about weather patterns to fairly accurately predict what will happen, both on a short-term scale of day to day weather and on a long-term scale like the Earth’s climate millions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Rainbow-Unicorn.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Rainbow Unicorn" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Rainbow-Unicorn-292x300.jpg" alt="Rainbow Unicorn" width="292" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
Yeah, but what about fucking rainbows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Violent J, you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; try to fuck a rainbow. It is in fact an optical phenomenon caused by light reflecting off the back of raindrops, showing us the full spectrum of visible light. You can never touch it, and it will always appear to move away from you the closer you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
Aw but what about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE (interrupting)&lt;br&gt;
Leprechauns don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
Motherfucker!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long, thoughtful pause follows as VIOLENT J processes this new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
Shaggy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Yes, Violent J?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
What about . . . what about magnets? I see ‘em on the fridgerator. I see ‘em and I just get so angry. They just stick there when they should fall down. WHY DON’T THEY FALL DOWN SHAGGY?? THE SCIENTISTS WON’T TELL ME. THEY LIE! THEY LIE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J breaks down sobbing. SHAGGY 2 DOPE holds him, rocking him gently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE (in a soothing tone)&lt;br&gt;
A magnet is just an object that can attract and repel other magnets and some metals by producing a magnetic field. It’s invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J (screaming)&lt;br&gt;
It’s magic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
No, Violent J. It’s science. In the 19th century, a scientist named James Clerk Maxwell discovered that magnetism and electricity are like two sides of the same coin. All our electronic equipment works thanks to the fact that we understand magnets. Even the Earth itself is a giant magnet! The center of our planet is chock full of molten rock with magnetic elements like iron, so we’re surrounded by our own magnetosphere. When particles fly at us from the sun, known as solar winds, and pass through the magnetosphere, we see the northern lights, also known as aurora borealis. This breathtaking display could once be considered a miracle or just a strange mystery. Now that we know its true cause, its beauty only deepens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J silently contemplates this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
There’s one other thing, Shaggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Yes, Violent J?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
You see . . . well . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Go on, Violent J. Remember, there’s no such thing as a stupid question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
Okay. Well, see, I was in San Francisco last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Yes, go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pelican.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="pelican" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pelican-300x225.jpg" alt="pelican" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
And I saw this pelican. I . . . I gave it my Filet-O-Fish sammich. And . . . and . . . it tried to eat my cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J begins quietly crying once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
Okay . . . and?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J&lt;br&gt;
I . . . ran away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAGGY 2 DOPE&lt;br&gt;
I don’t understand, Violent J.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIOLENT J (whispers dramatically)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It was a miracle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLOSE-UP on SHAGGY 2 DOPE’s face, as a single tear rolls down his cheek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If magic is all we’ve ever know&lt;br&gt;
Then it’s easy to miss what really goes on&lt;br&gt;
But I’ve seen miracles in every way&lt;br&gt;
And I see miracles everyday&lt;br&gt;
Oceans spanning beyond my sight&lt;br&gt;
And a million stars way above em at night&lt;br&gt;
We don’t have to be high to look in the sky&lt;br&gt;
And know that’s a miracle opened wide&lt;br&gt;
Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas&lt;br&gt;
And everything chilling underwater, please&lt;br&gt;
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog&lt;br&gt;
Long neck giraffes, and pet cats and dogs&lt;br&gt;
And I’ve seen eighty-five thousand people&lt;br&gt;
All in one room, together as equals&lt;br&gt;
Pure magic is the birth of my kids&lt;br&gt;
I’ve seen shit that’ll shock your eyelids&lt;br&gt;
The sun and the moon, and even Mars&lt;br&gt;
The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars&lt;br&gt;
UFOs, a river flows&lt;br&gt;
Plant a little seed and nature grows&lt;br&gt;
Niagara falls and the pyramids&lt;br&gt;
Everything you believed in as kids&lt;br&gt;
Fucking rainbows after it rains&lt;br&gt;
there’s enough miracles here to blow your brains&lt;br&gt;
I fed a fish to a pelican at Frisco bay&lt;br&gt;
It tried to eat my cell phone, he ran away&lt;br&gt;
And music is magic, pure and clean&lt;br&gt;
You can feel it and hear it but it can’t be seen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is all magic&lt;br&gt;
(Are you a believer in miracles)&lt;br&gt;
You can’t even hold it&lt;br&gt;
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)&lt;br&gt;
it’s just there in the air&lt;br&gt;
(Are you a believer in miracles)&lt;br&gt;
Pure motherfucking magic Right?&lt;br&gt;
This shit’ll blow your fucking mind&lt;br&gt;
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is a lot like love, it’s all a feeling&lt;br&gt;
And it fills the room, from the floor to the ceiling&lt;br&gt;
I see miracles all around me&lt;br&gt;
Stop and look around, it’s all astounding&lt;br&gt;
Water, fire, air and dirt&lt;br&gt;
Fucking magnets, how do they work?&lt;br&gt;
And I don’t wanna talk to a scientist&lt;br&gt;
Y’all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed&lt;br&gt;
Solar eclipse, and vicious weather&lt;br&gt;
Fifteen thousand Juggalos together&lt;br&gt;
And I love my mom for giving me this&lt;br&gt;
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted&lt;br&gt;
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly&lt;br&gt;
Miracles ain’t nothing to lie&lt;br&gt;
Shaggy’s little boys look just like Shaggy&lt;br&gt;
And my little boy looks just like daddy&lt;br&gt;
Miracles each and every where you look&lt;br&gt;
And nobody has to stay where they put&lt;br&gt;
This world is yours for you to explore&lt;br&gt;
there’s nothing but miracles beyond your door&lt;br&gt;
The Dark Carnival is your invitation&lt;br&gt;
To witness that without explanation&lt;br&gt;
Take a look at this fine creation&lt;br&gt;
And enjoy it better with appreciation&lt;br&gt;
Crows, ghosts, the midnight coast&lt;br&gt;
The wonders of the world, mysteries the most&lt;br&gt;
Just open your mind, and it ain’t no way&lt;br&gt;
To ignore the miracles of every day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Are you a believer in miracles)&lt;br&gt;
Magic everywhere in this bitch&lt;br&gt;
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)&lt;br&gt;
it’s all around you, you don’t even know it&lt;br&gt;
(Are you a believer in miracles) Shit’s crazy&lt;br&gt;
(Do you notice and recognize miracles,&lt;br&gt;
So many miracles, the magic miracles)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a believer in miracles&lt;br&gt;
Do you have time for the miracles&lt;br&gt;
Do you notice and recognize miracles&lt;br&gt;
So many miracles, the magic miracles&lt;br&gt;
Are you a believer in miracles&lt;br&gt;
Do you have time for the miracles&lt;br&gt;
Do you notice and recognize miracles&lt;br&gt;

The best way of testing out new or improved treatments is to run a clinical trial, involving as many patients as possible, to compare the potentially better option with the best current treatment.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skeptoid&lt;/em&gt; has a long-standing tradition of making every 50th episode a lavish musical production. This tradition began last year at episode 150, which established the lavish musical employing a host of talented professionals; and crumbled all to hell this week at episode 200, when I applied my own unassisted imbecility toward the construction of a musical piece. The result is a parody of marketing efforts from purveyors of pseudoscience in the form of a song entitled &lt;em&gt;Buy It!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/audio/skeptoid-4200.mp3"&gt;Click here to listen now (3 minutes)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an experienced non-musician, and quite impressively talented on no musical instruments, I elected to make this piece an &lt;em&gt;a cappella.&lt;/em&gt; This allowed me to leverage my deep gifts for not singing. Critics have already praised the performance as one of the great voices made for blogging.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My background in not composing music helped to cunningly construct chord progressions as provocative and complex as those from The Wiggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so armed with the needed talents, I proceeded. Among those talents are not the abilities to count beats, keep rhythm, or hold a note, so I had to cheat a bit. Contrary to suppositions I’ve already heard, no sampling or pitch correction was used in &lt;em&gt;Buy It!&lt;/em&gt; But there is a lot of looping. This meant I had to record each loop, usually 4 measures long, in the correct pitch and timing. So I played each vocal part separately on a keyboard into &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/"&gt;Garageband&lt;/a&gt;, each on its own track. I listened to each track solo, as a guide, as I sang each line. There are thirteen separate vocal tracks, plus ten handclap tracks and one finger snap track. Put them all together, mute out the keyboard guide tracks, and presto, we have a multitrack vocal performance that’s actually in sync and reasonably close to being on key. Pretty good, I thought, for someone who has no clue and little hope of ever obtaining a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know there is some clipping in a couple parts. The clipping provoked much colorful language. It’s not in the original recordings, so perhaps some future engineering will get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd-shouted “Buy it!” line caused a lot of headaches. &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv/"&gt;Richard Saunders&lt;/a&gt; gathered a crew together in Australia and did some takes. I thought it would be fun to make this a bi-continental piece, but unfortunately I ended up being unable to use that clip; it just didn’t sound right when I mixed it in. I also gathered my family around the mic and we all shouted it too, but it came out unintelligible. So I ended up reverting to my original concept of a Village People style chorus: a combination of basses and falsettos. I doubt any listeners were able to divine that inspiration, but that’s what I was going for. Regardless, it was the only one of my three options that worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope you enjoy it. It was fun to make, and I think its message is a worthy addition to the &lt;em&gt;Skeptoid&lt;/em&gt; body of work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Dunning</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270717564116"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BpsResearchDigest/~3/Wf_nlMPeN4A/people-lie-more-in-email-than-when.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/16bcd0713b88052b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">People lie more in email than when using pen and paper</title><published>2010-04-08T04:26:06Z</published><updated>2010-04-08T04:26:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/zHDRyKA_9n0/people-lie-more-in-email-than-when.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BpsResearchDigest/~3/Wf_nlMPeN4A/people-lie-more-in-email-than-when.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Emails feel so transient, so disembodied, that we&amp;#39;re more tempted to lie when sending them compared with writing with pen and paper. That&amp;#39;s according to Charles Naquin and colleagues who tested the honesty of students and managers as they played financial games.Forty-eight graduate business students were presented with an imaginary $89 kitty and had to choose how much they&amp;#39;d tell their partner was in the kitty, and how much of the kitty to share with their partner. Crucially, some participants shared this information by email, others by pen and paper. You guessed it - those who shared the info by email were more likely to lie about the kitty size (92 per cent of them did vs. 63 per cent of the pen and paper group), and they were also more unfair in how they shared the money. Participants in the email group also said they felt more justified in misrepresenting the amount of money to their partner. A follow-up study ramped up the ecological validity. One hundred and seventy-seven full-time managers took part in a group financial game. Participants formed teams of three with each member pretending to be the manager of a science project negotiating for grant money. This game was played with real money, the players all knew each other, and any lies would be revealed afterwards. Once again, players who shared information by email were more likely to lie and cheat than were players who shared information by pen and paper.Charles Naquin&amp;#39;s team said their results chime with previous research showing, for example, that peer performance reviews are more negative when conducted online rather than on paper. &amp;#39;Moving paper tasks online either within or across organisational boundaries should be undertaken with caution,&amp;#39; they said. For example: &amp;#39;Taxes using the increasingly popular e-filing system could be even more fraught with deception than the traditional paper forms.&amp;#39;_________________________________Naquin, C., Kurtzberg, T., &amp;amp; Belkin, L.

For some time now neurobiologists have known that there was nothing supernatural or paranormal about these NDEs. But now new research suggests that carbon dioxide may hold the key to explaining this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

This is just grotesque and these people should be made to feel ashamed of their wretched behavior for the rest of their lives. Where’s Aldo Raines to carve a swastika into their foreheads when you need him? To call the school’s administrators the scum of the Earth is an insult to the scum.&lt;/p&gt;

Patrick Jane, the title character of CBS’ &lt;em&gt;The  Mentalist&lt;/em&gt; is a former John Edward-esque stage psychic who after  suffering a crisis of conscience, has given up his con artist ways and  now uses his keen stage mentalist talents to help solve homicide cases.  And because he knows all too well how easily manipulated people are,  Jane has made it clear on a number of occasions that he does not believe  in psychics or gods. But as it turns out, the actor who portrays Jane,  Simon Baker, also doesn’t believe in the supernatural…sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I  believe in belief,” said Baker, the native Australian who has the  lead  role in The Mentalist, playing Patrick Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe in  belief, in the sense that, whatever works for you,”  Baker continued.  “The idea of believing in something is really about  focusing,  concentrating energy toward something in a positive way,  right? Is that  what believing is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe that you can, through committing  to something in your mind  and your body, it can exist for you. Do you  understand what I mean?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh … sort of … I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I  don’t,” Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then took one more crack at summing up his  views succinctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe in psychic powers,” Baker  said. “But that’s not to  say they don’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, still clear  as mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s very unclear but I think what he was  trying to say was that as with, say, the Orson Welles War of the Worlds  incident, believing can be seeing. In other words, if you believe in  something strongly enough, you can delude yourself into seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though  it’s also possible that he’s saying something else entirely and is  endorsing some wacky Deepak Chopra-like idea that believing in something  can literally cause that belief to literally manifest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  really hope he meant the former and not the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the first version Nelson says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ontogenetic Depth (OD) 1.0 was – well, it would be beyond charitable to say utterly inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we knew that six years ago, Paul.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, however, after never telling us just what version 1.0 actually was, Nelson is developing version 2.0.  First, though, we have to suffer through &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/04/ontogenetic_depth_20_the_prequ.html" rel="external "&gt;a prequel&lt;/a&gt; and then (not yet posted) an answer to &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/03/ontogenetic-dep.html" rel=""&gt;PZ’s criticism of OD 1.0 way back in 2004&lt;/a&gt;.  We don’t yet know how much more vamping Nelson will do: My bet is that the fan dance will go on for days.  So when version 2.0 will be unveiled is hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;

As many readers know, a few of the SBM bloggers (myself included) will be appearing at the &lt;a href="http://www.necsscon.org"&gt;Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism&lt;/a&gt; (NECSS) on Saturday, April 17. Since the topic of our panel discussion is going to be the infiltration of quackademic medicine into medical academia, I thought that now would be a very good time for me to update my &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=28"&gt;list of medical schools and academic medical centers&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. and Canada that have embraced (or at least decided to tolerate) quackademic medicine in their midst. After all, the list is over two years old and hasn’t been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My list is long past due for an update, and I want to post that update right here, either right before or right after NECSS. But I need your help. Please peruse the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=28"&gt;previous roll of shame&lt;/a&gt;. Then either post here in the comments or e-mail to me any examples of quackademic medical programs in the U.S. and Canada (I’ll leave Europe to &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net"&gt;others better qualified to deal with it&lt;/a&gt;) that I may have missed. Equally important, if there are programs I listed before that no longer peddle woo, let me know that too, so that I can investigate and decide if I should remove the program from my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly interested in the most egregious examples (although your submitting all examples is greatly appreciated). Yoga and meditation don’t bother me that much, for example. Neither do dietary studies, because diet and exercise are science-based medicine that have all too often been coopted by purveyors of woo. Homeopathy and &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, do bother me. A lot. I’m also particularly interested in educational programs in CAM that are funded by the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=36"&gt;National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please help me construct the definitive list of academic programs in the U.S. and Canada that have adopted quackademic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

But it was not always thus!  Very few people are actually born as theoretical physicists.  When I was an undergraduate astronomy major at Villanova, I wasn’t thinking about quantum field theory or differential geometry; I was working on photometric studies of variable stars.  My personal favorite star was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_Aurigae"&gt;Epsilon Aurigae&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious eclipsing binary.  One of the very few stars out there that has both a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Epsilon-Aurigae/178467120328?v=wall"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/epsilon_Aurigae"&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;.  And now Epsilon is &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/04/07/astronomers-display-the-eclipse-of-a-star-with-amazing-thermal-images/"&gt;in the news again&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among this star’s claims to fame is that it has the longest period of any known eclipsing binary:  over 27 years.  But it’s not just about facile record-holding; this system is truly puzzling, especially the nature of the secondary (the thing that eclipses the primary star).  The basic problem is that the eclipse has a fairly flat bottom, as seen in this light curve from the previous eclipse in 1982-84.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hposoft.com/EAur09/EAur8284Plots.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/V-82-84TN.JPG" alt="Epsilon Aurigae 82-84" title="Epsilon Aurigae 82-84" width="497" height="318"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flat-bottomed light curve is usually associated with a &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; eclipse; the secondary completely blocks the light from the primary for a while.  But in this case, the spectrum of the system seemed to remain unchanged, indicating that most of the light was still coming from the primary star, even in the middle of the eclipse.  This led Huang in 1965 to propose a clever model, in which the secondary is actually a &lt;em&gt;disk&lt;/em&gt; seen edge-on; the eclipse is therefore not total, but the disk blocks out part of the light without emitting much of its own.  And indeed, with modern infrared telescopes we can &lt;a href="http://spitzer.caltech.edu/images/2866-ssc2010-01a-Epsilon-Aurigae-Puzzle-Pieces-Snap-Into-Place"&gt;discern the light from the secondary&lt;/a&gt; — it does look like a relatively cold disk, about four astronomical units in radius, with a hot central star.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://spitzer.caltech.edu/news/1036-ssc2010-01-Centuries-Old-Star-Mystery-Coming-to-a-Close"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/ssc2010-01-Rec.jpg" alt="Epsilon Aurigae art" title="Epsilon Aurigae art" width="589" height="332"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1982-84 eclipse raised a problem with Huang’s model, however.  If you look closely at that light curve above, you’ll notice that it gets brighter right near the middle.  (The gap in data is from when the star was behind the Sun and unobservable.)  Your first guess is that this is probably just a fluctuation in the in brightness of the primary star; but it turns out that this can’t be right.  The primary is indeed variable, but its color changes in lockstep with its brightness, an effect that can be measured by observing with different filters.  And the mid-eclipse brightening shows no variation in color.  It’s not due to variability in the primary; somehow the disk is letting more light past, right during mid-eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is where I come in, as an undergrad doing research under &lt;a href="http://www.astronomy.villanova.edu/faculty/guinan/guinan.htm"&gt;Ed Guinan&lt;/a&gt;.  For my &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...367..278C"&gt;undergraduate thesis&lt;/a&gt;, we tried to put together the most sensible picture we could manage of Epsilon Aurigae; our picture has now become the &lt;a href="http://mysite.du.edu/~rstencel/epsaur.htm"&gt;consensus model&lt;/a&gt;.  (One difference is that we thought the primary was a supergiant, but now it appears that it’s likely to be a smaller star.)  As far as the disk is concerned, we built on a variation of Huang’s disk model, due to Wilson in 1971.  Wilson suggested that the disk should be thin and tilted, rather than thick and edge-on, with a semi-transparent inner region.  In that case, we could imagine that the central star (presumably holding the disk together) could clear out a region near the center, and light passing through that hole could account for the brightening.  I wrote a simple computer program (QuickBASIC on an IBM PC!) to calculate the light curve in this model, and we were able to get an extremely good fit to the data.  Here’s the killer plot from our paper, with three different models:  edge-on thick disk, opaque tilted disk with a central hole, and tilted disk with a central hole surrounded by a larger semi-transparent region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...367..278C"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/epsaurfit.jpg" alt="Epsilon Aurigae light curve fit" title="Epsilon Aurigae light curve fit" height="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, it’s eclipse time again!  (I’m getting old.)  Epsilon started going into eclipse in August 2009, right on schedule, and the eclipse is predicted to last until May 2011, so &lt;a href="http://www.hposoft.com/EAur09/EAurPredictions.html"&gt;we’re just a bit before mid-eclipse&lt;/a&gt; right now.  Here’s the &lt;a href="http://www.hposoft.com/Plots09/UBBand.jpg"&gt;current light curve&lt;/a&gt;.  But technology has advanced quite a bit since my student years.  Nowadays, we don’t need to puzzle out the meaning of a light curve and come up with an elaborate story involving tilted disks; we can just take &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://mysite.du.edu/~bkloppen/press/2010Nature01/index.html"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just what we did.  Under the leadership of &lt;a href="https://portfolio.du.edu/pc/port?portfolio=bkloppen"&gt;Brian Kloppenborg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://mysite.du.edu/~rstencel/"&gt;Robert Stencel&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Denver, we put together a proposal to observe the eclipse using &lt;a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu/CHARA/"&gt;CHARA&lt;/a&gt;, the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy.  CHARA is an array of optical telescopes on Mt. Wilson that act as an interferometer, enabling extremely high-resolution imaging of astronomical objects.  And by “we,” I do mean that I was included in the proposing team — a little return to my roots.  My contributions to the final results were not zero, but they were small; the lion’s share of the credit certainly goes to Brian and Bob and the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And our results just appeared in the form of a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7290/full/nature08968.html"&gt;paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately behind a paywall, but there is an extensive &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=116731&amp;amp;org=NSF&amp;amp;from=news"&gt;NSF press release&lt;/a&gt;.  But who cares about the words?  The stunning things are these pictures — you can actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the disk begin to move across the surface of the star.  There’s even a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84wJYwsEx0s&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; where you can compare a model to the actual data.  Click to embiggen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/epsAur_prfig1_withdisk.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/epsAur_prfig1_withdisk-sm.jpg" alt="Epsilon Aurigae eclipse" title="Epsilon Aurigae eclipse" width="600" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that, while these images are unambiguously amazing, the result is somewhat bittersweet for me.  John Monnier, another one of the team leaders, &lt;a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/eclipsing-binary-stars-100407.html"&gt;admits&lt;/a&gt; that he was skeptical about all this tilted-disk business; it just seemed like a house of cards.  But I wasn’t skeptical for a moment, having gone through the work of trying to fit the data with various different possibilities.  The extraordinary thing to me about observational astronomy was always how you could put together an apparently baroque model of some complicated system, just on the basis of a precious few data points, and yet have some degree of confidence that you were on the right track.  Reality is very constraining.  So in some perverse sense, it almost seems like &lt;em&gt;cheating&lt;/em&gt; to actually take pictures of the thing.  Where’s the fun in that?  (Of course it’s a great deal of fun.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we need to see what happens at mid-eclipse!  I predict we’ll be able to image that small central hole we posited many years ago.  Not at all certain about that — I suspect the star at the center of the disk is pretty active itself, and there are probably significant variations in the opacity of the central disk region.  That’s what data are for.  I will always love being a crazy-eyed theoretical physicist, but there’s something uniquely rewarding about digging into the data and coming to an understanding of far-flung pieces of our universe.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of you may recall a little something I created a couple of years ago known as the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/the_woo_aggregator.php"&gt;Academic Woo Aggregator&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, it was a list of medical schools and academic medical centers in the U.S. and Canada with departments or divisions of "integrative medicine" that promote what has been termed "quackademic medicine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I've been very remiss in updating it. The last update was in May 2008. I think it's long past due for an update. I haven't decided whether I will post such an update here or at my other blog (or both), but in preparing the update, I hereby for your help. Please peruse the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/the_woo_aggregator.php"&gt;previous roll of shame&lt;/a&gt;. Then either post here in the comments or e-mail to me any examples of quackademic medical programs in the U.S. and Canada (I'll leave Europe to &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net"&gt;others better qualified to deal with it&lt;/a&gt;) that I may have missed. Equally important, if there are programs I listed before that no longer peddle woo, let me know that too, so that I can investigate and decide if I should remove the program from my list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help me make the Academic Woo Aggregator the definitive list of academic programs in the U.S. and Canada that have adopted quackademic medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/a_call_for_examples_of_quackademic_medic.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/NzkYoCxRDDk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270700348183"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=173549">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/37e690635fd2eb93</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="clomid"/><category term="fertile drugs"/><category term="iui"/><category term="ivf"/><category term="trying to conceive"/><category term="trying to get pregnant"/><title type="html">Fertility Drugs: What Are Your Options?</title><published>2010-04-08T03:59:58Z</published><updated>2010-04-08T03:59:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/fertility-drugs-what-are-your-options/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Women who are trying to conceive have a wide array of fertility treatment options including intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), donor eggs and embryos, and surrogate mothers. Let’s start out with the basics – fertility drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fertility drugs regulate your hormones to trigger the release of one or more eggs during your ovulation cycle. Fertility drugs can be used alone or in combination with other fertility treatments such as IUI or IVF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular fertility drugs is clomiphene citrate, which is commonly know as the brand name, &lt;a href="http://infertility.about.com/od/infertilitytreatments/a/clomid101.htm"&gt;Clomid&lt;/a&gt;, or the generic version, Serophene. The risk of severe side effects such as &lt;a href="http://www.ivf-infertility.com/ivf/standard/complications/ovarian_stimulation/ohss.php"&gt;ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (OHSS) are less with Clomid compared to other fertility drugs. There is a risk of multiple pregnancy, as well as a number of other side effects. A series of Clomid pills are taken each month to trigger the release of the egg. Femera is another fertility drug that has shown similar results as Clomid, in terms of inducing ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/78154673.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="78154673" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/78154673-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many women opt for Clomid or Femera before moving on to injectable fertility drugs. Follistim and Gonal-F are created in a lab and aim to mimic the hormone FSH in your body. These injectables can be use in combination with IVF or IUI, or alone with timed intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other injectable drugs are meant to mimic the hormone LH – which triggers ovulation. These drugs are created from the urine of pregnant women and are made of hCG. They are normally tried after FSH treatment. These hcG drugs include Novarel, Ovidrel and Pregnyl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are a number of other drugs that suppress ovulation in order to create the proper ovulation timing for IVF and IUI treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all drugs, there are risks. Some side effects of fertility drugs are mild such as headaches and hot flashes, while others are more severe. Talk to your doctor about all your fertility treatment options and check out &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/fertility-drugs"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about trying to conceive with fertility drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, you can help stimulate your child’s mind to make your kid smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="video-games-kids_feat" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/video-games-kids_feat-300x126.jpg" alt="Video Games" width="300" height="126"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play video games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And you thought video games made kids brain dead! Well it depends on which games they play. Look for games that encourage strategy, planning and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offer music lessons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to a &lt;a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/ps/musiciq.pdf"&gt;University of Toronto study&lt;/a&gt;, the more years a child takes music lessons, the better grades he’ll achieve in high school and the higher IQ he will have as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serve healthy food options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Foods that are high in sugar and/or trans fats and low in other nutrients should be avoided. Give your children plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean meats, whole grains and other healthy options. High-nutrient foods improve children’s motor skills and mental development, particularly in the first few years of life. Be sure they have plenty of iron, which encourages brain tissue development. And serve your child gets a healthy breakfast every morning to improve their concentration and ability to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play mind games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Encourage children to play mind games such as chess, Sudoku, crossword puzzles, cryptograms, and even simple riddles when they are younger. These games promote logic, strategic thinking, decision making and problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read! Read! Read!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even when your kids are too young to read themselves, read to them. Your child’s cognitive development and IQ can be boosted with plenty of reading. Reading is a low-cost, easy way to help make your child smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

If you have any questions about the myths and realities of breastfeeding, ask your doctor. Here are a few common breastfeeding myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:210px"&gt;&lt;img title="Mother breastfeeding" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/breastfeeding-baby-200x300.jpg" alt="Breastfeeding" width="200" height="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth #1: Breastfed babies are more dependent and clingy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Babies become more independent when they are developmentally ready, and it doesn’t matter if they are breast or bottlefed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth #2: Breastfeeding leads to saggy boobs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Saggy boobs are due to genetics, age and gravity, not breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth #3: If your baby feeds a lot, that means your breasts aren’t producing enough milk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not true…breast milk is easier to digest than formula, so that’s why breastfed babies need to eat more often (every 2-3 hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth #4: Don’t give your breastfed baby an occasional bottle or they’ll stop eating out of confusion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Suckling the breast and sucking the nipple are two different things to infants. They won’t get confused. You can introduce an occasional bottle as a supplement to breastfeeding once your baby reaches 2-3 weeks of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth #5: Breastfeeding stops you from getting pregnant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though the hormones involved in breastfeeding can prevent ovulation – it’s not a 100% guaranteed form of birth control. If you don’t want to get pregnant right away, use a condom or ask your doctor for low-dose birth control pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read dozens more breastfeeding myths from &lt;a href="http://www.breastfeeding.com/all_about/all_about_myths.html"&gt;breastfeeding.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.llli.org/NB/LVAprMay98p21NB.html"&gt;La Leche League&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Several efforts have already tried to harness the web's power to make research papers available for free.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010052" title=""&gt;Why Do African Elephants (Loxodonta africana) Simulate Oestrus? An Analysis of Longitudinal Data&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Female African elephants signal oestrus via chemicals in their urine, but they also exhibit characteristic changes to their posture, gait and behaviour when sexually receptive. Free-ranging females visually signal receptivity by holding their heads and tails high, walking with an exaggerated gait, and displaying increased tactile behaviour towards males. Parous females occasionally exhibit these visual signals at times when they are thought not to be cycling and without attracting interest from musth males. Using demographic and behavioural records spanning a continuous 28-year period, we investigated the occurrence of this "simulated" oestrus behaviour. We show that parous females in the Amboseli elephant population do simulate receptive oestrus behaviours, and this false oestrus occurs disproportionately in the presence of naïve female kin who are observed coming into oestrus for the first time. We compare several alternative hypotheses for the occurrence of this simulation: 1) false oestrus has no functional purpose (e.g., it merely results from abnormal hormonal changes); 2) false oestrus increases the reproductive success of the simulating female, by inducing sexual receptivity; and 3) false oestrus increases the inclusive fitness of the simulating female, either by increasing the access of related females to suitable males, or by encouraging appropriate oestrus behaviours from female relatives who are not responding correctly to males. Although the observed data do not fully conform to the predictions of any of these hypotheses, we rule out the first two, and tentatively suggest that parous females most likely exhibit false oestrus behaviours in order to demonstrate to naïve relatives at whom to direct their behaviour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009703" title=""&gt;The Sixth Rhino: A Taxonomic Re-Assessment of the Critically Endangered Northern White Rhinoceros&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The two forms of white rhinoceros; northern and southern, have had contrasting conservation histories. The Northern form, once fairly numerous is now critically endangered, while the southern form has recovered from a few individuals to a population of a few thousand. Since their last taxonomic assessment over three decades ago, new material and analytical techniques have become available, necessitating a review of available information and re-assessment of the taxonomy. Dental morphology and cranial anatomy clearly diagnosed the southern and northern forms. The differentiation was well supported by dental metrics, cranial growth and craniometry, and corresponded with differences in post-cranial skeleton, external measurements and external features. No distinctive differences were found in the limited descriptions of their behavior and ecology. Fossil history indicated the antiquity of the genus, dating back at least to early Pliocene and evolution into a number of diagnosable forms. The fossil skulls examined fell outside the two extant forms in the craniometric analysis. Genetic divergence between the two forms was consistent across both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and indicated a separation of over a million years. On re-assessing the taxonomy of the two forms we find them to be morphologically and genetically distinct, warranting the recognition of the taxa formerly designated as subspecies; Ceratotherium simum simum the southern form and Ceratotherium simum cottoni the northern form, as two distinct species Ceratotherium simum and Ceratotherium cottoni respectively. The recognition of the northern form as a distinct species has profound implications for its conservation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The parasitoid Jewel Wasp hunts cockroaches to serve as a live food supply for its offspring. The wasp stings the cockroach in the head and delivers a cocktail of neurotoxins directly inside the prey's cerebral ganglia. Although not paralyzed, the stung cockroach becomes a living yet docile 'zombie', incapable of self-initiating spontaneous or evoked walking. We show here that such neuro-chemical manipulation can be attributed to decreased neuronal activity in a small region of the cockroach cerebral nervous system, the sub-esophageal ganglion (SEG). A decrease in descending permissive inputs from this ganglion to thoracic central pattern generators decreases the propensity for walking-related behaviors. We have used behavioral, neuro-pharmacological and electrophysiological methods to show that: (1) Surgically removing the cockroach SEG prior to wasp stinging prolongs the duration of the sting 5-fold, suggesting that the wasp actively targets the SEG during the stinging sequence; (2) injecting a sodium channel blocker, procaine, into the SEG of non-stung cockroaches reversibly decreases spontaneous and evoked walking, suggesting that the SEG plays an important role in the up-regulation of locomotion; (3) artificial focal injection of crude milked venom into the SEG of non-stung cockroaches decreases spontaneous and evoked walking, as seen with naturally-stung cockroaches; and (4) spontaneous and evoked neuronal spiking activity in the SEG, recorded with an extracellular bipolar microelectrode, is markedly decreased in stung cockroaches versus non-stung controls. We have identified the neuronal substrate responsible for the venom-induced manipulation of the cockroach's drive for walking. Our data strongly support previous findings suggesting a critical and permissive role for the SEG in the regulation of locomotion in insects. By injecting a venom cocktail directly into the SEG, the parasitoid Jewel Wasp selectively manipulates the cockroach's motivation to initiate walking without interfering with other non-related behaviors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010047" title=""&gt;The Walking Behaviour of Pedestrian Social Groups and Its Impact on Crowd Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behaviour consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to 70% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends, couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because of its "non-aerodynamic" shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among individuals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010068" title=""&gt;'Positive' Results Increase Down the Hierarchy of the Sciences&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the "hardness" of scientific research--i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors--is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a "positive" (full or partial) or "negative" support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in "softer" sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010039" title=""&gt;Searching PubMed during a Pandemic&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic has generated thousands of articles and news items. However, finding relevant scientific articles in such rapidly developing health crises is a major challenge which, in turn, can affect decision-makers' ability to utilise up-to-date findings and ultimately shape public health interventions. This study set out to show the impact that the inconsistent naming of the pandemic can have on retrieving relevant scientific articles in PubMed/MEDLINE. We first formulated a PubMed search algorithm covering different names of the influenza pandemic and simulated the results that it would have retrieved from weekly searches for relevant new records during the first 10 weeks of the pandemic. To assess the impact of failing to include every term in this search, we then conducted the same searches but omitted in turn "h1n1," "swine," "influenza" and "flu" from the search string, and compared the results to those for the full string. On average, our core search string identified 44.3 potentially relevant new records at the end of each week. Of these, we determined that an average of 27.8 records were relevant. When we excluded one term from the string, the percentage of records missed out of the total number of relevant records averaged 18.7% for omitting "h1n1," 13.6% for "swine," 17.5% for "influenza," and 20.6% for "flu." Due to inconsistent naming, while searching for scientific material about rapidly evolving situations such as the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, there is a risk that one will miss relevant articles. To address this problem, the international scientific community should agree on nomenclature and the specific name to be used earlier, and the National Library of Medicine in the US could index potentially relevant materials faster and allow publishers to add alert tags to such materials.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is a week of faithful celebration. On Monday and Tuesday nights, Jewish families and friends in the United States and around the world gathered for a Seder to commemorate the Exodus from Egypt and the triumph of hope and perseverance over injustice and oppression.  On Sunday, my family will join other Christians all over the world in marking the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we worship in different ways, we also remember the shared spirit of humanity that inhabits us all — Jews and Christians, Muslims and Hindus, believers and &lt;strong&gt;nonbelievers&lt;/strong&gt; alike.

Sure, there's a whole lot of well-deserved hoopla about the LHC, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/starting_with_a_little_bang_th.php"&gt;world's #1 particle accelerator&lt;/a&gt; in terms of energy!  But don't forget about #2, Fermilab's Tevatron, which &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; holds the honor of being the first place I ever worked in physics!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/dont_write_off_fermilab_yet/tevatron.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/dont_write_off_fermilab_yet/tevatron-thumb-500x409-44283.jpeg" width="500" height="409" alt="tevatron.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fermilab has been operating since the 1970s, and has been responsible for many of the most outstanding discoveries in the history of particle physics.  Remember the standard model?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/dont_write_off_fermilab_yet/_41136526_standard_model2_416.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/dont_write_off_fermilab_yet/_41136526_standard_model2_416-thumb-500x480-44285.gif" width="500" height="480" alt="_41136526_standard_model2_416.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard model tells us that the most fundamental things in nature are the things that make up normal matter (six quarks and six leptons), the things that carry forces (the four gauge bosons), and the thing that gives everything else mass (the Higgs).  This was first proposed and worked out in the late 1960s/early 1970s by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg"&gt;Steven Weinberg&lt;/a&gt; and others, and has been the most rigorously verified physical theory ever!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How has Fermilab helped?  For starters, Fermilab's was the accelerator where the bottom quark, top quark, and tau neutrino were discovered.  It's the place where CP-violation, an intrinsic difference between matter and antimatter (and the thing that allows our Universe to have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_4.php"&gt;more matter than antimatter&lt;/a&gt;), was first directly observed, and it's the only place that's ever precisely measured the masses, lifetimes and &lt;a href="http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/new/top/2007/mass/topwidth/topwidth.html"&gt;widths&lt;/a&gt; -- or intrinsic uncertainty of masses -- of the highest energy particles in the Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/dont_write_off_fermilab_yet/Collider%20Detector%20at%20Fermilab.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="Collider Detector at Fermilab.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a bad career at all!  But Fermilab isn't done yet, not by any stretch.  You see, Fermilab -- much like Aesop's tortoise -- still has a shot to win the race to find the Higgs!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they're "only" colliding particles at 2 TeV (as opposed to 7 TeV for the LHC), Fermilab's detectors are very sensitive to the signatures that a Higgs boson will leave behind.  By 2011, the Tevatron (the name of the accelerator at Fermilab) will have enough events that it should either find evidence for the Higgs boson...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/dont_write_off_fermilab_yet/theory_higgs.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/dont_write_off_fermilab_yet/theory_higgs-thumb-500x357-44288.jpeg" width="500" height="357" alt="theory_higgs.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...or it should be able to declare that &lt;b&gt;no&lt;/b&gt; evidence was found for the Higgs, and it can start placing real, meaningful limits towards ruling it out!  In fact, thanks to Fermilab, we can already say that &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; the Higgs exists, it &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; in the mass range below.  (Image credit: Gregorio Bernardi.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/dont_write_off_fermilab_yet/Tevatron%20Higgs.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/dont_write_off_fermilab_yet/Tevatron%20Higgs-thumb-500x325-44290.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="Tevatron Higgs.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by the end of 2011, just from Fermilab (regardless of what the LHC does), we should find the Higgs if it's lighter than the top quark!  (And, FYI, our theories say it &lt;b&gt;should&lt;/b&gt; be.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermilab's been at this a long time, and while the LHC is getting all the press, they're not the only ones in the race!  And just so you don't forget, here's a link to the Fermilab rap music video; enjoy!

There &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; any public restrooms in Berkeley’, you say.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Cox will be presenting his “What I Learned at Straight Camp” talk for the on-campus group SANE (Students Advocating a Nonreligious Ethos):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starting in 2007, Sacramento writer Ted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Cox went undercover in gay-to-straight therapy programs. He attended  weekly support meetings, conferences and a 48-hour “healing touch” camp  in Arizona. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This presentation details the weird times he had posing as a  “same-sex attracted” Christian and includes music, videos and a live  demonstration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: Friday, April 9.2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time: 7:00pm-8:00pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location: Cal Campus, 2050 VLSB (&lt;a href="http://saneatberkeley.org/images/stories/2050vlsb.png"&gt;Map&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted will speak about his intervention adventures at a Christian camp (no pun  intended) designed to change one’s sexual orientation, like it’s some sort of mental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wholesome  and godly retreat where a dozen men stay in a cabin together – but it’s  not like sex ‘addicts’ who attend therapy to pick up partners at all…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly intrigued by the “live demonstration”, and I  wonder if Ted received a certificate upon completion of the course…now that’s one I want right next  to my certificate of ordination from &lt;a href="http://www.universalministries.com/doctrine.html"&gt;Universal  Ministries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Part 3: The medicalisation of rape? (with apologies)

The DSM-IV makes an interesting definitional decision which may seem a bit peculiar at first. A mental condition is normally only defined as a ‘disorder’ if it causes the sufferer ‘clinically significant distress’.

Today we watched the 3rd reading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;In short: Democracy wasn't present. Those wishing to censor ideas have been given a most powerful weapon. Culture will suffer. Whilst creators will gain nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;My girlfriend and I gathered on the couch. Laptops out. Phones out. TV on. Twitter buzzing, Youtube satirising. Forums racing. People don't merely consume anymore. To &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; consume doesn't even make &lt;strong&gt;sense&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;During the minuscule 2 hours the 2nd reading took one man mashed up the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23debill"&gt;#DEBill twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; with the parliament feed &lt;a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=1284"&gt;onto his TV&lt;/a&gt; to avoid having to multitask so much. He published his work so others could do the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remixing, reusing, editing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overnight one excellent person remixed one particularly inane part of the 2nd reading to make a very important point:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline;float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/U0Ru8qlQEH0%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remixing, reusing, editing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://nevali.net/post/501647501/an-open-letter-to-sion-simon-pete-wishart-david"&gt;Open letters&lt;/a&gt; were written. Crowd sourced lists of the MPs in attendance were pulled together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;20,000 wrote to their MPs. Thousands protested or rang MPs. #DEBill became the top trending topic on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;There are 646 MPs. About &lt;a href="http://debillitated.heroku.com/"&gt;40 turned up&lt;/a&gt; for the second reading. About 16 made it to the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third reading has been just as bad. Almost Empty. 2 hours given to debate amendments to 50 clauses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;The first clause took 1hr. The last 49 were glossed over in the last hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Ten minutes before the vote labour MPs put down their drinks, pulled themselves out of the bar and stumbled in to vote for the Bill. Having listened to nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_mUjBpHQiRKw/S70fhh2nlMI/AAAAAAAAATY/NDMe91V1zyI/s800/Screen_shot_2010-04-07_at_21.03.30.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_mUjBpHQiRKw/S70fgW_NnfI/AAAAAAAAATU/Y4WSpHbtrwU/s800/Screen_shot_2010-04-07_at_21-thumb.03.30.png" height="214" width="380" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WikiLeaks has been releasing hugely important videos this week. The USA has been trying to shut them down, for leaking footage of an american helicopter killing Reuters Journalists in Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;John Hemming MP (Lib, Birmingham) is a member of the BPI. His money comes from media. If anyone should support the bill it should be him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;But instead he calls it 'Absurd.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Why? Because he states that the Bill will allow the USA (or others) to claim copyright on that video and shut down the website and forbid sharers of it access to the internet. Despite it's important worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;John Redwood MP (Con, Wokingham) agreed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is really about Censorship on the Web" - John Redwood MP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;The true hero was &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/tom_watson"&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/a&gt; (Labour MP) who quickly came to be the people's champion. His criticism of the bill didn't stop with the preposterous technical issues (ip address are not fingerprints) or the equally preposterous human rights violations (guilty till proven innocent, child downloads musics - dad loses the internet he needs for his job). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;He went on to point out that remixing copyrighted works is part of culture now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;His example?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_mUjBpHQiRKw/S70fi7GWKGI/AAAAAAAAATg/3yrG_2S6P8s/s800/Labour-campaign-poster-fe-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_mUjBpHQiRKw/S70fiZjuKoI/AAAAAAAAATc/m0LRfGe0JWY/s800/Labour-campaign-poster-fe-1-thumb.jpg" height="228" width="380" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The remixed Ashes to Ashes poster that Labour and the Conservatives have been having so much fun with over the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remixing, reusing, editing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;They all fall foul of the bill they've just passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As do you for reading this page.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Today was a huge failure for democracy. A bill was passed, unread and unanalysed by computer illiterate MPs who didn't attend the debates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Here are what I feel these are the most terrible consequences of the last 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bill that makes the ricockulous DMCA look sensible has passed without proper debate or democratic process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The internet generation, who cares deeply about this matter was watching.&lt;br&gt;They saw the empty parliament.&lt;br&gt;They heard the ignorant comments.&lt;br&gt;They saw democracy fail.&lt;br&gt;They are not pleased.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scientists, Journalists and Skeptics are working so hard to fight the abuse of Libel Laws to stifle debate and censor criticism. The existence of the Digital Economy Bill will allow so many avenues for censorship that we need to start all over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Piracy is a serious concern to the mainstream media, and yet remix/reuse of material is part and parcel of our culture today. If the bill works then MPs will make so many innocent parties criminals and it will be a disaster for the UK. But If the bill fails then they will have convinced Pirates that the Government is clueless and toothless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The British Legislative process is fundamentally and comprehensively broken. And today MPs showed that in detail to an extremely internet savvy audience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;On the eve of the first true internet election, this will stand as the defining moment that summarises how out of touch the Government is with respect to the populace. I don't think they appreciate how much attention we can give them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;How difficult we will make this for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;I will leave you with this.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The subject of this paper, the accommodation of college students with modest learning disabilities, is rarely discussed. It operates under a cloak of secrecy, both because of legal privacy rules and because no one on campus wants to appear to criticize the disabled. yet the number of college students receiving special accommodation is growing dramatically and will soon pose serious questions for universities about whether, or to what extent, such support is appropriate and warranted.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
“Accommodating College Students with Learning Disabilities: ADD, ADHD, and Dyslexia,” by Melana Zyler Vickers, reveals the assistance provided for students with learning disabilities so mild that they may not be visible to others. The paper is not about severe disabilities such as autism, brain injuries, or visual or hearing impairment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The paper is based on interviews with on-campus experts in learning disabilities, with professors who deal with learning-disabled students, and with students themselves. It includes statistics showing the rise in accommodations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Vickers asks such questions as whether students with such disabilities are being improperly prepared for their future lives, when they will have little or no accommodation; whether accommodation unfairly benefits some but not others; and whether the privacy rules are ultimately harmful to the students themselves. we believe that this report will encourage more open discussion and careful thought about the role of universities in dealing with these disabilities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.  This is *much* better than street preaching.&lt;/p&gt;

However, there are simple ways to reduce your consumption.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/cfl.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="cfl" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/cfl-300x216.jpg" alt="CFL" width="300" height="216"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Less Energy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never drive when you can walk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to energy-efficient appliances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace traditional light bulbs with CFLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Less Water:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit showers to ten minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off the faucet when brushing your teeth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect rainwater to quench your houseplants and garden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Less:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use smaller plates – they make a normal portion look ample.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill half your plate with vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chew gum while you’re cooking – those tiny tastes add up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More ways to reduce your consumption, save money, and generate less trash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop using paper towels.&lt;/strong&gt; Believe or not, you don’t need them. Old tee-shirts, receiving blankets, and other fabric remnants work well for most every clean-up job. Cut them into a usable size and keep them on hand throughout your house. Plus, they’re washable and reusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say “Neither” to “Paper or plastic?” &lt;/strong&gt;Use your own canvas tote bags at the supermarket to carry your groceries. Reusable shopping bags can help eliminate the paper and plastic bags piling up in landfills around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay for everything with cash.&lt;/strong&gt; Want to simplify your life and consume less? Start buying everything with cash – not even a debit card. When you’re paying with real dollar bills, you’ll be much more conscious about your spending.&lt;/p&gt;

This question is not only relevant to primatologists and zoologists. Even though instances of predation on humans is relatively rare, big cats still kill and consume people, and when they do they can virtually obliterate a body. Yet, just like a human criminal, the dining habits of big cats leave tell-tale clues, and in 2004 researchers Travis Pickering and Kristian Carlson fed two captive leopards eight complete baboon carcasses each in order catalog the most useful ways to identify the victim of a big cat kill.

That, in and of itself is not news; what is news is the age of the thing: 23,000 years BP, obtained by optically stimulate luminescence (OSL)The structure is a stone wall that blocked two-thirds of the entrance to the Theopetra cave near Kalambaka on the north edge of the Thessalian plain. It was constructed 23,000 years ago, probably as a barrier to cold winds.“An optical dating test, known as Optically Stimulated Luminescence, was applied on quartz grains nested within the stones. We dated four different samples from the sediment and soil materials, and all provided identical dates,” Nikolaos Zacharias, director of the laboratory of archaeometry at the University of Peloponnese, told Discovery News. This is definitely cool, as there are not very many such structures known from the Paleolithic. One possible, though somewhat shaky, comparable example is that of "two low, roughly linear wall-like piles of cobbles, each about 50m long [that] border a portion of the scatter" of the scatter of mostly Upper Paleolithic stone tools recovered at site MAC064, Iran (Rosenberg 1984:83). I was surprised, though, that the report refers to the Theopetra structure as the oldest 'man-made' (sic) structure. This is because I can think of at least one other stone structure, at Ucagizli Cave in Turkey (Kuhn et al 2003: 114-116 - available as a free pdf here), that dates to slightly older than ca. 30,000 BP. Here's what it looks like:And though it appears at first glance to be perhaps less impressive than the Theopetra wall (though the picture in the DN report is a bit unclear as to what the exact boundaries of the wall are), Kuhn et al. (2003: 114) describe the Ucagizli wall as a feature consisting "of a single arched course of limestone blocks, each 20-40cm in length. The blocks form a 'wall' running roughly parallel to the back wall of the cave at a distance of 1.5 to 2m from it. The alignment is clearly artifical: it corresponds with neither the cave's dripline nor any obvious fault or crack in the roof , and there were no blocks of comparable size in the surrounding sediments. Moreover, several of the blocks were set on edge rather than resting on their broad face." By analogy to ethnographic observations, they interpret it as most likely demarcating the edges of "a bedding area in the back of the cave."So yes, the Theopetra wall is old, but not necessarily the oldest evidence of an artificial stone structure that we have for the Upper Paleolithic. In any case, it'll be very interesting to see what other material is associated with this wall at Theopetra, to see whether or not its interpretation as a windbreak is borne out. As I've discussed before with the case of La Folie, the correlation between features and other aspects of the archaeological record is critical in inferring their ultimate function.ReferencesKuhn, S.

She labelled them “tracks of unknown animal”. The first one looks like a human hand print, but the second shows a set of prints, clearly not made by human hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what made them? NB There are no bears left in the Lakes, and the biggest mammals are ungulates. Mind you, it is hard to tell what the scale is. They seem to be smaller than a human hand. Could it be a pine marten? The small size would tend to exclude the possibility that someone was wearing boots with pawprints on them – in WW2 British Special Operations Executive agents in the Far East wore boots with soles with a human footprint on them, but reversed, so anyone tracking them in the jungle would think a) they were a “native” and b) they were going the other way…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (8 April 2010):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After over 20 contributions (including from Fiona, who took the photos), I think we can be pretty confident it’s a badger print. Here’s a useful guide to prints of British mammals (when I was a lad we had these on the soles of our shoes – nothing to do with the SOE shenanigans mentioned at the beginning of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-10545" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/the-lakeland-yeti/footprints-2-2/"&gt;&lt;img title="Footprints (2)" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/footprints-21.gif?w=250&amp;amp;h=225" alt="" width="250" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large pad kind of gives it away, no? And here are some badger prints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-10546" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/the-lakeland-yeti/badger-footprints/"&gt;&lt;img title="badger-footprints" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/badger-footprints.jpg?w=400&amp;amp;h=300" alt="" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the claws on the Lakeland Yeti’s prints seem to be much more spread out… Is the mystery really solved?&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s our third group of  super-cool charitable nonprofits run for women, by women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/LorenCovey.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Smiles Forever" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/LorenCovey.png" alt="" width="300" height="432"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;A volunteer for Smiles Forever, an organization that provides dental care for women and children in Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dutzidesign.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dutzi Rescue Bags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Designer bags to support indigenous Mayan communities in the Yucatan. Former fashion editor, Ariane Dutzi, started making these totes after moving to Mexico. She designs the lightweight burlap and raffia totes, and trains indigenous women to make them, so that the women can earn money while working from home at their own pace (no factories, no assembly lines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.runforcongowomen.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run For Congo Women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Organized races to support women in war and post-war zones like the Democratic Republic of Congo. When runner Lisa Shannon saw Women for Women International Congo on the Oprah show in 2006, she was moved to tears. She was also moved to do something about it, so she started running to raise money for women in Congo. Since then, she’s raised more than $600,000 through races in the U.S. to help Congolese women rebuild their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.smilesforever.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smiles Forever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Non-profit dental hygiene training for Bolivian women, provided by volunteer American dental professionals. Founded in 2003 by Sandra Robinson Kemper, who volunteered in Cochabamba, Bolivia in 1999 and was shocked by the poor level of care. Back home, she did enough fundraising to return to Cochabamba a few months later, and independently provided dental care at a homeless shelter for women and children. She continued to return, eventually secured funding to create a two-chair dental training center, and recruited other volunteers to start teaching Bolivian women how to provide dental care themselves. The center now educates women at the shelter and provides dental services and fluoride treatments for the local community.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of dealing soberly with the climate problem they prefer to attack climate scientists, i.e. the bearers of bad news. The German magazine DER SPIEGEL has played this game last week under the suggestive heading “Die Wolkenschieber” – which literally translated can mean both “the cloud movers” and “the cloud traffickers” (available in English &lt;a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,686697,00.html"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;). The article continues on this level, alleging “sloppy work, falsifications and exaggerations”. By doing so DER SPIEGEL digs deeply into the old relic box of “climate skeptics” and freely helps itself on their websites instead of critically researching the issues at hand.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a scientist I do not have the time to dedicate a whole day to one article and to do much research on it, which is why I here discuss only a few of the most obvious flaws and distortions of facts in this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature data &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cynically and inhumanely the article sets off with remarks on our British colleague Phil Jones. The authors extensively revel in sentences like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He feels a constant tightness in his chest. He takes beta-blockers to help him get through the day. He is gaunt and his skin is pallid.&lt;br&gt;
Jones is finished: emotionally, physically and professionally. He has contemplated suicide several times recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the result of a media campaign consisting of precisely such poorly researched and fact-twisting articles as this one, for which Marco Evers, Olaf Stampf and Gerald Traufetter are responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is first greatly hyped is then gleefully destroyed. According to DER SPIEGEL “the entire profession” of climate science “based much of its work on his [Jones&amp;#39;] research” and “almost every internal debate among the climate popes passed through his computer”. Now it happens that I, most likely not an untypical example, have never worked with Jones’ data and have only exchanged a handful of emails (out of tens of thousands every year) with him, although I do probably count as part of the “profession”. There is a whole set of other data of global temperature, e.g. the data from &lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt"&gt;NASA &lt;/a&gt;which is based on weather stations (and which I prefer &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/10/a-warming-pause/"&gt;for various reasons&lt;/a&gt;) or data from &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/anomalies/annual.land_ocean.90S.90N.df_1901-2000mean.dat"&gt;NOAA &lt;/a&gt;or the satellite data from &lt;a href="http://www.remss.com/data/msu/monthly_time_series/RSS_Monthly_MSU_AMSU_Channel_TLT_Anomalies_Land_and_Ocean_v03_2.txt"&gt;RSS &lt;/a&gt;or the &lt;a href="http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/public/msu/t2lt/tltglhmam_5.3"&gt;UAH&lt;/a&gt;. As is always scientifically useful, important conclusions are based not on one single set of data but on the fact that a whole range of competing scientific groups find consistent results, using different methods (see Figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/5temps.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/5temps.jpg" alt="" title="5temps" width="453" height="309"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global mean temperature (annual means) according to the 5 most often used data sets. The graph shows the deviation from the mean of the last 30 years, as well as the linear trend over the last 30 years. The data from the Hadley Center, NASA and NOAA use measurements from surface weather stations, each with its specific method of quality control (e.g. correction for heat island effects) and interpolation and spatial integration. Independently, the satellite data from RSS and UAH (available from 1979 onwards) provide two different analyses based on the same microwave raw data. These measure the temperature of the middle troposphere, the variations of which can differ from those of the surface temperatures on short time scales. The record El Niño year of 1998 is an example. It has caused a greater temperature anomaly in the troposphere, presumably as warm air rising in the tropics spread in middle altitudes. The climatic trends, however, do not differ significantly since on longer time scales the surface and tropospheric temperatures are closely coupled due to turbulent mixing processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of raw data from worldwide weather stations and vessels is indeed often unsatisfactory, especially if one goes further back in time – after all they were gathered to help forecast the weather and not to determine long-term climate trends. However, the error margin has been &lt;a href="http://hadobs.metoffice.com/hadcrut3/HadCRUT3_accepted.pdf"&gt;carefully analyzed&lt;/a&gt; – as is standard in science – and is shown in the &lt;a href="http://hadobs.metoffice.com/hadcrut3/diagnostics/comparison.html"&gt;temperature graphs&lt;/a&gt; on the Hadley Center´s website as well as in the IPCC report, and to date there is no reason to assume that the actual temperature evolution lies outside these error margins – the more so as the satellite data correspond well with the ground data. Whether the global warming trend was 0,15 or 0,17°C per decade in the past decades is of no relevance to any practical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/ts6_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/ts6_small.jpg" alt="" title="ts6_small" width="460" height="299"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPCC-Figure of global mean temperature 1850-2005 (&lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/graphics/ar4-wg1/jpg/ts6.jpg"&gt;Fig. TS6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to DER SPIEGEL Jones has erased raw data and is “an activist or missionary who views ‘his’ data as his personal shrine” who “is intent on protecting it from the critical eyes of his detractors”. However, Jones is neither the producer and owner nor the archivist of these data – it is simply data from the national weather agencies, who also are responsible for its archiving or for the question to whom and under what circumstances they may be passed on. The majority of these data is freely accessible online. However, some weather services do not allow their data to be passed on because they sell such data. Other scientists have &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/12/are-the-cru-data-suspect-an-objective-assessment/"&gt;compared &lt;/a&gt;the CRU-data with freely available raw data from weather stations. And at NASA one can find the &lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/sources/"&gt;computer algorithms&lt;/a&gt; which are used to calculate the global mean temperature, publicly available for everybody. There is hardly any other scientific field in which &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/data-sources/"&gt;more data and computer codes are freely accessible&lt;/a&gt; than in climate science (e.g. also codes and data of my current papers on sea level rise in &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Nature/rahmstorf_science_2007.pdf"&gt;Science 2007 &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Journals/vermeer_rahmstorf_2009.pdf"&gt;PNAS 2009&lt;/a&gt;). Do for example economists, on whose advice many political decisions depend, disclose their raw data and the computer codes of their models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British House of Commons has just published the &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/387/387i.pdf"&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;by the committee which has been appointed to examine the accusations made against Phil Jones. The report concludes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus on Professor Jones and CRU has been largely misplaced. [...] The scientific reputation of Professor Jones and CRU remains intact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Jones has been rehabilitated will be welcomed by all those who know this decent, always helpful and universally well-liked scientist. For the general public the conclusions on his scientific findings will be even more important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the data that CRU used were not publicly available-which they mostly are-or the methods not published-which they have been-its published results would still be credible: the results from CRU agree with those drawn from other international data sets; in other words, the analyses have been repeated and the conclusions have been verified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ever-popular “hockey stick” discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DER SPIEGEL resurrects one of the oldest shelf-warmers of the “climate skeptics”: the hockey stick debate and a series of flawed accusations with it. The so-called “hockey stick” is a temperature construction for the Northern Hemisphere for the last millennium published by Michael Mann, Ray Bradley and Malcolm Hughes in 1999, of which DER SPIEGEL writes that the Canadian &lt;a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/mcintyre-and-mckitrick-unmasked"&gt;Steve McIntyre&lt;/a&gt; unmasked it as “a sham”. (And this is the only clue within the whole article pointing to the alleged “falsifications”). This is not true. Even a committee of the National Academy of Sciences looked in 2006 at the accusations made by McIntyre and has &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/22/science/22cnd-climate.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ex=1154577600&amp;amp;en=a5becb7939461059&amp;amp;ei=5070"&gt;cleared the authors&lt;/a&gt; of all suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meteo.psu.edu/~mann/shared/research/MANNETAL98/"&gt;Raw data and computer codes of the “hockey stick”&lt;/a&gt; are online and publicly available, and independent scientists have &lt;a href="http://www.ucar.edu/news/releases/2005/ammann.shtml"&gt;recalculated everything years ago &lt;/a&gt;using their own codes (also &lt;a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/ccr/ammann/millennium/codes/"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;). The current IPCC report from 2007 shows in &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/graphics/ar4-wg1/jpg/fig-6-10.jpg"&gt;Fig. 6.10&lt;/a&gt; these reconstructions together with a dozen more which have meanwhile been added; the &lt;a href="http://www.copenhagendiagnosis.org/"&gt;Copenhagen Diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2009 shows some even more recent ones in Fig. 19 (page 43). All show consistent results, not in detail but in their fundamental aspects. This is why the conclusions drawn in the IPCC report of 2007 were stronger than back in 2001, when the “hockey stick” had been shown for the first time. The IPCC report 2007 concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palaeoclimatic information supports the interpretation that the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous 1,300 years. [Summary for Policy Makers, S. 9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third report from 2001 such a statement had been made only for he last 1000 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All reconstructions – with or without using tree-ring data – agree that the temperature in the Northern Hemisphere (for the Southern Hemisphere insufficient data existed until recently) is higher today than in medieval times. DER SPIEGEL simply claims the opposite: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many indications that in medieval times, between 900 and 1,300 A.D., when the Vikings raised livestock in Greenland and grape vines were cultivated in Scotland, it was in fact warmer than it is today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No scientific evidence in support of this claim is mentioned. Locally – in the North Atlantic region – climate reconstructions do indeed show higher temperatures than today (see Fig.); hence there is no contradiction to the anecdotal evidence about Greenland and Scotland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/mca.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/mca.jpg" alt="" title="mca" width="396" height="216"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Temperature difference between the middle ages (years 950 to 1250) and the modern period (years 1961 to 1990) according to a reconstruction by Mann et al. 2009. The grey &lt;del&gt;shading&lt;/del&gt;hatching shows regions with statistically significant results. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, looking at the forcings, it would be surprising if it had been warmer in medieval times than now. Forcings are the factors which affect the global radiation budget of the Earth, such as variation of solar activity, volcanic eruptions or changes of the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If we compute the temperature evolution from the known forcings over the last thousand years, the result is consistent with the temperature reconstructions mentioned above. Merely one (in the meantime corrected) model simulation by Zorita and von Storch is an exception. These model calculations (18 in total) are compiled and compared with data in the IPCC report in figures &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/graphics/ar4-wg1/jpg/fig-6-13.jpg"&gt;6.13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/graphics/ar4-wg1/jpg/fig-6-14.jpg"&gt;6.14 &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only by looking at the &lt;em&gt;forcings &lt;/em&gt;can one draw conclusions about the causes of global warming – the fact that currently it is unusually warm does not by itself tell us anything about the causes. If only natural and no anthropogenic forcing existed it would be much colder now than in medieval times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hockey stick debate exemplifies how the „climate skeptics“-lobby has tried to discredit an inconvenient scientific finding over the course of many years, without success. The scientific conclusions have proven to be robust.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tropical storms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the subheading “The Myth of the Monster Storm” the SPIEGEL article reports on a “hurricane war” amongst US climate scientists: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alarmists, using the rhetoric of fiery sermons, warned that Katrina was only the beginning, and that we would soon see the advent of superstorms of unprecedented fury. Members of the more levelheaded camp were vehemently opposed to such predictions and insisted that there was no justification for such fears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, no example for the “rhetoric of fiery sermons” is quoted. “Levelheaded” is the well-worn SPIEGEL-parlance for describing anyone who downplays climate change, regardless of whether their claims are scientifically well-founded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a recent &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n3/pdf/ngeo779.pdf"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Nature Geoscience&lt;/em&gt; is cited which allegedly announces “the all-clear signal on the hurricane front” and which signifies “another setback for the IPCC”. This is because “the IPCC report warned that there would be more hurricanes in a greenhouse climate”. Let us simply quote from the abstract of the new study: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future projections based on theory and high-resolution dynamical models consistently indicate that greenhouse warming will cause the globally averaged intensity of tropical cyclones to shift towards stronger storms, with intensity increases of 2-11% by 2100. Existing modelling studies also consistently project decreases in the globally averaged frequency of tropical cyclones, by 6-34%. Balanced against this, higher resolution modelling studies typically project substantial increases in the frequency of the most intense cyclones, and increases of the order of 20% in the precipitation rate within 100 km of the storm centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, fewer but heavier tropical storms can be expected. By the way, the potential destructiveness of storms increases more steeply than the wind velocities; a 2-11% higher speed means a 6-37% higher destructiveness. (Emanuel 2005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what did the IPCC report have to say on this topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a range of models, it is likely that future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become more intense, with larger peak wind speeds and more heavy precipitation associated with ongoing increases of tropical sea surface temperatures. There is less confidence in projections of a global decrease in numbers of tropical cyclones. [Summary for Policy Makers, page 15.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, fewer but heavier tropical storms can be expected, even if there was still less confidence about the first aspect at the time. The &lt;a href="http://www.wmo.int/"&gt;WMO&lt;/a&gt;, whose expert group has published this study, consequently describes the result &lt;a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/mediacentre/infonotes/infonote62_en.html"&gt;as follows&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substantial scientific progress has led the Expert Team to raise their confidence levels on several aspects of how tropical cyclone activity may change under projected climate scenarios.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means: there is no reason for speaking of a “setback” in a “war”; rather the early findings of the IPCC report have been given a higher confidence level. The SPIEGEL story on this issue falls into a category of false allegations against IPCC mentioned &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/02/ipcc-errors-facts-and-spin/"&gt;by us already in February&lt;/a&gt;, namely those which can be falsified by simply reading the report (in this case even a quick look at the &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf"&gt;Summary for Policy Makers&lt;/a&gt; would have sufficed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IPCC mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to DER SPIEGEL “more and more mistakes, evidence of sloppy work and exaggerations in the current IPCC report are appearing”. We already &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/02/ipcc-errors-facts-and-spin/"&gt;investigated this&lt;/a&gt; and came to the conclusion that of the mistakes discussed excitedly in the media, nothing much remains except for the Himalaya mistake. The SPIEGEL does not have anything else to offer either – it counts “Jones’ disputed temperature curve” as one of them; apart from that “the supposed increase in natural disasters” – wrongly so as we have already &lt;a href="http://www.wissenslogs.de/wblogs/blog/klimalounge/klimadaten/2010-02-17/verkehrte-welt"&gt;showed (in German)&lt;/a&gt; reacting to an article published in &lt;em&gt;Die Welt&lt;/em&gt; which claimed the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DER SPIEGEL elaborates on the story of the alleged “phantom graph” by Robert Muir-Wood which we have explained there as well. According to DER SPIEGEL, Roger Pielke “tried to find out where the graph had come from” and “traced it” to Robert Muir-Wood. This must have been hard indeed, given that Muir-Wood, who provided the graph, is named by the IPCC in the figure caption. The only difficult thing is to find this graph (which incidentally is correct but not very informative) at all: other than DER SPIEGEL claims, it is not in the IPCC report itself but &lt;del&gt;only&lt;/del&gt; provided as “&lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter1sm.pdf"&gt;supplementary material&lt;/a&gt;” on its website, where the IPCC publishes such background material. Although on the 3,000 pages of the report there was no space for it, the graph now seems to be important to SPIEGEL readers for reasons unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it all about?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPIEGEL defames some of the best scientists worldwide, who not least for this reason have become prime targets for the “climate skeptics”. If you look at publications in the three scientific &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/17/6883.full"&gt;top journals&lt;/a&gt; (Nature, Science, PNAS), the just 44-year-old Mike Mann has already published 9 studies there, Phil Jones 24 (comments, letters and book reviews not included). In contrast, DER SPIEGEL always calls upon the same witness, the mathematician Hans von Storch, who has published only a single article in the prime journals mentioned (and that &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/04/a-correction-with-repercussions/"&gt;was faulty&lt;/a&gt;). But he says the politically wanted thing, even if without any supporting evidence from the scientific literature: in his view we can &lt;a href="http://coast.gkss.de/staff/storch/Media/interviews/SPIEGEL.final.pdf"&gt;easily adapt &lt;/a&gt;to climate change. He also publicly accuses the vast majority of his colleagues who disagree with him of &lt;a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,469539,00.html"&gt;alarmism&lt;/a&gt;, calls them “&lt;a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-39080872.html"&gt;prophets of doom&lt;/a&gt;” or &lt;a href="http://coast.gkss.de/staff/storch/pdf/welt.041000.pdf"&gt;“eco-activists” who indoctrinate the public&lt;/a&gt;. He also insinuates &lt;a href="http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/meldung154752.html"&gt;political or financial motives for disseminating horror scenarios&lt;/a&gt;. In this article he says things like “unfortunately, some of my colleagues behave like pastors, who present their results in precisely such a way that they’ll fit to their sermons”. This quote matches the article´s  inflationary usage of the words “guru” “popes” “fiery sermons” “missionaries” and so forth. And he goes on: “It’s certainly no coincidence that all the mistakes that became public always tended in the direction of exaggeration and alarmism.” The following statement would have probably been more correct: it is certainly no coincidence that all the alleged errors scandalized in the media always tended in the direction of exaggeration and alarmism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that DER SPIEGEL does not care about science. This really is about politics. This year will decide about the future of the German climate policy: in the fall the government will announce its new energy strategy. This will decide whether the energy transformation towards a sustainable electricity supply, increasingly based on renewables, will be pushed forward or thwarted. In a global context the issue is whether global warming can be limited to a maximum of 2 ºC, as the &lt;a href="http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf"&gt;Copenhagen Accord&lt;/a&gt; calls for, or whether this opportunity will be lost. The power struggle on this issue is in full gear. The energy transformation can best be prevented by creating doubts about its urgency. The fact that scandal stories about climate science have to be invented to this end just proves one thing: good, honest arguments against a forceful climate policy apparently do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;p.s. (26 April):&lt;/strong&gt; It’s just a curiosity, but telling: DER SPIEGEL calls Pachauri’s novel “Return to Almora” an “erotic novel”. The novel follows the life story of Sanjay Nath, from a childhood in the 1950s in the Himalayas through decades spent in the US building up a chain of meditation centers, until his final return to the Himalayas at age 60. The 400-page book contains a handful of love scenes, only gently hinted at in a few sentences. Calling this an “erotic novel” is devious; it can only serve the purpose of letting Pachauri appear in a dubious light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt; As Roger Pielke &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/04/climate-scientist-bashing/comment-page-3/#comment-169791"&gt;has pointed out&lt;/a&gt; to us, the Supplementary Material to the IPCC reports is not only available on the IPCC website, but also on a CD-ROM distributed with the printed books.  &lt;/p&gt;

Our café speaker for that night is Rogelio Sullivan, Associate Director of the Advanced Transportation Energy Center and also of the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management Systems Center (FREEDM) at NCSU.  Come and learn how our country is dealing with our ever-increasing energy consumption, and of ways that we may be able to reduce our dependence on foreign oil using a combination of innovative alternative energy cars and changes in our daily transportation habits. 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clash of the Titans; Energy, Environment, and the Economy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, April 20, 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time:  6:30 - 8:30 pm with discussions beginning at 7:00 followed by Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: The Irregardless Café, 901 W. Morgan Street, Raleigh 833-8898&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are approximately 250 million cars on U.S. roads today, fueled primarily by imported oil, and demand is growing. The electric utilities are in the midst of a "Smart Grid" revolution, driven by new technology, increased demand, and need for higher reliability and security.  The U.S. government, along with the auto and electric utility industries, are currently striving for electrification of the transportation sector by way of plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles. All-electric vehicles can provide significant oil savings, improved air quality, reduced energy costs to consumers, increased energy diversity, and support for the electric grid. But are U.S. drivers ready to go all electric?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Speaker:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rogelio Sullivan is the Associate Director of the Advanced Transportation Energy Center and also of the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management Systems Center (FREEDM) at NCSU.  The two research centers are working in partnership with industry to develop technologies that can effectively create the "energy internet"; which will support widespread utilization of renewable energy, plug in electric vehicles, and greater consumer participation in the energy marketplace. Mr. Sullivan is an engineer with more than 20 years of research and development management experience in advanced transportation systems such as hybrids, batteries, lightweight materials, advanced combustion engines, and vehicle auxiliary systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That reclusion &lt;a href="http://nyc-atheists.org/"&gt;ends this weekend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a coup that we never thought possible, New York City Atheists has managed to get Ellen Johnson, the former president of American Atheists, to come speak to us on April 11 to commemorate the birthday of the late Madalyn Murray O’Hair, founder of American Atheists. Johnson’s topic will be: “Madalyn O’Hair: All the Things That She Did Right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson has consented to speak at New York City Atheists’ Brunch on April 11, 2010 to honor the woman who was brave enough to come out as an Atheist long before it was acceptable — or even safe. Madalyn suffered a beating by the Baltimore police, persecution, vandalism of her home and automobile, loss of her job and verbal vilification such as rarely happens to Atheists today. And Johnson wants us to know that though Madalyn was dubbed “The Most Hated Woman in America,” she was actually beloved by many.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the area, this is a talk you won’t want to miss.&lt;br&gt;

of the early Eukaryotes have, more and more, shown a tangled relationship among various proteins (and their coding genes), implicating a large amount of lateral transfer.[7]  The role of mitochondria has changed during this process.  At one time the various amitochondrial Eukaryotes were regarded as (possibly) descended from the ancestral premitochondrial Eukaryote.   By now, however, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that most (probably all) of these lineages are descended form mitochondrial Eukaryotes.[7] To complicate the picture, a number of (probably distantly related) lineages possess mitochondria that are facultative anaerobes.[8]  Among these lineages are several animals such as parasitic helminths such as Fasciola hepatica and Ascaris suum.   It seems plausible that the probable hydrogenosomes of these newly discovered Loricifera are descended from such facultatively anaerobic mitochondria.   (Or more precisely, descended from the original mitochondria via such facultatively anaerobic mitochondria.) It&amp;#39;s interesting to speculate regarding the specific metabolic pathways these species use.   One possibility is that these organelles, despite looking like hydrogenosomes, are actually using sulfate as an electron donor, producing hydrogen sulfide.   Another is that they actually produce hydrogen, which is then used by other organisms for energy, to reduce sulfates to hydrogen sulfide.   Certainly the former would provide more energy for a multicellular creature.   OTOH it would also have (probably) required a longer evolutionary path to reach.  The question I suppose, is whether a simple hydrogen-producing metabolism could have provided enough energy for such a creature.  It certainly seems plausible that a sulfate (or sulfite) reducing metabolism could have evolved in a facultative anaerobe, followed by streamlining into an obligate anaerobe.I&amp;#39;m certainly looking forward to the publication of further research on these animals.T/H Nick AnthisDanovaro, R., Dell&amp;#39;Anno, A., Pusceddu, A., Gambi, C., Heiner, I., &amp;amp; Kristensen, R.

It needs fixin'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy counseling center lawsuit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bal-md.ci.pregnancy30mar30,0,4172720.story"&gt;Do you agree with the archdiocese that Baltimore's law requiring pregnancy centers to post signs stating that they do not provide abortions or birth control referrals is a violation of freedom of speech and religion?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes
      54%
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      No
      44%
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      Not sure
      2%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to clarify the clumsily worded question, right now 54% of the respondents think the Catholic Church is being oppressed by being asked to be truthful about the services their pregnancy centers provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it is terribly cruel of us to tell a church they shouldn't lie or hide the facts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/hey_i_missed_a_poll.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/kgB4O1YkcH4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270670216096"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/nice_gift.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2fc479ab77e04d36</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Nice gift!</title><published>2010-04-07T20:07:26Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T20:07:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/EQNwlFCknEU/nice_gift.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/nice_gift.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Pamela Turner for sending me a box of &lt;a href="http://www.tcho.com/store/"&gt;TCHO chocolates&lt;/a&gt; — they&amp;#39;re fabulous.

And they did so in terms which were directly and starkly critical of the BCA's conduct of the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, the Court of Appeal has provided a detailed critique of the "&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;jot of evidence&lt;/span&gt;" point which always lay at the heart of the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the BCA cannot sensibly rebut Simon Singh's "&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;honest opinion&lt;/span&gt;" defence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, it is possible that the BCA can proceed to apply to the Supreme Court, or that the case can go back to the High Court for trial.  But, in either case, the BCA's position is now the weaker one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if there was some reason for the BCA to hang on until the Court of Appeal decision, that reason has just gone away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have always regarded the BCA case as misconceived.  This was for two reasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, the substantial issue in dispute - the soundness of the evidence base for chiropractic for certain children's ailments - was simply not something which is amenable to a court trial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One did not need to be a Court of Appeal judge to see this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, the evident tactical reason for bringing the claim - to get a "&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;quick win&lt;/span&gt;" of an apology and retraction - was always likely to backfire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And on this I cannot be accused of hindsight.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in August 2008, in a post listing &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2008/08/ten-questions-british-chiropractic.html"&gt; ten questions members of the BCA should be asking&lt;/a&gt; (which, if I may say so, still reads very well), I shared the following insights:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"A decision to sue anyone should indeed never be taken lightly, and usually it should not be made at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A misconceived libel action can be an incredible financial and reputational disaster of the very first order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It can be the maddest, saddest decision any person ever makes"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"Any decision to litigate should always be on the assumption that it will go all the way and that you could lose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It cannot just be assumed that the defendant will settle or surrender."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA clearly did not prepare for litigation on this sensible basis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, I did try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, all that said, it was not until last Thursday that the BCA was procedurally overtaken by Simon Singh, even if the case was misconceived all along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Simon Singh is &lt;a href="http://www.openculture.com/2010/04/libel_reform_a_conversation_with_simon_singh.html"&gt;quoted today&lt;/a&gt; as saying &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"the BCA would have to pay my costs before being allowed to walk away"&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will be painful and expensive, but this is what needs to be done by the BCA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if the decision is made by the BCA to go through the motions of going to trial or the Supreme Court just to somehow "&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;maximise their negotiating position&lt;/span&gt;" for settlement, I think they should instead get prepared - and resourced - to go through with the trial or the appeal in full.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So please no more bluffing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please no more legal manoeuvring on the stupid assumption that Simon Singh will not go through with what the BCA threatens to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One hopes the BCA will have learned their lesson on this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The claim should never have been brought, but one can see why the BCA hung on until the Court of Appeal decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA can still extract itself with some dignity now the procedural advantage has been lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It really should take this opportunity to bring this wretched business to a close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The time has come to settle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, as I did back in August 2008, I offer this insight for free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Jack of Kent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This blogpost was inspired by &lt;a href="http://thinkingisreal.blogspot.com/2010/04/what-would-bca-do.html"&gt;an excellent blogpost&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;James Randi poses as Adam Jersin with a gypsy fortune teller. At the beginning of the video Randi enters the room and while walking to his seat he fakes some lower back pain. Once he sits down the reader asks him to shuffle the cards. Randi does so but in a fumbling manner. Once the reading begins the reader mentions a woman that Randi is involved with and then another woman in his future. Randi does a great job of leading the reader by feeding her questions that she may then elaborate on, trying to make them fit with the reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video is in 2 Parts.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll ask you to attend to this matter of great importance, please.  Our UK friend Simon Singh has been an outstanding and very active critic of pseudoscience for years now. What follows here will explain the situation fully, but I urge you to respond to his request for action, a simple request that will only take a few minutes of your time, but which could result in a major change in UK law that will benefit us – as skeptics – and can have far-reaching results on an international scale.  This is the business of the JREF, to improve the reach and importance of science, a factor that Simon has brought to the attention of the world by his heroic action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please add your name to the roster of dedicated persons in this battle, by reading Simon’s account and following his request for participation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you!&lt;br&gt;James Randi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the silence, but it has been a ridiculously hectic (and happy) time since last week’s victory at the Court of Appeal. However, I urgently wanted to get in touch to update you on the status of my case, the latest news on libel reform and what you can do today to push libel reform up the political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BCA v Singh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April Fool’s Day 2010 was a day to remember. The Court of Appeal gave a ruling in my libel case with the British Chiropractic Association. The ruling strongly backs my arguments and puts me in a much stronger position when my trial eventually takes place. At last, after two years of defending my article and my right to free speech, I seem to have the upper hand and can breathe a small sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the judges made it clear that they did not want to see scientists and science journalists being hauled through the High Court. In particular, they endorsed the view that a so-called comment defence should be adequate for scientific and other articles on matters of public interest. As well as the legal technicalities, the three wise, charming and handsome judges quoted Milton on the persecution of Galileo and directed that the High Court should not become an “Orwellian Ministry of Truth”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libel Reform Campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small step forward for libel reform, but there is still a huge battle to be fought over the issues of costs, libel tourism, public interest defense, balancing the burden of proof, restricting the ability of powerful corporations to bully individuals (e.g., bloggers, journalists, scientists), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The General Election was called yesterday and the manifestos will be published in the next week, so we need one last push to persuade the major parties to commit to libel reform. Although we have already achieved a huge amount (from editorials in all last week’s broadsheets to the Commons Select Committee recommending libel reform), we must keep up the pressure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Labour and Conservative parties have made encouraging sounds about libel reform, but now is the time for them to make commitments in their manifestos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you can do today to pressure politicians&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent over a million minutes and £100,000 defending my article and my right to free speech, so I am asking you to spend just one minute and no money at all persuading others to sign the petition for libel reform &lt;a href="http://www.libelreform.org/sign"&gt;by clicking here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I made this request, we doubled the number of signatories from 17,000 to 35,000. Can we now double the number from almost 50,000 to 100,000?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could ask parents, siblings, colleagues or friends to sign up. You could email everyone in your address book. You could blog about it, mention it to your Facebook friends and Twitter about it. In fact, I have pasted some possible tweets at the end of this email — it would be great if you could tweet one, some, or all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could send all or part of this message to people or just steer them to &lt;a href="http://www.libelreform.org/sign"&gt;Libelreform.org/sign.&lt;/a&gt; Or you could persuade people that English libel law needs radical reform by using some of the reasons listed at the end of this email. Remember, we welcome signatories from around the world because English libel law has a damaging impact globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, please, please apply maximum pressure to the politicians by encouraging as many new signatories as possible. Please do not take my victory last week as a sign that the battle is over. My case is still ongoing and the campaign for libel reform is only just starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hanks for all your support – it has been incredibly important for the campaign and a real morale booster personally over the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ps. Please spread the word by sending out one, some or all of the following tweets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pls RT English libel law silences debate, says UN Human Rights Committee. Sign up at www.libelreform.org &amp;amp; back #libelreform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pls RT English libel costs 140x more than Europe. We can&amp;#39;t afford to defend our words. Sign up at www.libelreform.org &amp;amp; back #libelreform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pls RT Two ongoing libel cases involving health. The law should not crush scientific debate. Sign up at www.libelreform.org &amp;amp; back #libelreform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pls RT  London is notorious for attracting libel tourists who come to UK to silence critics. Sign up at www.libelreform.org &amp;amp; back #libelreform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PPs. Reasons why we need radical libel reform:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) English libel laws have been condemned by the UN Human Rights Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) These laws gag scientists, bloggers and journalists who want to discuss matters of genuine public interest (including public health!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) Our laws give rise to libel tourism, whereby the rich and the powerful (Saudi billionaires, Russian oligarchs and overseas corporations) come to London to sue writers because English libel laws are so hostile to responsible journalism. (Again, it is exactly because English libel laws have this global impact that we welcome signatories to the petition from around the world.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(d) Vested interests can use their resources to bully and intimidate those who seek to question them. The cost of a libel trial in England is 100 times more expensive than the European average and typically runs to over £1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(e) Two separate ongoing libel cases involve myself and Peter Wilmshurst, and we are both raising concerns about medical treatments. We face losing £1 million each. In future, why would anyone else raise similar concerns when our libel laws are so brutal and expensive? Our libel laws mean that serious health matters are not necessarily reported, which means that the public is put at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; PPPs. I know that I will leave people out of this list, but I owe a huge thanks to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10,000 people who joined the Facebook group “For Simon Singh and Free Speech - Against the BCA Libel Claim”, particularly those who joined when the rest of the world ignored the issue of libel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 300 people who packed Penderel’s Oak in May 2009 and who helped launch the Keep Libel Laws Out of Science campaign, particularly the speakers: Nick Cohen, Dave Gorman, Evan Harris MP, Professor Brian Cox, Chris French, Tracey Brown (Sense About Science), Robert Dougans (Bryan Cave) and David Allen Green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20,000 people who then joined the Keep Libel Laws Out of Science campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack of Kent and every other blogger who ranted and raved about libel reform when the mainstream media was turning a blind eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the mainstream media who is now covering the various libel cases and the issue of libel reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sense About Science, Index on Censorship and English PEN, who formed the Coalition for Libel Reform. And thanks to everyone who has contributed pro bono to the campaign in terms of design, technical support, chivvying support for the EDM and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 46,000 people (i.e. you) who have signed the petition for libel reform, particularly those who have cajoled others to sign up at www.libelreform.org/sign&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the big names who have spoken out in favour of libel reform, from Professor Richard Dawkins to Derren Brown, from the Astronomer Royal to the Poet Laureate, from the Amazing Randi to Ricky Gervais. Particular thanks go to Dara O Briain, Stephen Fry, Tim Minchin and Robin Ince, who have gone out of their way to step up to the plate when the campaign has needed them. Immense thanks also to the 100+ big names who were the first to sign the petition to keep libel out of science and highlighted the need for libel reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Everyone who has emailed and twittered and told me in person that I am not going crazy, and who reassured me that I am doing the right thing by defending my article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Nick Clegg, leader of the Lib Dems, for promising to put libel reform in his manifesto. And thanks in advance to Jack Straw (Justice Secretary) and Dominic Grieve (Shadow Justice Secretary), because I know that the Labour and Conservative parties are going to commit to libel law reform. I cannot believe that they will allow more scientists, serious journalists, bloggers, biographers, human rights activists and others to go through the same hell that I have had to endure for last two years.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefbrandon@gmail.com (James Randi)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270667173177"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13264">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ede7d62775130f51</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Guest Bloggers"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Stuff You'll Like"/><title type="html">Reader Rants: Science Needs Women – kevinf</title><published>2010-04-07T19:00:24Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T19:00:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/reader-rant-science-needs-women-kevinf/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ed3b633b3ae45bd985c3032e0ea349f0&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;You may remember Kevin Folta as the Great God who invented the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2008/11/skepchick-drink-contest-results-the-reckoning/"&gt;Buzzed Aldrin&lt;/a&gt;.

I got a bunch of great submissions this week, but I could only pick one. So I picked Kevin’s because it’s sweet and Skepchickal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science Needs Women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin M. Folta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In three weeks I will put on the cap-and-gown professor outfit I bought on Ebay and witness something that probably never should have happened – the graduation of a self-described dumb blonde.  Jessie came to my laboratory looking to make some extra cash as a dishwasher.  Little did she know that she would be remolded, repackaged and refocused by a cadre of women that identified a change that needed to happen, then took the initiative to make it so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my laboratory the ratio of X to Y chromosomes is traditionally skewed to about twelve to one.  The reason is not clear, but the majority of the technicians, postdocs, grad students and undergraduates in my program are female, and it has always been that way. One residue of the phenomenon has been that I get to observe the powerful influence that strong women have in shaping the career, and sometimes personal, choices of young women entering science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens every semester, but Jessie was the most stunning example.  She would take on simple tasks like dishwashing and lab maintenance with a certain care and precision not seen in most twenty year olds.  But when I asked her if she’d like to take on a laboratory project all she would say is, “I probably can’t do it, I’m not smart enough”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sentiment was echoed every time she was assigned a task.  She had self esteem that was so low it defied accurate analogy.  Yet every time I would show her a technique, computer program or protocol she would execute it flawlessly after a flurry of “I probably can’t do it” and “I’m not smart enough”.  I don’t know why she was so eternally self-deprecating, but it was sad to see her downplay, if not completely discount, her inherent talents and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women in my lab took special notice of this situation.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; At the time there was a technician and three graduate students, all balanced, opinionated and strong. Most of all they were complete, with good relationships overlaid with conspicuous hint of glamour. They were maybe four years older than Jess, making their influence especially strong. They dug one layer deeper into Jessie than I would want to; discovering her dysfunctional relationships with males, her horrendous daily decisions and the penetrance of her miserable self perception that negatively impacted many facets of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading by example, they showed her that women could drive science and lead a high-powered research team.  They cultured her talents, supported her good decisions and taught her flawless execution of advanced scientific tests. Their influence would escape the walls of the lab, as they’d reprimand her when she’d talk about the dopes she’d date and the poor decisions she’d make at home. Soon, the growth was visible and rapid. The self-described ugly duckling was changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year in my lab with Dawn, Stef, Denise and Thelma, Jessie left to pursue advanced training within her major.  She wrote up her work, turning in a graduate-level synopsis of the literature and her results.  She had a visible sense of confidence, a new maturity and poise that contrasted so starkly against that of the “dumb blonde” that started in my lab only a year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, years after she left my lab, I received a tiny card in my university mailbox buried amongst the junk mail.  Inside was an invitation to a graduation. From Jessie.  Adjacent to the time, date and event details was a handwritten note.  “Thank you for teaching me how to think critically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, maybe I had a hand in it, but the best thing I did was mentor four stellar women scientists that took the initiative to guide her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rare success of a grant funded, a scholarly paper accepted, or putting the hood on a new Ph.D. are all wonderful, memorable moments in the life of an academic scientist. However, this victory was especially sweet.  I folded that card inside-out, permanently wedged it into the frame of my office bulletin board, and then sent congratulatory emails to the four women that changed Jess’ thinking, influenced her decisions, and maybe even saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of providing a forum for their foulness, I'm shutting down comments on this post.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, I lost the link that inspired this. But I recently saw a post by a conservative about "reclaiming" the word racist. It went on to list a collection of reasons why he was a racist. The gist of it was that all of us dirty liberals were the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; racists - because there's no possible reason for us to support things like affirmative action, welfare, etc., unless we really, deep down, believe that minorities - particularly blacks - are stupid animals incapable of taking care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It's typical bullshit. So I'm responding in my own way. Because, you see, I am a racist. I'm not proud of that fact - but growing up in a deeply racist and sexist culture, you can't avoid absorbing racist and sexist messages and attitudes into your worldview. And the blogger who inspired this is, like me, a member of the privileged elite. The difference between us is that I at least &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to notice the effects of my privilege. I don't support social justice programs like affirmative action, welfare, and job training because I think that poor black people need help because they're less smart than me: I think that people like me have unfair advantages that we rarely appreciate, and that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; deserves the same advantages that I've been lucky enough to receive. But however idealistic I am, however commited I am to social justice, the fact remains: I am, to my shame, a racist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I am a racist - because I never noticed all of the unearned privileges that are given to me until someone pointed them out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; I am a racist - because even after learning about the unearned privileges
  that I recieve, I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don't notice them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; I am a racist, because I have grown up in a culture that, at every turn, teaches
  me that to be white is to be better, and smarter, and I have absorbed that lesson.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; I am a racist, because I instinctively react to members of minorities with fear.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; I am a racist, because I live in a sunset town.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; I am a racist, because I believe that I deserve the success I
have, even though I know people who are more smart, capable, and
talented than I am never had the chances that I did to
be successful, because of the color of their skin.&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt; I am a racist - because I am a white man who has directly benefited from 
  the unfair preferences that have been directed towards me all of my life.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; I am a racist - because every day, I benefit from the &lt;em&gt;denial&lt;/em&gt; of
  basic privileges to other people.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; I am a racist, because I do not notice the things that are denied to people
  who are different from me.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; I am a racist, because I do not notice the advantages that I have over
  others.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; I am a racist, because even when I do manage to notice what is denied
  to people of different races and backgrounds, I don't speak up.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The point of this isn't just to do a sort of "walk of shame". The
point is that I am an incredibly lucky person, who has benefited from
all sorts of things - from where I was born, to the color of my skin,
to the background of my parents, to my gender. I have recieved, and
continue to receive benefits because of those, and many other factors
that have &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; to do with my own merit. And except for
very rare occasions, that goes unremarked, unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; People like me think of ourselves as the default - as "normal"
people. We consider the incredible advantages that we receive to
be normal, unremarkable. We don't notice just how much we benefit
from that assumption of our own normality - the benefits we
receive fade into invisibility. We don't even notice that they exist. And
then when someone who &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; get those benefits 
has trouble, we naturally blame them for not being as successful as we
are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The underlying theme of people like the jerk who inspired this
post is: "I made it &lt;em&gt;by myself, without any help&lt;/em&gt;. So
&lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; should be able to make it by themselves, without any
help either."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But that's bullshit, because none of us "made it by ourselves". We're
the beneficiaries of the system we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I grew up in a wealthy town in NJ. We didn't consider ourselves
wealthy - but by comparison to lots of other people, we really were. 
I went to a very good school system. We complained about it a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;:
the textbooks were too old; the equipment in the science labs were too
beaten up; the classes were too easy, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; When I was in college, I got to teach a summer program for top
students from schools in Newark, Camden, and Jersey City. And I
discovered that my students went to schools where they didn't have to
worry about their books being too old - because they didn't
&lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; any books. I mean that literally: in their english
classes, they didn't have books, because their schools had
&lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been able to buy new books since it opened - and the
books had long since fallen apart. They didn't complain about the
lousy lab equipment - because their schools had &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; had
science labs at all. How could people coming from schools like that
&lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; hope to compete with students from a school like
mine? I didn't admitted to college over people from their schools because
I was &lt;em&gt;smarter&lt;/em&gt;. I got admitted into college over people from their
schools because I was &lt;em&gt;richer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;whiter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And when my students went to the campus bookstore to buy
basic supplies like paper and pencils, the people who worked there
followed them around the store - because what would a
bunch of poor black kids be doing in a bookstore if they weren't
there to rob it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I write this math blog for fun. How did I get the background to do
it? I come from a highly educated family. They taught me to read
before I even started preschool. I'd learned about statistics from my
father when I was in third grade. I learned about algebra in sixth
grade, even though my school didn't teach it until 8th or 9th. I
learned calculus in my freshman year in high school - even though my
school didn't teach it until a senior year AP class. I was learning this stuff
long before the school taught it to me; and my parents made sure that
they bought a house in a very expensive school district where there would
be things like AP classes. My parents paid for me to go to college - which gave
me the time to take courses not just because I needed them to graduate,
but because they covered things that I wanted to learn, just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; How could a person from a family that just managed to scrape by,
who lived in a school system that couldn't afford textbooks for the
basic classes, much less the AP classes, how could they compete with
me? It's damned close to impossible. Not because they're any less
smart, or any less talented. But because I've had an absolutely
uncountable number of advantages. Every day of my life, I've been
given benefits which helped make it possible for me to become who and
what I am. I'm here &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; because I've worked damned hard
to get here. But that work, by itself, wouldn't have gotten me to where I am,
without luck and privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; People like me need to remember that. We didn't earn what we have
all by ourselves. We &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have earned part of it - but only
part. An awful lot of what we have is built on privilege: on the advantages
that we've been given because of race, gender, wealth, and family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/04/i_am_a_racist.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/l5zXiGjiacg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270665498074"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=31323">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/246c155157f7f9c5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="nudges"/><category term="traffic"/><title type="html">A Hindu Traffic Nudge</title><published>2010-04-07T18:43:14Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T18:43:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/rFTyO-XVBOA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/hindu-traffic-nudges/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">What's the one thing that convinces Indian drivers to slow down?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/rFTyO-XVBOA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By FREAKONOMICS</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270664708316"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=4534">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8bc082903968c8e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media"/><category term="News"/><category term="NPR"/><title type="html">Is this a trick question?</title><published>2010-04-07T17:24:18Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T17:24:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CosmicVarianceBlog/~3/d2AwwsOLCaw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/04/07/is-this-a-trick-question/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/04/rush-vs-npr"&gt;Bits&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/04/npr-and-cable.php"&gt;blogosphere&lt;/a&gt; are taking note of a &lt;a href="http://www.themonkeycage.org/2010/04/where_is_the_npr_of_cable_news.html"&gt;recent post by John Sides&lt;/a&gt; noting the growth of NPR compared to other news sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sides comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something in their business model is working.  And I have a hard time imagining that NPR listeners won’t watch televised news programming as a matter of principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where is the NPR of cable news?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the reason seems dead obvious.  &lt;em&gt;Radio is the only delivery mechanism that you can absorb while doing something else.&lt;/em&gt;  Driving? Check.  Cooking? Check.  Reading email? Check.  Lingering in bed after the alarm goes off?  Check.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a “principle” against watching televised news.  I just don’t have time.  You could have Ira Glass and Carl Kassell doing the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustle_(dance)"&gt;Hustle&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by frolicking puppies and I still wouldn’t make the time to sit down and watch.&lt;/p&gt;

Vernon, OH, have been quiet.  Apparently R. Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s lawyer, has been going through the “new evidence” that supposedly turned up in &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/02/freshwater-the-1.html" rel=""&gt;a black bag in a parking lot&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to find something to exonerate Mr. Freshwater.  Rumor has it that the administrative hearing will resume late this month, though there’s no word yet on whether it will be closed so the mystery witness can testify in safety from the ravening evolutionist hordes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been some progress on another front, though.  More below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recall that in June 2008 the &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/doe-v-freshwater-mv" rel="external "&gt;Dennis family brought a federal suit&lt;/a&gt; against Freshwater and the school district.  &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/webfm_send/1076" rel="external "&gt;Freshwater filed a counter-claim&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) alleging that false and defamatory statements were made against him and that some statements made about him were slanderous.  It also alleged that the plaintiffs (the Dennis family) intentionally caused Freshwater emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/webfm_send/1252" rel="external "&gt;The district settled&lt;/a&gt; with the Dennis family, paying legal fees and a token amount for damages.  Freshwater remained a defendant in the Dennis’s suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal judge has now ruled on motions for summary judgments by both sides.  The Dennis family had moved to summarily dismiss Freshwater’s counter-claim, while Freshwater had moved to dismiss the original suit.  In essence, the judge has ruled that he will allow the Dennis family’s suit against Freshwater to proceed while dismissing Freshwater’s counter-claim that alleged defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  I hear that the trial on that suit is scheduled to begin in late May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting bit buried in the judgment is that Freshwater is classed as a “limited purpose public figure” with respect to this matter, and therefore cannot claim damages for public statements about him concerning it unless he can show actual malice on the part of the person making the statement.  Even though I have a standing offer of &lt;em&gt;pro bono&lt;/em&gt; representation by one of the most respected First Amendment litigators in the country should it become necessary, I was personally a little concerned about that question since I’ve written some pretty critical stuff about Freshwater’s behavior.  But that definition of Freshwater considerably raises the bar he must jump to allege defamation and/or slander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the legal documents except the most recent ruling are &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/doe-v-freshwater-mv" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I welcome any qualified legal commentary.  I presume the judge’s opinion briefly described here will go up there soon.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a BBC astronomy documentary hosted by my friend Brian Cox, and from what I have heard is an extraordinary event. I can’t wait to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks, though, have a different opinion. Brian, like me, is an outspoken skeptic, and will brook no nonsense. In one episode of the show, he said, &amp;quot;…astrology is a load of rubbish.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is, of course, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html"&gt;completely accurate&lt;/a&gt;. Astrology has no mechanism, no predictability, and no physical way of working. When tested even using its own standards it fails miserably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrology doesn’t work, and anyone telling you otherwise is selling something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as obviously, those people who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; selling something have taken umbrage at Brian’s impolitic uttering of truth. &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/equinox-astrology/bbcs-wonders-of-the-solar-system-astrology/384769273320" rel="nofollow"&gt;They have started a Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; where they can get together and reinforce their silliness, make fun of Brian, and grossly misrepresent science. My favorite bit is this, in the page description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His careless assertion was unresearched, unsubstantiated and unscientific. Has he done any empirical studies? Has he explored his birth chart? Can he cite any scientific studies disproving astrology that are not fundamentally flawed? Of course not. I have certainly never seen him at an astrology conference or read anything written by him about astrology. Cox is simply not qualified to speak on astrology and his comments amount to no more than prejudice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Brian, a PhD physicist with decades of training in the scientific method, research, analysis, logic, and critical thinking, who has written a book on relativity and works at CERN on the Large Hadron Collider, is not qualified to speak on astrology. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, astrologers: in the link above I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; cite scientific studies that are not flawed and show astrology to be nonsense, just as they trash flawed studies that support astrology. I have explored birth charts and found them to be nothing more than tarot cards/Ouija boards/tea leaves/cold reading tools. I have seen empirical studies, and they all show astrology = nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;prejudice&amp;quot;? No, it’s not prejudice. You just assume that because we disagree with you. But I’ve studied astrology, and I conclude that it’s garbage. That’s not prejudice. That’s &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ordinance requires that a "limited-service pregnancy center" post an easily readable sign, written in English and Spanish, stating that the center does not provide or make referrals for abortion or birth-control services. A center failing to comply within 10 days of being cited could be fined up to $150 a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s perfectly reasonable, even if the center is directly opposed to abortion — they could cheerfully put up a sign &lt;i&gt;bragging&lt;/i&gt; that they do not abort adorable little babies, and take some pride in their position. But no, that's not what they want to do. We've got a 'counseling center' here in Morris, for instance, that provides no real help at all. They've got little signs around that say something like, &lt;span&gt;"Pregnant? We can help!"&lt;/span&gt; with a phone number, and when some frightened teenaged girl calls, their sole purpose is to make sure she does not get an abortion. Stating their position up front and diminishing confusion is exactly what they don&amp;#39;t want — they want their clients confused and worried, susceptible to the lies they&amp;#39;ll tell them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps you will be as unsurprised as I am to learn that the &lt;a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bal-md.ci.pregnancy30mar30,0,4172720.story"&gt;Catholic Diocese of Baltimore is suing the city&lt;/a&gt;, claiming oppression because they are asked to be clear in the range of services they will offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thomas J. Schetelich, chairman of the board for the Center for Pregnancy Concerns, said that the ordinance singles out the Catholic Church for its anti-abortion stance. The nonprofit, anti-abortion organization receives donations from religious groups supporting women who plan to take their pregnancies to term and operates three of the four local centers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;"Frankly, we would expect our city government to be supporting our sacrificial efforts rather than trying to hinder,"&lt;/span&gt; Schetelich said. &lt;span&gt;"We're disappointed that our stand for life draws opposition."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note: they are talking about &lt;i&gt;four&lt;/i&gt; referral centers. They have hired a battery of lawyers to oppose the posting of &lt;i&gt;four&lt;/i&gt; signs that state exactly what they regard as a positive, noble, tenet of their faith, that they do not condone abortions. What's the gripe? If they think it's an unfair burden to have to pay for four signs, I suspect that if they asked Planned Parenthood or other such organizations, or even asked the community at large, people would chip in to send them a few hundred dollars or a few thousand dollars, even, to make their own damned signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is simply the Catholic Church suing for the right to keep people in the dark, as they have for so many centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have no grounds for complaint. As a NARAL director explains,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This law empowers women by giving them full information up front about what to expect from a limited-service pregnancy center," said Jennifer Blasdell, the organization's executive director. "This provision does not ask a facility to provide or counsel for any services they find objectionable, but only asks them to tell the truth about the nature of their services." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, our local example of anti-abortion ignorance is called the &lt;a href="http://morrispregnancycenter.com/"&gt;Morris Life Care Pregnancy Center&lt;/a&gt;, and it is somehow affiliated with the &lt;a href="http://www.mefc.net/"&gt;Morris Evangelical Free Church&lt;/a&gt;, our local festering canker of wingnut inanity. They don't seem to provide any material services at all, other than advice, AKA browbeating and misleading. I am amused to see that they are hosting a &lt;a href="http://morrispregnancycenter.com/Page_2.html"&gt;father-daughter chastity ball&lt;/a&gt; (although they don't call them that anymore), which is rather creepy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I do commend them on one thing. Right there at the bottom of their web page, they clearly and honestly state this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This center does not offer abortion services or abortion referrals. This information is intended for general educational purposes only and should not be relied upon as a substitute for professional medical advice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t complain too much about them, then — I disagree vehemently with their opinions, but as long as they&amp;#39;re not pretending to be offering real medical advice and don&amp;#39;t pretend to offer services that they&amp;#39;re actually going to be telling their clients to avoid, they have every right to express their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate to say this, but the Baltimore Diocese could learn something about honesty from a loony rural Protestant church that teaches that the world is only 6000 years old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/but_youd_think_theyd_be_proud.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/HtXpXKty4TI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270660639628"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=173637">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3b6ca46d9e116939</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="1000 cities - 1000 lives"/><category term="Health"/><category term="healthy cities"/><category term="WHO"/><category term="World Health Day"/><category term="World Health Organization"/><title type="html">Happy World Health Day: The World Health Organization</title><published>2010-04-07T15:04:57Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T15:04:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/173637/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy World Health Day:&lt;/strong&gt; The World Health Organization celebrates World Health Day with their “1000 cities – 1000 lives” campaign to make cities healthier.&lt;/p&gt;

That's why the question posed by Michael Reiss in &lt;i&gt;New Statesman&lt;/i&gt; is a valid one in that country, "&lt;a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/education/2010/04/science-evolution-creationism"&gt;Should creationism be taught in British classrooms?&lt;/a&gt;". The answer might surprise many people in other countries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why schools and universities should encourage debate on evolution -- and how this could benefit science.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;.... When teaching evolution, there is much to be said for allowing students to raise any doubts they have in order to shape and provoke a genuine discussion. The word "genuine" doesn't mean that creationism and intelligent design deserve equal time with evolution. They don't. However, in certain classes, depending on the teacher's comfort with talking about such issues, his or her ability to deal with them, and the make-up of the student body, it can and should be appropriate to address them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having said that, I don't pretend to think that this kind of teaching is easy. Some students become very heated; others remain silent even if they disagree profoundly with what is said. But I believe in taking seriously the concerns of students who do not accept the theory of evolution while still introducing them to it. Although it is unlikely that this will help them resolve any conflict they experience between science and their beliefs, good teaching can help students to manage it - and to learn more science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My hope is simply to enable students to understand the scientific perspective with respect to our origins, but not necessarily to accept it. We can help students to find their science lessons interesting and intellectually challenging without their being a threat. Effective teaching in this area can help students not only learn about the theory of evolution, but also better appreciate the way science is done, the procedures by which scientific knowledge accumulates, the limitations of science and the ways in which scientific knowledge differs from other forms of knowledge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I agree with this point of view. I think the main arguments for creationism, and against evolution, should be discussed in science class. It's an excellent way of showing what real science is and how it should be practiced. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem with ignoring the main criticisms of evolution is that students are going to hear about them from other sources and they won't know what to think about those points of view unless we teach them how to reason. The goal of science education is to teach students how to think, not just fill them with facts. It's our responsibility as teachers to teach critical thinking. One of the best ways to do that is to give them some popular examples to discuss and debate.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Hat Tip: &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5386"&gt;RichardDawkins.net&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-8669344427615914612?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270657504938"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=13653">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d35e4caa01b1ae36</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alt-Med"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Baja earthquake"/><category term="Deepak Chopra"/><title type="html">Deepak impact</title><published>2010-04-07T16:00:34Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T16:00:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/0o1Y5B5vwkA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/07/deepak-impact/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Deepak Chopra is a peddler of nonsense, woo, and alt-med garbage. I’m not a fan — &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/12/01/deepak-chopra-redefining-wrong/"&gt;duh&lt;/a&gt; — so I missed &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/DeepakChopra/status/11610151300"&gt;his tweet&lt;/a&gt; which is causing a minor stir on the intertoobz:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Had a powerful meditation just now – caused an earthquake in Southern California.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading his tweets is like trying to read a book whirling around in a blender, but it does appear that he thinks he caused &lt;a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2010/ci14607652/"&gt;the earthquake in Baja&lt;/a&gt; the other day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/DeepakChopra/status/11640595865"&gt;in a later tweet he said&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some people were upset at my remarks re earthquake. Sorry about that. I was actually meditating when it happenned [sic] and thougt [sic]” Whoaaa!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So either he was joking, and haha if he was, or he was serious. So if it’s the latter, y’know what I’d love to see? &lt;em&gt;A class action suit against him.&lt;/em&gt; That’s right, the people of Mexico and southern California should sue Chopra because he caused a major earthquake! If you win, he goes bankrupt and we’ll never hear his quantum enmangled word salad again. And if you lose, it’s because he’s a charlatan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see a downside here, frankly.&lt;/p&gt;

So we love to rag on them. Until they mention Michele Bachmann and then we have to hang our head in shame and slink away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the latest news from our neighbor to the east is that some cheesehead named Scott Southworth is trying to strongarm teachers into not following the sex education guidelines, &lt;a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/90020507.html"&gt;threatening them with jail time if they say anything about condoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forcing our schools to instruct children on how to utilize contraceptives encourages our children to engage in sexual behavior, whether as a victim or an offender. It is akin to teaching children about alcohol use, then instructing them on how to make mixed alcoholic drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, but mixed alcoholic drinks are legal, and lots of people consume them…and so will many of those kids, hopefully once they&amp;#39;re of legal age but not before (although we know many of them will jump the gun — and think of all the awful pina coladas and over-strong rum &amp;amp; cokes they&amp;#39;ll slosh down if not properly trained. Think of the children!) There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with urging responsible restraint in both alcohol consumption and sexual behavior, while also explaining what they actually, honestly are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, you're a conservative kook who thinks the solution to every peril is to keep everyone in a state of maximal ignorance. Case in point: when this bill to teach medically accurate information about contraceptives in sex ed classes was introduced, &lt;i&gt;every single Republican&lt;/i&gt; voted in lockstep against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more like telling kids who are too young to drive about using seatbelts. It's not telling them to get in an accident, it's telling them to take precautions in case something happens. And in the case of sex, we know a collision is pretty much inevitable at some point, so we &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be offering information and sensible safety in those years when they are at greatest risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/theyre_crazy_over_there_in_wis.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/QNHkuYFHi4o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270657198883"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/skeptical_2010.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e20c7295077ceeec</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">SkeptiCal 2010!</title><published>2010-04-07T16:00:18Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T16:00:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Tu-ki95sNGc/skeptical_2010.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/skeptical_2010.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Californians, if you're living anywhere near Berkeley, you might want to go to this: the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalcon.org/"&gt;Skeptical Conference&lt;/a&gt; on 24 April.

Women have heard this claim about rape over and over again: the victim was asking for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;His comments were that there are youngsters who want to be abused, and he compared that abuse to homosexuality, describing them both as prejudicial to society. He said that on occasions the abuse happened because the there are children who consent to it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"There are 13 year old adolescents who are under age and who are perfectly in agreement with, and what's more wanting it, and if you are careless they will even provoke you",&lt;/span&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, it is so hard to be a noble heterosexual man in this society, with every woman, every gay man, every child, every moist orifice, every knothole, every small animal burrow on the ground, every lemon meringue pie, every velvety wrinkle in the Pope's cassock, all just taunting and teasing and tantalizing you, begging you to stick your penis in them. And then when you finally give in and let them have what they want, despite all your insistence that you're doing it for their benefit, not yours, what do they do? They cry rape, or lock you up for child abuse, or the Vatican dry cleaning service sends you an extravagant bill.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s Paul Nelson Day, the anniversary of Nelson’s so far unfulfilled  promise to provide a detailed exposition of “ontogenetic depth.”  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/happy_monkey_paul_nelson_its_b.php" rel="external "&gt;PZ has the details on Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added in edit: &lt;a href="http://blog.jmlynch.org/2010/04/07/happy-paul-nelson-day/" rel="external "&gt;John Lynch also notes the anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, and points out that Nelson &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/04/a_puzzle_on_the_eve_of_paul_ne.html" rel="external "&gt;is aware of it&lt;/a&gt;.  Nelson also provides the toy model that he thinks shows that developmental biologists are incapable of accounting for cell differentiation.  Nelson’s misconception is encapsulated in this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to know the minimal instruction (or command) set, which must be present in the starting cell, for this to happen reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Beth Beck from &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/" title=""&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a political scientist with almost 25 years in the federal government. I work at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C. I have an undergraduate degree in Government from the University of Texas with concentration on language, specifically Spanish. My grad degree comes from the LBJ School of Public Affairs in Austin. I am a non-techie working in NASA techie-land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a communicator. An extrovert among introverts. I don't see the world as others do, but how boring would life be if we all agreed?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my federal career as a Fellow in the Terrorism Analysis office at the CIA. Terrorism was new to the U.S. at the time. 9/11 changed all that. I wrote my grad thesis on International Cooperation to Combat Terrorism, then I accepted a job at NASA. Go figure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. When I was assigned to the task force commissioned by President George H.W. Bush to look at options for returning to the Moon and Mars, I ended up at NASA Headquarters in Washington DC. My job: to craft a 30-year organizational structure to allow NASA creative flexibilities to manage an evolving Moon/Mars program. I still have the file from the early 90's.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Beth Beck pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Beth%20Beck%20pic.jpg" width="448" height="299" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We changed directions, so I accepted a permanent job at Headquarters in the Space Station office. During my time at Headquarters, I've moved a good deal - usually due to internal reorganizations. I worked with our international partners for five years. Another five in Public Affairs with a long stint as Editor of NASA.gov. I served as a LEGIS Fellow in the Senate for a year. Now I'm the Outreach Program Manager for the Office of Space Operations - five years so far.  Yes, I'm a rolling stone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my most memorable experience at NASA was the day we nearly sparked World War III. Short story: we partnered with the Norwegians on NASA's Sounding Rocket campaign. We launched our instruments on their Black Brandt XII rockets off the coast of Norway. The Russians thought they were incoming missiles. Lots of drama. And yes, fingers were poised on red retaliation buttons for one hair-raising second before calm prevailed. The Norwegians sent me a T-shirt with a picture of the rocket and the caption: "I almost caused WWIII!" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything I work on is interesting .(Ok, almost everything.) Not the paper and process - but the programs themselves. A few stand out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   1. The end of the Space Shuttle program in September.&lt;br&gt;
   2. Completion of Space Station assembly this year.&lt;br&gt;
   3. NASA and social media - specifically Launch/Mission Tweet-ups.&lt;br&gt;
   4. LAUNCH Water sustainability forum. &lt;a href="http://launch.org/" title=""&gt;http://launch.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coolest project EVER!!!!! LAUNCH.org is our wildly-successful sustainability incubator. I'm sure I have words to express how THRILLED we are at our first event a few weeks ago.  We've been sweating blood to make it happen for the last year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal: Accelerate Innovation for a Sustainable Future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'd been looking for ways to tell our &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html" title=""&gt;Space Station&lt;/a&gt; green story, and this concept fit the bill. We pulled together a team of creative folks, all bringing together different strengths, to birth the &lt;a href="http://www.launchorg.com/www/events/" title=""&gt;LAUNCH:Water incubator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted a &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/" title=""&gt;TED-style&lt;/a&gt; event but with teeth, where we can chomp into issues and mash-up new approaches and solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created &lt;a href="http://www.launchorg.com/www/" title=""&gt;LAUNCH.org&lt;/a&gt; as a global initiative to identify and support the innovative work that is poised to contribute to a sustainable future. We want this process to accelerate solutions to meet urgent challenges facing our society. That's the goal: to make a difference, leave this world better tomorrow than it is today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose &lt;a href="http://www.launchorg.com/www/events/" title=""&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; as a logical starting point because it's an issue we deal with on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" title=""&gt;Space Station&lt;/a&gt; every day in orbit. Not only is water a critical commodity for our orbiting pioneers, but for so many living on our home planet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the Innovator videos online, thanks to our partner Nike: &lt;a href="http://launch.org/forums/" title=""&gt;http://launch.org/forums/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media interests me. I love finding new ways to communicate. Keeping up with the changing landscape of technology and applications is a FULL-time job. I barely skim the surface, but what a fun time skimming cream off the top! &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I LOVE social media, though I spend most my time on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/bethbeck" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook and &lt;a href="http://bethbeck.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt;. I like the fact that I can follow blogs now by signing up through Twitter or Facebook.  I use Google Reader, but I have to take time to go read everything in my reader. I like the blogs to drop in my email so I don't have to do anything but read them. I'm lazy! I want info to come to me, rather than have to search it out. I haven't really caught on to Google Wave or Buzz. Twitter already meets that need. Wave takes time to be creative, and I haven't invested the time to use it creatively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NET POSITIVE!!! For NASA, we have a new community built around social media interaction. I have new friends I've met through Twitter/Facebook who've attended our Tweet-ups. Now we're friends in real life, in addition to digital life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media is expanding my universe! &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science blogs discovered me. &lt;a href="http://kejames.com/" title=""&gt;Karen James&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/kejames" title=""&gt;@kejames&lt;/a&gt;) and I met on Twitter through her space passion. She'd just recently connected with Space Station astronaut Mike Barratt, who participated in her &lt;a href="http://thebeagleproject.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Beagle Project&lt;/a&gt; with a downlink live from Station.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen invited me to join the panel on Science Online 2010 - which was an amazingly cool experience. I'm thrilled to be part of your community now. And, by the way, Karen is Mike's guest to his upcoming launch: STS-133, our final mission of the Space Shuttle program - if our current schedule holds. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I absolutely LOVED the session with the students. Changed the way I see technology applications - through their eyes. I'd love to have them rate OUR websites, social media activities next year. They can be our future leader consultants. We could submit projects to them, let them choose their favs, and tell us why. (I'd rather not do the best/worst list on stage. I'd hate to find NASA ones on the bottom.)   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might be fun to have them schedule one-on-one time with us to give us feedback. Good experience for them to provide consultation. Good experience for us to hear the naked truth -  no matter how painful.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love, love, love them! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_31.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/STbRmm3yTfc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270655058866"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=5058">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1952f438199085bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">A clarification</title><published>2010-04-07T12:00:45Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T12:00:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/Jii0TQz057I/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Left Brain/Right Brain</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270655058865"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=5052">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e40158bd82d0ec9e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Polly Tommey poses as advocate for autistic adults</title><published>2010-04-07T11:07:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T11:07:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/Gv97SDAYXYI/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Mike Stanton</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270654785588"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=3047">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c57dce58629c809</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="#atheistcon"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="atheist poster"/><category term="charity"/><category term="Ebay"/><category term="fundraiser"/><category term="Global Atheist Convention"/><category term="news"/><category term="Pharyngula"/><category term="PZ Myers"/><category term="Richard Dawkins"/><title type="html">I’m For Sale On eBay!</title><published>2010-04-07T14:50:38Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T14:50:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/oqPDphvWbho/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2010/04/im-for-sale-on-ebay/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/Signed-poster-from-2010-Global-Atheist-Convention_W0QQitemZ120553853223QQcmdZViewItemQQptZAU_PostersPhotographic?hash=item1c1191d127"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/roa-poster.png" alt="roa-poster" width="269" height="362"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Kind of!

According to this idea, animals sleep because otherwise we&amp;#39;d always be active, and constant activity is a waste of energy. Sleeping for a proportion of the time conserves calories, and also keeps us safe from nocturnal predators etc.Siegel&amp;#39;s theory in what we might call minimalist. That&amp;#39;s in contrast to other hypotheses which claim that sleep serves some kind of vital restorative biological function, or that it&amp;#39;s important for memory formation, or whatever. It&amp;#39;s a hotly debated topic.But Siegel wasn&amp;#39;t the first sleep minimalist. J. Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley created a storm in 1977 with The Brain As A Dream State Generator; I read somewhere that it provoked more letters to the Editor in the American Journal of Psychiatry than any other paper in that journal.Hobson and McCarley&amp;#39;s article was so controversial because they argued that dreams are essentially side-effects of brain activation. This was a direct attack on the Freudian view that we dream as a result of our subconscious desires, and that dreams have hidden meanings. Freudian psychoanalysis was incredibly influential in American  psychiatry in the 1970s.Freud  believed that dreams exist to fulfil our fantasies, often though not always sexual ones. We dream about what we&amp;#39;d like to do - except we  don&amp;#39;t dream about it directly, because we find much of our desires shameful, so  our minds disguise the wishes behind layers of metaphor etc.  &amp;quot;Steep inclines, ladders and stairs,  and going up or down them, are symbolic representations of the sexual  act...&amp;quot; Interpreting the symbolism of dreams can therefore shed light on the depths of the mind.Hobson and McCarley argued that during REM sleep, our brains are active in a similar way to when we are awake; many of the systems responsible for alertness are switched on, unlike during deep, dreamless, non-REM sleep. But of course during REM there is no sensory input (our eyes are closed), and also, we are paralysed: an inhibitory pathway blocks the spinal cord, preventing us from moving, except for our eyes - hence why it&amp;#39;s Rapid Eye Movement sleep.Dreams are simply a result of the &amp;quot;awake-like&amp;quot; forebrain - the &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot; perceptual, cognitive and emotional areas - trying to make sense of the input that it&amp;#39;s receiving as a result of waves of activation arising from the brainstem. A dream is the forebrain&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;best guess&amp;quot; at making a meaningful story out of the assortment of sensations (mostly visual) and concepts activated by these periodic waves. There&amp;#39;s no attempt to disguise the shameful parts; the bizarreness of dreams simply reflects the fact that the input is pretty much random.Hobson and McCarley proposed a complex physiological model in which the activation is driven by the giant cells of the pontine tegmentum. These cells fire in bursts according to a genetically hard-wired rhythm of excitation and inhibition.The details of this model are rather less important than the fact that it reduces dreaming to a neurological side effect. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the REM state has no function; maybe it does, but whatever it is, the subjective experience of dreams serves no purpose.A lot has changed since 1977, but Hobson seems to have stuck by the basic tenets of this theory. A good recent review came out in Nature Neuroscience last year, REM sleep and dreaming. In this paper Hobson proposes that the function of REM sleep is to act as a kind of training system for the developing brain.The internally-generated signals that arise from the brainstem (now called PGO waves) during REM help the forebrain to learn how to process information. This explains why we spend more time in REM early in life; newborns have much more REM than adults; in the womb, we are in REM almost all the time. However, these are not dreams per se because children don&amp;#39;t start reporting experiencing dreams until about the age of 5.Protoconscious REM sleep could therefore provide a virtual world model, complete with an emergent imaginary agent (the protoself) that moves (via fixed action patterns) through a fictive space (the internally engendered environment) and experiences strong emotion as it does so.This is a fascinating hypothesis, although very difficult to test, and it begs the question of how useful &amp;quot;training&amp;quot; based on random, meaningless input is.While Hobson&amp;#39;s theory is minimalist in that it reduces dreams, at any rate in adulthood, to the status of a by-product, it doesn&amp;#39;t leave them uninteresting. Freudian dream re-interpretation is probably ruled out (&amp;quot;That train represents your penis and that cat was your mother&amp;quot;, etc.), but if dreams are our brains processing random noise, then they still provide an insight into how our brains process information. Dreams are our brains working away on their own, with the real world temporarily removed.Of course most dreams are not going to give up life-changing insights. A few months back I had a dream which was essentially a scene-for-scene replay of the horror movie Cloverfield. It was a good dream, scarier than the movie itself, because I didn&amp;#39;t know it was a movie. But I think all it tells me is that I was paying attention when I watched Cloverfield.On the other hand, I have had several dreams that have made me realize important things about myself and my situation at the time. By paying attention to your dreams, you can work out how you  really think, and feel, about things, what your preconceptions and  preoccupations are.

So  I've been doing my reading, and I came across this article by Kintisch's rival Jeff Goodell, who also has a geoengineering book coming out, entitled How to Cool the Planet. (So far Goodell's seems to be selling a bit better, but I like Kintisch's title!)

I'm certainly not surprised, but I had not yet seen the relevant data showing that when it comes to this subject, the public is basically a blank slate. Goodell provides said data in his piece:
Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change, who presented the results of a long-running study on the public perception of global warming. In his most recent survey, he had thrown in a few questions about geoengineering. When asked, “How much, if anything, have you heard about geoengineering as a possible response to climate change,” 74 percent of respondents said “nothing.” The 26 percent that had heard about geoengineering turned out to be wildly misinformed — more than half thought it referred to geothermal energy.

&lt;p&gt;The song was written by &lt;strong&gt;Helen Kagin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Edwin Kagin&lt;/strong&gt; and performed at last weekend’s American Atheists convention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case you want &lt;a href="http://www.gofigger.org/leaves/feb08w.pdf"&gt;the lyrics&lt;/a&gt; (PDF):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They’re back in their burkas again&lt;br&gt;
Women obeying their men&lt;br&gt;
No other man should ever see&lt;br&gt;
Her eyebrow or her knee&lt;br&gt;
They’re back in their burkas again &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are wrapped up by men&lt;br&gt;
Protecting their bodies from sin&lt;br&gt;
Women must comply&lt;br&gt;
And not tempt some lustful eye&lt;br&gt;
So they’re back in their burkas again &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wrap must be shared with a friend&lt;br&gt;
With sister and cousin and kin&lt;br&gt;
It costs far too much&lt;br&gt;
With accessories and such&lt;br&gt;
But they’re back in their burkas again &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman can’t leave her pen&lt;br&gt;
While the burka is still out on lend&lt;br&gt;
So in her house she’s trapped&lt;br&gt;
‘Till in that horror she is wrapped&lt;br&gt;
‘Till she’s back in her burka again &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burka’s a smothering affair&lt;br&gt;
No garment can even compare&lt;br&gt;
It gets so hot in there&lt;br&gt;
She can barely breathe the air&lt;br&gt;
They’re back in their burkas again &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covered head and eyes and nose&lt;br&gt;
Down their thighs right to their toes&lt;br&gt;
They’re back in their burkas again &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes under there&lt;br&gt;
They wear sexy underwear&lt;br&gt;
They’re back in their burkas again &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody will finally win&lt;br&gt;
When women aren’t wrapped end to end&lt;br&gt;
Law is a disgrace&lt;br&gt;
When it hides a pretty face&lt;br&gt;
And puts women in burkas again &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom can only begin&lt;br&gt;
When women can show off some skin&lt;br&gt;
That law will have to go&lt;br&gt;
When all women just say “No”&lt;br&gt;
“We’ll not wear those burkas again” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on some happy day&lt;br&gt;
They will put those laws away&lt;br&gt;
And never wear burkas again&lt;br&gt;
And on that glorious day&lt;br&gt;
They will throw those rags away&lt;br&gt;
And never wear burkas again
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nelson, some of you may recall, is a creationist who made up this wacky claim of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/ontogenetic_depth.php"&gt;"Ontogenetic Depth"&lt;/a&gt;, saying he had a way of objectively measuring the complexity of the developmental process in organisms with a number that described the distance from egg to adult. Unfortunately, he forgot to tell us how one calculated this number, or how it actually accounted for the complexity of a network, or even how we'd get a number that was different for a sponge and a cat. But he did say he'd get back to us with the details &lt;i&gt;tomorrow&lt;/i&gt;…six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll keep waiting. We'll also keep making accurate predictions. Last year I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/its_been_five_years_paul_nelso.php"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that we'd still be waiting in 2010, and look! We are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve put on a turban, closed my eyes, and am waving my hands over a crystal ball, and predict…we&amp;#39;ll still be waiting in 2011.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/simon-singh-wins-appeal-bca-releases-statement/"&gt;Rebecca has the lowdown at Skepchick&lt;/a&gt; (some NSFW, but totally funny, language there), as does &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1804"&gt;Steve at Neurologia&lt;/a&gt;. While this doesn’t mean Simon has won the case, it does mean he can continue his arguments, when before he had been stopped cold by a judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCA is looking ever-more ridiculous, mean, and venal in this case.

Now we can hope that the BCA will be handed their heads in this case… and if we really grab the brass ring, the UK’s awful libel laws will get reformed, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re on the verge of a huge, huge win here. It hasn’t happened yet, and there is much to do. But the light is there, on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

Today I saw it.  And I’m going to show you where.  We’ll be looking at the MitoCheck database.  Below I’ll offer some discussion of the associated research papers, and in the movie I’ll show you how to navigate around the MitoCheck site a bit to find their data online.

It was actually coverage on the BBC* that tipped me off to this resource.  And then I went looking for more.  A press release on the work provided details and links.  And then the Nature News article added additional information.

In short, this group of researchers used a couple of different genomics approaches to examine what happens to HeLa cells when you mess with the mitotic apparatus and processes.  They transform cells with either RNA interference constructs, or GFP-tagged proteins, and film what happens to the cells over time.  They analyze the movies, and make all this data available in the MitoCheck resource.  As we say here in Boston–this is wicked cool.

But now, on to the papers:  these researchers have 2 articles out that talk about the work, one focused more on the RNAi approach, and a separate one on the tagged proteins.  I’ll address them separately below.

RNA interference experiments:

In this series of experiments, the MitoCheck team started with over 20,000 protein coding genes in humans, transformed HeLa cells with the siRNAs, and let the cells divide over a couple of days.  The nuclei of the cells could be illuminated by a GFP-histone protein that they had already placed in the cells.  They could light up the cells and film them, and monitor whether cell division looked normal or not.  They were able to identify a number of cases where things were going awry.  And they were going wrong in various ways.  Sometimes there was cell death.  Other times they could see a variety of phenotypes such as delayed mitosis, binuclear, poly-lobed, or “grape” looking aberrations.   Some cells were too large.  These could all be categorized, and compared, quantified, and are now stored as movies, processed data, and phenotypic assignment in the MitoCheck database.

I have some minor concerns about how knocked-down the transcripts are–they say that the values of the target mRNAs drop a lot, but these numbers vary quite a bit (the amount of supplemental data with the paper is excruciating….).  It’s also hard to be sure what that means for the protein levels at this point.  Also, HeLa cells have some characteristics that may not be average.  But that said–as a general method and a hunting license to find genes to assess in more detail, I think this is a very excellent strategy.  If I was still in the lab, I’d try the same thing with the cell system I used to study: C2C12 cells for muscle development.  You could track whether cell fusion and myotube formation was disrupted….man, sometimes I do crave the lab still….

Tagged protein experiments:

In a second paper from the research teams, they use a similar strategy of monitoring the behavior of cells during mitosis via movies.  But this time instead of knocking down a gene, they put a GFP tag on some selected proteins (mostly mouse proteins) that they put into the HeLa cells. These are stably-transfected tagged proteins on BACs, and they call this BAC TransgeneOmics (ahem, another -omics?).  They look for where these proteins end up in dividing cells.  Again, they have movies of this available now in their database. They also pull down protein complexes and look at them in more detail with other techniques.

Again, I have minor questions about the approach: mouse proteins in HeLa cells, and the bulky GFP tag affecting interactions, expression levels, etc.  But again, as a hunting-license sort of effort, I think this is a very neat way to move downstream from digital genomics to real cells.  And it’s worth it.  The team demonstrates that you can begin to characterize the functions of unknown proteins with this strategy.

So, for this week’s tip of the week I show you MitoCheck.  I’ll show how to access this data so you can take it further if you like.  One technical note: I did have all of the issues that they talked about in their “troubleshooting” document (PDF) on my Windows machine.  I had to do all 4 of the things they recommend in there to get the movies to run. FYI.

This isn't some sort of fuzzy critter, though; instead, these are tiny (less than 1 mm in length) animals that were found on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea. Significantly, these animals lack mitochondria, the sub-cellular organelles where oxygen is employed to produce ATP in aerobic (oxygen-dependent) life.

&lt;/a&gt;Massaging your baby will help her relax, reduce crying, and strengthen your bond together. These days, baby massage is becoming more and more popular – you can even find classes on it at community colleges, children’s hospitals, parenting centers, and from &lt;a href="http://www.infantmassageusa.org/"&gt;one-on-one instructors&lt;/a&gt;. It’s beneficial for newborn infants, babies, and even older children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to relaxation and bonding benefits, massage improves circulation, enhances neurological and physiological development, reduces pain from teething, helps increase oxygen flow, teaches babies to self-soothe, and increases sensory awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video below highlights some basic baby massage techniques; it’s best to practice massage when your baby is calm, and at least a half-hour after eating. Right after bathtime is perfect – baby is undressed and ready to chill out.&lt;/p&gt;

Damn it. Damn it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish &lt;em&gt;that woman&lt;/em&gt; would go back to focusing on things like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/04/an_open_letter_10.php"&gt;not shaving her legs &lt;/a&gt;rather than making me think about what a tremendous tool of the patriarchy I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a feminist here on ScienceBlogs, and really anywhere on the internet, is really a tough job.  As soon as you write a post that says anything along the lines of, &amp;quot;This is happening to me and it makes me feel bad&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;This is happening to me and it is inappropriate&amp;quot;, a sea of penis-carrying asshats descends upon the post, spraying hot, sticky fuckwittidude all over the joint and quashing much of the discussion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like these d00ds have been issued talking points.  You&amp;#39;re bound to hear something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With that in mind when I first read the post it struck me as an overreaction to something minor, but it's hard to argue with a few dozen women from all over with the exact same stories and reactions.(&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2010/04/smile_boys_it_would_make_the_w.php#comment-2407848"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But please, when you bullshit a bullshitter, expect to be called on it. But it is your blog, and I do understand you are trying to get more readers.  I wonder, though, with so many gender equity issues still unaddressed, if this kind of triviality just diminishes the impact of the whole. (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2010/04/smile_boys_it_would_make_the_w.php#comment-2406060"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also love the attempt at steering the comments towards less interesting subjects ("what might be done about it"? are you serious) and away from the more obvious points ("you are a deluded man-hating wackjob").(&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2010/04/smile_boys_it_would_make_the_w.php#comment-2406378"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;You&amp;#39;ve got to be constantly concerned that asking them to think outside of their sphere of experience will make some d00d&amp;#39;s head explode, or be worried about hurting some poor d00ds feelings.  Or at least make sure that you&amp;#39;re wearing a smock.  Still, Zuska had mad chops yesterday.  Mad chops.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/head%20explode.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="DISPLAY:block;MARGIN:0pt auto 20px;TEXT-ALIGN:center" height="243" alt="head explode.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/04/head%20explode-thumb-350x243-44239.jpg" width="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ludditemachine.org/blog/uploaded_images/head_explode-779507.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;:  BLAMMOOOO!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, God forbid, you ask anyone to ponder both being a woman and not being white.  then, you&amp;#39;re surely done for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, Zuska wrote a great blog post in response to a blog post I had written to answer a graduate student&amp;#39;s email.  Here&amp;#39;s the thing about answering your emails.  You know that I am fairly sensitive to the issue of pseudonymity and the blogosphere, so I don&amp;#39;t frequently take great notice of the name attached to the emails I receive.  I mainly read the letter and use the name that you sign it with. When I answered &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/ask_dr_isis_-_show_me_that_smi.php"&gt;Frowny McSternface's email&lt;/a&gt;, I didn&amp;#39;t put a lot of thought into associating a gender with the letter writer.  I don&amp;#39;t want to reveal now whether this writer was male or female, because they&amp;#39;ve asked me to keep them anonymous.  But, maybe I should have thought more about how gender played in to this issue in a more general sense, because Zuska picked up on the issue of telling women specifically to smile and knocked it out of the park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/knocked%20out%20of%20park.png"&gt;&lt;img style="DISPLAY:block;MARGIN:0pt auto 20px;TEXT-ALIGN:center" height="348" alt="knocked out of park.png" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/04/knocked%20out%20of%20park-thumb-350x348-44242.png" width="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hl.absolutegamenetwork.com/Achievements/TF2/Scout/out_of_the_park.png"&gt;Figure 2: &lt;/a&gt;BLAMMOOOO!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;So here's the take-home lesson, ladeez. Smile and dress nice and act like a lady - and you will be considered to be a silly, thoughtless, insignificant girl. Don't smile and dress for comfort and you will be considered to be a ball-busting, man-hating lesbian bull-dyke - or, possibly, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2007/09/scholarships_for_special_peopl.php#comment-585725"&gt;Ozzy Ozbourne&lt;/a&gt;. You will be called a trope, or a caricature feminist, or a reverse sexist, or a slut, or frigid. You will be said to have fucked too much, or in need of a good fucking, or your problem will lie in the fact that no one wants to fuck you, in which case you need a good fucking but are unlikely to get one. But no matter who you are, and what is wrong with you - because, mark my words, something is ALWAYS wrong with you - there will always be some damn asshat around the corner just waiting to cheerfully insist that you smile, smile, smile!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damn it, Zuska.  Damn it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Isis has been dealing with issues related to her image and gender lately, and Zuska really got her thinking,  Many months ago I began having trouble with someone at MRU.  I was frustrated and was talking about the issue with a man on campus who has been a generally great mentor, and he told me that if I were &amp;quot;more nurturing,&amp;quot; I wouldn&amp;#39;t have the problems I&amp;#39;ve been having.  His statement really affected me and made me question my entire personality.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a bit ago, we had something in our program fall through the cracks.  Something that ultimately would impact me, and I sent an email that said &amp;quot;[This thing] needs to be done.  If you can&amp;#39;t [do this thing], you need to let me know in advance because there is nothing I can do when I learn about it at the last minute.&amp;quot;  Now, I suppose I could have gone to this person, smiled, and said, &amp;quot;Oh, its ok.  But, in the future would you mind...&amp;quot;  It&amp;#39;s not ok.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I've learned that such a direct statement from me is interpreted as an attack and as hostile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m at a point where I have no idea what to do. I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll figure it out.   Here&amp;#39;s the thing that&amp;#39;s pissing me off, though.  Trust me, I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about this. There are completely different expectations for how I am expected to behave compared to how my male colleagues are expected to behave.  There is a scientist in my field, a really famous guy, who is very direct.   I&amp;#39;ve heard people remark, &amp;quot;You know you&amp;#39;ve been well-trained and are ready to go out on your own when you can&amp;#39;t stand him and you&amp;#39;re always arguing with him.&amp;quot; Or &amp;quot;[Chuckle, chuckle] Yeah, that guy is a huge pain in the ass.&amp;quot;   In him, it&amp;#39;s regarded as a lovable, admirable quirk. In me, however, this is a fault and a sign that I am not &amp;quot;nurturing.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week I&amp;#39;ve had enough of second guessing my personality.  I just need people to do the things that I ask of them, and I don&amp;#39;t want to have to worry about giving them a glass of warm milk or making sure they have their teddy bear in order to get them to do it.  I am somebody&amp;#39;s wife and I am somebody&amp;#39;s mother, but I get frustrated that people seem to expect a particular personality from me at work.  I don&amp;#39;t think I had really incorporated the true source of my frustration until I had read Zuska&amp;#39;s post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damn it, Zuska.  Damn it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/i_may_have_breasts_but_i_am_no.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/TEXTfvNwuqc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270648948761"><id gr:original-id="http://scepticsbook.com/?p=3499">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/85bd43494a965bd6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="announcements"/><category term="bad journalism"/><category term="7:30 Report"/><category term="A2 milk"/><category term="ABC"/><category term="seven thirty report"/><title type="html">Credulous reporting on regular milk and disease on the 7:30 Report</title><published>2010-04-07T13:04:21Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T13:04:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/04/07/credulous-reporting-on-regular-milk-and-disease-on-the-730-report-x-3/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scepticsbook.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight the usually high standards of journalism displayed by the ABCs 7:30 report failed dismally when they aired a story about regular cows milk causing all manner of diseases from schizophrenia, heart disease, diabetes to impaired neurological development and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a purely appalling piece, (watch it &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) containing red flags for pseudoscience at every turn. Run as the lead story (making it appear to be important) it was peppered with testimonials, anecdotes and some very dodgy looking science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I must have stood on the remote and switched over to A Current Affair or Today Tonight when they showed footage of a woman saying switching from regular milk cured her hives and deep tissue swelling in only four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the story of the farmer’s daughter who was cured from diarrhea and vomiting overnight (or somesuch) after switching to magic milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, scant evidence for regular milk causing these conditions was presented, or maybe I blinked and missed it. Instead there were statements about countries where more regular milk is consumed displaying higher levels of obesity and other diseases, but correlation does not equal causation. &lt;a href="http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/policy-law/projects/a1-a2-milk/lay-summary.htm"&gt;And these studies need to be interpreted with caution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They had someone who had a kid with eczema and the eczema had gone away, someone who didn’t get migraines anymore, someone who didn’t get stomach upsets anymore – those types of issues. All the stories can’t be wrong. I just believe there’s got to be something in it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is this magic milk of which they speak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cows give one of three types of milk. There’s milk with A1 casein (a type of protein), milk with A2 and some cows give milk with a combination of both. A theory, which apparently started in New Zealand in 2000, is that A2 milk is much better for your health than A1 milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of protein a cow produces depends on genetics, so A2 cows must be bred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is even more interesting when I was researching this story I found out this is not the first time the A2 milk story has been covered by the ABC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the theory was first proposed in the year 2000 in New Zealand, the ABC covered it on &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/transcripts/s820943.htm"&gt;Four Corners in 2003&lt;/a&gt; and then on &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1702999.htm"&gt;Landline in 2006.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transcripts are available on-line and appear to be quite similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at this for an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Corners, First Published 31/03/2003. Reporter Ticky Fullerton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a possible mechanism for how A1 milk might cause disease was now proposed. Protein molecules of A1 and A2 milk are both chains of amino acids. But in the A1 molecule, one amino acid is different, a weak link. A2 researchers believe this causes the chain to break, creating a small piece called Beta Casomorphin 7. And this piece is able move through the gut wall, into the blood, triggering disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:30 Report, 07/04/2010 (attributed to Four Corners 2003)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They claim that trigger is found in a weak link in A1 milks chain of amino acids causing the chain to break and creating a small piece called BCM7. They say that piece moves through the gut wall into the blood stream causing disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But being that today’s date is 07/04/2010, it seems this story might be on a cycle of every 3 – 4 years. Slow news day 7:30 Report?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more similarities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Corners, First Published 31/03/2003. Reporter Ticky Fullerton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk has long been blamed for health problems – heart disease, diabetes and even autism. But in the new hypothesis, it’s not fats or sugar but protein, something you can’t even taste, under the microscope. A2 milk’s backers claim A1 triggers these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh Aunty, really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they even spoke to many of the same people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landline First Published: 06/08/2006. Reporter Pip Courtney:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in 2004, the New Zealand Food Safety Authority asked &lt;strong&gt;Professor Boyd Swinburn from Deakin University&lt;/strong&gt; to evaluate the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Corners, First Published 31/03/2003. Reporter Ticky Fullerton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR BOYD SWINBURN&lt;/strong&gt;, SCHOOL OF HEALTH SCIENCES, &lt;strong&gt;DEAKIN UNIVERISTY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After re-watching tonight’s story on-line, I’m not sure what prompted them to run it again. You might guess some  significant new scientific breakthroughs, or advances in the understanding of how regular milk might cause such diseases. But sadly no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only saw one piece of new science in this version of the story, a paper from Russian researchers claiming developmental delays in babies fed A1 formula, which correlated with high levels of circulating BCM7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Professor Peter Clifton had this to say;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve certainly read that paper and I don’t think it’s groundbreaking and significant. In fact, if I had been editing that journal I wouldn’t have  accepted that paper for many many reasons, essentially I don’t think they’ve actually measured what they claim to measure”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landline First Published: 06/08/2006. Reporter Pip Courtney:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the Queensland Health Department fined A2 milk marketers $15,000 for making false and misleading claims about the health benefits  of A2 milk. Dairy Australia says the company broke the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:30 Report, 07/04/2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s wary about the way it promotes the product. Mindful that back in 2004 another A2 milk marketer was convicted of making false and misleading health claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Corners, First Published 31/03/2003. Reporter Ticky Fullerton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;TICKY FULLERTON: Just how plausible do you think it is that one factor, a  protein in A1 milk, could contribute to diabetes, heart disease, autism  and schizophrenia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:30 Report, 07/04/2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporter Lisa Whitehead: Why don’t you go as far as claiming that A1 milk can cause heart disease, juvenile diabetes, even autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was a piece of unsubstantiated scaremongering from an A2 supporter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve really left that topic to the scientists to talk about, there are many eminent scientists who would support that. Ummm, we would certainly say that yes, there’s some evidence, we don’t certainly talk avidly about that evidence but we believe yes consumers should make up their own minds about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A2 milk is big business and much money can be made if either side can convince consumers that their milk is healthy and the other causes autism. I know, I’ve seen the reports detailing the ins-and-outs three times now (go read the transcripts if you want to know more). But this debate is really about the politics, and the money, not the science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done to the 7:30 Report for contributing to the scaremongering by A2 producers and potentially lining their pockets, for the third time, along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a disgrace ABC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: What is a sellable idea? How do you develop one? Is your idea enough for a book, is there more you can do to develop it, or should it just be a magazine article or series of blog posts? This will be a hands-on nuts and bolts workshop: Come with ideas to pitch. Better yet, bring a &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; (1 page or less) written proposal to read and workshop. This workshop will provide handouts on proposal writing as well as sample proposals you can use to help develop your own in the future. Useful for anyone hoping to someday write for print or online publications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_writing_fo_4.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/bCblvtkdbZ4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270647068962"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2238">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2692685150303fba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">This digitized life</title><published>2010-04-07T13:05:25Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T13:05:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2238" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's Zits:&lt;/p&gt;

As part of an ongoing celebratory series, I&amp;#39;ve asked Dr Gavin Nobes of the University of East Anglia to look back on his research on children&amp;#39;s naive models of the earth that I covered in March 2005, to reflect on that study and the field more generally. Here&amp;#39;s what he had to say:&amp;quot;Almost 15 years ago the late George Butterworth visited UEL and inspired a group of us to follow up some work he and Michael Siegal had started in Australia. Using a novel, forced-choice question task, they were testing the claim, based on children&amp;#39;s drawings, that children have theory-like ‘naive mental models’ of the Earth; that is, children believe it to be (for example) flat, or a hollow sphere in which we live. This area of research has important implications for our understanding of the acquisition of knowledge, and for science education. For example, if children are influenced primarily by their intuitions and observations (as proponents of the naive mental model approach claim), they would be expected to think the Earth is flat; but if cultural communication is the principal source of information, children’s first concept of the Earth should be a rudimentary version of the scientific, spherical model.In the study featured in the Digest five years ago, Georgia Panagiotaki, Alan Martin and I asked children not to draw but to choose, from a set of pictures, those that they thought best represented the Earth. As in the Australian study, we found that children knew much more about the Earth than previous researchers had claimed, and found no evidence of naive mental models.Despite this apparently strong evidence from two different methods, the debate continued. Our recognition (forced-choice questions and picture selection) methods were criticised on the grounds that, unlike the earlier studies based on children&amp;#39;s drawings, they failed properly to elicit children’s understanding. We responded to these criticisms by giving the same open-ended, drawing-based questions (used in the earlier studies) to university students. We were amazed to find that many of them drew exactly the same pictures, and gave identical non-scientific answers, as had children who were supposed to have naive mental models. Subsequent interviews revealed that the students had drawn and answered in these ways because they didn’t understand the questions – despite them being designed for 5-year-olds! Further experiments with a new version of the task, in which we rephrased the original open questions to reduce their ambiguity, led both adults and children to give substantially fewer non-scientific answers. We concluded that naive mental models are methodological artifacts: children and adults give these responses to the original instrument because the questions are poorly worded.One recommendation that arises from this work is that, wherever possible, different methods should be used to test the same hypotheses. Another is that, however simple your children’s task might be, try it out first on adults: this is quick, easy, and can be remarkably revealing. And third, don’t be too dispirited by negative reviews: especially early on, editors sent our submissions to proponents of the naive mental model view, whose disparaging reviews resulted in rejections. Had it not been for Michael’s and George’s generous support and encouragement, we would probably have given up and turned to less controversial areas of research.&amp;quot; _______________________________Nobes, G., Martin, A., &amp;amp; Panagiotaki, G.

Beware. Your law has become quack-friendly to the point where doctors can do almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, you may reasonably wonder, am I saying this? The answer is what appears to be the end of a long and painful story of cancer quackery and anti-vaccine celebrity that has tainted North Carolina for years now. Do you remember Dr. Rashid Buttar? Regular readers know who he is, as he's been a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=rashid+buttar+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;recurring character&lt;/a&gt; on this blog &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/06/on-uselessness-of-chelation-therapy.html"&gt;since the very beginning&lt;/a&gt;. Most recently, he &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/desiree_jennings_cured.php"&gt;figured prominently&lt;/a&gt; in the case of Desiree Jennings, the young woman who claimed that the flu vaccine caused a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/dystonia_from_a_flu_vaccine.php"&gt;case of dystonia&lt;/a&gt; but was almost certainly suffering from a psychogenic disorder. Unfortunately for Ms. Jennings, she decided to seek out Buttar for "treatment" of her "vaccine injury. He subjected her to all manner of his usual woo, and--miracle of miracles!--she was miraculously cured!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this case, though, Dr. Buttar had been under investigation by the North Carolina State Medical Board for a variety of misconduct involving "unconventional treatments" to which he subjects autistic children and cancer patients, all for lots of money to line his pockets. At the time, over two years ago, Dr. Buttar lashed out at the medical board, characterizing it as a "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/12/dr_rashid_buttar_the_medical_board_is_a.php"&gt;rabid dog&lt;/a&gt;." Ultimately, the medical board recommended restricting Dr. Buttar's license to prohibit him from treating children or patients with cancer. Personally, I thought this was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/thoughts_on_dr_rashid_buttar_and_the_fai.php"&gt;too mild a sanction&lt;/a&gt; and thought Buttar should have been "struck off" (lose his medical license in British lingo--you know, just like Andrew Wakefield is--hopefully--about to be struck off), but it was a start. Still, how does one justify letting a physician keep his license after he charged dying cancer patients tens, even hundreds, of thousands of dollars for ineffective "cures" for cancer, virtually all of which were based on the idea of treating "heavy metal toxicity"? I was also frustrated that Dr. Buttar could get away with what he got away with for so long unencumbered by regulations, the state medical board, or, apparently, any hint of morality. At the time, nearly two years ago, I had assumed that the story was over. I was unhappy, but at least Dr. Buttar couldn't victimize cancer patients or autistic children any more.&lt;/p&gt;

In it are refuted numerous false claims about Mann with regard to the so-called "ClimateGate" fiasco.

I bring this up because some people never tire of the same old routine, and so there is yet another round of attacks on Mann afoot, courtesy of usual suspects like Fox News, Steven Milloy, etc. Once again, the fact is that Mann's employer, Penn State University, vindicated him on numerous charges relating to "ClimateGate"--although one aspect of that investigation currently continues.

Mind you, I had repeatedly replaced all the bits I could: the mesh, often; the knife, several times; once even the accumulator pack. But I figured that having someone replace the worn-out bearings (Sw. &lt;i&gt;lager&lt;/i&gt;) of the motor would be more expensive than getting a new shaver. I poked around on the net, looked at reviews and ordered a mid-price Philips HQ7360/17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two shavers look pretty different. The Braun is designed to move only to and fro along one axis, preferably against the direction your stubble is pointing. This makes its action similar to that of a disposable razor. The Philips looks like a three-headed microphone and allows you to figure-skate it around your face in whatever curlicues you like. I figured it would take some time to get used to a different machine after all these years. But I've been an increasingly unhappy Philips user now for almost four months, and I've come to the conclusion that the Philips is simply not a very good electric shaver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every non-bearded man wants a 1) quick 2) close shave that 3) doesn't lacerate or bruise his skin. And I'll say this for the Philips: it's quick (on the parts of you where it works at all). And you can rinse it under the tap when you're done. But my list of complaints is longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philips is absolutely useless on your throat, your upper sideburns and other soft concave surfaces. You can shave until your skin is red and still your throat will be not just stubbly, but fucking hirsute. This has forced me to take up non-electric shaving again with all its concomitant gore just to get my throat done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it works pretty well above the jaw line, the Philips is sloppy. Hours after shaving you'll sit at your desk at work and grab your chin or lip in thought, and suddenly you'll find a long hair sticking out of an otherwise clean-shaven area. I've started to carry a disposable razor around in my jacket pocket for these emergencies.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
In my face, the Philips encourages ingrown beard hairs, "razor bumps". This, to you boys and ladies, is when a hair is lopped off at the surface of the skin, retracts somewhat, loses track of its exit hole, and proceeds to develop subcutaneously, forming an unsightly pimple. When the pimple is ripe, you then find something long and curly that would make a Hasid proud rolled up inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got to buy a new shaver. Dear Reader, if you're a Europid guy with dark curly beard hairs, and if you have a shaver that works well for you, I'd like to know brand and model please.&lt;/p&gt;

We are collectively concerned that the NCCAM primarily serves as a means for promoting unscientific medicine, and any useful research it funds can be handled by other centers at the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we were a bit surprised when the current director of the NCCAM, Josephine Briggs, contacted us directly and asked for a face-to-face meeting to discuss our concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meeting took place this past Friday, April 2nd. David Gorski, Kimball Atwood and I met with Dr. Briggs, Deputy Director Dr. John Killen, Karin Lohman PhD (Director, Office of Policy, Planning, and Evaluation) and Christy Thomsen (Director, Office of Communications and Public Liaison).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Briggs very graciously began the meeting by telling us that she and her staff have been reading SBM and they find our arguments to be cogent and serious. She shares many of our concerns, and feels that we are an important voice and are having an impact. She then essentially turned it over to us to discuss our primary concerns regarding the NCCAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were prepared for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first pointed out that many of our concerns deal with issues that are outside the purview of the NCCAM director (such as regulation) and therefore we would not bring them up but would rather stick to constructive feedback and concrete ways in which the NCCAM can better serve its mandate. These issues broke down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:391px"&gt;&lt;img title="NCCAM1s" src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/NCCAM1s.jpg" alt="NCCAM1s" width="381" height="240"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left to right: David Gorski, John Killen, Steven Novella, Kimball Atwood, Josephine Briggs, Christy Thomsen, Karin Lohman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCCAM faces particularly complex ethical issues in funding some clinical trials because of the very nature of the topics it is tasked to research – those with low plausibility that have been bypassed by mainstream research. The ethical guidelines of clinical research dictate that before subjecting a person to an experimental treatment, there is sufficient evidence for safety and plausibility of benefit from pre-clinical and animal studies. It might therefore be considered unethical to subject people to experimental treatments that are highly implausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular study that is most concerning is the TACT trial, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4474"&gt;Kimball reviews the specific details of concern here&lt;/a&gt;. TACT is a trial of chelation therapy for heart disease. The concern is that chelation therapy is not a benign treatment and there already has been sufficient evidence to conclude that it does not work. Further study is therefore unethical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Briggs acknowledged our concerns, but pointed out two things. First, this study came into being before her tenure at NCCAM (she became director on January 24th 2008). Second, the TACT trial has been turned over to NHLBI (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute), who now sponsors the trial, while the NCCAM still partly funds and collaborates on the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that Dr. Briggs was able to decline to comment on the TACT trial on the grounds that it falls under the aegis of the NHLBI. This effectively cut off discussion on this topic, which is unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does bring up another issue – the NCCAM funds many studies along with other centers at the NIH, and (as with TACT) they intend to allow centers with the proper expertise to take the lead. NHLBI does heart studies, so they took over TACT. This is reasonable, but does have the consequences of effectively increasing the amount of research funding the NCCAM controls, and also provides cover (intended or not) for controversial studies like TACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimball intends to follow up with the NHLBI regarding TACT and will likely give us an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TACT aside, the ethical concerns remain and this is an issue we will have to follow with future studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Studies funded by NCCAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another core issue we discussed is the fact that the NCCAM funds many studies that are designed to promote CAM in general or specific CAM modalities rather than study whether or not they are effective. Studying how CAM is used, or barriers to CAM acceptance – prior to demonstrating that any particular CAM modality actually works, is putting the cart before the horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a more subtle and insidious problem. So-called pragmatic studies are trials that either compare different treatments or follow outcomes for one treatment in real-world practice. They are often not rigorously blinded nor are variables controlled. They are typically “intention to treat” trials where everyone is followed, regardless of whether or not they complied with the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragmatic studies are a very useful way of tracking real world outcomes. It may be true that aspirin reduces strokes and heart attacks, but what happens when a typical primary care doctor prescribes aspirin? Are their patients compliant? Do they run into side effects or other problems that cause them to stop taking the medication? What do primary docs have to do to improve compliance and minimize side effects? All good questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such studies are simply not designed to answer the question – does aspirin work for the reduction of heart attacks and strokes. Efficacy trials are needed for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have observed in the CAM world, however, is that pragmatic trials are being performed on treatments that have no proven efficacy, and the outcomes are being misinterpreted and presented as evidence for efficacy. For some modalities, such as acupuncture, this is a very deliberate strategy and is being done in response to well-controlled efficacy trials that are negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would therefore like to see NCCAM focus on efficacy trials, especially for treatments that do not already have proven efficacy. Pragmatic studies of unproven therapies are inappropriate and are ripe for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Briggs response on this issue was equivocal – she defended the utility of pragmatic studies but also acknowledged our concerns. We ran into the same problem in that, any examples of such behavior more than 2 years old were before Dr. Briggs time. So we will have to simply monitor things going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Say Never&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to the issue of what kinds of studies the NCCAM should fund is the following question – are there any treatment modalities that have been sufficiently shown to be both implausible and lacking in efficacy that the NCCAM should close the door on future research. When is enough enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used our favorite example – homeopathy, which is especially pertinent following the report of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee in the UK, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3961"&gt;who concluded that homeopathy is worthless&lt;/a&gt;, cannot possibly work, and should be abandoned in all ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to us that the NCCAM (at least so far) has never closed the door on any modality, no matter how implausible and no matter how much evidence for lack of efficacy there is. This seems, if nothing else, like a waste of taxpayer money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Briggs response was that in the last two years (under her directorship) the NCCAM has not funded any studies of homeopathy, which is true. However, they still accept applications for homeopathic research, but none have made it through the review process and been awarded funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tricky issue. Dr. Briggs pointed out that it is not the job of the NCCAM to make final pronouncements about any treatment or medical claim. This is fair enough – but depends on context. The NCCAM is responsible for informing the public about so-called CAM modalities, and that should include a fair assessment of the science. If the science says a treatment is worthless, the NCCAM should not be afraid to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the NCCAM does determine what studies the NCCAM funds. The NCCAM accepts applications for research into homeopathy, but have not funded any in several years. What does this mean? Will they consider funding homeopathy research, and if so they are basically saying that they do not close the door on any medical modality, no matter how implausible or damned by negative evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they will not consider funding homeopathy, then why are they accepting grant applications for homeopathy research? This could be construed and disingenuous – perhaps a way to not fund homeopathy research without having to say they will not fund homeopathy research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads directly to our final core point of concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NCCAM Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final major topic of discussion was the information that the NCCAM provides on its website, newsletter, and press releases. In my opinion this is the easiest problem for the NCCAM to address, and one that is completely and solely within their purview – the information they themselves publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were armed with the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/news/newsletter/2010_february/"&gt;latest NCCAM newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, in which Dr. Briggs is quoted as saying that “Science must be neutral.” Of course, we agree. But in the same newsletter there is article discussing the evidence for acupuncture and pain showing a model of chi and meridians – mystical life force and the lines through which they allegedly flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also an interview with a member of the NCCAM national advisory board, Xiaoming Tian, a Chinese Medical Doctor. In the article he states that he uses acupuncture to treat a variety of ailments (1.  Chronic and acute pain, 2. Osteoarthritis, 3. Fibromyalgia, 4. Sports injuries, 5. Sciatica and neuralgia, 6. Automobile-accident injuries, 7. Autoimmune diseases, 8. Allergies and asthma, 9. Depression, anxiety, and stress, 10. Bell’s palsy and paralysis, 11. Skin rashes and eczema, 12. Side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern of information is consistent – NCCAM staff talk about a strict adherence to evidence-based medicine and science being neutral, but interspersed with this is an uncritical presentation of ancient superstition as if it were science, and endorsement of treatments that are not backed by science, and in fact have been shown not to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my interpretation of the evidence that acupuncture has not been shown to work for any indication (as I have written before, the studies show it does not matter where you stick the needles or if you stick the needles, and any benefit appears to be due to placebo effects, artifact, and the non-specific effects of the ritual surrounding acupuncture – none of which constitute acupuncture itself). But I will acknowledge that there can be some reasonable disagreement about whether or not acupuncture is useful for some symptomatic treatment, like pain. The problem is that wishy-washy evidence for symptomatic benefit is then used to support the use of acupuncture for serious medical conditions, like nerve injury. It’s a classic bait and switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this confirms our worst fears about NCCAM – that its very existence, and the generally positive and uncritical information it provides to the public, is used to promote and endorse unscientific medical modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is not enough to be “neutral”, which could easily fall into the trap of false balance (balancing legitimate scientific evidence and analysis with pseudoscientific promotion). The neutrality of science means letting the chips fall where they may – fairly and honestly reporting the state of the evidence without pulling any punches, like the HCSTC did regarding homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is my experience that the worst thing that the NCCAM will say about a treatment is that there is not “yet” evidence to support its use. The “yet” is often used, but when not it is implied. Almost invariably the lack of evidence leads to the conclusion that  “more research is needed.”  What we don’t hear is that there is evidence for lack of efficacy, or a recommendation to not use a modality or to abandon further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the CAM community is actively exploiting the existence of the NCCAM as an imprimatur of legitimacy, the NCCAM needs to take special care to avoid such exploitation. Meanwhile, it seems that they go out of their way to encourage such exploitation (although it seems just out of naivete) or at least make it easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pointed out that we do not expect the NCCAM to engage in “debunking” (that’s our job). But we do expect that they are fair and do not give a free pass or special treatment to a modality because it’s CAM. That is the double standard we are frequently complaining about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, Dr. Briggs did agree that anti-vaccine sentiments are common in the world of CAM and that the NCCAM can do more to combat this. Information countering anti-vaccine propaganda would be a welcome addition to the NCCAM site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We greatly appreciate Dr. Briggs giving us the opportunity to voice our concerns to her and her staff directly. The meeting was overall very pleasant and constructive. We hope this will lead to an ongoing dialogue and as a result we can help the NCCAM evolve into a more science-based institution. Dr. Briggs did clearly voice her intention to make NCCAM a more rigorous scientific institution, in line with other centers at the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one concrete result of the meeting was an offer to have experts from SBM review NCCAM material before it is published. We, of course, agreed to offer our services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There continue to be very important issues and questions that are at a “higher level” than the NCCAM itself – such as the optimal regulation of medical products and practices, and also whether or not the public is best served by having a center of funding at the NIH which is organized around such a nebulous concept as CAM, rather than a disease or biological system. SBM will continue to address these issues head on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are also happy to work with the NCCAM, and Dr. Briggs does profess her intention to move the NCCAM in a more rigorous scientific direction. We will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to my comment that NCCAM fails to condemn ineffective treatments, the following entry on the NCCAM site was pointed out: http://nccam.nih.gov/health/silver/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In which the NCCAM definitely states that colloidal silver does not work and is not safe. The wording of this entry (noting what the FDA states about colloidal silver) reminded my that Dr. Briggs did specifically mention that the NCCAM information is and will be in line with FDA positions on specific products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further clarify my statement – the NCCAM and even some CAM promoters in my experience will at times condemn specific products when there is evidence of harm, such as with colloidal silver. But this does not extend to treatment modalities, like homeopathy, acupuncture, or therapeutic touch, nor to mere lack of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further the threshold for negative conclusions about CAM modalities seems to follow a double standard, otherwise chelation for heart disease would never have made it past a review board.&lt;/p&gt;

All she wanted to do was attend her senior prom with her girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her Fulton, Mississippi high school &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/12/school-cancels-prom-instead-of-allowing-lesbian-to-attend/"&gt;canceled prom&lt;/a&gt; in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money was donated (and &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/31/aclu-rejects-atheists-money/"&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt;) so she could attend an alternative prom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn’t need an alternative prom, though, because she was told there was already one in the works (run by the school, on private property), and &lt;a href="http://www.shewired.com/Article.cfm?ID=24752"&gt;she attended it&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it didn’t go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The school district invited McMillen and five other students to a prom at a country club in Fulton on Friday night, while the parents for the other students held a “real” prom just miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“They had two proms and I was only invited to one of them,” McMillen tell the &lt;em&gt;Advocate&lt;/em&gt;. “The one that I went to had seven people there and everyone went to the other one I wasn’t invited to.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McMillen says the school principal and teachers served as chaperones for the seven students that were at the dance.&lt;br&gt;
Prior to the prom night, McMillen asked one of the students organizing the event for details and was directed to the country club. “It hurts my feelings,” McMillen says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most disturbing part of this story is that two of the students that were also sent to the “fake” prom apparently had learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They had the time of their lives,” McMillen recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the one good thing that come out of this, [these kids] didn’t have to worry about people making fun of them [at their prom].”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely deplorable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All “adults” (and I use that word loosely) who work at Itawamba Agricultural High School ought to be ashamed of themselves.  So should the parents who took part in all this.  So should the students who find all this funny.  What the hell do you think you’re doing?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there no people in that community with a &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many other people have commented on this already.  I want to echo their words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/lesbian-teen-sent-to-fake-prom.html"&gt;Jen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Constance, get the fuck out of there and don’t come back. Use that scholarship to go to a good college, educate yourself, and rise above the muck that you happened to get stuck in. These people don’t fucking deserve you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2010/04/hateful.html"&gt;Eric Zorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s sickening to imagine how many parents and students had to be involved to pull off this disgusting caper  at a country club in Fulton, Miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids, sometimes they don’t know any better.  I, for one, was not always as kind as I should have been to schoolmates who were different, and it’s a regret that I carry to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And occasionally you’ll find some parents who don’t know any better. Bigots. Fools. Wicked people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But virtually an entire community of parents and teens had to conspire to pull this off.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Supposedly) from &lt;a href="http://lafiga.firedoglake.com/2010/04/05/the-meanest-town-in-america-fake-prom-for-lesbian-student/#comment-14453"&gt;a senior&lt;/a&gt; at Constance’s high school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The reason the senior class boycotted the actual prom was not because we hate gays. We wanted a drama-free gathering to celebrate 3 great years and 1 lousy one together, and we wanted to lay low. We also wanted to do it without the main cause of the lousy. What people are failing to realize is that much of the fault of this whole stink lies with Constance, not her mistreatment by the school district, but her crazy-reckless need for attention. It sounds mean and horrible and like we planned it all specifically to embarrass Constance, but we didn’t. We let her have her prom with her girlfriend and her tuxedo and we went to party it up in the “boondocks” not because we wanted her rights violated, but so we could salvage what has turned into a total fiasco.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/fulton_mississippi_skeeviest_t.php"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PZ&lt;/strong&gt; remarks&lt;/a&gt; about Constance’s classmates and the online trail they’re idiotically leaving with their comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I hope employers and college admissions committees find the hateful association between their names and what they say. Not that it’s much of a worry for these losers; Jiffy Lube probably doesn’t care much about their network trail, and Liberty University would probably consider bigotry an asset.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer can’t come soon enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope Constance takes the goodwill coming from so many of us and the positive press she’s getting from so many bloggers and columnists and channels it into something wonderful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He thinks he can affect reality with his thoughts alone, and that is as good a definition of “magic” as any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday there was a magnitude 7.2 earthquake in Baja CA. This is a serious quake, and on the Mexico side of the border where construction quality is not as good, there was substantial devastation and some loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the quake&lt;a href="http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/chopra-blames-own-meditation-for-baja-quake/19426755?icid=main%7Cwelcome%7Cdl2%7Clink5%7Chttp://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/chopra-blames-own-meditation-for-baja-quake/19426755"&gt; Deepak tweeted:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Had a powerful meditation just now — caused an earthquake in Southern  California,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Was meditating on Shiva mantra &amp;amp; earth began to shake. Sorry about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra’s tweets have caused a bit of a stir. The immediate speculation is – was Chopra just kidding, or was he seriously claiming that he caused the quake in Baja? Either possibility is disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he were just kidding (which is what I suspect will ultimately be his spin) then it was a callous and confusing comment, especially in light of the severity of the quake. It may have just been a bad joke or a moment of poor judgment, but less charitably it was an expression of supreme arrogance from someone who thinks he is a master of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, regardless of what spin Chopra chooses to put on this, we reveal much when we “joke” – it is often a way to express our true feeling without being held accountable for them. It’s a moment of honesty with an escape hatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chopra’s case it is entirely reasonable to conclude that he actually believes he can affect reality with his thoughts. Regarding meditation (referring specifically to achieving “god consciousness”), &lt;a href="http://www.shareguide.com/Chopra2.html"&gt;he has written:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…you see the whole world as an expression of  yourself and you see that the ground of your being is also the ground of all existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ground” here is an ironically appropriate metaphor. &lt;a href="http://www.5min.com/Video/What-is-Transcendental-Meditation-27282794"&gt;He has also said of meditation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“the field of possibilities, creativity, correlation … where intention  actualizes its own fulfillment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intention actualizing its own fulfillment is a fancy way of saying “magic” – affecting reality with your wishes alone. This is because, according to Chopra and other gurus, reality is just your intention; your consciousness is the universe. It all has something vaguely to do with quantum mechanics – or at least that is what Chopra assures us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra’s multi-million dollar empire built in his intention will survive this faux pas. What he is selling many people want to buy – magic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270639180858"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=10506">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8430cf9259d30149</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">The human genome 10 years on – so what?</title><published>2010-04-07T11:19:37Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T11:19:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/the-human-genome-10-years-on-%e2%80%93-so-what/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;By Matthew Cobb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 25, 2000, Bill Clinton, flanked by Francis Collins of the National Human Genome Research Institute and Craig Venter of Celera Genomics, with Tony Blair incongruously at the end of a satellite feed, stood at the White House. &lt;a href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/clinton2.shtml"&gt;Clinton announced&lt;/a&gt; that “the international Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics Corporation have both completed an initial sequencing of the human genome – the genetic blueprint for human beings.” They claimed that the genome “promises to lead to a new era of molecular medicine, an era that will bring new ways to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure disease”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this week’s issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; (which published the draft sequence in February 2001), there is the first of what will undoubtedly be a series of articles and books looking at what has happened over the last 10 years [&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/specials/humangenome/index.html"&gt;these articles are open access&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe there won’t be any such flood of publications, for the simple reason that, despite all the hype, the contribution of the genome to human health has been pretty negligible. In other words, from a purely medical point of view, there isn’t much to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for this slight sense of disappointment can be found in that first, triumphal declaration: a genome is not a “blueprint”, in the sense of a plan that can be read off to deduce a particular structure or behaviour. You cannot look at the chicken genome and deduce that a cockerel will go “cock-a-doodle-doo”. And there are no “cancer genes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genome has turned out to be a much more complicated place than many suspected (I would argue that many of us who actually worked on how genes function in whole organisms predicted this). Genes regulate other genes and, above all, interact with the environment. Organisms are not simply the expression of the genome, they are constructed through myriad interactions between the environment and the genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those interactions turn out to be incredibly complicated. Although computing power has also increased over the last 10 years, attempts to model what all these genes are doing have floundered, and people who work in these areas are in danger of drowning in a sea of data. Those who thought there were big bucks to be made have still to make their fortune; many have lost their shirts. My hunch is that it will be a long time before the promised health benefits turn up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the prospect of lots of money – and health benefits – did mean that a massive amount of attention was paid to sequencing, and the result has been an unprecedented explosion of information about the evolution of life. Over 3,800 organisms (including around 200 humans) have had their entire genomes sequenced, while sequence information on more than 200,000 species has been obtained. This figure is growing all the time, as the price of sequencing plummets and the ease of obtaining entire genomes increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:410px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-10507" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/the-human-genome-10-years-on-%e2%80%93-so-what/464676a-i2-0/"&gt;&lt;img title="464676a-i2.0" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/464676a-i2-0.jpg?w=400&amp;amp;h=514" alt="" width="400" height="514"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exponential growth in the amount of genomic information available. Figure taken from Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;We are living through an astonishing revolution in science, and young biologists should be grabbing the opportunity to make some amazing discoveries about the evolution of life. For example, I am interested in the evolution of the sense of smell. These databases contain the sequences of genes that code for olfactory receptors; it is relatively straightforward to see how they evolved in different lineages, and above all, to gain insight into the role of this sense in the life of a given organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until 2004, it was argued that birds didn’t have much of a sense of smell (there was no real basis for this prejudice, but it was widely held). Then the chicken genome revealed that there were over 500 olfactory receptor genes (more than in a human). And this week, the genome of the zebra finch reveals that this songbird has about 215 functional olfactory receptor genes. This should be leading people to start finding out what exactly birds are doing with their sense of smell – finding food, navigating, finding mates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any young scientists reading this – not just biologists, but computer scientists, mathematicians, chemists – the current revolution in genomics should be seen as a new ocean to explore, a sea of unexploited knowledge that they can play in. It really is that amazing. As the poet William Wordsworth wrote with regard to a rather more bloody revolution – the French revolution of 1789:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,&lt;br&gt;
But to be young was very heaven!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have particularly appreciated the clear legal exposition of my host, &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2010/04/bca-v-singh-what-court-of-appeal-said.html"&gt;Jack of Kent&lt;/a&gt;, Heresy Corner's &lt;a href="http://heresycorner.blogspot.com/2010/04/simon-singh-appeal-ruling-right-result.html"&gt;dissenting take&lt;/a&gt; and a perceptive examination of the BCA's mindset by &lt;a href="http://gormano.blogspot.com/2010/04/ive-blogged-few-times-about-ongoing.html"&gt;Dave Gorman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like to expend just a few more words to consider paragraph 26 of the judgement, which seems to me to go to the scientific heart of the matter. Let us look at exactly what it says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;26. What "evidence" signifies depends heavily on context. To a literalist, any primary fact – for example, that following chiropractic intervention a patient's condition improved – may be evidence of a secondary fact, here that chiropractic works. To anyone (and not only a scientist) concerned with the establishment of dependable generalisations about cause and effect, such primary information is as worthless as evidence of the secondary fact as its converse would be. The same may equally well be true of data considerably more complex than in the facile example we have given: whether it is or not is what scientific opinion is there to debate. If in the course of the debate the view is expressed that there is not a jot of evidence for one deduction or another, the natural meaning is that there is no worthwhile or reliable evidence for it. That is as much a value judgment as a contrary viewpoint would be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are several interesting points here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, it is pleasing to see that their Lordships have a sophisticated understanding of the nature and variability of what constitutes evidence, even in science. I can only speculate that they have read either or both of Ernst and Singh's &lt;em&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/em&gt; and Ben Goldacre's &lt;em&gt;Bad Science&lt;/em&gt;, which give detailed expositions on the factors that determine the quality of scientific experiments, with particular reference to clinical trials. Not all experiments are equal. Controls—the deceptive application of a mock treatment—are vital. Blinding of the scientists and the participants to whether any given participant is receiving the mock or the test treatment provides the most unbiased way of determining treatment efficacy. But not all investigations adhere to these standards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, their Lordships draw an interesting distinction between "literalists" who are prepared to make facile causal links between observations and those "concerned with the establishment of dependable generalisations about cause and effect". This latter group includes but is not restricted to professional scientists. But, given the use of that word "dependable", it is difficult not to envisage that this group must include those who are willing to apply the scientific method &lt;em&gt;rigorously&lt;/em&gt;. Few people, I imagine, would be prepared to submit to treatments developed by "literalists".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Third, by highlighting this distinction, their Lordships draw attention to an unhappy fact about the scientific profession: not all scientists are equal. Some of them are cleverer than others. Some of them are more critical in their interpretation of experimental data. And some of them produce work that is not very good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result of this variability, we have the necessary cut and thrust of scientific debate—the free exchange of criticism that is so important to the method—in which scientists robustly &lt;em&gt;evaluate&lt;/em&gt; this or that piece of evidence. (For anyone interested in the technical details, there is an interesting case study &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/scurry/2009/03/27/eye-opening-access"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Just because an experiment has been done does not mean that useful evidence has necessarily accrued. The good stuff is kept—for the time being—and used as the basis for further investigation. The bad stuff is discarded and left to lie, lifeless and unread, in the scientific literature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crucially, their Lordships contend that it is within the context of this scientific rough and tumble that assessments such as "not a jot of evidence" can readily be taken to mean "no... reliable evidence". These argumentative evaluations of evidence are part of the widely understood terms and conditions of scientific debate. It is a blessed relief that they have been thrown out of court and returned to their proper place: the public domain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42986019@N00/4495963091" title="View &amp;#39;Paragraph 26&amp;#39; on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img border="0" width="500" alt="Paragraph 26" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4495963091_d2e0979f69.jpg" height="208"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is an interesting follow-on to this judicial dissection. In the very next paragraph of the ruling, the Court of Appeal mention a revealing example of the BCA's approach to scientific evidence:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;27. ...Dr Singh's defence includes, in §8(25), a survey of controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of chiropractic in treating infantile colic, none of which, he contends, affords objective support for the BCA's claim. The BCA, in §9(23) of its reply, relies (among other studies) on a 1989 observational study of 316 children, of which it is said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; "This... measured the number of hours each child spent in crying. It showed a reduction in crying time from 5.2 hours each day to 0.65 hours each day at 14 days. This was a very substantial improvement. There was no control group. However, the study constitutes evidence." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their Lordships are careful to point out that this is not the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; study cited by the BCA in support of their claims. But it is telling that this paper [Klougart &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; (1989) J. Manipulative Physiol Ter, Vol. 12, p281-8] is cited at all*. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Klougart study is considered by the BCA to constitute "evidence". But there is no control and therefore no way to gauge the efficacy of the chiropractic intervention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not evidence that a scientist worth their mettle would consider to be of any real value. This is not evidence that I would tolerate in an argument from one of my undergraduates. This is not evidence that a child at primary school learning about science at &lt;a href="http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/key-stages-1-and-2/subjects/science/keystage1/index.aspx"&gt;key stage 1&lt;/a&gt; of the national curriculum would consider to be derived from a "fair test".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BCA is a professional organisation that represents the interests of chiropractors who claimed to be able to treat non-spinal childhood ailments by manipulating their spines. Those are bold claims given our modern understanding of human physiology. That the BCA is happy to cite the paper by Klougart and colleagues as worthwhile evidence supporting chiropractic treatments tells me they are far less critical, far less scientific, than the public has a right to expect them to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This study is the second paper listed in the &lt;a href="http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/gfx/uploads/textbox/Singh/BCA%20Statement%20170609.pdf"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; put out by the BCA in June 2009 to demonstrate that there is a "significant amount" of evidence to support the claims that chiropractic could treat childhood ailments such as colic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The totality of this evidence was subjected to intense scrutiny in the &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/598"&gt;blogoshpere&lt;/a&gt; and the pages of the &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/jul08_4/b2766?view=long&amp;amp;pmid=19589818"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt; and found to consist of irrelevant or poor quality trials. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-9000960018327370035?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270631844485"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44eceba1517bdeea</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Microchip Off the Block</title><published>2012-03-08T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2012-03-08T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/microchip.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Does "Obamacare" health care legislation require that everyone be implanted with RFID microchips by 23 March 2013?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270628223294"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=5536">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d8dea5d29e166dd6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><category term="News From Around The Blogosphere"/><category term="UFOs/aliens"/><category term="religion"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="black hole"/><category term="Carbon nanotubes"/><category term="Catholicism"/><category term="child abuse"/><category term="Jordan"/><category term="Los Angeles"/><category term="Minnesota"/><category term="Opus-Dei"/><category term="UFO"/><category term="Vatican"/><title type="html">News From Around The Blogosphere 4.6.10</title><published>2010-04-07T08:16:55Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T08:16:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/news-from-around-the-blogosphere-4-6-10/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pictures.chrisbradleywriter.com/rat.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pictures.chrisbradleywriter.com/rat.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="131"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/04/05/minnesota.church.abuse/index.html?hpt=T2"&gt;More Catholic child buggery in Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;

My vote goes to Christianity. 3 gods = 1 god? Transubstantiation? Jesus riding on the back of an ass solely to fulfill a prophecy? Land of milk and honey? Hell? C’mon, it’s no contest.&lt;/p&gt;

And early last year my friends Joe Rudy and Chris Russo hoaxed Morristown, New Jersey with their own UFO hoax. You’d think such a major news story being broken by newspaper instead of the internet would have been a big tip-off but what can you say? People fall for it every time! And that’s why the people of Jordan are this year’s April Fools.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, Opus Dei are back, baby! And this time they’re taking L.A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m sure it will all be fine. I mean, what could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Archdiocese of Los Angeles, however, is one of the worst afflicted  by the    clerical sexual abuse crisis that has convulsed the US Church since  2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anti-vaxxer celebs Jim Carrey and &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; have split up. I don’t know the details but I really hope it’s because Jim has come to his senses, realized Jenny’s a nutjob, and has forsaken the anti-vax movement. I want to believe this because I always liked Jim Carrey and I really, really want to like him again. It’s been hard enough watching movies I love that he stars in and I haven’t been able to watch any new Jim Carrey films since finding out his affiliation with the anti-vaxxer movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly like &lt;a href="http://thesuperficial.com/2010/04/jim_carrey_jenny_mccarthy_brok.php"&gt;The  Superficial&lt;/a&gt;’s vision of how the breakup happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can only assume this has everything to do with Jenny  McCarthy being completely shot down by the medical community only to  continuing claiming a Playboy Bunny cracked the mystery of autism. Which  has to get annoying.JIM: Honey, I’m pretty sure a gunshot wound to the pancreas won’t  cure my migraine.&lt;br&gt;
JENNY: I KNOW MORE THAN SCIENCE! *fart*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincere apologies to Jim Carrey for making him relive that  conversation. That must’ve been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I hope that’s how it went down. I guess we’ll all have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in December, the anti-vaccination group, the  Australian Vaccination Network (AVN – yes, that’s their actual acronym), and its founder Meryl Dorey ran into a problem. &lt;a href="http://www.northernstar.com.au/story/2009/12/18/vaccination-group-under-investigation/"&gt;They became subjects of an investigation by the NSW Health Care Complaints  Commission&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AVN is accused of ‘engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct with  the intent of persuading parents not to vaccinate their children,’ by  Ken McLeod, a member of a group known as Stop the AVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while the commission may take several more months to complete  itsinvestigation, the ABC last month released a statement to say that  information supplied by Mrs Dorey which was broadcast on ABC Mid-North  Coast local radio in September was found to be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation found the use of these statistics, about whooping  cough, was misleading as they were ‘drawn from different data sets and  related to different groups of children’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statistics were also  presented as vaccination rates for 1991, when they were, in fact, for  2001, the ABC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also around this time that Dorey started begging for money on behalf of the AVN, which was allegedly going bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now new reports are coming in that suggest Dorey and the AVN are still in dire straits. Allegedly, &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/04/02/the-avn-knocked-back-from-advertising-in-mums-babies-publication/"&gt;parenting magazines, home of their primary demographic, are refusing to publish AVN advertisements&lt;/a&gt;. Now the intended ad would have cost $8000, which Dorey was all ready to pay, which raises an important question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At question here is how the AVN came to have a spare $8000, after their &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/02/07/have-we-seen-the-last-of-the-avn/"&gt;recent  donation drive&lt;/a&gt; initiated apparently to keep them from going under.  Meryl apparently needed the cash to cover debts, so just a few weeks  later she has enough in the coffers to blow eight grand on advertising?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will someone soon be banging down Dorey’s door to break her thumbs in the near future? Who knows? Given the news I reported last week that the &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/australian-vaccination-network-linked-to-scientology/"&gt;AVN is now selling $cientology propaganda films&lt;/a&gt;, nothing would surprise me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

Just before moving to our new home here on Scienceblogs, I asked our readers for ideas on what types of content they would like to see here on Obesity Panacea.  One topic that came up several times was the issue of injuries.  I&amp;#39;m not sure why we haven&amp;#39;t discussed injuries in the past (aside from the fact that it&amp;#39;s not the focus of our research), but it was a great idea, and I&amp;#39;ve come across a study on the topic that I think will be of real interest. 

The study is titled &amp;quot;The influence of exercise and BMI on injuries and illnesses in  overweight and obese individuals: a randomized control trial&amp;quot; and was performed by Carol Janney and John Jakicic at the University of Pittsburgh.  Participants in the study included overweight and obese individuals taking part in one of two  exercise studies - one focused weight loss and the other on weight maintenance.  The exercise component of the two studies were similar, with participants walking at a brisk pace 5 days/week (the major difference between the two studies is that one included caloric restriction to induce weight loss, while the other simply emphasized healthy eating patterns).  Every 6 months, participants reported any injuries or illnesses that impacted their ability to exercise.

I have since received e-mails from Gerald Billings, the Head of Aquaculture at the Ministry of Fisheries and Forests in Fiji. He expressed his concern over the paper's intent and subsequent findings. As a scientist, I believe strongly in impartiality, so I've posted the entirety of his response to the study after the fold for you to read if you wish. I don't like the idea of supporting bickering between governments and conservation organizations, but in this case, I feel the need to comment more on this paper. Indeed, there are many sides to the story here, and my first pass was a little short-sighted.

I am a conservationist at heart, so I was clearly drawn to the message of the Tilapia study. I instantly agreed with the idea that our actions are having negative consequences in ways we haven't even thought of, and that we need to be more careful when we throw species around the globe. 

But, Mr. Billings brings up counter points to the study that cannot be ignored. Indeed, as he states, there is a growing need to feed people that cannot be met by the current native species, and the authors management plan does not include any way of dealing with this issue. To be fair (to myself), I did bring this up in my review. To quote myself on the issue (which is a very strange thing to do),

It's a good plan for the native fish, but as the human populations continue to expand, countries like Fiji will, out of necessity, rely more and more heavily on compact, efficient means of producing food like fish farms. As they do so, it will be harder and harder to keep the fish in the farms from escaping and damaging the surrounding habitat. While this paper serves to warn of the downsides of aquaculture, it unfortunately doesn't provide a solution to the underlying problem of too many mouths to feed on limited resources.

But Mr. Billings also brings up another valid point that I didn't recognize the first time I read the study. It's my age-old pet peeve, and this time, I failed to properly critique the authors: correlation isn't causation.

The paper looked at a number of variables and correlated them to native fish density and diversity. To summarize the entire paper super-quickly, the researchers found that where tilapia lived, native fish didn't. They suggested that this was due to tilapia's voracious appetite. What they didn't do is actually justify that position - they provided no data to show that tilapia introduction in a previously tilapia free waterway caused a drop in native fish density. 

Mr. Billings is right: just because they're at the scene of the crime doesn't mean they committed it. Another perfectly plausible explanation for the correlation between tilapia presence and low native fish density is that, like many invasive and introduced species, tilapia is quick to fill ecological gaps. Instead of the tilapia eating their way through freshwater streams, it's possible that some other disturbance created ecological holes that the fast-breeding, adaptable tilapia gladly filled. 

That's not to say that studies like this one shouldn't be done: indeed, understanding what is happening in an ecosystem is the first step in understanding why it is happening. I still believe this paper is interesting and vital to understanding the role invasive species may play in ecosystem decay, but some of the authors' conclusions must be taken with a grain of salt. At minimum, they must be supported by further research into the interaction of tilapia and native fish.

Apparently it's being reported on &lt;a href="http://thesuperficial.com/2010/04/jim_carrey_jenny_mccarthy_brok.php"&gt;The Superficial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/96945/jenny_mccarthy_jim_carrey_split_after_five_years_together/"&gt;Celebitchy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20358595,00.html"&gt;People.com&lt;/a&gt; that Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy have broken up. I must admit that it's hard not to feel a bit of schadenfreude over this and wonder if maybe Jim Carrey was getting tired of the whole anti-vaccine scene, as &lt;a href="http://thesuperficial.com/2010/04/jim_carrey_jenny_mccarthy_brok.php"&gt;The Superficial&lt;/a&gt; suggested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I can only assume this has everything to do with Jenny McCarthy being completely shot down by the medical community only to continuing claiming a Playboy Bunny cracked the mystery of autism. Which has to get annoying.

&lt;p&gt;JIM: Honey, I'm pretty sure a gunshot wound to the pancreas won't cure my migraine.&lt;br&gt;
JENNY: I KNOW MORE THAN SCIENCE! *fart*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincere apologies to Jim Carrey for making him relive that conversation. That must've been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I can't help but feel sorry for Jenny's son Evan. As messed up as Jim Carrey was, buying into Jenny's anti-vaccine quackery, Carrey had &lt;a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20358595,00.html"&gt;become a father figure to Evan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the years, Carrey has also grown close to McCarthy's son, Evan, who has Autism. "He taught me how to love," Carrey said in 2008 at a march in Washington, D.C. "And without Evan I might never have seen the greatness of Jenny's spirit." 

&lt;p&gt;For her part, McCarthy has praised her then-boyfriend's devotion to Evan telling PEOPLE, "[He has the] capacity to love and to take on something that most men would completely run away from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couple's breakup can't help but cause Evan confusion and consternation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, whatever the reason Jim and Jenny's relationship foundered, Jenny still has plenty of cash in the form of a $50 million trust fund to continue to spread her dangerous anti-vaccine message far and wide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/im_conflicted_over_this_news.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/FnB3RQlzQIg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270613286033"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/95a0405eae83d4e9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">NECSS</title><published>2010-04-07T04:02:36Z</published><updated>2010-04-07T04:02:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/3-newsflash/935-necss.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Folks!&lt;/p&gt;

Why then may you patent a gene?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer could turn out to be that you may not. Last week, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/business/30gene.html" rel="external "&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, a Federal district judge invalidated patents on human genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, on the grounds that they are products of nature. Both genes are related to breast cancer and are often used to decide who may be at risk for breast cancer.  The judge, Robert W. Sweet, ruled that merely isolating a gene does not make it patentable and indeed called arguments to the contrary “a cheap lawyer’s trick.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the patent note that thousands of genes have been patented and fear that private funding for the development of new medical techniques may be at risk if the decision is upheld. On the other hand, according to an earlier &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;324/5930/1000-a" rel="external "&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the patent owner, Myriad Genetics, has been accused of interfering with other people’s research into breast cancer and the BRCA genes. Indeed, according to &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, Myriad Genetics has been charged with using “its monopoly to impede rival research, restrict clinical practice, and deny people access to medical information.” I have not read the judge’s (lengthy) decision and do not know how he ruled on this accusation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, the decision is at least consistent: if you may not patent a product of nature, then you may not patent a product of nature. I have never understood why the Patent Office permitted genes to be patented in the first place. Neither, evidently, did Judge Sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

It's funny, but we shouldn't forget the parallel set of male-disparaging labels: we're &lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/~myl/languagelog/archives/003541.html"&gt;uncommunicative&lt;/a&gt;, we're &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003561.html"&gt;hard of hearing&lt;/a&gt;, we're &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005496.html"&gt;unempathetic&lt;/a&gt;, we're &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003284.html"&gt;emotionally immature&lt;/a&gt;, we pretty much &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003473.html"&gt;can't see things unless they're moving&lt;/a&gt;, in fact we're &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003551.html"&gt;practically vegetables from the neck up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could make up another bingo card with labels of that sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackers have broken into the database of the University of East Anglia’s  Climatic Research Unit – and put the files they stole on the Internet.  The 1079 emails and 72 documents seem indeed evidence of a scandal  involving scientists pushing the man-made warming theory, suggesting  conspiracy, collusion in exaggerating warming data, possibly illegal  destruction of embarrassing information, organised resistance to  disclosure, manipulation of data, private admissions of flaws in their  public claims and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the deniers were claiming that there was a vast &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Conspiracy_Theory"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; on the part of the climate science community to conceal that global-warming was a hoax.  There’s a quick, one-word answer to that charge:  &lt;strong&gt;FAIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/climate-gate1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="climate gate" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/climate-gate1.jpg?w=405&amp;amp;h=359" alt="" width="405" height="359"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how do I know this?  Very simple, really… &lt;a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/phil%20jones%20house%20of%20commons%20report.pdf"&gt;a thorough public investigation has been conducted in the United Kingdom about the actions of Dr. Phil Jones and the Climate Research Unit (CRU).&lt;/a&gt; And it is worth noting that genuine skeptics, like me, were actually calling for just such an investigation back when the hacked emails were originally leaked – hell, if there was some kind of cover-up, I sure wanted to know about it.  And if there was nothing to the allegations, I firmly believed that the science would only be strengthened by an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that isn’t what the global-warming deniers seemed to want.  All they ever seemed interested in was simply ranting &amp;amp; screaming about The Conspiracy – it was almost as if they were afraid that an investigation would discover that their ranting claims were, pardon the pun, so much hot air.  And you know what?  That’s &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/phil-jones-exonerated-british-house-commons"&gt;Read on to see the conclusions of the investigation…&lt;/a&gt; (and, btw, you can get the full House of Commons report &lt;a href="http://climateprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/HC387-IUEAFinalEmbargoedv21.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerning the focus on Jones &amp;amp; the CRU as part of a conspiracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus on Professor Jones and CRU has been largely misplaced. On  the accusations relating to Professor Jones’s refusal to share raw data  and computer codes, the Committee considers that his actions were in  line with common practice in the climate science community but that  those practices need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the much cited phrases in the  leaked e-mails—“trick” and “hiding the decline”—the Committee considers  that they were colloquial terms used in private e-mails and the balance  of evidence is that they were not part of a systematic attempt to  mislead. Insofar as the Committee was able to consider accusations of  dishonesty against CRU, the Committee considers that there is no case to  answer.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And concerning the state of the climate science research itself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the data that CRU used were not publicly  available—which they mostly are—or the methods not published—which they  have been—its published results would still be credible: the results  from CRU agree with those drawn from other international data sets; in  other words, the analyses have been repeated and the conclusions have  been verified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about Dr. Jones’ use of the phrase “trick” in an email  referring to Michael Mann’s Hockey Stick graph:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics  of CRU have suggested that Professor Jones’s use of the word “trick” is  evidence that he was part of a conspiracy to hide evidence that did not  fit his view that recent global warming is predominately caused by  human activity. The balance of evidence patently fails to support this  view. It appears to be a colloquialism for a “neat” method of handling  data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And on the matter of another oft-repeated phrase &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/Mikes-Nature-trick-hide-the-decline.htm"&gt;“hide the decline”&lt;/a&gt;, the investigators conclude:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics of  CRU have suggested that Professor Jones’s use of the words “hide the  decline” is evidence that he was part of a conspiracy to hide evidence  that did not fit his view that recent global warming is predominantly  caused by human activity. That he has published papers—including a paper  in Nature—dealing with this aspect of the science clearly refutes this  allegation. In our view, it was shorthand for the practice of discarding  data known to be erroneous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, to put it simply: there’s no “there” there.  After a complete, public, and thorough investigation into the issue, the science is sound &amp;amp; there was no conspiracy to cover-up anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, not too ironically, what is the response from various global-warming deniers to this news?  You guessed it, they attack the messenger… they either claim the House of Commons investigators are in on the cover-up (the mark of true conspiracy theorists) or they basically conduct an ad hominem attack on the House itself using various non-sequitirs (i.e. you can’t trust them because a previous &amp;amp; different House messed up WMD info on Iraq).  Not one of their counter arguments seems to have anything to do with the actual &lt;em&gt;science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it.  Instead of becoming red hot, hot, hot, the so-called Climategate ends with little more than a fizzle.  Good riddance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, at this time of year, at least in Christian circles, there is a lot of talk going around about &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/prayer.html"&gt;prayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/miracles.html"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; – usually in the guise of stories about supposedly “miraculous” healing.  And the media loves to give air time to these kind of anecdotal stories with nary a whiff of skepticism.  However, to its credit, &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/139839/abc-2020-fri-apr-2-2010"&gt;ABC News did a segment recently&lt;/a&gt; with Elizabeth Vargas where she gave a fair amount of face-time to skeptic Michael Shermer.  Here are some &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2010/04/06/would-i-ever-pray-for-a-miracle/"&gt;excerpts from Shermer’s account of the interview at the really groovy SkeptiBlog…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like how Shermer goes into the issue of &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/lawofnumbers.html"&gt;large number statistics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Confirmation_bias"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;, and believers counting the “miraculous hits” while discounting the enormous number of inevitable misses…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say one million people have cancer in America (it’s much higher  than this), and only one-tenth of one percent experience a spontaneous  recovery (it’s actually higher than this). 1,000,000 x .001 = 1,000  people. Out of that cohort of 1,000 people, what are the chances that  half a dozen of them have compelling narrative stories worthy of  broadcast television? Pretty good! Here is a show you will never see on  any television series: “Next, we examine the remarkable fact that 99.99  percent of people who were diagnosed with incurable cancer and were  prayed for died anyway. Stay tuned, for you won’t want to miss these  stark statistical realities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="balls dropping" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/balls_dropping1.gif" alt="illustration" width="290" height="288"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If  you drop enough balls some will fall into the highly improbable outside  slots. Such “miracles” are statistically guaranteed with large enough  numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the entirety of Shermer’s article for his full views.  But what is a skeptic/atheist to do if someone asks you the following really tough question: &lt;strong&gt;If a loved one was dying, would you suspend disbelief and pray?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, my answer is an emphatic “no.”  And I’m not just speaking of a hypothetical situation here, because this very occurrence has happened to me.  Years ago, my mother was deathly ill, so much so that me and my siblings flew across country on a day’s notice to be with her because we didn’t know how much longer she had.  Things got so bad at one point that we had The Talk with her (that is, the one where she told us that she wanted us to pull the plug if things got bad enough).   Let’s just say that it was a very tough time, because none of the treatments were working and the doctors were throwing everything they had into the fight to turn her around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, through the wonders of medical science (plus some luck, I’m guessing), the doctors were able to make an experimental treatment work and pull my mother back from the brink.  By the end of the week, she was back to normal – but what a week it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never once did I pray during that entire time, even though some people suggested that I do so.  I decided that it would have been far better to put my efforts into being with her, my siblings, and her husband through the difficulty of the situation.  Beyond that, I never once fooled myself about her chances – I immediately accepted the enormity of the situation, and I didn’t want to set myself up for any kind of self-imposed crash when “my prayers weren’t answered”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, when it comes to healing, let’s face it: modern medical science has prayer completely licked.  If it didn’t, and prayer actually worked as advertised by so many, then why would &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; ever get sick &amp;amp; die?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question.&lt;/p&gt;

A paper recently published in the February issue of Conservation Biology – ‘Payments for ecosystem services as a framework for community-based conservation in northern Tanzania’ - highlights a group of tourism operators who are using a PES framework to address the “persistent institutional barriers that limit local rights and economic benefits” of community-based conservation strategies.The researchers document the attempt of a group of tourism operators in northern Tanzania who are trying to address historical conflicts between local pastoralist livelihoods and the wildlife conservation upon which their businesses depend. The approach being taken is to actually compensate the local community for their role in stewarding conservation areas. In particular, “the operators pay the community to enforce voluntary restrictions on agricultural cultivation and permanent settlement in a defined area of land.”Local communities and wildlife both require large, connected landscapes, due primarily to the arid climate and variable rainfall patterns. As a result, land conflicts are common. The land scarcity problem becomes more prevalent as population growth and new state protected areas drive Maasai communities to agricultural cultivation as a livelihood strategy.The first conceptualization of the PES scheme was for the consortium of tourism operators to purchase a pilot conservation easement from the local village, an arrangement that could then be scaled up for larger and more important habitat areas. This initial agreement encompassed 9,300 hectares, with an annual value of $4,500, and required the community to refrain from agricultural development, charcoal burning, and unlicensed hunting in the area. The community took responsibility for enforcement, though the Wildlife Conservation Society funded four village scouts.Interestingly, the tourism operators viewed the costs of compensating local communities as “a collective investment in the conservation of an ecosystem their businesses in the national park ultimately depend on.”The program is characterized as a success: the per-hectare cost of conservation under the arrangement is $0.86 per year. Compensation funds being used to defend (in court) against encroachment from other farmers and to build a school in the village. And a neighboring village is now seeking a similar agreement with the tourism operators.Notably, this PES approach is complex and requires. Indeed, the researchers involved in this study represent six different organizations: Maliasili Initiatives, Wildlife Conservation Society, Ujamaa Community Resource Trust, Dorobo Fund for Tanzania, University of Oxford, and the Tanzania Natural Resource Forum.NELSON, F., FOLEY, C., FOLEY, L., LEPOSO, A., LOURE, E., PETERSON, D., PETERSON, M., PETERSON, T., SACHEDINA, H., &amp;amp; WILLIAMS, A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our guest in this Science Forum is economist Scott Barrett of Columbia University's Earth Institute. Chat with Barrett about the science and politics of geoengineering, the emerging field of science aimed at cooling the planet.

&lt;p&gt;Barrett is an expert on international environmental agreements. He is currently studying the politics and economics of geoengineering. He says countries are more likely to geoengineer climate than reduce their carbon emissions. Read his paper on The Incredible Economics of Geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barrett is the author of Environment and Statecraft: The Strategy of Environmental Treaty-Making. (Here's a review of the book.) Barrett also blogs for Yale Global Online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring your own questions and comments for Scott Barrett. He's here in the forum through April 19th.

Image from Wikipedia.

SK-54 is a curious fossil. The 1.5 million year old skullcap represents a juvenile Paranthropus robustus, one of the heavy-jawed hominins which lived in prehistoric South Africa, but there is something that makes this skull fragment particularly special. Near one of the sutures along the back of the skull are two neat puncture marks, the hallmark of a leopard.

Even though it was initially proposed that SK-54 had been murdered by another australopithecine wielding a weapon of bone or horn, in the late 1960's the paleontologist C.K. Brain was able to demonstrate that the holes almost precisely fitted with the lower canine teeth of a leopard. What's more, Brain determined that many of the accumulations of bones found in the South African cave deposits were attributable to the activities of predators, meaning that for a long span of time our ancient relatives (particularly juveniles) may have regularly been cat food. Nor were hominins the only primate fossils to be found in these accumulations. It seems that the prehistoric leopards had a taste for primates, just as some living leopards do.

In the Tai Forest of Cote d'Ivoire, leopards frequently kill and consume primate prey. It is rare that scientists observe an attack in progress, but the primate remains in big cat scat confirm that primates are a major part of the leopard diet in this forest. Along with what we know from the fossil record, these prey preferences have raised an interesting question. Have the hunting habits of leopards influenced primate evolution?

&lt;p&gt;This past Friday I had the priviledge of being interviewed by &lt;a href="http://www.seti.org/"&gt;SETI&lt;/a&gt; astronomer &lt;a href="http://www.seti.org/shostak"&gt;Seth Shostak&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://radio.seti.org/"&gt;SETI Radio’s monthly “Skeptic Check” segment.&lt;/a&gt; Apparently, Seth and executive producer Molly Bentley had caught the &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/edmund_pseudo_scientific_sells_ghost_detectors"&gt;article that I wrote to Skeptical Inquirer magazine&lt;/a&gt; about the Edmund (Pseudo)Scientific ghost detector (my blog post on the subject is &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/09/14/edmund-pseudoscientific-sells-ghost-detectors-other-woo/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and how that once respected science teaching outlet had now decided to go down the rabbit hole of nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

But then there was a ray of hope: the school administrators changed their minds. There would be a prom after all, and Constance McMillen could bring her date! Wow! A progressive, reasonable attitude was prevailing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/constance-mcmillen-american-hero-not-he"&gt;They had organized a new prom, all right…a prom just for Constance McMillen&lt;/a&gt;. The principal and teachers showed up to chaperone Constance, her date, and all of &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; other students who showed up, including two kids with learning disabilities. They basically quarantined off seven outcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about all the other kids at the high school? They got to go to a prom, too, a special one organized by the parents for just the True American™ kids. Constance wasn&amp;#39;t told about it, which is the amazing thing: all the kids who showed up at the alternate prom knew about it and kept it secret. That&amp;#39;s impressive. I remember my high school, and news like that would be all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other kids at Itawamba Agricultural High School are really special. Special scumbags. Bigots and haters and cowards. I hope they remember that for many years afterwards, that what their school is internationally known for is that it is populated with weasely little homophobes. What a disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang on — it&amp;#39;s even worse than I thought. &lt;a href="http://patriotboy.blogspot.com/2010/04/we-dont-need-you-comin-round-here-with.html"&gt;Jesus' General has the scoop&lt;/a&gt;: the kids at that high school created a Facebook group, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Constance-quit-yer-cryin/367776042862?v=wall&amp;amp;ref=sgm"&gt;"Constance quit yer cryin"&lt;/a&gt;. Unbelievable. Here are samples of what they wrote there (they're buried now; decent human beings discovered the page and have flooded it with comments supporting McMillen and berating the cowards who played this game&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mitchell Henderson&lt;/b&gt;: lulz rug munchers are hilarious. Come join me in hell, there's ipods all around for dance parties. As long as you bring someone to scissor with.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Melody Carol&lt;/b&gt;: JAlthough, she asked and they said no, she should have just stfu and dealt with it. The school did not need to cancel the prom to shift attention from here. That's just gay.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Brittany Kay Brown&lt;/b&gt;: jeremy, that's your fault for not coming out of the closet. IAHS is not a bigoted school. This whole town is based on Christianity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Caleb Waddle&lt;/b&gt;: i just wish she would shut up and quit makeing the freakin county stupid you say well its there fault but since when did the public do anything to you just shut the freak up already.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Traci Taylor&lt;/b&gt;: Carnathan who wants to c 2 girls makn out...especially one of them thats parents are totally against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope employers and college admissions committees find the hateful association between their names and what they say. Not that it's much of a worry for these losers; Jiffy Lube probably doesn't care much about their network trail, and Liberty University would probably consider bigotry an asset.&lt;/p&gt;

Managing for stability just doesn’t work.

This epiphany has helped forge the development of ecosystem based management (EBM), theoretically a more holistic approach to natural resource management that is more in tune with natural processes.  However, we still haven’t worked out the kinks so something good in theory often falls flat.  A couple of recent [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

What’s mine is yours and what’s yours is mine, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="check-book_feat" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/check-book_feat-300x126.jpg" alt="Checkbook" width="300" height="126"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast – especially when it comes to money. It’s becoming more and more popular for married couples to keep separate bank accounts. A practice that was unheard of a few decades ago, many experts are pointing to reasons why keeping finances separate but not necessarily equal is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an advice column, &lt;a href="http://www.lendingtree.com/smartborrower/families/managing-money/joint-vs-separate-bank-accounts/"&gt;LendingTree&lt;/a&gt; gives reasons why separate bank accounts may be the way to go in terms of the need for privacy, lowering the risk of financial ruin, and maintaining credit and a sense of freedom for both parties. And &lt;a href="http://newlyweds.about.com/od/money/a/jointbankingaccounts.htm"&gt;About.com&lt;/a&gt; points to the fact that separate ledgers can make a divorce more cut and dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictably, not everyone agrees. Author &lt;a href="http://www.sharondurling.com/book.htm"&gt;Sharon Durling&lt;/a&gt; explained to &lt;a href="http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/chk/20030610a1.asp"&gt;Bankrate.com&lt;/a&gt; how a long-lasting marriage could be keyed by merging financial assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Durling: “Of couples I have counseled, the greatest success, both in marital happiness and sustainability, occurs when assets are commingled upon marriage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, whether or not a couple should have separate bank accounts is a personal decision that should be carefully considered. But if a husband and wife enter a marriage with established monetary routines, why should that harmony be disrupted? Today, that’s a valid question.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course. Though many people will tell you that you won’t be giving your baby enough nutrition as a vegetarian, that’s simply not the case. However, you do need to make sure that you’re getting enough calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12 for the health of your newborn – and yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="breastfeed_feat" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/breastfeed_feat-300x126.jpg" alt="Breastfeeding" width="300" height="126"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/much-more-than-milk/"&gt;calcium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; that aren’t dairy products, so you shouldn’t have a problem consuming the required 1,000 mg per day. In terms of zinc, breastfeeding mothers should get 12 mg daily. Zinc-rich foods (aside from meat and dairy) include spinach, yeast, wheat germ, peanuts, beans, bran cereals, and pumpkin seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you eat dairy or fish, you’ll probably get enough B12. But if you skip animal protein, take vitamin B12 supplements while you’re pregnant and nursing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also while preggers, be sure to get enough &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/folate-why-you-need-it-how-to-get-it/"&gt;folate&lt;/a&gt;, which can reduce a woman’s risk of having a baby with spina bifida and other birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asperger’s syndrome is pervasive development disorder (PDD), as well as an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Some refer to Asperger’s syndrome as a highly functional form of autism, and the symptoms of Asperger’s vary tremendously from very mild to quite severe. Some things to look for in children include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty interacting socially&lt;/strong&gt; – Kids with Asperger’s syndrome don’t make friends easily and have difficulty interacting with others. They may also be clumsy in their movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obsessive, repetitive behavior &lt;/strong&gt;– Similar to OCD, children with Asperger’s may show odd and repetitive behaviors, preoccupations, and rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication issues&lt;/strong&gt; – Though children with Asperger’s syndrome are usually of average or above-average intelligence, they often have trouble using facial expressions and gestures, as well as understanding body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptionally talented &lt;/strong&gt;– Kids with this disorder often are exceptionally talented in a particular area, such as art, music, or math. On the other hand, they have a very limited (and almost obsessive) interest in just a few topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis can be difficult, as there’s no one specific exam to determine whether or not a child has Asperger’s syndrome. A battery of tests should be taken to make sure there’s no physical cause for the symptoms; then children should be referred to a child development specialist or a pediatric neurologist for observation and diagnosis. In order to identify the problem, a doctor may use various screening instruments, such as the Asperger’s Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS), Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), Childhood Asperger’s Syndrome Test (CAST), and Gilliam Asperger’s Disorder Scale (GADS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there’s no cure for Asperger’s syndrome, but speech and occupational therapy, as well as behavior modification can make life easier for the child (and the rest of the family), plus reduce certain undesirable patterns. Doctors may decide to prescribe medication for some symptoms including anxiety, sleeplessness, and hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn’t been made yet,  but &lt;a href="http://tulsa.unitedcor.org/node/37"&gt;it could be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To get license plates in Oklahoma with the phrase, “In Reason We Trust” &lt;strong&gt;750 citizens of Oklahoma will need to agree to purchase the plate&lt;/strong&gt;. This plate will be between $15 to $20. More information will be provided at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we are collecting a list of names for those interested in purchasing a “In Reason We Trust” license plate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, just &lt;a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;amp;formkey=dFNqNndQQWR5aUR3d2FvVDJiZ1JRUXc6MA"&gt;fill out this form&lt;/a&gt;!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the &lt;a href="http://tulsa.unitedcor.org"&gt;Tulsa Coalition of Reason&lt;/a&gt; gets enough names, they can move forward to make this plate a reality.&lt;br&gt;

And while it’s normal to want to stock up on everything that your infant might possibly need, some things just don’t make sense. So, save a little cash and hold off on buying these items until &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;you live with your baby for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High chair &lt;/strong&gt;– Your baby won’t sit in a high chair until she’s ready to eat solid foods. An infant can also slip right out of a high chair. Put this purchase off until your bundle of joy is five to six months old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:250px"&gt;&lt;img title="baby2" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/baby2.jpg" alt="Baby" width="240" height="228"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity center&lt;/strong&gt; – A play mat that lies flat on the ground is fine for infants, but a saucer activity center doesn’t make sense until your little one is at least five months old and can control the bobbing of her head. So, just wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gates and other childproofing products &lt;/strong&gt;– You don’t need a stairway gate, kitchen cabinet locks, or dozens of outlet covers – your baby isn’t going anywhere for a while! When your infant starts crawling (or maybe rolling), then it’s time to childproof your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fancy bedding&lt;/strong&gt; – As we mentioned yesterday, a newborn doesn’t need &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/let-your-newborn-sleep-in-an-open-drawer/"&gt;fancy bedding or an elaborate crib&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, they’re not always safe. A very basic crib with a firm mattress is perfect for a newborn. Save the frilly comforters and matching drapes until she reaches toddler-hood.&lt;/p&gt;

However, sudden infant death syndrome is a real threat. In fact, for infants older than one month, nothing is as deadly as SIDS. Approximately one in 2,000 infants die from the mysterious syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:210px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/baby-in-crib.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="baby-in-crib" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/baby-in-crib.jpg" alt="Baby in crib" width="200" height="299"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: istockphoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts point to a number of ways to reduce the risk of SIDS. The &lt;a href="http://www.sids.org/"&gt;American SIDS Institute&lt;/a&gt; says prevention starts before birth. Parents-to-be should avoid smoking, drinking, and all types of drugs. They also recommend regular medical care and good nutrition during pregnancy (all fairly obvious suggestions). But what you might not know is that the Institute also says women should wait a year after giving birth before getting pregnant again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nichd.nih.gov/"&gt;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development&lt;/a&gt; stresses that all babies should sleep on their back on a firm mattress that’s covered with a fitted sheet. There should be no soft toys, pillows, bumpers, or any type of loose bedding in the crib. (See our recent post about that subject &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/let-your-newborn-sleep-in-an-open-drawer/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+b5media%2FBabylune+%28Babylune%29"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional tips offered by &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sudden-infant-death-syndrome/DS00145/DSECTION=prevention"&gt;MayoClinic.com&lt;/a&gt; include: No smoking around babies, breastfeeding your baby if possible, keeping the room at a reasonable temperature, and staying near the sleeping baby to listen for any disruptions.

The concept is an online dating service meant to create fewer single households, because “if people start to share their lives, they will also start to share  their toasters. This will cut pollution in half.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, the “green” dating service identifies just how eco-conscious you are with its Green-O-Meter: Do you sort garbage, own a car, or grow your own vegetables? What about your Greenest Act and Greenest Sin – do you virtuously pee in the shower or lie about being part of an environmental organization? Based on your answers, the service pairs eco-compatible partners, then suggests earth-friendly-themed dates (a “no lights night” or, if you want things to get really hot and heavy, plant a tree together).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D8928244%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D1%26show_byline%3D1%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D00ADEF%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=281" width="500" height="281"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dating service with a twist is adorably silly, but it raises the question: How much do you care about your date’s “Green-O-Meter”? We judge all kinds of things on a first date, assessing whether we share enough interests to, y’know, go on a second date. When yours throws his recyclable bottle into the trash, does your inner Liz Lemon scream “That’s a deal breaker, ladies!”? Take our poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ScienceBlogs.com, the leading social media site in the science category, today released traffic figures for 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 (Source: Google Analytics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visits for the quarter ending March 31 grew by 41% year-over-year to approximately 13 million, and page views topped 25 million. Monthly unique visitors grew to 2.4 million worldwide and in the US surpassed 2 million for the first time this March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total visits for 2009 grew by 55% year-over-year to 45 million and average monthly unique visitors climbed 49% to 1.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ScienceBlogs.com has achieved high double-digit traffic growth (at least 50%) every year since its launch in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ReadThis and Books for NYC Schools&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to hang with Elizabeth Gilbert and Rick Moody this weekend? If you’re into books and happen to be in Manhattan, you (and your kids) won’t want to miss a huge literary blowout, &lt;a href="http://booksfornyckids.blogspot.com/"&gt;Books for NYC Schools&lt;/a&gt;, put on by &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=43663579230&amp;amp;ref=ts"&gt;ReadThis&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, April 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=43663579230&amp;amp;ref=ts"&gt;ReadThis&lt;/a&gt; is a New York-based literary group dedicated to providing access to books and reading – the organization is run completely by writer-volunteers who have created libraries, sent books to troops overseas, and held book drives to fulfill school wish lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Saturday starting at 11:30 a.m., ReadThis will collaborate with New York’s &lt;a href="http://centerforfiction.org/"&gt;Center for Fiction&lt;/a&gt; to host a &lt;a href="http://booksfornyckids.blogspot.com/2010/03/help-put-books-in-hands-of-nyc-kids.html"&gt;mega literary event&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of collecting 5,000 books for New York City public schools and students. The hip happening will feature readings and Q&amp;amp;A sessions with literary luminaries including Elizabeth Gilbert, Jamaica Kincaid, Rick Moody, Kurt Andersen,  and Sam Lipsyte. Plus, there will be special readings, film screenings, and make-your-own-book workshops for kids and teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We even like the cost of admission: Two or more new or gently used kids’ books per attendee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In fact, I move that Bad Astronomy  be a recommended text book at secondary schools everywhere, or even primary schools, for that matter. Scratch that. Everyone in the world should read this book. Phil Plait manages to break things down to an easily understandable level, so that people without a background in physics or astronomy* can grasp the core concepts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree. In fact, I’d be happy to reduce my royalty to a mere one penny per book if that would make what he wishes come true. I suspect $60M would be a sufficient and acceptable paycheck. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471409766/qid=1002324596/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_0_3/103-7192648-5486217/badastronomy"&gt;You can start now if you’d like&lt;/a&gt;, and if it does sell six billion copies, I’ll send you a refund for the difference&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#disclaimer"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The James Randi Educational Foundation is pleased to announce the JREF Credit Card Art Contest. Back in November 2009 the JREF announced the release of the JREF Capital One Visa card, available to anyone interested in supporting the JREF through the use of a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JREF Capital One Visa Card has been successful for the JREF with the first purchase made on the card triggering a gift of $50 from Capital One to the JREF. Once the card is active, 1% of everything spent on the card goes to the JREF to help fund our valuable and much needed programs fighting woo-woo and helping to get critical thinking resources into the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between April 5, 2010 and May 15, 2010 we are asking for contest submissions of artwork to adorn the JREF Capital One Visa card. This is your chance to have a lasting impact on the JREF by designing a new iconic image for the card!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning design will be chosen by James “The Amazing” Randi and the card designs will be posted on the JREF website (&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/../"&gt;www.randi.org&lt;/a&gt;) so that JREF members can vote on which design they think should adorn the second card. At the end of the contest we’ll have two brand new JREF Capital One Visa card designs to choose from giving JREF members and the public a pair of new reasons to order a JREF Capital One Visa Card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contest Prizes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recognition of designing one of the three JREF Capital One Visa credit card designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;First Prize winner gets a JREF Swag Bag (a collection of JREF Paraphernalia)  plus a copy of &lt;em&gt;An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural&lt;/em&gt; by James Randi.&lt;/p&gt;

The brooding, antisocial loner, the one with impulse control problems, a penchant for risk-taking, and a cigarette dangling from his lip, is a recognizable archetype in popular culture. From Marlon Brando to Bruce Lee, these flawed heroes are perhaps the ones with restless brain chemicals; the ones who never felt good and never knew why (“What are you rebelling against?” “What’ve you got?”). 

A recent study at Vanderbilt University, published in Nature Neuroscience, used PET scans and fMRI imaging to suggest that impulsivity and other “antisocial” traits “predicted nucleus accumbens dopamine release and reward anticipation-related activity in response to pharmacological and monetary reinforcers, respectively.”

In other words, the Vanderbilt researchers maintained that so-called “psychopathic traits” like impulsivity and risk taking are linked to addiction and gambling by means of an overly active dopamine system. PET scans of dopamine responses to a low dose of amphetamine showed that “individuals who scored high on a personality assessment that teases out traits like egocentricity, manipulating others, and risk taking had a hypersensitive dopamine response system,” according to a press release from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which funded the study.

Putting a different spin on the matter, NIDA director Nora Volkow said: “By linking traits that suggest impulsivity and the potential for antisocial behavior to an overreactive dopamine system, this study helps explain why aggression may be as rewarding for some people as drugs are for others.”

Lead author Joshua Buckholtz of Vanderbilt said that “the amount of dopamine released was up to four times higher in people with high levels of these traits, compared to those who scored lower on the personality profile.  Buckholtz suggested that a pattern of exaggerated dopamine responses “could develop into psychopathic personality disorder.”

Dr. Robert Cloninger, a prominent addiction researcher, has asserted in the past that children who show a high propensity for risk-taking, along with impulsivity, or “novelty-seeking,” are more likely to develop alcoholism and other addictions later in life. 

And, in interviews with the late psychologist Henri Begleiter for my book on addiction science, Begleiter insisted that addicts were stuck with a package of symptoms he called behavioral dysregulation. “Disinhibition, impulsivity, trouble fitting into society—you have certain behavioral disorders in kids who later develop into alcoholics and drug addicts,” he said. The behavior itself doesn’t cause the addiction. The dysregulated behavior is a symptom of the addiction.” 

“When you talk to these people, as I have,” Begleiter said, “you see that the one thing they pretty much all report is that, under the influence of the drug, they feel much more normal. It normalizes their central nervous systems. Initially, what they have is a need to experience a normal life.” 

So, it wasn’t ducktails, pool halls, tattoos, casual sex, or lack of parental involvement that caused addiction to alcohol and cigarettes and pot, and maybe cocaine and speed and heroin. It wasn’t just the “bad kids.” Irrational anger, impulsive decisions, certain compulsive behaviors like gambling—these behaviors were symptoms of the same group of related disorders that included drug and alcohol addiction, and which involved specific chemicals and areas of the brain related to reward, motivation, and memory.

The trait of impulsivity is a possible marker for addiction that may help explain why it is usually impossible to persuade addicts to give up their drugs by sheer force of logic—by arguing that the drugs will eventually ruin their health or kill them. “They tell me it’ll kill me,” sang Dave Van Ronk, “but they don’t say when.”

Consider the always-instructive case of cigarette smoking. In 1964, the Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and Health laid out the case for the long-term ill effects of nicotine quite effectively—and millions of people quit smoking. A stubborn minority did not, and many of them still have not. Are they simply being hedonistic and irresponsible? Or are the long-term negative consequences, so dramatically clear to others, simply not capable of influencing their thinking to the same degree? Biochemical abnormalities similar to those predisposing certain people to addiction may also prevent them from comprehending the long-term results of their behavior.

&lt;blockquote&gt;DURHAM, N.C. -- Internationally renowned conservationist Claudine André will visit Duke University April 14-18 as part of the "Primate Palooza," an effort to raise awareness for our primate relatives.

&lt;p&gt;André founded and runs the world's only sanctuary and release program for orphaned bonobos in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, are our closest living relative and are highly endangered. However, unlike chimpanzees and humans, bonobos are the only ape that has found a way to maintain peace in their groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When bonobos have a disagreement with each other they tend to hug or share food instead of having a fight. Bonobos have never been observed to kill each other and females cooperate to prevent males from bullying smaller bonobos. Ironically, this peaceful ape only lives in one country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been torn apart by almost a decade of war that has killed more than five million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;André was given an orphan bonobo called Mikeno when she was caring for abandoned animals at the Kinshasa zoo during the war. She collected food from local restaurants to feed Mikeno and other starving animals while starting kindness clubs to teach Congolese children about animals. Further north, soldiers were shooting bonobos for food, and before long, she was flooded with bonobo orphans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I wanted a paradise for my bonobos," Claudine says. "Somewhere they would always be fed and taken care of. Somewhere they could always see the sky."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She established Lola ya Bonobo in 2001 in a forest just outside Kinshasa, the capital city of Congo. Since the sanctuary has opened her non-profit "friends of bonobos" has funded the visits of tens of thousands of children to the bonobo sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, André enlisted the help of Duke students and faculty in the Evolutionary Anthropology Department to aid her efforts to release bonobos orphaned by the illegal pet and bush meat trade back into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Having Claudine here at Duke is a wonderful opportunity to share with students and the general public the difference a single individual can make," says Duke researcher Brian Hare. "Claudine has done more for bonobo conservation than anyone else in the world. If you want to meet a conservation heroine this is your chance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duke's Primate Palooza will run from April 14th - 17th. The main events open to the public are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Primate Symposium: Why you need to know you are a primate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
5-8 p.m., Wednesday, April 14&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duke faculty studying primates will discuss how knowing you're a primate can improve your life. Keynote speaker Claudine André will speak about her work saving bonobos and defending the world's last great tropical forest in the Congo Basin. A silent auction including Duke Men's basketball, Duke Lemur Center, and Bonobo memorabilia will be held to benefit "Friends of Bonobos."&lt;/p&gt;

A little man who wasn’t there&lt;br&gt;
He wasn’t there again today&lt;br&gt;
Oh, how I wish he’d go away*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JB Handley used to be the news and entertainment media’s go-t0 guy for acerbic quotes about vaccines and autism, or what editors call “balance”.  The founder of Generation Rescue, arguably the largest, best-funded anti-vaccine group in the world, was adept at playing reporters and credulous talk-show hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those days are gone.  As an unrelenting stream of scientific and legal setbacks rocks the anti-vaccine movement, fewer journalists feel an obligation to balance the consensus of medical science with the unhinged rants of the nation’s number one vaccine rejectionist. A case in point: a Google News search of “World Autism  Awareness Day” and “vaccines” for the first three days of April yields zero hits. The old media narrative of “some people think vaccines might cause autism” has given way to “vaccine rejectionism puts children at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purported vaccine-autism link is dead. Survivors include Big Foot, the Loch Ness Monster, and Alien Elvis. Interment will be held in Area 51. In lieu of flowers, mourners can send contributions to Unicorn Rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Handley isn’t going down without a fight, and in a fawning, two-part interview on a &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/articles/2010/04/04/10362"&gt;fringe “progressive” blog&lt;/a&gt;, he attacks the media for ignoring him. Progressive politics has a long, proud history in the US, and its  accomplishments include a 40-hour work week, minimum wage laws, civil  rights, and national parks. Absent from the list are measles, mumps,  pertussis, and a other vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the subjects that inflate Handley’s voice is the mainstream media  and “how ignorant they are” when they report on vaccines and autism.  They don’t even know how many shots kids get, he said, citing coverage  of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines as the classic case in  point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tells his interviewer, Steven Higgs, an adjunct professor at Indiana University, of an “emerging consensus that the autism epidemic is real and caused by  environmental toxins.” In fact, scientific consensus tells us there are no reliable data for or against an autism epidemic. The point apparently escapes Higgs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, Handley “repeatedly emphasized that he has no  idea what causes autism,” and that he “couldn’t prove vaccines  contributed to his son’s (autism)in a court of law.” But only a week ago Handley boasted that he would “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4259"&gt;bring the US vaccine program to its knees&lt;/a&gt;,” apparently over an unproven hunch.&lt;/p&gt;

It was crazy. Everything shook and I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; it was going to happen. I even told my husband and I told some of my friends a few days prior. I was like, “Dude, there is totally gonna be an earthquake.” I was so psychically connected to the earthquake idea that I strapped a pillow on my head. You know, in case something was to fall on it. Laugh all you want but I have been in earthquakes before and trust me, stuff &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; fall on your head. Okay, I didn’t do the pillow thing cuz that would look silly but I thought about it and I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; wearing all my fancy jewelry. Not just to be a show off but so that when the earthquake hit I would have all my important stuff with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s right.  I am a genius-psychic earthquake-predictor.  I kick ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is my next prediction you ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there is totally going to be an earthquake. Duh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in California and there are going to be earthquakes. That is one prediction you can bet on. There will be quakes and every so many years there are going to be big ones. We are due, &lt;img src="http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/662/greenquake.jpg" alt="green quake" width="280" height="279"&gt;statistically speaking, for a big one any time now. The San Andreas Fault in particular is long overdue for a significant quake. It could seriously happen at any moment and if you walk around saying there will be an earthquake, eventually you get to be right and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you get to say you are psychic! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering how many times I said there was going to be an earthquake and there wasn’t one? Did I mention the earthquake was actually in Mexico and just shook California? Ah, don’t worry about it. Remember the hits and forget the misses just like the professional psychics teach us to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is your chance to play psychic and maybe even say I told you so! Make a prediction of your own! Look into your crystal balls (your crystal ones) oh psychic readers of Skepchick and predict a celebrity death or a catastrophe or some other significant (or insignificant) event. Tell me, what do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; predict will happen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

How Do We Use It?

What Happens When We Lose It?

One of our most essential life skills is the ability to build context - the core assumptions which enable effective choice of behavior. The literatures on posttraumatic growth, many forms of therapy, recovery from depression or significant loss describe new context as a foundational achievement: recovery happens as we create better, more valid assumptions about ourselves and the world around us.

Two other foundational qualities for recovery and growth are the development of new abilities and  the development of social relationships and the associated capacity for self-regulation. In many cases, these qualities are present, just neglected. The building of positive context can reveal these capacities. In other words, as we develop wisdom, we discover new capabilities and relationships we couldn’t recognize earlier.

Traumatic events cause the invalidation of highly significant assumptions. Trauma destroys context. After the trauma, we grow with the development of positive context or wither as such development is neglected. Consider these two definitions:

  Tedeschi and Calhoun:1

  

  Psychological crisis can be defined in relation to the extent to which the fundamental components of the assumptive world are challenged, including assumptions about the benevolence, predictability, and controllability of the world; one's safety is challenged, and one's identity and future are challenged. The "seismic" set of circumstances severely challenges, contradicts, or may even nullify the way the individual understands why things happen, in terms of proximate causes and reasons, and in terms of more abstract notions involving the general purpose and meaning of the person's existence. Such threats to the assumptive world are accompanied by significant levels of psychological distress.

And,

  Brewin et al. (1996):2

  

  Trauma generally involves a violation of basic assumptions connected with survival as a member of a social group. These include assumptions (not necessarily conscious ones) about personal invulnerability from death or disease, status in a social hierarchy, the ability to meet internal moral standards and achieve major life goals, the continued availability and reliability of attachment figures, and the existence of an orderly relation between actions and outcomes.

Any quality of learning beyond primal instinct and reflex is context - our somatic markers, biases, scripts, schemas, personalized mind-blindness, unchallengeable doubts and certainties, internal working models, values and personality. Context is nothing less than the applicable portion of our model of both the world and also how we most effectively and efficiently respond to it.

Context is positive if it affirms possibility and capacity. Positive context leads to useful behaviors. Positive context promotes attunement to the present state of mind and body. We can have positive context for negative circumstances and scenarios: the assumption we should flee in the presences of certain threats is a positive assumption.

Context is negative if it is absent, inappropriate generalized or abstract, or worse, if it is a negation of possibility or capacity. Context is negative if it emphasized the presumption of accuracy over positivity. Negative context often promotes behaviors which neglect present circumstances.

When we take time to “think,” to “access higher order cognitive functions,” we are accessing our ingrained knowledge base so we can efficiently choose the most effective behavior. As we access context, we develop behaviors with more accuracy and nuance. It would be like taking care with what you say rather than blurting out the first thoughts. 

Suffering Loss

When we lose access to food and shelter, or are wounded, our physical living is threatened. We lose life fitness. When we lose context, our decisioning will be too fast (denying access to higher-order functions) or too slow (worsening peril are losing opportunity), and less effective because of lack of core understanding. Here again, we have lost life fitness. When we lose context, we face the horror of psychic annihilation. We are overwhelmed by our own life experience.

(For a greater discussion on the role of life fitness, see How Loss Creates Depression And Growth)

Posttraumatic growth is the consequence of the struggle to rebuild physical resources, regulatory resources (such as friendships or relationships) and context. Of the three, context is likely the most significant.

  Tedeschi and Calhoun (2004), again:

  

  Because of the affect involved, and the restructuring of the fundamental components of the assumptive world, growth seems to have a qualitative and quantitative difference in trauma survivors. Their attributions that growth was accomplished because of, and in the aftermath of, the struggle with trauma may be acknowledgments that much cognitive processing and affective engagement went into the changes they report. Research indicates that when persons who have experienced severe trauma have been compared with those who do not report trauma, positive personal changes are reported at a reliably higher level among trauma survivors.

So understanding how we use and lose context should offer some ideas about how to approach the creation of new, more positive and vital context.

The Body And the ‘What Is That?’

Each iota of experience is the product of body change in response to an emotionally salient object: Body-as-it-was, object, body-as-it-is. These body changes are emotions. A simple organism swims along and enters a patch of acidic water. It reacts and swims away. For a patch of food-rich water, it swims in and enjoys the bounty. The condition of the water changes the behavior of the organism.

However hard-wired by evolution, there is a process of assessment (what is that?) and behavior choice (what do I do?). Together, the answers drive the primal first sentence of experience: body-as-it-was, object, body-as-it-is - simple-organism, acidic-water, organism-fleeing. The answers determine the enacted emotion.

Assessment gathers input from our senses. We have one set of memories for such information. We compose the what from the primal question what is that? We simultaneous retrieve context from our prior experience and innate reflexes to prefigure that. We have a contextual memory to hold this evolving concept.

The Dual Memory Model

  Chris Brewin et al. (2010):3

  

  Evidence from cognitive psychology and neuroscience implies distinct neural bases to abstract, flexible, contextualized representations (C-reps) and to inflexible, sensory-bound representations (S-reps)... [Our] model is used to explain how the different types of distressing visual intrusions associated with clinical disorders arise, in terms of the need for correct interaction between the neural systems supporting S-reps and C-reps.

When an event occurs (our body encounters and object), we pay attention to the object and ask the primal question - what is that? We notice things and take in the salient information. We experience the remembered presence of this event.

At the instance of the encounter, we create two types of representations: sensory-based representations (s-reps) of the things we notice and contextual-based representations of the assumptions we make. When the object is as we expect, the s-rep and the c-rep correspond and there are few distinctions to notice. It fades from our attention.

For example, I turn to stare at the wall as I write. The wall looks (s-rep) as it is supposed to look (c-rep). I continue to stare, thinking about my writing, not about the wall. Core understanding could give rise to qualities such as mind blindness. We could choose to search for novelty amidst prefigured familiarity, but our choice would not reflect qualities of being startled or curious. In fact, such behavior might simply reflect boredom.

When something is not as it supposed to be, we experience novelty, core understanding, and speculative assumptions. Novelty is an s-rep without associated c-rep. Familiar information within prefigured context (the core understanding) is an s-rep matched to a c-rep. Speculative assumptions are c-reps unsupported by the core understanding. The combination of novelty and speculation creates emotional salience.

An event causes body change. We emote. I use the following diagram as a generalized form of body-as-it-was - ▲1, object - ▼1, body-as-it-is - ▲2: ▲▼▲. (For more information, see the discussion of the primal first sentence footnoted below).4 The presence of ▼1 cause a body change (the difference between ▲2 and ▲1).

Our choice of emotion is based the...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I doubt I'll be getting in iPad. I have an iPhone, after all, and I don't see where I would use something like the iPad rather than my laptop. Most of the stuff I need to do with a computer that I can't do on my iPhone requires Microsoft Office and various graphics programs. There just doesn't seem to be a niche in my computing habits that isn't already filled by my laptop or iPhone. That could change as the iPad evolves, but for now this Apple fanboy is going to abstain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I wonder where you get a job like this guy's, where I'd get to blend things just for the hell of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/the_eternal_question_about_the_new_ipad.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/c6u4gVP_Heg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270580437788"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=173446">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d351df4ce8dc1e3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="carbon emissions"/><category term="carbon footprint"/><category term="carpooling"/><category term="joan jett"/><category term="Kristen Stewart"/><category term="one small thing"/><category term="personal carbon footprint"/><category term="The Runaways"/><title type="html">One Small Thing: Finally, Carpooling Is Cool</title><published>2010-04-06T18:29:18Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T18:29:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/one-small-thing-finally-carpooling-is-cool/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share Your Ride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not exactly math whizzes, but taking one car instead of two is a fairly dummy-proof way to lower your carbon footprint. In an ideal world, we’d all be able to take public transportation, buy an electric car, or ditch four wheels altogether for two, but pedaling your kids to school or taking a bus out of town for a weekend getaway isn’t always practical. Carpooling, however, only takes a few minutes of coordination, lowers your carbon footprint, and cuts your gas station bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carpooling might bring to mind petrol pig mommy vans and SUVs, but  whatever your make and model, one car still emits less carbon pollution  than two.&lt;/p&gt;

AoA is one of the homes of the antivaccination movement and gives a lot of time to those who still believe that vaccinations and other &amp;quot;toxins&amp;quot; cause autism.  The site is full of remarkably paranoid rants.  When Chicago Tribune journalist Trine &lt;a href="http://www.healthjournalism.org/about-news-detail.php?id=86"&gt;Tsouderos won an excellence in health care journalism award&lt;/a&gt;, AoA &lt;a href="http://www.healthjournalism.org/about-news-detail.php?id=86"&gt;accused the CDC and Trib of having "bought" the award&lt;/a&gt;. They are boosters of every unproven and implausible "treatment" for autism, such as &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/09/chelation-study.html"&gt;chelation&lt;/a&gt;, hyperbaric oxygen, and &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/04/mercury-testost.html"&gt;chemical castration&lt;/a&gt; through lupron injections.  Recently, they provided a platform to &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/04/statement-from-dr-andrew-wakefield-regarding-gmc-hearing-sanctions.html"&gt;Dr. Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;, the physician who's &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper drawing a link between autism, vaccinations, and gut disorders, was formally withdrawn by the journal&amp;#39;s editors.  Due to accusations of scientific and ethical misconduct, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3941"&gt;he is likely to lose his license to practice medicine&lt;/a&gt; in England.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So it came as no surprise to see one of their writers hyping a study in progress that is testing oral enzymes for the treatment of autism.   In the piece, Theresa Conrick incorrectly implies that the existence of this study is vindication for both the autism-gut hypothesis and for Wakefield&amp;#39;s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;*******&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1998 Dr. Andrew Wakefield published a paper in the prestigious medical journal the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;.  In this study, he claimed that the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine caused observable changes to children&amp;#39;s intestines which eventually lead to autism.  The study led directly to falling vaccination rates in the UK, an increase in vaccine-preventable disease, and helped launch the modern antivaccination movement in North American and Europe.  The study, as it turned out, was &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm"&gt;so fraught with conflicts of interest and poor science&lt;/a&gt; that several of the authors dropped their association with it, and it was eventually withdrawn from the journal.  Wakefield himself was &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8483865.stm"&gt;lambasted by England's General Medical Council&lt;/a&gt; for his unethical behavior associated with the study, and will likely lose his license to practice medicine.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wakefield&amp;#39;s hypothesis about autism and gastrointestinal disease was never terribly plausible to begin with, and despite the retraction of his original study, there persists a belief in many parts of the autism community that the gut is somehow implicated in the development and treatment of autism.  Wakefield still has many zealous adherents and dietary therapies for autism have grown in popularity.  &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/04/02/mccarthy.autsimtreatment/index.html"&gt;Jenny McCarthy attributes much of her purported success&lt;/a&gt; with her child to severe dietary restrictions which she recommends for others.  So far, however, there is no good body of literature supporting any connection between gut disease, diet, and autism.  &lt;a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00881452?term=curemark&amp;amp;rank=1"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; aims to change that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;According to the hyperbolic language of Age of Autism, you would think that the very existence of this study exculpates Wakefield and vindicates all of the pseudo-experts&amp;#39; opinions about the causes of autism.

Neither of these gives a particularly strong foundation for a study of proteases in autism.  Yet another study extensively quotes the work of Andrew Wakefield, the doctor who was censured in England for his unethical work.  But the most interesting study is one done by Wakefield himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/bye/zQoPWw4lZX-i-iSxuBcyeXNxvdDxuQ7Ju6c9cXcHuioyzTp9ai7HSTDxNBciescgm64LD61PSQ7Hc6D65B0LVi7yg67VN6h9Ei4L3BUgWwNG0iY6vQ1gW1-He6oR9RCjER4wSRFt." style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;In this study&lt;/a&gt;, Wakefield reported that he had discovered &amp;quot;new variant of inflammatory bowel disease is present in this group of children with developmental disorders.&amp;quot;  This was a number of years before his famously retracted study in which he blamed the MMR vaccine for autism, the same study for which he was censured.  Before that controversy, a discussion in the journal &lt;em&gt;Histopathology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17257133" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;criticized Wakefield's work&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://neo.beaumont.edu/pubmed/,DanaInfo=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov+17257133" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;practically accused him of lying&lt;/a&gt; about his methodology:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:20px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal;background-repeat:no-repeat repeat"&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;Sir: The histopathology proforma used for scoring of intestinal biopsies in the paper 'Enterocolitis in children with developmental disorders'&lt;a href="https://neo.beaumont.edu/#b1" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Wakefield et al. receives detailed criticism in the Commentary, &amp;#39;Autistic enterocolitis, is it a histopathological entity?&amp;#39;,&lt;a href="https://neo.beaumont.edu/#b2" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by MacDonald and Domizio.

Gannon Jr. who is directing the study for Curemark.  He has decades of experience running clinical trials.  He reported to me that he is aware of the challenges sometimes associated with research into autism treatments and has worked closely with Curemark and the FDA to make sure this phase III trial is done right.  He has been in continuous contact with study sites to make sure they stay on protocol and avoid inappropriate release of preliminary results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;But it would appear he is being hamstrung by Curemark, who is pumping up CM-AT before the phase III results are available.  Their website currently links to a BusinessWeek article about the product:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:20px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal;background-repeat:no-repeat repeat"&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;"One of the most promising treatments in this category is a drug called CM-AT made by a startup called Curemark. Dr. Joan Fallon, the company's founder and CEO, observed that many autistics show a strong preference for foods high in carbohydrates and low in protein. A diagnostic test revealed that some autistic children lack enzymes that digest protein. As a result, these children produce fewer of the essential amino acids that are the building blocks for brain development and neuroreception. Fallon believes this deficiency is linked to the most severe symptoms of autism, and she says&lt;strong&gt; an early observational study of CM-AT, an orally ingested powder that delivers protein-digesting protease, showed &amp;quot;significant improvements.&amp;quot; Curemark is enrolling patients in phase III clinical trials at 10 to 12 site the largest autism trial to date.&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;Where did she get these ideas?  What evidence supports this hypothesis?  Who is &lt;a href="http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/PersonDetail.aspx?PersonID=15616040" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Dr. Joan Fallon?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;First, Fallon is not a doctor; she is a chiropractor.  She is not exactly widely published in the medical literature.  In 2005 she put &lt;a href="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306987704004281" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;a piece in Medical Hypotheses&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306987704004281" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;a controversial journal&lt;/a&gt;, to say the least) in which she &amp;quot;hypothesizes&amp;quot; that the antibiotic Augmentin may be responsible for autism.  She applied for a patent to use the commonly available laxative lactulose to treat autism.  And &lt;a href="http://www.todayschiropractic.com/issues/archives/may_jun_05/feat_004.html" style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;she's promoted the idea&lt;/a&gt; that autism is somehow related to the gut.  None of her ideas really hang together.  Is autism caused by a failure of protein digestion?  By an antibiotic?  By toxic ammonia levels?  Whatever the cause, she seems to be looking for a profitable cure.  I&amp;#39;m not sure that she can patent lactulose, but she apparently found a substance she &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; patent---CM-AT, a proteolytic enzyme in a novel delivery system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;There are a number of things I find disturbing about this study.  While it appears to be well-run, it fails to conform to an important scientific and ethical standard: plausibility.  According to the Helsinki Declaration protecting human research subjects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:20px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal;background-repeat:no-repeat repeat"&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;Fallon and Curemark have not convinced me that there is any science that would justify their study.  It&amp;#39;s certainly reasonable to take some risks based on sound science, but in this case, all that underlies this study is a handful of very questionable studies.  Citing literature to justify your research is not just some bureaucratic hurdle to leap; it is fundamental to the ethical design of clinical trials. There is no reason to expect that delivering an oral protease to children with autism should improve symptoms of autism.  There is no putative mechanism by which this should work, despite the speculations of the chiropractor CEO of the company that makes the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;Given the low plausibility of the hypothesis, even positive results, should they be found, must be interpreted with a high index of suspicion.  The statistics underlying the study of implausible hypotheses tell us that positive results are often due to chance or problems with study design rather than the drug being tested.  This is not an esoteric technical detail.  This is a study being done on child subjects whose parents have been led to believe this treatment may help. There is no reason to believe this is so.  Perhaps some day if there are convincing preliminary studies, the current one would be justified.  At this point, though, it is simply another questionable study built on a foundation of bad science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/bqHA60QL944" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270577867539"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/todays_carnivals_485.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d95588edfcc1ab94</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2010-04-06T19:11:11Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T19:11:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/AShdjM3wqnw/todays_carnivals_485.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/todays_carnivals_485.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circus of the Spineless&lt;/strong&gt; #49 is up on &lt;a href="http://xenogere.com/2010/04/06/circus-of-the-spineless-49-the-uncarnival-edition/" title=""&gt;Xenogere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In a world before Facebook, Twitter, and the big network of local Skeptics in the Pub, for many of us Derek and Swoopy were the only skeptics' community we had, in our ear week after week. Thank you for the steady stream of critical thinking, you two!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I proposed that D.J. and I begin a podcast back in the fall of 2005, it was because I was inspired by Derek and Swoopy and how great &lt;em&gt;Skepticality&lt;/em&gt; was. We were employed at the Center for Inquiry at the time, and not everyone there at first understood the promise of podcasting for skeptical outreach, even if they eventually came around because of our success with Point of Inquiry (D.J. and I ended up doing over 200 episodes of that show with over 6 million downloads during our tenure. Since then I've left CFI to pursue my legal education, and D.J. moved on to head up the JREF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first met Derek and Swoopy back in January of 2006 at a podcasting conference I attended with D.J., and have enjoyed their warmth and friendship since. This was right after Derek's stroke, but I was still impressed with how they brought podcasting to the skeptical world and skepticism to the podcasting world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:3px;border:3px ridge #000000;float:right" alt="keynote" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/swift/keynote.jpg" width="250" height="280"&gt;These two deserve commendation: not only did they start skeptic podcasting with &lt;em&gt;Skepticality&lt;/em&gt;, but they also started a skeptical mini-convention at Dragon*Con, which has gone onto attract many new critical thinkers into the fold. This shows you what just two people who are creative and hard working can do to advance skepticism's agenda; to get people thinking about why they believe what they believe and whether there is good reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggested D.J. have Derek and Swoopy on &lt;em&gt;For Good Reason&lt;/em&gt; this last week and I think you will find the conversation, which runs the gamut from the influence of podcasting on the grassroots skeptical movement, to how much fun iPads are, to be really enjoyable. It can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.forgoodreason.org"&gt;ForGoodReason.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It will dock with ISS tomorrow, April 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, the Orbiter has to play catch up, slowly changing its orbit until it matches the station’s. The thing is, you may be able to watch this unfold! Both the Orbiter and the ISS are easily visible to the unaided eye, and in fact the station is potentially the fourth brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, Moon, and Venus). As they approach each other, you can see them as bright(ish) stars moving rapidly across the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out if they are visible to you by going to a site like &lt;a href="http://www.heavens-above.com"&gt;Heavens-Above&lt;/a&gt;. Enter your latitude and longitude (try Google maps to get that) and it will put you on a page that gives you times, directions, and brightnesses (in magnitudes, so a more negative number is brighter) of a lot of different satellites. Click on &lt;em&gt;ISS&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;STS-131&lt;/em&gt; to get the station or Orbiter times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/573107852/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1011/573107852_833e30c9a3_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All the good passes for the next week in Boulder, for example, are in the early morning. I suspect I’ll miss them. But check your local times and see if you can catch them! It’s an amazing sight. The picture here is one I took myself using nothing more than a digital camera on a tripod — click to embiggen it. It shows a time exposure of &lt;em&gt;Atlantis&lt;/em&gt; and the ISS from 2007, and you can see how they are on very slightly different orbits. The two were separated by a small amount; you can tell by the different end points of the trails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren’t many Shuttle flights left, so get out there and observe this while you can!&lt;/p&gt;

Today we have a look at Chapter Thirteen, “The Life of the Universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If our comoving patch defines an approximately closed system, the next step is to think about its space of states. General relativity tells us that space itself, the stage on which particles and matter move and interact, evolves over time. Because of this, the definition of the space of states becomes more subtle than it would have been in if spacetime were absolute. Most physicists would agree that information is conserved as the universe evolves, but the way that works is quite unclear in a cosmological context. The essential problem is that more and more things can fit into the universe as it expands, so—naively, anyway—it looks as if the space of states is getting bigger. That would be in flagrant contradiction to the usual rules of reversible, information-conserving physics, where the space of states is fixed once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we’ve already looked a bit at the life of the universe, way back in Chapter Three.  The difference is that we’re now focusing on how &lt;em&gt;entropy&lt;/em&gt; evolves, given our hard-acquired understanding of what entropy is and how it works for black holes.  This is where we review Roger Penrose’s well-known-yet-still-widely-ignored argument that the low entropy of the early universe is something that needs to be explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, this is pretty straightforward stuff, following directly from what we’ve already done in the book.  But it’s also somewhat controversial among professional cosmologists.  The reason why can be found in the slightly technical digression that begins on page 292, “Conservation of information in an expanding universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that physicists often think of “the space of states in a region of spacetime” as being equal to “the space of states we can describe by quantum field theory.”  They &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that’s not right, because gravity doesn’t fit into that description, but these are the states they know how to deal with.  This collection of states isn’t fixed; it grows with time as the universe expands.  You will therefore sometimes hear cosmologists talk about the &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; entropy of the early universe, under the misguided assumption that there were fewer states that could “fit” into the universe at that time.  (Equivalently, that gravity can be ignored.)  This approach has, in my opinion anyway, done great damage to how cosmologists think about fine-tuning problems.  One of the major motivations for writing the book was to explain these issues, not only to the general reader but also to my scientist friends.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/04/emptying.jpg" alt="emptying" title="emptying" width="500" height="222"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the chapter I deviate from Penrose’s argument a bit.  He believes that a high-entropy state of the universe would be one that was highly inhomogeneous, full of black holes and white holes and what have you.  I think that’s right &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you are thinking about a very dense configuration of matter.  But matter doesn’t have to be dense — the expansion of the universe can dilute it away.  So I argue that the truly highest-entropy configuration is one where space is essentially empty, with nothing but vacuum energy.  This is also very far from being widely accepted, and certainly relies on a bit of hand-waving.  But again, I think the failure to appreciate this point has distorted how cosmologists think about the problems presented by the early universe.  So hopefully they read this far in the book!&lt;/p&gt;

It's what we do. Why are there Elk on Afognak island? Some guy thought it was a good idea at the time. Wildlife managers in the past were some of the biggest conduits for moving animals around, frequently en mass, back before biology really caught up with the profession. We can cite plenty of examples where moving animals around to do population rescues was a bad thing...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Sabine Vollmer to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sabine Vollmer pic.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Sabine%20Vollmer%20pic.JPG" width="336" height="448" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;I'm a journalist by trade and a thrill seeker by nature. There's nothing more thrilling to me than Eureka! moments, my own and those of others. That's why I chose to study journalism instead of biochemistry, why I left Germany to come to the U.S., why I enjoy reporting more than writing. Writing keeps me sane, but finding out stuff I didn't know keeps me going. In the more than 20 years I worked for newspapers, I covered just about everything: Crime (too emotionally draining), politics (too much hot air), business (too much granularity, not enough color) and science. I got stuck on science about 10 years ago after moving&lt;br&gt;
to North Carolina's Research Triangle and the Eureka! moments keep on coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becoming a science writer was a logical step for me, because I've always been interested in science, particularly in biology and chemistry. I took a heavy load of biochemistry classes in high school (German high school is different from American high school), but selected mass communication as my major at the university in Munich. I have never regretted my decision, because it has allowed me to experience scientific breakthroughs without having to toil in the lab doing experiments over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my expertise is in the life sciences. My sweet spot is where business and research intersect, mainly because those stories dominate in the &lt;a href="http://www.rtp.org/main/" title=""&gt;RTP&lt;/a&gt; area. I moved here to cover biotech, pharma and health care for the &lt;a href="http://triangle.bizjournals.com/triangle/" title=""&gt;Triangle Business Journal&lt;/a&gt; and then switched to the &lt;a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/" title=""&gt;News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/a&gt; to essentially write about the same things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, my job at the N&amp;amp;O got cut in a massive, nationwide McClatchy layoff, which so far has been largely a blessing. Now, I get to focus more on the science than the business angles, I get to mingle with scientists and I have more outlets. In the past year, I met three Nobel Prize laureates, including Ada Yonath, a 2009 winner in chemistry. Compare that to a big, fat 0 in the previous eight years while I was a staff writer with a regular paycheck and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stories are now published on &lt;a href="http://scienceinthetriangle.org/" title=""&gt;Science in the Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, an online publication that tracks research activities in the RTP area, and in the &lt;a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/tags/?tag=+scitech" title=""&gt;Science &amp;amp; Technology pages in the N&amp;amp;O&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/scitech/" title=""&gt;Charlotte Observer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceinthetriangle.org/" title=""&gt;Science in the Triangle&lt;/a&gt; is a current interesting project. Past interesting projects include a story about AZT, the first HIV/AIDS drug that was developed in RTP, and a couple of investigative stories about laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis, or LASIK. The AZT story was a doorway into HIV/AIDS research, a very active area in RTP, and Harvard Medical School picked it up and posted it on its Web site. The LASIK stories have since garnered the interest of a national magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still waiting for the curse part to hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.rtp.org/main/" title=""&gt;RTP&lt;/a&gt; area generates a wealth of research in a number of different disciplines. Until four or five years ago, local media did an adequate job chronicling the activities. But when the bottom fell out in the newspaper industry, the local science coverage started to decline in quality and quantity. I just couldn't bear the thought that all this local knowledge would become largely inaccessible to the general public and that the research silos that exist would become more impenetrable. I couldn't and I can't imagine how that would improve an area I came to appreciate for its intellectual vitality and cultural diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time applying my skills and expertise trying to fill the holes in the local science coverage, generate enough income to help feed and house the family and learn from the mistakes my former employers made and are still making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to make a national name for myself writing about research and development in the RTP area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see a business model for online science writing emerge that values quality content and provides broad access to new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogs come in different flavors. I'm trying to find time to start a personal blog and keep it going. For now, most of my blogging is for &lt;a href="http://scienceinthetriangle.org/blog/" title=""&gt;Science in the Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, where I provide information and analysis rather than opinion. I absolutely love Twitter, because it's fast and insightful if you follow the right people. Basically, I use Twitter like a science wire service, to get ideas and to distribute blog posts. My twitter handle is @SciTri. I'm also on Facebook and LinkedIn. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, but I wouldn't want to be without any of my social networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still discovering them and have yet to form much of an opinion. I do find them very interesting as blueprints of publishing alternatives to the traditional, or "dead-tree" as you call it, media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eureka! moments, of course. It was my first ScienceOnline conference and I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was great. It brought me up-to-date with a world I realized I knew nothing about as a staff writer for the dead-tree media. The networking was particularly fruitful for me. What I hope next year's conference will address more and more specifically is a possible business model for online science writing.

&lt;p&gt;I am a 20 year old student living with my father. He’s a Christian, with very firm beliefs. Recently, he’s been pushing me to join a church. He believes that joining a church would be extremely beneficial to me. However, he doesn’t know I’m agnostic, except for my sister, no one in my family knows. I’ve given him various excuses as to why I don’t want to join a church, but he won’t let it go. Anytime I have a problem, he uses it as an opportunity to push me to  attend church. I’m not sure how he, or any of my other family members would take my lack of faith. I’d been planning on waiting until I was no longer dependent on them to “come out”, but his pressuring me to become a faithful churchgoer is becoming hard to deal with. Is there any way to tell him I’m not interested in going to any church, without explicitly saying I doubt God exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mary,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it it is wise of you to wait until you feel the situation is right for you to come out to your father about your agnosticism.  You have no obligation to tell anyone ever, and certainly not to disclose it when it will complicate things and create far more disharmony and stress for all concerned. Over and over in these family scenes, I’ve seen that the right timing turns out to be much more important than the right words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you want to get your father to stop nagging you to go to a church, but you don’t want to tell him yet that you doubt God exists, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I’m going to assume that you’d rather avoid telling him a flat-out lie, such as, &lt;em&gt;“Oh I’m going to First Church of (blank). It’s several miles away, but so far I like it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat-out lying is a popular option, but I generally avoid advising people to do it.  Lying is demeaning, degrading, demoralizing, and in your case could have serious drawbacks, like having to disappear every Sunday morning and to bring back church pamphlets or whatever if your dad continues to pry or be curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to suggest an alternative that I’m not going to pretend is that far away from lying, but you might not feel as guilty doing it.  There may be quite a lot of truth in it for you, but you will, at least passively, be allowing him to continue to assume that you’re a believer. But what other people assume about your beliefs is not your concern.  As I said, I don’t think any non-believer owes that disclosure to anyone, given the awful things that so often happen.  I see nothing wrong with keeping that private until when it is in your own personal interest to divulge it, if ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell him nature is your church.  Say something like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Dad, churches and all the social stuff that go with them just aren’t for me.  When I’m in a small, crowded building I don’t feel close to God. But when I’m outdoors in nature, I feel close to all of creation, and I feel I’m a part of a much bigger thing.  It’s glorious and inspiring and rejuvenating, and I always come back feeling my spirit is  restored. I’m sure that you don’t think that God can &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; be found inside a church, right?  Churches and congregations are great for those who benefit from them, but they are things of man, and I’m sure that you agree that no things of man can pretend to contain God.  Dad, I love you and I know you want the best for me.  I assure you that I’m taking good care of my body, my mind and my spirit, and going outdoors into nature is doing all of that.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds too pantheist for him, you can assure him that you always take your Bible along with you.  Just keep it in your car or knapsack.  But if he still insists on you going to a church, then I think you’re going to have to take a stand, and gently but firmly say something like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Look Dad, I’m an adult now, and you need to accept that. I have to make my own decisions and find my own way.  You’ve done a wonderful job guiding me and helping me, and I’m very grateful.  And now you have to let me walk my path for myself, being the good, responsible adult that you raised me to be.  Please don’t keep insisting on having this exactly the way you want.  That would be prideful, and I’m sure you don’t want to be doing that.  If you believe that God is in charge, and that God provides everything we need to find and be with him, then you know that no place and no person in the world is out of his reach. This is the way that is right for me at this time in my life, and this is the way I’m going to do it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:315px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/north-rim-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Mary, I suggest that you actually go frequently outdoors into nature, if you don’t already.  It really is good for your body, mind and &lt;em&gt;emotions,&lt;/em&gt; if you substitute that for “spirit.”  There’s a long tradition of thinkers both religious and secular seeking clarity and renewal in nature.  Whether you can go up to the hills, out to the woods, down to the river, or just over to the park, students are seldom the worse for regular doses of sunshine, fresh air and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have some problem and your father uses it as an opportunity to push you to attend church, reframe that parental controlling into a positive suggestion, and thank him for it. Say, &lt;em&gt;“That’s a great idea, Dad. You’re right. Thanks!”&lt;/em&gt;  Then immediately grab your always-handy knapsack which always contains granola bars, bottled water, and a small Bible covering up a copy of “The Demon Haunted World” and head out the door, singing &lt;a href="http://www.boyscouttrail.com/content/song/song-483.asp"&gt;“The Happy Wanderer”&lt;/a&gt;.  This tactic will have the instant benefit of getting you away from his nagging, and you have cleverly framed it as &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; suggestion.  It may also have the more subtle behavior modification effect of gradually getting him to stop harping on it, since every time he does, you’re suddenly gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our society, early adulthood can be a difficult time because young adults usually have their fully developed mental independence, but often not their financial or physical independence.  Parents teach their children how to grow up to be adults, but often those grown up children then have to teach their parents how to stop being parents, and shift to adult-to-adult relating.  It can sometimes take as much love and patience for a young adult to guide a middle aged parent as it does for a young parent to guide a small child.&lt;/p&gt;

Small children were raped, entire villages are decimated by mental health trauma and suicides brought on by these monsters, and in one particularly appalling instance, a priest was caught raping a dying woman he was supposed to give the last rites. There&amp;#39;s also an interview with a former priest who was a &amp;quot;cleaner&amp;quot; (yes, he actually calls himself that), brought in to tidy up the messes these evil men brought into a community…before they got shipped off to another community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer concentration of known sex offenders in these isolated communities begins to look less like an accident than a plan. Their institutional protection looks less like an embarrassed cover-up than aiding and abetting. And the way the church has settled case after case across the country, refusing to let most of them go to trial for a public airing, is starting to look like an admission of guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the reason why the church covers up for rapist priests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does the church keep sending these priests, who have come to be such a major liability, back into ministry? "It's all about keeping the stores open, keeping the revenue rolling," Wall says. The Alaskan provinces in particular, Wall says, were a source of revenue--not from the Native population living there, but from parishioners in the lower 48 who were encouraged to donate for the Native ministry up north. "You could raise thousands to fund a mission that cost very little to run," Wall says. "The profit margin is huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story makes 1950s Ireland look like a paradise of blissful religious sanctity. It is not for the squeamish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd rather read something a little more encouraging, read &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/ct-oped-0405-pollitt-20100405,0,6555871.story"&gt;Katha Politt on priestly pedophilia&lt;/a&gt;. She nails the priesthood on their sanctimony and hypocrisy, and their pretense to a moral superiority that is so patently betrayed. She also mentions this surprising story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Bishop Margot Kaessmann, the first woman to head the German Protestant Church and a much-admired public figure, was caught running a red light while intoxicated. There was a lot of sympathy for her, even in the conservative media, which disagreed with her liberal and anti-war views, and she received the support of the church's governing body. Nonetheless, within four days Kaessmann resigned, saying her moral authority had been so compromised she could no longer do right by her high office. Maybe Pope Benedict and his bishops could learn something from her example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? A Protestant bishop &lt;i&gt;resigns&lt;/i&gt; for the crime of running a red light under the influence? She got a &lt;i&gt;traffic ticket&lt;/i&gt; and felt her moral authority was compromised? I mean, that's a bit excessive, but OK, at least she's taking religion's claims of morality extremely seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Pope heads a Catholic office that was sheltering child-rapers, and the entire Catholic hierarchy is busily claiming the martyrdom of Christ for itself because people have started to complain about their intrusive little penises. They aren't even trying for the moral flood plain, let alone the moral high ground. It's more like they're taking a dive in the Marianas Trench of turpitude while pretending to climb the Everest of propriety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we can&amp;#39;t expect the church to expire in shame, at least we should start regarding Catholicism as a Mafia-like criminal organization…and maybe our governments should stop treating with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/how_bad_can_a_catholic_priest.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/_RgGfcHGaB8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270567304228"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/for_the_apple_haters.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b4d59652b22c20f2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">For the Apple haters</title><published>2010-04-06T14:57:54Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T14:57:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/BVJHGYKfKfM/for_the_apple_haters.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/for_the_apple_haters.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/lAl28d6tbko%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=248" width="425" height="248"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 7, 2009 the embargo expired, and my and Stefan’s joint paper &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/51/21527.full.pdf"&gt;‘Global sea level linked to global temperature’&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the Proceedings of the U.S.  National Academy of Sciences. It had been a long time coming! But this post is not so much about the science as about the process, and about how a &lt;a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Vermessung_der_Welt"&gt;geodesist&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~eisaksso/nordstrom/nordstrom.html"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; and an oceanographer from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Tower"&gt;Potsdam&lt;/a&gt;, who to this day have never even met, came to write, to the surprise of both of us, a joint paper on sea level rise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own entry into climatology happened only a few years ago. A significant trigger was RealClimate, which I had learned to appreciate as one of the rare reliable Internet sources amidst the junk. Contributing to the oft-slandered science is my small ‘thank you’ and revenge as a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I remember, it was the commenter calling himself Rod B. who enquired, sometime August 2008, what the story really was with &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Nature/rahmstorf_science_2007.pdf"&gt;Rahmstorf (2007)&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to answer, I ended up reading the paper and getting interested. What seduced me was the simplicity of this, so-called semi-empirical approach: linear regression of sea level rise &lt;em&gt;dH&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;dt&lt;/em&gt; against temperature &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, yielding two unknown parameters: a regression coefficient &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, and an intercept, or ‘equilibrium temperature’, &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. See our &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/08/ups-and-downs-of-sea-level-projections/"&gt;Ups and downs of sea level projections&lt;/a&gt; for a more detailed explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curve of temperature as a function of time over the 20th century has three parts: a steep rise in the beginning, a flat middle part commonly attributed to aerosols, and a very steep upswing at the end. Physically one would expect for the curve of the sea level rise rate dH/dt as a function of time to look rather similar, as indeed it does: this justifies the Rahmstorf (2007) approach of regressing the one against the other. Looking more carefully however one sees that the &lt;em&gt;dH&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;dt&lt;/em&gt; curve has slightly more of an S-like shape, turning downward in the middle, before swinging up again at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggested to me that, in addition to a proportionality to temperature &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, sea level rise would also contain a term proportional to the time derivative of temperature, &lt;em&gt;dT&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;dt&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, global sea level would be a good global thermometer, but with a ‘quirk’. I could even think of a physical mechanism for such behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted Dr. Rahmstorf, proposing the idea: one would expect the ocean surface to warm up rapidly to completion, contrary to the deep ocean and the continental ice sheets. This would argue for a term, in addition to the secular &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) term, of form &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;dT&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;dt&lt;/em&gt;. Stefan’s response was cautious; not surprising, as being something of a media figure in Germany surely means that he has to contend with his share of cranks. But he suggested I look myself into the idea, which I subsequently did: in for a penny, in for a pound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded Stefan’s script, modified it, did the first computations with the same real tide gauge and temperature data Stefan had used — surprise: negative &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;. Hmmm, strange. That was for real data from the real Earth; what would happen if I applied the extended relationship to simulated data from the same &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/11/faq-on-climate-models/"&gt;general circulation model&lt;/a&gt; (actually, an &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~anders/publications/montoya_griesel05.pdf"&gt;Earth system model&lt;/a&gt;) for the period 1900-2100 that Stefan had used in his paper for testing his relationship? This model was in one essential way very much simpler than reality: it completely lacked the contribution of land ice melting to sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan helpfully sent me Matlab snippets and model output, and indeed I got it all working. What was more, the disagreement found by Stefan for the late 21st Century — between sea level rise as predicted directly by the model, and indirectly through the semi-empirical relationship between temperature and sea level rise — went almost completely away when using the new, extended relationship. With a positive value for &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, just as expected from theory for an ocean surface water response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right" width="50%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/vermeer_fig3.jpg" width="90%" align="center"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size="-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global sea level against time. Top, sea level rise, bottom, sea level itself. Red, sea level from observations; blue, with uncertainty band, the fit from global temperatures using our new relationship; black, the fit using Stefan’s original relationship. The thin red wiggly curve shows annual sea level values.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;font size="-1"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was encouraging, but what again about the real data? Remember that this is real observational data from tide gauges, &lt;a href="http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/en/altimetry/principle/index.html"&gt;altimetric satellites&lt;/a&gt; and meteorological stations, warts and all, with a very imperfect spatial sampling both for the &lt;a href="http://sealevel.colorado.edu/tidegauges.php"&gt;tide gauge&lt;/a&gt; data and for the &lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/"&gt;surface temperature&lt;/a&gt; data. Nothing like the clean, formally perfect model output of truly global mean surface temperature and sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point I was about to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered however Stefan mentioning a ‘reservoir correction’ and  decided to see if that made a difference. It was not hard to find &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/320/5873/212.pdf"&gt;Chao et al. (2008)&lt;/a&gt;, who had painstakingly compiled a list of all man-made reservoirs the world over, and the amount of water stored in them. I fitted a simple arctan function through their water storage curve and added that to Stefan’s already extended script. All that water, up to 30 mm sea level equivalent, that should have been in the ocean was progressively kept bottled up on land as dams were being built: a known correction that should be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Introducing the &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; term had already improved the Pearson correlation &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; of fit from 90% for Stefan’s original relationship to 97%; nice, but hardly on its own compelling. Bringing in the Chao et al. man-made reservoir correction brought it up to 99.2%! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly it dawned upon me that, hey, maybe I’m on to something real here, something based in physics: it seems the world ocean can be a remarkably good global thermometer, once you get to know its quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/thermo.png" width="200"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size="-1"&gt;The world ocean, a pretty good global thermometer (drawn using&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan relates the &lt;a href="http://blogs.dw-world.de/forschertagebuch/rahmstorf/1.8630.html"&gt;moment&lt;/a&gt; when he realized that I had something worth publishing: January 16, when he saw the results of the ‘millennium run’ that I had done on the data he had sent me. All of the volcanic explosions over the last thousand years, which were translated first into top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing and then turned into sea water thermal contraction and a drop in modeled sea level, were faithfully reproduced in the sea levels obtained from the model temperatures by my new relationship! A beautiful performance on what are large, rapid and erratically occurring excursions in both global temperature and sea level. And that’s how Stefan came on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the small number of independent data points we needed to make sure we were not ‘&lt;a href="http://cmm.cit.nih.gov/~hassan/dyson.pdf"&gt;fitting an elephant&lt;/a&gt;‘, so I read up on statistics during winter 2008/2009, and in particular, information theoretical methods like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion"&gt;Akaike Information Criterion&lt;/a&gt;. The model intercomparison was useful for just that. I’m not the only one studying these ideas, and I learnt a lot from &lt;a href="http://tamino.wordpress.com"&gt;tamino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://julesandjames.blogspot.com"&gt;James Annan’s Empty Blog&lt;/a&gt;.  Jaynes (2003) was also on my 2009 Christmas reading list; Hypothesis testing, null and alternative hypotheses, confidence bounds and all that, is a traditional approach to statistics that is &lt;a href="http://www.colostate.edu/Dept/coopunit/pdfs/PDF%20of%20t_test_ANOVA_%20with%20I-T_final.pdf"&gt;easily misunderstood&lt;/a&gt; and often &lt;a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/57091/title/Odds_Are,_Its_Wrong"&gt;misused&lt;/a&gt;. Statistical refutations of “silly null” hypotheses abound — like the silly null of no relationship between temperature and sea level rise. If this sounds all cryptic to you, I don’t blame you. Pick up Jaynes (2003), it’s an eye-opener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his contribution, Stefan tightened up the draft paper to be suitable for submission to &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;gave us some very helpful reviews which we used to further improve our manuscript. The most useful reviewer remark had to do with the extraction of water from underground aquifers, a process potentially almost as important as the artificial reservoir storage that we did take into account — only, nowhere in the literature was there an equally painstaking accounting exercise to be found as what Ben Chao and colleagues did for the reservoirs. So, we settled for a sensitivity analysis, skillfully whipped up by Stefan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;turned us down, like they do over 90% of manuscripts; had they accepted, the paper would have been out already in summer. We resubmitted to &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; who obtained three further helpful reviews, the paper was improved yet again and finally published in December. As it happens, this landed it right on top of the Copenhagen meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan &lt;a href="http://blogs.dw-world.de/forschertagebuch/rahmstorf/1.8630.html"&gt;tells&lt;/a&gt; me that we have exchanged over a thousand emails in the run-up to this paper. I see some poetry in that number being close to that of the East Anglia stolen email selection. Easy, informal email plays a vital role in the work of climatologists, and the loss of trust in its confidentiality could be very disruptive for the science: if the internal discussions of an authoring team would have to be expressed with the same care as the finished product, not a lot of authoring would get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I have &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/12/22/what-if-anything-can-skeptics-say-about-science/"&gt;dared&lt;/a&gt;, or managed successfully, to submit to a top journal all on my own? Hardly. It is an illusion to think that you can just enter a field that’s not your own and become a productive researcher, whatever you might read or what &lt;a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/?p=1001"&gt;denialists-of-service&lt;/a&gt; may pretend. There is a lot of &lt;a href="http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/5919/acomicstripaboutglobalw.jpg"&gt;domain knowledge&lt;/a&gt; involved, and precious little of it is simple. In this case, I did learn a lot (and I continue to do so), but this takes both a willingness to learn, and great teachers. RealClimate, and the community it represents, are an indispensable resource for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still waiting for Al Gore’s cheque…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.s.&lt;/strong&gt; Over at &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;Stefan has a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/climate/2010/1004/full/climate.2010.29.html"&gt;commentary on sea level &lt;/a&gt;today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I wrote a response to a graduate student who was told in her teaching evaluations that she needed to smile more. Zuska has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2010/04/smile_boys_it_would_make_the_w.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=channellink"&gt;taken a look&lt;/a&gt; at the issue of women being told to smile by men. It's an interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made me think about the number of times I have been told in a professional setting that I have a nice smile. I don&amp;#39;t think I have ever been told that I have a nice smile by a woman.   Then again, I am generally a smiler and when I am not smiling, there usually is something wrong.  I&amp;#39;m not sure that I have ever been told that I needed to smile at work, but I have been asked why I wasn&amp;#39;t smiling.  I have certainly been told out in public that I needed to smile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go read Zuska before I blather any more.  And make sure that you do it with a smile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/04/remember_all_that_stuff_about.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/cR2Bs5b5i84" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270566618777"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=31081">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6adf8575e2ec213b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Comedy"/><title type="html">We've Finally Made the Big Time</title><published>2010-04-06T14:30:58Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T14:30:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/P34trmnbDCA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/weve-finally-made-the-big-time/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The Onion makes fun of Freakonomics.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/P34trmnbDCA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By STEVEN D.

I happened to catch a few minutes of her show while on the road the other day, and although it made my blood boil, I watched the entire segment, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/36155851#36155851"&gt;which is now online&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size:11px;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:#999999;margin-top:5px;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;text-align:center;width:420px"&gt;Visit msnbc.com for &lt;a style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999999!important;font-weight:normal!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com"&gt;breaking news&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999999!important;font-weight:normal!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507"&gt;world news&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999999!important;font-weight:normal!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072"&gt;news about the economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her segment, Ms. Maddow talks about the out-and-out lying being done by so many right-wing media outlets, in this case about ACORN and Climategate. As I have been saying many times, the far right in this country have been beating the pulpit to a bloody mess with their distortions and noise-making. They will do or say just about anything to distract people from the real issues. As long as people are scared to death by this noise, they won’t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about issues, they’ll &lt;em&gt;react&lt;/em&gt; to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Elizabeth Kolbert — gotta love that name — &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2010/04/12/100412taco_talk_kolbert"&gt;has an article in The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; on a similar theme, saying how the sturm und drang over Climategate is much ado about nothing, an overtrumped, overhyped, and breathlessly hyperbolied mountain crafted entirely out of molehills. I have said &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/30/the-global-warming-emails-non-event/"&gt;exactly that&lt;/a&gt; myself. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/12/04/global-warming-emails-followup/"&gt;Twice&lt;/a&gt;. And as I expected when I posted those articles, there was a huge amount of noise, but the points I was making — the ones I was actually making, and not the ones denialists tried play up — still stand. The hacked emails did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; show widespread conspiracy by climatologists, and in fact a parliamentary committee that convened to investigate the hacked emails &lt;a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2010/2010-03-31-02.html"&gt;cleared scientists of all wrongdoing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note that the far right doesn’t own the copyright on this; the far left has its share of antireality. The alternative medicine movement is a fine example of this. But the right is the one currently making the most noise. I agree with some of the basic tenets of Republicanism — I’d prefer a small government over a bloated bureaucracy, and I believe in fiscal responsibility — but the GOP as it stands now is a far cry from the roots of its party. I think the unholy  (so to speak) alliance it curried with fundamental religion a few decades ago has led it to the antireality stance it has today. And either way, and from whatever direction, the noise machines are in full swing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this over and over again, and it will continue for as long as the media allow it, and we allow the media to allow it. I’m really glad Ms. Maddow and The New Yorker called them out on it. The blogosphere does what it can, but until the main stream media take this issue on, I fear that most people won’t see the man behind the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global warming &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; real. Evolution &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; real. Vaccines do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; cause autism. Homeopathy &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t&lt;/strong&gt; work. These are facts, and they don’t care whether or not denialists spin, fold, and mutilate them. Until we face up to reality, however, they will spin, fold, and mutilate us.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal was to create a stable democratic state that could offer security to its citizens and promote the rights and values that we cherish in Western democracies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We aren't any closer to achieving that goal than we were ten years ago. Should Canadian forces remain in Afghanistan after 2011? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two main options ....&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. cut and run (withdraw all military forces)&lt;br&gt;2. soldier on, perhaps with no combat troops&lt;/blockquote&gt;I favor option #1. We've given it our best shot and it's time to admit defeat. Afghanistan is not going to become a respectable member of the world's democratic community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My resolve was strengthened by a hard-hitting article in last week's issue of &lt;i&gt;Newsweek&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/235221"&gt;The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;America has spent more than $6 billion since 2002 in an effort to create an effective Afghan police force, buying weapons, building police academies, and hiring defense contractors to train the recruits—but the program has been a disaster. More than $322 million worth of invoices for police training were approved even though the funds were poorly accounted for, according to a government audit, and fewer than 12 percent of the country's police units are capable of operating on their own. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the State Department's top representative in the region, has publicly called the Afghan police "an inadequate organization, riddled with corruption." During the Obama administration's review of Afghanistan policy last year, "this issue received more attention than any other except for the question of U.S. troop levels," Holbrooke later told NEWSWEEK. "We drilled down deep into this."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst of it is that the police are central to Washington's plans for getting out of Afghanistan. The U.S.-backed government in Kabul will never have popular support if it can't keep people safe in their own homes and streets. Yet in a United Nations poll last fall, more than half the Afghan respondents said the police are corrupt. Police commanders have been implicated in drug trafficking, and when U.S. Marines moved into the town of Aynak last summer, villagers accused the local police force of extortion, assault, and rape.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It&amp;#39;s time to leave—the sooner the better. The people of Afghanistan have to want change bad enough to fight for it and that&amp;#39;s ain&amp;#39;t happening.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Photo Credit: &lt;a href="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/canada-purchases-200m-in-equipment-for-operation-archer-in-afghanistan-01564/"&gt;Defense Industry Daily&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Hat Tip: &lt;a href="http://canadiancynic.blogspot.com/2010/04/so-hows-that-afghan-police-training.html"&gt;Canadian Cynic&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-6730203160852772211?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270561326233"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=7709">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6c0b98ed5b3cc7e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="science of kissing"/><category term="Sheril Kirshenbaum"/><category term="The Science of Kissing"/><title type="html">The Science of Kissing COVER!</title><published>2010-04-06T13:41:57Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T13:41:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/04/06/the-science-of-kissing-cover/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">So what do you think?! 
The Science of Kissing will be out next January and is already available for pre-order on Amazon. Here's the description:

From a noted science journalist comes a wonderfully witty and fascinating exploration of how and why we kiss.

When did humans begin to kiss? Why is kissing integral to some cultures and alien to others? Do good kissers make the best lovers? And is that expensive lip-plumping gloss worth it? Sheril Kirshenbaum, a biologist and science journalist, tackles these questions and more in THE SCIENCE OF KISSING. It's everything you always wanted to know about kissing but either haven't asked, couldn't find out, or didn't realize you should understand. The book is informed by the latest studies and theories, but Kirshenbaum's engaging voice gives the information a light touch. Topics range from the kind of kissing men like to do (as distinct from women) to what animals can teach us about the kiss to whether or not the true art of kissing was lost sometime in the Dark Ages. Drawing upon classical history, evolutionary biology, psychology, popular culture, and more, Kirshenbaum's winning book will appeal to romantics and armchair scientists alike.&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F04%2F06%2Fthe-science-of-kissing-cover%2F" width="100%" height="60" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270561153187"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_writing_fo_3.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/52f8a19a36c714d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SO'10"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline2010 - Writing for more than glory: Proposals and Pitches that Pay (video) - Part 4</title><published>2010-04-06T14:30:16Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T14:30:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/M6jb2J50G_M/scienceonline2010_-_writing_fo_3.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_writing_fo_3.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: What is a sellable idea? How do you develop one? Is your idea enough for a book, is there more you can do to develop it, or should it just be a magazine article or series of blog posts? This will be a hands-on nuts and bolts workshop: Come with ideas to pitch. Better yet, bring a &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; (1 page or less) written proposal to read and workshop. This workshop will provide handouts on proposal writing as well as sample proposals you can use to help develop your own in the future. Useful for anyone hoping to someday write for print or online publications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_writing_fo_3.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/M6jb2J50G_M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270559717397"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13241">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e494e5641b564e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 4.6</title><published>2010-04-06T13:15:15Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T13:15:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/04/skepchick-quickies-4-6/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

This will probably remain the case forever, and rightly so because it’s a game of words. It’s an initialism because it doesn’t create a word, unlike an acronym, such as NATO. No dilemma in Scrabble though, because NATO is a name. Names, brands and other proper nouns are not allowed in Scrabble. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Because there are a gazillion of them and so they’re unverifiable in a standard dictionary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Because almost anything can become a name. See the game &lt;a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/"&gt;VVVVVV&lt;/a&gt; for an example. Not that you have enough V’s in Scrabble for that, but you get my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, today Scrabble has announced that in future versions of the games, the&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8604625.stm"&gt; rule sheet will allow proper nouns&lt;/a&gt;, names and brands. Their excuse is that it will “add a new dimension, blah blah popular culture blah” which is marketing-speak for “help, no-one is buying our game any more”. Well fine, it’s your game, you can do what you want. Change the rules all you like, it’s not your problem that the younger generation have vocabularies limited to ‘McD’ and ‘P Diddy’ – cause that’s the message I’m getting here. Hey kids, sorry you don’t know any words, just use the brands you’re exposed to every day, that’ll present less of a challenge! I find it insulting to kids and a prime example of ‘dumbing down’, a phrase I generally avoid along with ‘political correctness gone mad’ but in this case apt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my house, as a kid, Scrabble was a huge challenge, and increasing my vocabulary was not just a motivation for beating my opponents, but a direct result of playing against those who knew more words than I. I tried cheating by grabbing the dictionary to pretend I was checking a word, when in reality I was searching for words which fit the tiles I had. I can clearly remember my parents looking askance at the six-year-old me and asking if I actually knew what ORGASM meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is quite simple: just stick to the old rules, and if your opponent tries to put down ‘KFC’, make them eat their own tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETA: I have refined the original to reflect the entirety of the new rules and correct my mistype of ‘proper noun’ for ‘pronoun’, ironically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETA2: There’s always the chance this is a cynical marketing ploy by Scrabble and they will pretend to bow under public pressure, basking in the glory of all the free press coverage and blog outrage. If that’s the case, GTFO, Scrabble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETA3: Looks like ETA2 is half right.

But sometimes the worst comes from people who are on my side, like this message that really ruined my breakfast. It&amp;#39;s from a Catholic anti-choice site, full of prim certainties about gods and babies and your reproductive organs, and it has this…this…&lt;a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/vonhildebrandletter.htm"&gt;&lt;i&gt;letter&lt;/i&gt; to a young girl&lt;/a&gt;, written by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_von_Hildebrand"&gt;Alice von Hildebrand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to hurtle back and forth from hilarity to revulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us take off our "secular" eyeglasses, and then we shall be able to see that women, far from being "discriminated" against, are in many ways privileged. And this is the "secret" I wish to share with you. The body of every little girl born into this world is mysteriously sealed by what is properly called the "veil of virginity". That is to say, a "secret" is entrusted to her body, and a secret is always "veiled". According to Christian teaching, this veil closes the entrance to a mysterious garden which belongs to God in a special way, and for this reason cannot be entered into except with His express permission, the permission that God grants spouses in the Sacrament of Matrimony. Any little girl aware of this "mystery" will feel that her body is to be modestly clothed, so that its secret will be hidden from lewd looks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Little girls, of course, grow up. How beautiful when a bride can say to her husband on their wedding night, "I have kept this garden virginal for you, and now, with God's permission I am giving you its key, knowing that you will enter into it with reverence".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Moreover, when a wife conceives a few hours after her husband has embraced her, God creates the child's soul in her body, (as you certainly know, neither husband nor wife can produce the human soul; God alone can create it.) In other words, there is a personal "contact" between God and the woman which, once again, gives to the female body a note of sacredness. Don't forget that He whom the whole universe cannot contain, was "hidden" in the womb of the Holy Virgin for nine months. Once you realize this, you will be awe-filled for the double mystery that God has confided to you: to conceive a human being made to God's image and likeness, and to give birth to it in pain and anguish. Do not forget that it was also in pain and anguish that Christ re-opened for us the gates of paradise - which had been shut by sin. To women has been granted the awesome privilege of nobly suffering so that a new human being, made to God's image and likeness, might come into the world. Meditate upon this for a moment, and you will feel a deep reverence for your body. It belongs to God, and is not a "play thing" that you can dispose of as you please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. In  a few short paragraphs, she&amp;#39;s managed to promote the cult of virginity, insist on magical ensoulment at the instant of conception, belittle the struggle for equality of women, glorify pain, and imply that anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t follow Catholic dogma is throwing away their body…and she does it with a kind of Victorian smugness that alone is rather off-putting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I'll go take a shower now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/ladies_you_have_a_mysterious_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/CT4nnTkdBIA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270559327359"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BloggingForBacteriophages/~3/Aad8aw2nwdY/speculation-surrounding-sporulation-in.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/acd71b5699566490</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Speculation Surrounding Sporulation in the Mycobacteria</title><published>2010-04-06T08:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T08:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/4x3J9E18kkU/speculation-surrounding-sporulation-in.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BloggingForBacteriophages/~3/Aad8aw2nwdY/speculation-surrounding-sporulation-in.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">by TimThe Mycobacteria are quite the unique genus; not quite Gram-positive due to their waxy mycolic acids on their outer surface, but certainly not Gram-negative as they do not have an outer lipid bilayer. (Although, there are some interesting micrographs showing a structural feature that does look a lot like a typical Gram-negative outer membrane on the surface of Mycobacteria.) Much slower growing than the average bacteria studied in the lab and not so easily manipulated genetically (though see here and here for some recent advances), studying this important group of pathogens challenges a researcher&amp;#39;s patience for results. (Imagine waiting a month or more for a colony to grow to see if a simple transformation was successful!)Neveretheless, the study of these bacteria is vital as the Mycobacteria represent one of the largest, global public health concerns. Over 1/3 of the world&amp;#39;s population is thought to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and a growing percentage of this population is exceedingly drug resistant. During infection, the bacterial population often enters a latent state, making antibiotic treatment (and diagnosis) difficult.In an effort to study this latent phase, a research group happened upon what appeared to be textbook endospores in very late stationary phase cultures of Mycobacterium marinum, a common model for acute Mycobacteria infection. As they closely examined cell morphology over long periods of time (2 months), they began to see forespore formation, and subsequent endospores. Utilizing TEM, the distinct outer coat and cortex of the spores could be identified in the M. marinum population.These researchers analyzed rRNA from the sporulating cells and identified it as M. marinum, ruling out contamination issues. Also, they demonstrated heat tolerance, malachite green staining, and the presence of dipicolinic acid an important compound necessary for heat resistance in most spore-forming species. Furthermore, their bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of homologs of genes utilized in sporulation within the M. marinum genome. Taken all together, the authors hypothesize that M. marinum forms spores, and posit that these spores may be how Mycobacteria stay dormant in a host.However, here is where the speculation steps in...A group of rather prominent US labs in the field attempted to replicate M. marinum sporulation in their labs, and were unable to demonstrate sporulation by any of the methods used by the original researchers. Furthermore, in an attempt to see if spores were present during latent M. marinum infection as the original authors postulated, they attempted to isolate heat resistant cells from infected frogs. Although they could recover Bacillus spores from spiked tissue samples, they could never isolate M. marinum.Additionally, the authors demonstrate that the majority of the genes picked out by the original researchers as being sporulation homologs in Mycobacteria, are actually rather universal Gram-positive genes, with homologs present in a wide variety of species, without being used for sporulation. Some of these genes identified by the original group are also not necessary for sporulation, even in Bacillus sp. Finally, neither group of researchers could identify a group of coat proteins, in M. marinum, that are necessary for spore formation in Bacillus.The lack of this set of coat proteins could be explained by the hypothesis that M. marinum forms its coat differently. This would be a fine rationale, however the spores the original researchers imaged looked identical to those found in B. subtilis. This is of note, particularly because even within the Bacillus genus (with similar coat proteins), spores between species are highly dissimilar.With this set of data, the second set of researchers conclude that M. marinum does not form spores, and that the simplest solution is that the original authors were looking at Bacillus sp. spores, and not those of M. marinum.Looking at these two articles, what do you think?

&lt;p&gt;I recently switched from a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/05/tech_note_samsung_sghi780_smar.php"&gt;2008 smartphone&lt;/a&gt; running Windows Mobile to a &lt;a href="http://www.phonearena.com/htmls/Samsung-Galaxy-Spica-i5700-Review-review-r_2310.html"&gt;Samsung i5700 Galaxy Spica&lt;/a&gt; that runs the open-source operating system Android put out by Google. Here are some impressions after two weeks of use.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really miss the old phone's hardware keyboard. Typing on the touch screen is slow and error-prone, especially since the Swedish layout has to cram in three extra keys. And for some reason the Swedish dictionary never makes any word suggestions. What's up with that?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is so much prettier under Android than under the 2008 version of Windows Mobile.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web browser finally works equally well as desktop software. Among other things, it will allow me to &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/06/treeblogging.html"&gt;blog from a tree-top&lt;/a&gt; in the woods again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love the ease of finding, downloading and installing new software under Android.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Spica offers a respectable maximum volume on its audio output, which is a big improvement over my old phone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally I can use the GPS to find my way around and for geocaching (&lt;a href="http://www.cacheopedia.com/wiki/GeoBeagle"&gt;Geobeagle&lt;/a&gt;!) without paying for an on-line map service. Google Maps piped straight into my handset for free, yay!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Listen is a really slick podcatching client. Sadly one of my favourite podcasts, &lt;a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radio Lab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, hasn't made sure that its feed works there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can't get the dedicated Gmail client to work, but the generic e-mail client works well for that purpose too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "PC Studio" Windows software intended to allow USB cable communication with the handset is ugly and bloated and I can't get it to work. All I want is for the phone to act like a USB memory stick, OK? Can anybody suggest a good alternative for Linux?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to get the SD memory chip out of the Spica you have to open the case. Poor design.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question: I have a html file on my SD card. How do I make it my web browser's starting page?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[More blog entries about &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/smartphone" rel="tag"&gt;smartphone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/samsung" rel="tag"&gt;samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/android" rel="tag"&gt;android&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/samsunggalaxyspica" rel="tag"&gt;samsunggalaxyspica&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://bloggar.se/om/android" rel="tag"&gt;android&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bloggar.se/om/smartphone" rel="tag"&gt;smartphone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bloggar.se/om/samsung" rel="tag"&gt;samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bloggar.se/om/samsunggalaxyspica" rel="tag"&gt;samsunggalaxyspica&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You knew he couldn't stay gone for long, I'm sure. He's just like the zombie who rises again just as the hero turns his back, thinking the zombie dead, or the blond terrorist in &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;/em&gt; who appeared to have met his end hanging from a chain only to appear later in the movie, just when it looks as though it's all over and Bruce Willis has triumphed, to try to take a shot at him. That's right. I'm referring to the anti-vaccine quack whose &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/surprise_surprise_andrew_wakefield_was_p.php"&gt;trial lawyer-funded&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/the_autism_omnibus_the_difference_betwee.php"&gt;incompetent&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/why_am_i_not_surprised_it_looks_as_thoug.php"&gt;probably fraudulent&lt;/a&gt; research &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/the_anti-vaccine_biomed_movement_hijacking.php"&gt;launched a thousand autism quacks&lt;/a&gt; looking to "cure" &lt;strike&gt;autism&lt;/strike&gt; "vaccine injury."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep. Andy Wakefield's back, a mere month and a half after his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/andrew_wakefield_pushed_out_by_the_board.php"&gt;ignominious departure&lt;/a&gt; from Thoughtful House at the hands of its board of directors, led, ironically enough, by the heiress of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson pharmaceutical fortune who helped found that den of quackery with Wakefield. Before that, the General Medical Council (the U.K.&amp;#39;s equivalent to a state medical board, only for the whole country) &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/solved/solved.htm"&gt;had found proved three dozen charges against Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;,  including four counts of dishonesty and 12 counts involving the abuse of developmentally-challenged children; 11 counts of "high risk" research performed without ethical approval; 9 counts of carrying out research that was contrary to the children's clinical interests; three counts of having children undergo lumbar punctures that were not clinically indicated; and three of Wakefield ordering medical tests without the necessary qualifications to do so and in breach of his non-clinical employment contract. In spite of all these damning findings, you didn't think Wakefield would stay gone for very long, did you? It hasn't yet become clear what new woo he's ultimately going to end up doing, although I have no doubt it will be every bit as harmful as the anti-vaccine woo he's engaged in since 1998. It has, however, become clear that Wakefield is really, really good at playing the martyr, as &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/04/statement-from-dr-andrew-wakefield-regarding-gmc-hearing-sanctions.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;this statement by him&lt;/a&gt; posted on that den of anti-vaccine iniquity Age of Autism demonstrates. His first whine makes the fallacious argument that, just because no parent has complained about him, the General Medical Council of Britain must be "persecuting" him for another reason other than enforcing the law:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/someone_didnt_nail_the_coffin_shut_andre.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/someone_didnt_nail_the_coffin_shut_andre.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/f_FgAGLigNg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270556426631"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1817">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c8179feaefdd094b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="stem cells"/><category term="stroke"/><title type="html">Bad Reporting about Stem Cell Treatments for Stroke</title><published>2010-04-06T12:19:02Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T12:19:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1817" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michele Mandel, writing for CNews (a Canadian outlet) is responsible for one of the &lt;a href="http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2010/04/03/13456206-qmi.html"&gt;worst examples of science and health news reporting I have ever seen&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly she is at the top of my list so far for the worst reporting of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tells the story of Alda Byers, a 52 year old woman who suffered a brainstem stroke and is now locked-in – a syndrome in which she is conscious but mostly paralyzed and can only blink her eyes. This is a devastating neurological condition, and I fully understand the desperation of her family in seeking a cure. Unfortunately, currently there isn’t one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are living in the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=254"&gt;golden age of quackery&lt;/a&gt;, where a global market of false hope is peddled over the internet. And so Byers’ family found a stem cell clinic in Mexico willing to treat her stroke with a stem cell transplantation. Mandel does not name this mystery clinic in Mexico, or the doctor who runs it or who treated Byers. We learn no details about the treatment except that it was “stem cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is actually fairly predictable from that point – the family raised the money necessary to take Byers to Mexico and receive the treatment (we are not told how much it cost but these clinics typically charge tens of thousands of dollars). After receiving the treatment the family was convinced that Byers improved, reporting that she could move her head from side to side, form her mouth into an “o”, and wiggle her toes. But the improvement was not sustained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we get to the focus of Mandel’s story – in order to continue the treatment Byers needs a Canadian doctor to prescribe a cocktail of drugs (erythropoeitin, filgastrim and somatotropin), but the family cannot find a doctor willing to prescribe them. Here we have the human interest story that Mandel wanted to tell, regardless of the facts or the dictates of journalistic integrity. She concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as she watches him, her blue eyes spill unspoken words of  unbearable defeat. It’s as if someone dangled the key of hope before her  and then cruelly snatched it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving her locked-in for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not want to in any way minimize the sincere plight of Byers and her family. I have treated patients who were locked-in and it is one of the worst neurological conditions we face. My problem is with Mandel’s framing of this story as cruel doctors snatching hope from a desperate patient. This is utter rubbish. Mandel does not interview a doctor and provide any explanation for why they would refuse to prescribe these drugs. She does quote Byers’ husband, who can only speculate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was definite improvement here. Why someone wouldn’t want that to  continue is beyond me,” insists Byers. “I guess they’re all afraid of  malpractice suits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect there is another explanation – the doctors understand that this treatment is bogus and that Byers is being exploited by a con-artist in a white coat. Facilitating such exploitation raises serious ethical issues, and is not in the patient’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the story behind the story, but apparently Mandel was not interesting in such things, or even a pretense of false balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stem Cells for Stroke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the current status of research into stem cell therapies for stroke? At present we are at the animal research level, mainly producing strokes in rats and then transplanting various types of stem cells with various techniques and following outcomes. Early results are encouraging, but we do not yet have sufficient data to transition to human trials, although we may be getting close. There are many questions to be answered: what are the stem cells doing exactly, do they survive and form connections, do they support native cells in their recovery, do they limit inflammation, and what are the long term outcomes? &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19399885?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_SingleItemSupl.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=4&amp;amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt; A recent review of the research&lt;/a&gt; concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies of neuroregeneration will require the demonstration of  function in endogenously born neurons following focal ischemia. Further,  methods are currently lacking to demonstrate definitively the  therapeutic effect of newly introduced neural cells. Increased  plasticity following stroke may facilitate the functional integration of  new neurons, but the loss of appropriate guidance cues and supporting  architecture in the infarct cavity will likely impede the restoration of  lost circuitry. Thus careful investigation of the mechanisms underlying  trophic benefits will be essential. Evidence to date suggests that  continued development of stem cell therapies may ultimately lead to  viable treatment options for ischemic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation – cautious optimism, but we are not there yet.I would also point out that much of this research involves transplanting stem cells shortly after the stroke, and so some of the improvement may be due to a protective mechanism (limiting damage) rather than a restorative function (growing new brain cells). This would therefore not translate into treatment long after a stroke (more than a few days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is it that an anonymous clinic in Cancun Mexico would be years ahead of leading research centers in translating stem cell therapies for stroke in humans? The simplest answer is – they aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, if this Mexican clinic had a new treatment that was more effective than what leading researchers were so far able to develop – where is their published research? Why aren’t they telling the medical community about their breakthroughs, and doing the kind of clinical trials that would convince doctors their treatments work? There is absolutely no legitimate reason not to do this. If they were transparent and were doing ethical research and had a treatment that worked, their clinic would become world famous and they would have more clients than they could deal with. Their techniques would also spread to other centers and the research would be expanded. That is what happens when a treatment is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about Byers’ story – did she really improve? We don’t know, because there does not appear to be any scientific follow up of her condition. In stroke trials patients often appear to improve even with placebo treatments. There is what is known as the “cheerleader effect” – tell someone you have given them a treatment and encourage them to do more, and they will do more – if for no other reason than perhaps they are trying for the first time in a while. That is sufficient to explain this story, at least in the absence of objective stroke scales documenting maximal neurological function prior to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, it is quite possible that Byers was given one or more drugs that may have treated a post-stroke depression or temporarily stimulated neurological function, or she was given some intensive rehab – giving the appearance of a temporary minimal improvement, but just enough to stoke the fires of hope and make the treatment seem legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that the clinic actually transplanted neural stem cells (we cannot take this for granted, but it’s possible) and that they provided a temporary benefit to brain function. This is plausible given existing research. But one of the big questions and challenges is – how long do such cells survive? Patients may be better at 30 days, but not 6 months. This is a common problem of both fetal and stem cells transplants, and is one of the technical issues researchers are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If in the very unlikely situation that these Mexican doctors actually have an effective stem cell treatment, then they are guilty of extreme malfeasance. By failing to do ethical, transparent, and scientific trials of their treatments they are depriving their patients of proper follow up (as is evidenced by the Byers case) and the world of their treatment. This is unethical in the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is more likely in my opinion that they are just charlatans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press needs to do a far better job of exposing these exploitative clinics to the public – they are there to take large sums of money from desperate patients and their families and friends. Their behavior is grossly unscientific and unethical. There is a reason why they are hiding away in Cancun, and are not embraced by academic centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, Michele Mandel decided to give such clinics free advertising. Her article goes beyond incompetence to reckless indifference to the truth. She is now an accomplice to this exploitation and is responsible for every patient who seeks out such care after reading her article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on this story is available &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/stem_cell_therapy_for_locked-in_syndrome.php"&gt;from Orac&lt;/a&gt;, who originally pointed me toward the story. Specifically, another article on the story mentioned which Mexican stem cell clinic treated Alda Byers – Stem Cell Therapy International. As Orac points out, this is as bad as you might imagine, with all the red flags for quackery. They make astounding claims to treat a wide variety of ailments and provide no evidence to back up their claims (they basically tell you to look up the subject in PubMed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also learn that the Byers spent $150,000 on the treatments – $40,000 to the clinic and the rest on travel and other expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I noted one error in Mandel’s article. She mentions that the clinic is in Cancun, but it appears that it is in Tijuana Mexico. This is not an important detail, but reflects the generally sloppy nature of her reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the commenters on Orac’s blog brought up what is an excellent point – by requiring the prescribing of several powerful and risky drugs, which local docs (as in this case) are unlikely to prescribe, the clinic has a ready-made excuse for lack of efficacy of their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also raises another ethical issue – beginning a treatment (and charging tens of thousands of dollars) without first establishing appropriate follow up, including prescribing necessary drugs, is malpractice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270556248454"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BpsResearchDigest/~3/DgboXjb1bBM/people-have-intuitive-understanding-of.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b0240af772cfd7da</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">People have an intuitive understanding of the science of persuasion</title><published>2010-04-06T07:19:41Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T07:19:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/5qKr7NXmnSg/people-have-intuitive-understanding-of.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BpsResearchDigest/~3/DgboXjb1bBM/people-have-intuitive-understanding-of.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Psychologists have devoted entire careers to finding out how people can be persuaded but far less time investigating what people know intuitively about persuasion.Now Karen Douglas and colleagues at Kent University have bucked this trend with a paper which they say shows people have an intuitive understanding of how a person&amp;#39;s thinking style affects their vulnerability to persuasion, known formally as &amp;#39;the elaboration likelihood model&amp;#39;. This is the idea, supported by research findings, that people who have a greater inclination for thinking things through tend to be less swayed by adverts that use superficial tricks like beautiful models and slick graphics, but are more persuaded by adverts that make an intelligent argument. The jargon for the character trait in question is &amp;#39;need for cognition&amp;#39;. Douglas&amp;#39; team asked 132 non-psychology undergrad students to either rate themselves or &amp;#39;other students in their class&amp;#39; on their weak-mindedness, their strong minded-ness and their &amp;#39;need for cognition&amp;#39;. Next the students had to look at six colour advertisements that used style rather than intelligent argument to promote things like food and mobile phones, and their task was to say how much either they or typical undergrads in their class would be persuaded by those adverts. The key finding was that the participants&amp;#39; judgments about either their own or other people&amp;#39;s vulnerability to the adverts was strongly related to the scores they gave on &amp;#39;need for cognition&amp;#39;, even above and beyond the relation to strong and weak-mindedness. In other words, if they saw themselves or other students as low on this measure then the students also tend to say that they or other students would be swayed by the ads. It&amp;#39;s as if they were applying the rules of psychology&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;elaboration likelihood model&amp;#39; even though it&amp;#39;s highly unlikely they&amp;#39;d ever heard of such a thing. Another finding to come out of the research was that the students tended to think other people would be swayed by the adverts far more than they would be themselves - a well-established phenomenon in persuasion research. Past studies have suggested that this tendency to think other people will be more prone to persuasion is just another expression of our egotistical tendency to see ourselves as better than average. However, the current study suggested instead that we think other people will be more prone to persuasion (by superficial ads) because we think they have less &amp;#39;need for cognition&amp;#39;. We probably make this assumption, the researchers said, not for self-serving, egotistical reasons but simply because we &amp;#39;have greater access to our own thoughts, and therefore to occasions in which we were personally motivated to think.&amp;#39;Concluding their paper, Douglas&amp;#39;s team said: &amp;#39;This research provides the first evidence that people do indeed use their intuitive understanding of persuasion and the personal characteristics associated with persuasion, to judge the extent to which persuasive attempts will be successful.&amp;#39;In as yet unpublished research Douglas has further shown how people are able to make effective use of their lay theories of persuasion. In one study participants tailored mobile phone adverts appropriately according to an audience who were described as being either high or low in need for cognition. For example, for consumers who think more, the participants chose an ad with more detail on technical specifications. &amp;#39;We and Tobias Vogel at the University of Heidelberg have a lot of data on this topic ... it&amp;#39;s very interesting because no research (to our knowledge) to date investigates people&amp;#39;s lay theories of persuasion and certainly not how people use these theories to persuade people,&amp;#39; Douglas told the Digest.&amp;#39;Our findings suggest that people do have some kind of awareness of how persuasion works and can use their knowledge to attempt to persuade people. It&amp;#39;s just the beginning really - while people seem to have an intuitive understanding of how thinking style relates to persuadibility, it could plausibly extend to other aspects of persuasion and persuasive techniques such as social norms and the foot-in-the-door technique.&amp;#39;_________________________________Douglas, K., Sutton, R., &amp;amp; Stathi, S.

&lt;div style="width:308px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/102635_b088_pre.jpg" alt="photo" title="Elizabeth Vargas" width="298" height="206"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Vargas hosts 20/20 special on miracles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Last night ABC 20/20 &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/139839/abc-2020-fri-apr-2-2010"&gt;aired a one-hour special&lt;/a&gt; on miracles (such topics are common faire on television during Christmas and Easter week) hosted by Elizabeth Vargas, this one featuring the usual array of “unexplained” recoveries from injury and disease, in this case a brain injury, cancer, and Parkinson’s disease. (See my interview segments at 26:34, 28:35, 38:15, 39:05.) The producers called me on Wednesday and asked for a skeptical perspective, outlining for me the details of the stories. It was good to know the details, but it doesn’t really matter what they are because the explanation follows no matter the specifics, because of the statistical analysis I provided applies to all such cases.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:300px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/balls_dropping1.gif" alt="illustration" title="balls dropping" width="290" height="288"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you drop enough balls some will fall into the highly improbable outside slots. Such “miracles” are statistically guaranteed with large enough numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let’s say one million people have cancer in America (it’s much higher than this), and only one-tenth of one percent experience a spontaneous recovery (it’s actually higher than this). 1,000,000 x .001 = 1,000 people. Out of that cohort of 1,000 people, what are the chances that half a dozen of them have compelling narrative stories worthy of broadcast television? Pretty good! Here is a show you will never see on any television series: “Next, we examine the remarkable fact that 99.99 percent of people who were diagnosed with incurable cancer and were prayed for died anyway. Stay tuned, for you won’t want to miss these stark statistical realities.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course you will never see such a show because of the confirmation bias, in which we look for and find confirmatory evidence for what we already believe and ignore or rationalize the disconfirmatory evidence. This is naturally what any religion or television production team is going to do when telling a story about miracles: they will pick and choose the most compelling cases that seemingly defy science and reason, and present those to the public, while blindly (and cruelly) ignoring all those devoutly religious people whose loved ones prayed in earnest for them and who died nonetheless. Why do religions and television production companies not call attention to them?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(In point of fact, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/05/nun-cured-pope-parkinsons-ill" rel="nofollow"&gt;recently the story broke&lt;/a&gt; that one of the “miraculous healings” featured on the show is now being challenged by the attending physician of the nun who was allegedly healed after a night of prayer to Pope John Paul II shortly after his death).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:209px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/n1606814012_21181-199x300.jpg" alt="photo" title="Maureen and husband" width="199" height="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real miracle here is Maureen's courage to live a full life with a husband, children, and career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Well, to their credit ABC 20/20 did just that in allowing me to be the voice of science, reason, and skepticism, and to state the above…and more. It’s the “and more” that seems to be troubling some of my hard-core atheist readers, who were dismayed that I seemingly gave some ground at the end. Watch it yourself at the 39:05 point. After a fairly lengthy interview, Elizabeth Vargas began pushing me to find out if I understood the emotional need people have for religion, faith, and belief in miracles, and she wanted to know if I ever prayed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course I have, when I was a born-again Christian, and I even recounted a story for her that didn’t make the show because it was a little long (I tell the story at length in my next book): shortly after I became an atheist, my girlfriend at the time, Maureen Hannon, was in a horrific automobile accident and was paralyzed from the waist down, and one night in the ER in the midst of reality sinking in of what this meant for her life, I took a knee and asked God for a miraculous healing of the sweetest, smartest, most wonderful woman I ever knew for whom if anyone deserved a miracle it was her. Nothing happened, and Maureen is to this day a paraplegic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Devin-DadCamp-300x200.jpg" alt="photo" title="Devin and Michael" width="300" height="200"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a parent is miraculous enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Elizabeth then surprised me by asking, as a father, would I ever do anything like that for my daughter, and I said what aired on the show; that is, that setting aside my role as a scientist and speaking purely as a father, “it is possible that I would do anything” and “as a person who loves someone else, who knows?”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, take what you will from that. Anyone who is a parent knows exactly what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michael Shermer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270543385025"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/04/best-evidence-encyclopedia.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8999965a54fe8918</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education: Public Schools"/><category term="Learning Disabilities"/><title type="html">Best Evidence Encyclopedia</title><published>2010-04-06T08:42:00Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T08:42:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/04/best-evidence-encyclopedia.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday March 31, there was a &lt;a href="http://thecoffeeklatch.com/Home.html"&gt;The Coffee Klatch&lt;/a&gt; tweetchat on &lt;a href="http://wthashtag.com/transcript.php?page_id=9620&amp;amp;start_date=2010-04-01&amp;amp;end_date=2010-04-01&amp;amp;export_type=HTML"&gt;auditory processing&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://www.bestevidence.org/aboutbee.htm"&gt;Best Evidence Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt; is a free web site created by the Johns Hopkins University School of Education&amp;#39;s Center for Data-Driven Reform in Education (CDDRE) under funding from the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education. It is intended to give educators and researchers fair and useful information about the strength of the evidence supporting a variety of programs available for students in grades K-12.
&lt;/p&gt;

The Best Evidence Encyclopedia provides summaries of scientific reviews produced by many authors and organizations, as well as links to the full texts of each review. The summaries are written by CDDRE staff members and sent to review authors for confirmation.

Literature can teach us things about the world that science can’t. It can give us vicarious experience and insight into other minds. Two recently published novels illuminate why perfectly rational people might reject the help of scientific medicine and prefer to die a little sooner but to die on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://janicevandyck.com/books/"&gt;Finding Frances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by Janice M. Van Dyck, an elderly woman with COPD and heart disease has had a gradual decrease in her quality of life and has been ready to die for some time. She believes in God and an afterlife and is not afraid of dying. When she needs emergency surgery to remove a section of infarcted bowel, she wants to refuse it, but accepts mainly because she is told that otherwise she will be sent home where insurance won’t cover her care and her husband’s savings will be depleted (which isn’t really true). The first surgery leads to complications and she is offered a second operation with a 25% chance of success. She refuses despite the strong urgings of her health care providers and her entire family. She is given hospice care, stops eating, and eventually dies. The book chronicles the course of the death process in hospice, giving a feel for what the experience is like and how it impacts family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061671784/Leisure_Seeker_The/index.aspx"&gt;The Leisure Seeker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by Michael Zadoorian, Ella and John, a couple in their 80s, set out on one last road trip in their RV, to follow the entire length of old Route 66 and revisit Disneyland. Their doctors and their children try desperately to dissuade them. He has Alzheimer’s and she has cancer and other health problems: between them they have one functional brain and one functional body. She has refused surgery and chemotherapy, uses a walker, and is dependent on pain pills. He has made her promise that she will never put him in a nursing home. After many mishaps, misunderstandings and misadventures, they manage to reach Disneyland. Then she finds a way to end both their lives at the same time so neither will be left alone. She is a feisty, colorful character and the book is hilarious despite its sad subject. Ella tells us what it feels like to become old and decrepit, to be handicapped and live in pain, and to live with a demented loved one who must constantly be watched and doesn’t always remember who you are. And how one can find joy in the small pleasures of life despite all those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I would make the same choices in their situation, but I can understand their choices and empathize with them. They didn’t give up hope or turn to false hopes, but they created their own realistic hope — the hope of a “good death.” They rejected dependence on medical care, took control of their lives, and met death on their own terms. I have to respect their autonomy and admire their courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ella says at the end of &lt;em&gt;The Leisure Seeker&lt;/em&gt; after she plans her own and her husband’s death by carbon monoxide poisoning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not always what love means, but this is what it means for us today. It is not your place to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4418"&gt;The case of John Lykoudis and peptic ulcer disease revisited: Crank or visionary?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (David Gorski) Followup to the recent post about the Greek doctor who apparently discovered the bacterial origin of peptic ulcers a quarter of a century before Marshall and Warren did. It can be difficult to distinguish a crank from someone who is ahead of his time: only properly controlled trials can determine the truth of claims, and the context of the time is a factor in deciding which claims to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4431"&gt;“Vaccines didn’t save us” (a.k.a. “vaccines don’t work”): Intellectual dishonesty at its most naked&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;/strong&gt;David Gorski) Anti-vaccine activists have graphs allegedly showing that diseases were already subsiding before vaccines and that the vaccines had little or no impact. A careful look at their data shows their intellectual dishonesty; and the fact that disease rates rise when vaccination rates fall clearly refutes their claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4320"&gt;Genetic Testing for Patients on Coumadin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Harriet Hall) A new study showed that pharmacogenetic testing for Coumadin sensitivity was associated with fewer complications for patients on the anticoagulant Coumadin. The study is questionable and does not prove that treatment guided by genetic testing offers any significant advantage over optimal clinical management based only on careful monitoring of the response to Coumadin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4460"&gt;SBM Live Event – April 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Steven Novella) A panel of SBM bloggers will be participating in the Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism in New York on April 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4462"&gt;Being Negative Is Not So Bad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Steven Novella) There is a publication bias against animal studies with negative results; it adversely impacts the translation to human clinical trials. Negative studies should be published too; otherwise our interpretations based on the published body of evidence will be flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4451"&gt;Less salt: it’s that simple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Peter Lipson) Salt in the diet is associated with hypertension and heart disease; a combination of education and regulation could save lives and money. Instead of recommending these measures, altmed promotes special expensive kinds of salt with no evidence that they offer any benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4471"&gt;Cartoon:  The Omnipresence Of Pharma Advertising (&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Val Jones) A bit of humor for April Fool’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
According to Ticketmaster™, Landover Baptist church services in all four sanctuaries are completely booked through 2017 (even some Platinum Level Tithers are reportedly scalping their tickets for $3,000 a pop!) and there are plans to build a new worship center in Freehold, Iowa to accommodate the enormous number of new members coming in from the &lt;em&gt;S.S. Titanic of all faiths&lt;/em&gt;, the Roman Catholic Church.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, to help people get used to being a Baptist, LBC has put together a &lt;a href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org/2010/april/catholicsincrisis.html"&gt;handy little chart&lt;/a&gt;.  Here’s just a sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the &lt;a href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org/2010/april/catholicsincrisis.html"&gt;full chart here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/7557799/Oriental-yeti-discovered-in-China.html"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; and  the &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/biology_evolution/article7088318.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&amp;amp;attr=797093"&gt;Times&lt;/a&gt; have stories up about the creature below from China, which they’ve dubbed the “oriental yeti”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:470px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-10481" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/oriental-yeti-april-fools/yeti/"&gt;&lt;img title="&amp;quot;Oriental yeti&amp;quot; from the Telegraph." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/yeti.jpg?w=460&amp;amp;h=288" alt="" width="460" height="288"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oriental yeti&amp;quot; from the Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times headline writer notes that it “looks like a bear without fur”. The story is so absurd, I first thought it an April Fools joke, but the datelines are April 5 or 6, so I guess not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s absurd? First, there’s the name. ‘Yeti’ is a name for &lt;a href="http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/50yrs-yetis/"&gt;the abominable snowman&lt;/a&gt;, the supposed bipedal ape or ape-man of the Himalayas. The animal in the photo obviously bears not the slightest resemblance to a man or ape. ‘Oriental’ is a curious modifier for yeti, since yetis &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; Oriental– they occur (or are supposed to occur) in Asia. Whoever bestowed this moniker on the creature evidently hasn’t the slightest idea what the word ‘yeti’ means, and perhaps doesn’t know what ‘oriental’ means either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the description of it as a ‘bear without fur’. While it is only very sparsely haired, it doesn’t look at all like a bear. The head and ear shape are all wrong, but if this is too subtle, it has a &lt;em&gt;long, thick tail! &lt;/em&gt;(Hint: &lt;a href="http://www.bearbiology.com/"&gt;bears have very short tails&lt;/a&gt;; more bear info &lt;a href="http://www.bearden.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) The creature is said to have emerged from ‘ancient woodlands’, which sounds mysterious, but the articles note it was trapped by local hunters. Both articles betray very low standards of science journalism; really, in fact, no standards at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s not a bear or a yeti; what is it? It’s clearly a mammal of the order &lt;a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/carnivora/carnivora.html"&gt;Carnivora&lt;/a&gt; (but not of the bear family, Ursidae) suffering from some skin disease, likely mange. It doesn’t look like a member of the dog, cat or weasel families to me, but it does look like a civet, so my money is on a mangy civet. (Here’s &lt;a href="http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/common_palm_civet.htm"&gt;info on a civet&lt;/a&gt; that occurs in China– I’m not saying it’s this particular species; more on civets in general &lt;a href="http://www.smallcarnivores.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;amp;task=doc_download&amp;amp;gid=1&amp;amp;Itemid=33"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) The forlorn looking critter is said to have been sent to Beijing for DNA tests. Darren Naish over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/"&gt;Tetrapod Zoology&lt;/a&gt; is good at getting to the bottom of these sorts of stories, and I hope he’ll take this one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, this is what a mangy bear &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; look like.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s a look at a few handsome dog breeds that do well living with human siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img title="weimaraner-puppy" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/weimaraner-puppy.jpg" alt="Weimaraner puppy" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weimaraner puppy (Image: sxc.hu)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wire Fox Terrier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://www.akc.org"&gt;American Kennel Club&lt;/a&gt; recommends this terrier for families with kids due to the breed’s small yet sturdy build and its friendly nature. An added bonus for mom and the allergic: This dog hardly sheds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labrador Retriever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Although Labs may not be right for families with small children, they are the perfect breed for tweens and teens. This popular pooch became a favorite thanks to its active lifestyle and easygoing temperament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norwegian Elkhound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you’re adopting a puppy, consider a Norwegian Elkhound. The &lt;a href="http://www.akc.org"&gt;American Kennel Club&lt;/a&gt; claims that this breed will bond with your children and be a life-long guardian – especially if introduced as a pup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sussex Spaniel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A canine perfect for the family with lots of children and other pets, it’s friendly with just about every species. The drawback? This spaniel’s long hair needs weekly grooming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weimaraner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This silvery-grey-colored breed can be trained easily, and the &lt;a href="http://www.akc.org"&gt;AKC&lt;/a&gt; praises it for being obedient and loving children. Plus, the Weimaraner’s lasting endurance will have your kids counting down the minutes to bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href="http://www.akc.org"&gt;American Kennel Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was a fun time. I got one of the most ignorant trolls I&amp;#39;ve yet had on this site and even Phil Plait came over to gawk and point at the giant logical gaps. One of the claims that the author had made was that, because we shouldn&amp;#39;t see young stars in very close quarters to black holes in the centers of galaxies (the nearest 1 parsec), and we do, that all of stellar evolution must be wrong and thus, God did it.Mollishka from A Geocentric View (which sadly hasn&amp;#39;t been updated in a year) pointed out that the only galaxies for which we could have sufficient resolution to even discuss the stellar populations of the innermost parsec, would be our own and Andromeda. So trying to draw grand conclusions from a tiny number of cases, as the Creationist was trying to do was just idiotic. Compile that with the completely unrelated conclusion that it meant that God did it, and you get normal Creationist mentality.Meanwhile, the problem of young stars in the inner portions of galaxies was still an unsolved problem. But instead of tossing their hands up and declaring it impossible a la Behe1. But while Creationists buried their heads in the sand, real scientists continued to try to figure out what was going on.A new paper looks to have some promising answers. The real trick in the whole problem is getting gas in close enough to the black hole to form young stars without chucking it in to be eaten.The new paper ran simulations and found that due to gravitational instabilities that effected stars and gas differently, galaxies with supermassive black holes like M31&amp;#39;s would form disks of each separately and tilted with respect to one another. The interplay between these disks allows the stellar disk to yank some of the gas out and send it towards the black hole. There, &amp;quot;[s]ome of the gas turns into stars, those stars are excited into the m = 1 mode, allowing the perturbation to efficiently propagate inwards to ~0.1pc.&amp;quot;Booya.New stars. Real science.1 - &amp;quot;As scientists, we yearn to understand how this magnificent mechanism came to be, but the complexity of the system dooms all Darwinian explanations to frustration. Sisyphus himself would pity us.&amp;quot;~Michael Behe: Darwin&amp;#39;s Black BoxPhilip F. Hopkins, &amp;amp; Eliot Quataert (2010).

For me, it's when I start to get pissy as hell with everyone around me. Basically, I turn in to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="TEXT-ALIGN:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/MBOV8WzH-oY%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0xe1600f%26color2%3D0xfebd01&amp;amp;width=460&amp;amp;height=240" width="460" height="240"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 1: "Take your ass back to your tree and shut the fuck up." Shut the fuck up, indeed. I hate birds too. Fuck birds with their stupid ass beaks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it gets to be time for me to write a manuscript, I start to lose tolerance for even the most basic of human interaction.  Any human interaction.  This morning I pulled up at a four way stop to turn left and the dude to my left, who got there before I did by minutes, made eye contact with me and waved me through and gave me the overly dramatized mouthed &amp;quot;go ahead&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fuck you, asshole.  You have the right of way.  Drive your fucking car and don&amp;#39;t make me stop thinking about my paper because you can&amp;#39;t handle motor vehicle operation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then tonight I went to the grocery store.  I needed to pick up a few items for dinner and, knowing about my recent antisocial tendencies, I went to the self-checkout line so that I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to stop thinking about the last experiment that needs to be done before the paper is complete.  In my opinion, antisocial people use the self-checkout line.  It&amp;#39;s a way to self-segregate ourselves from the regular,  well-adjusted segment of the population.  However, I made the mistake of placing a bottle of pinot noir in my basket.  This required the attendant to come check my ID.  But, then she wanted to talk about the wine and tell me that she didn&amp;#39;t think it would pair well with the chicken in my basket....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fuck you, asshole.  I got in this line and scanned my own shit so that I didn&amp;#39;t have to speak to anyone, Cockassweaselhatdouchefucker.  Who the fuck are you? Reviewer #3, full of opinions about my wine and chicken?  Poo on your face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I got home and checked my email, to find an email from a student who would like to meet with me about understanding some material.  I replied and told them to let me know when they wanted to come by my office and this fool told me, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m really busy this week, but I could come by after 7pm.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fuck you, asshole.  I&amp;#39;m not going to sit my happy ass in my office when I could be home drinking pinot noir, eating chicken,and hanging out with my family or writing this paper.  Fuck you.  I&amp;#39;m not going to sit around when you could seriously figure this out if you took two minutes to Google the shit.  I&amp;#39;m not your bitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I can tell that it really is time for me to write this shit up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img style="DISPLAY:block;MARGIN:0pt auto 20px;TEXT-ALIGN:center" height="350" alt="rosemarys baby.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/rosemarys%20baby.jpg" width="350"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: I'm going to be much more pleasant when this is out of me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am teaching tomorrow and still need to come up with a lecture.  I am thinking of calling it &amp;quot;[Shit Isis Studies]: Why you&amp;#39;ve been lied to your whole fucking life and you should be pissed off but you really don&amp;#39;t give a shit and will repeat whatever you&amp;#39;re taught to get an A.&amp;quot;  Or, maybe I&amp;#39;ll just watch more YouTube and thinking about the not-yet-created Figure 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FriedEnema1.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here's the unsavory-sounding dish in the context of the original menu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FriedEnema2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew asked for help from Language Log.   Luckily this puzzle is particularly easy to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese name of the dish in question is &lt;em&gt;zhá guànchang&lt;/em&gt; 炸灌腸, which is a kind of sausage made of wheat flour stuffed into hog casings and fried.  The last two characters, pronounced &lt;em&gt;guàncháng&lt;/em&gt;,  also have a completely different meaning, viz., "enema" or "give an enema" (literally, "to irrigate the intestine").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good example of the spoken language being clearer than the written language — at least when one is relying on not-very-good machine translation.&lt;/p&gt;

I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall. &lt;i&gt;-Thomas Paine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I've been telling you the history of the Universe over the past few months in serial.  Parts &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/01/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-.php"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_7.php"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; are currently up, and have taken us from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)"&gt;Inflation&lt;/a&gt; up through &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)"&gt;the formation of neutral atoms&lt;/a&gt;, covering the first 380,000 years of the Universe.  During this whole time, like a giant balloon, &lt;b&gt;space&lt;/b&gt; has been expanding.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/FG26_005.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/FG26_005-thumb-500x250-44194.jpeg" width="500" height="250" alt="FG26_005.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I haven't paid much mind to is just &lt;b&gt;how&lt;/b&gt; the Universe has been expanding during this time.  The concept is relatively straightforward: the Universe expands &lt;b&gt;faster&lt;/b&gt; based on the amount of &lt;b&gt;energy density&lt;/b&gt; in it.  More matter and energy packed inside a smaller volume means &lt;i&gt;faster&lt;/i&gt; expansion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this means for our Universe, which spends most of its time expanding and cooling?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/I02-06-expansion.jpeg" width="500" height="315" alt="I02-06-expansion.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to know &lt;b&gt;how&lt;/b&gt; the Universe expands, we need to know its energy density &lt;b&gt;at any given time&lt;/b&gt;.  Well, there are three general types of things that make up the Universe, and they're important at different times.  What are they?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/High%20Five.jpeg" width="500" alt="High Five.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.) Matter&lt;/b&gt;.  Normal matter is stuff like you and me... &lt;i&gt;stuff with mass&lt;/i&gt;.  As the Universe expands, the matter density dilutes.  You may remember that density is just mass over volume, and so as the volume increases, the energy decreases.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/Expansion4.jpeg" width="360" alt="Expansion4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.) Radiation&lt;/b&gt;.  Radiation is stuff with either no mass or very little mass, like photons or (sometimes) neutrinos, which move either at or extremely close to the speed of light.  But unlike matter, radiation &lt;b&gt;loses extra energy&lt;/b&gt; as the Universe expands!  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How?  The energy intrinsic to radiation is determined by its wavelength.  Long wavelength photons (like radio waves) have &lt;i&gt;less energy&lt;/i&gt; than short wavelength ones (like X-rays).  But as the Universe expands, in addition to volume increasing (as it does for matter), the wavelengths &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; get stretched.  This means that a Universe full of radiation loses energy &lt;i&gt;faster&lt;/i&gt; than a comparable Universe filled with matter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/dark_energy_2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/dark_energy_2-thumb-500x392-44201.jpeg" width="500" height="392" alt="dark_energy_2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.) A &lt;i&gt;constant&lt;/i&gt; energy source&lt;/b&gt;.  It's also possible for space to be filled with a constant source of energy that &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; dilute as the Universe expand.  This not only happens in our Universe, it looks like it has all happened before (during inflation), and like it's all happening again (with dark energy)!  In this case, the expansion rate remains constant, and the energy density also remains constant as long as the Universe is full of this type of energy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean for our Universe's beginning?  We know it's expanding and cooling, we know it has matter and radiation in it now, and we know that before that, towards the beginning (see parts &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/01/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-.php"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/01/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_1.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; of my series), it had a constant source of energy in it.  What I'd like to do is to work backwards from now, and ask whether the Universe started from a singularity or not?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/universe_expansion.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/universe_expansion-thumb-500x500-44203.png" width="500" height="500" alt="universe_expansion.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, diagrams on the internet aren't going to hold the answer.  For billions of years, until the recent takeover of dark energy, the Universe was dominated by matter.  Prior to that, though, when the Universe was only a few thousand years old (and earlier), the radiation was more energetic!  It lost its energy more quickly due to that extra "stretching" of its wavelength, but for the first few thousand years, the Universe was dominated by radiation.  And then if we go back even farther -- towards the instant the big bang was created at the end of inflation -- we come to the epoch of inflation, where the Universe is dominated by a &lt;i&gt;constant energy source&lt;/i&gt;, and expands exponentially.  Let's compare, graphically, what these three cases look like.  (The next three graphs -- unlike most of the ones on this blog -- were generated by me.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/expansion%20of%20universe.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/expansion%20of%20universe-thumb-500x322-44205.jpg" width="500" height="322" alt="expansion of universe.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, quite clearly, a Universe with exponential expansion expands the fastest over time, and one with matter expands faster than one with radiation.  No big deal.  But I want to go &lt;b&gt;backwards&lt;/b&gt;, and take a look at what happens when we extrapolate back to a time where the size of the Universe should shrink to zero!  After all, that's what a singularity is &lt;b&gt;defined to be&lt;/b&gt;, where all of the matter and energy in the Universe is concentrated &lt;b&gt;in a single point&lt;/b&gt;.  Let's calculate it and see what we get.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/Expansion%20Universe%202.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/Expansion%20Universe%202-thumb-500x283-44207.jpg" width="500" height="283" alt="Expansion Universe 2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's this?!  A Universe with matter or radiation totally has a singularity at time t=0, but -- and this is very, very important -- &lt;b&gt;an inflating Universe does not!&lt;/b&gt;  In fact, we can take the inflating, exponentially expanding Universe back arbitrarily far, and what do we find?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/Expansion%20Universe%203.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a/Expansion%20Universe%203-thumb-500x290-44209.jpg" width="500" height="290" alt="Expansion Universe 3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; reaches a size of zero!  If you want an inflating Universe to have a singularity, you need to go back &lt;i&gt;an infinite amount of time!&lt;/i&gt;  Physically, of course, we can't do that.  The only information we have about inflation is from whatever comes at the &lt;i&gt;very end&lt;/i&gt; of it.  Everything else is wiped away from our field of view by the exponential expansion!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does this all mean?  It means the idea that our Universe started from a singularity was a very good one back when we thought that the only important things in our Universe were matter and radiation, &lt;b&gt;but now that we know about inflation, there is no reason to believe that our Universe ever had a singularity in the past.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is different from what you'll read almost everywhere -- on the internet, in textbooks, even at many colleges and Universities -- but it's right.  Now that we know about inflation, it's time to admit that we can't with any sort of certainty speak about what came before it.  That means there is &lt;b&gt;no reason to believe that our Universe came from a singularity&lt;/b&gt;, and this outdated idea should have died as soon as inflation was accepted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And isn't that a surprise for most of us!  So my answer -- to the best of our current knowledge about the Universe -- is &lt;b&gt;no, it didn't.&lt;/b&gt;  What do you think about that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/did_the_universe_start_from_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270515528322"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/sorry_catholic_church_imma_let.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a029ea9f80fbddf9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Sorry, Catholic Church, Imma let you keep being holy and all, but first ....</title><published>2010-04-06T01:57:13Z</published><updated>2010-04-06T01:57:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/Bn56Rx95adk/sorry_catholic_church_imma_let.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/sorry_catholic_church_imma_let.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;... you are going to have to take a century or two of snark from us atheists.

It was a fun time. I got one of the most ignorant trolls I've yet had on this site and even Phil Plait came over to gawk and point at the giant logical gaps. One of the claims that the author had made was that, because we shouldn't see young stars in very close quarters to black holes in the centers of galaxies (the nearest 1 parsec), and we do, that all of stellar evolution must be wrong and thus, God did it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mollishka from &lt;a href="http://mollishka.blogspot.com/"&gt;A Geocentric View&lt;/a&gt; (which sadly hasn't been updated in a year) pointed out that the only galaxies for which we could have sufficient resolution to even discuss the stellar populations of the innermost parsec, would be our own and Andromeda. So trying to draw grand conclusions from a tiny number of cases, as the Creationist was trying to do was just idiotic. Compile that with the completely unrelated conclusion that it meant that God did it, and you get normal Creationist mentality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, the problem of young stars in the inner portions of galaxies was still an unsolved problem. But instead of tossing their hands up and declaring it impossible a la Behe&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. But while Creationists buried their heads in the sand, &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; scientists continued to try to figure out what was going on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1002/1002.1079v2.pdf"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; looks to have some promising answers. The real trick in the whole problem is getting gas in close enough to the black hole to form young stars without chucking it in to be eaten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new paper ran simulations and found that due to gravitational instabilities that effected stars and gas differently, galaxies with supermassive black holes like M31's would form disks of each separately and tilted with respect to one another. The interplay between these disks allows the stellar disk to yank some of the gas out and send it towards the black hole. There, "[s]ome of the gas turns into stars, those stars are excited into the m = 1 mode, allowing the perturbation to efficiently propagate inwards to ~0.1pc."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Booya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New stars.

Good journalism should be exposing this stuff for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a video shot from an American helicopter gunship in Iraq. It shows real human beings being shot to death. I wish I could unwatch seeing it now, so be advised before you click on that play button…it is horrific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/5rXPrfnU3G0%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of Iraqi journalists working for Reuters are slaughtered in the above clip, gunned down from a distance by American troops who claim their cameras are weapons, that they&amp;#39;re walking around with AK-47s and RPGs…which I simply don&amp;#39;t see anywhere in the clip. I see a small group of civilians casually walking down a city street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the killers were merely mistaken, as happens in war. Perhaps they had better views of weaponry than can be seen in this video. But that doesn't explain what happened next, when a van pulls up to help a wounded man and they open fire again, fully aware of what was going on below them, and fire several bursts into the people and into the van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they could see weapons more clearly than I can. But then how did they fail to notice two small faces peering out of the passenger side window of the van? They shot journalists and &lt;i&gt;children&lt;/i&gt;, all the while laughing and congratulating themselves on the 'nice' pile of bodies they had produced. And when they see soldiers on the ground rushing injured children to aid, they say, "Well, it's their fault for bringing their kids into a battle."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am ashamed. We are the storm troopers, the murderous invaders, the butchers of children, the laughing barbarians. We aren't in Iraq to &lt;i&gt;help&lt;/i&gt; those people, our troops are there to oppress them…when we aren&amp;#39;t gunning them down outright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and go ahead, turn on your TV news. The top stories on CNN are the iPad, Jessica Alba planning to adopt a baby, and Tiger Woods. Doesn't that fill you with confidence?&lt;/p&gt;

A good question, one that is still open and energetically debated in the scientific community. How about epigenetic changes, mechanisms that alter the process of producing proteins from genetic blueprints without changing the genes themselves, such as those involving DNA methylation? Insofar as degenerative aging is concerned, are epigenetic changes cause, consequence of other, more fundamental changes, or a mix of both? Also good questions, and also still open. I noticed two open access papers on epigenetic changes in aging today, the first of which begins with this statement: Aging is arguably the most familiar yet least-well understood aspect of human biology. Which is quite true. Fully understanding aging - a set of massively complex changes in a massively complex system - will take a long time, biotechnology revolution or no biotechnology revolution. But full understanding is not needed for significant progress to occur in the development of medical technologies to repair and reverse the damage of aging. Just as for other fields, there are engineering strategies that can sidestep ignorance and build good solutions based upon what is actually known. Our ancestors built good, working bridges for thousands......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

(Photo: Good Morning America)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Honey, I don’t love you anymore, and I don’t know if I ever did” are words that must sting coming from a spouse after 20-odd years of betrothal. But when Laura Munson’s husband told her exactly that, she forged ahead, unconvinced. The Montana-based writer’s new book, &lt;em&gt;This Is Not The Story You Think It Is&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the tale she first told in &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/fashion/02love.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (to overwhelming reader response – the comments came in at a rate that crashed the comments section). Her husband told her he wanted to leave, she didn’t believe him, and through the power of belief, she seems to have saved her marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On today’s &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/laura-munsons-book-marriage-love-happiness/story?id=10269295"&gt;George Stephanopoulos interviewed Munson&lt;/a&gt;, and articulated the suspicion most people might feel: “I thought maybe you were a little delusional.” But she insists that her conviction in her marriage was a powerful lesson in coping with crisis, and taking control of her life. (The fact that Munson’s husband came crawling back from his sister’s house might have something to do with her feeling so powerful.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Munson is delusional, or a good example of how to make marriage work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.skyandtelescope.com/images/RWS_ZetaOphOcc1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/RWS_ZetaOphOcc1.jpg" alt="RWS_ZetaOphOcc1" title="RWS_ZetaOphOcc1" width="300" height="412"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/home/89690067.html"&gt;Sky and Telescope has the details&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the asteroid 824 Anastasia will pass directly in front of the star ζ (Zeta) Ophiuchi. At magnitude 2.5, the star is easily visible, about as bright as Polaris (though honestly, from LA you may need binoculars). The map shown here on the left is from Sky and Tel; click it for a higher-res version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asteroid itself will be invisible to the eye; it’s at magnitude 14.7, a thousandth as bright as the faintest object you can see even from a dark site. But when it passes in front of the star, the star will dim or blink out for up to 8 seconds. This &lt;em&gt;occultation&lt;/em&gt;, as it’s called, is important because by mapping exact locations and timing from a large number of observers, the shape of the asteroid can be found! Well, more or less, since we only see it in profile, but it’s still a nice clue to the characteristics of an otherwise featureless point of light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you plan on being out and about at that time, why not check out how to do some astronomy from literally your back yard? The more people who participate, the better our science is!&lt;/p&gt;

Okay, we’re exaggerating, but you don’t need to buy the most expensive bassinet, crib, and comforter set. Sure, decorating the nursery can be fun, but it might not be in your child’s best interest to get too fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/baby-crib-set.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="baby-crib-set" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/baby-crib-set-300x300.jpg" alt="Baby Crib Set" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Walmart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kidshealth.org"&gt;To reduce the risk of SIDS and suffocation&lt;/a&gt;, it’s recommended that newborns sleep in a crib with just a tight, firm mattress and a fitted sheet. That means no stuffed animals, blankets, or other bedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And skip the matching crib bumper. You might think that a bumper pad will protect your baby, but &lt;a href="http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/10081.aspx"&gt;a study by Washington University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found a number of accidental deaths attributed to bumpers – and zero deaths attributed to the lack of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bumper pad deaths can be caused by suffocation (the baby’s face against the bumper, or the head getting stuck between bumper and crib mattress) and strangulation by bumper ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no matter how tempting it is to splurge on those matching comforters, sheets, bumpers, curtains, bed skirts, wall hangings, and rugs, save yourself a small fortune and get a plain, simple crib instead – or just clean out a spare drawer in your dresser.&lt;/p&gt;

On top of that the premiums for ATE insurance run at roughly £68,000 per £100,000 worth of cover. The claimant does not pay for that insurance; they incur the premium but they then claim it back from the defendant. The vast majority of cases against the media are won by claimants."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in the words of Ian Hislop:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"If someone comes and says, 'We are suing you, and not only that, we have a CFA, which means we can just make it up. It will be any figure that comes into our head, double it, double it again, and you pay all of it,' that makes you think twice about running a piece."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The barrister Lord Pannick QC in &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100325-0016.htm"&gt;the House of Lords debate on the SI &lt;/a&gt;put it in stark terms:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"...a particular and urgent problem needs to be addressed in the context of libel and breach of confidence law. It is an urgent problem because the consequence of the cost regime today is that it is deterring defendants from exercising their freedom of expression. That is a fundamental right for them and a fundamental condition of a free society in which those who are governed are given information about those who govern us, information that people in power, let us be blunt about it, and influential people would much prefer to keep confidential, even if-indeed, often especially if-it touches on matters of public interest".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So how has this situation come to pass?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why has an uplift designed to be fair to lawyers taking on CFA cases caused such a dreadful situation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, most of the law firms involved do not appear to use the current 100% uplift to actually cover the risk of running unsuccessful cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, there is evidence that the firms adopt an approach to risk analysis which means they do not go with unsuccessful cases, but usually with good cases anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100325-0016.htm"&gt;in the words of Lord Pannick QC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The 100 per cent success fee is a deterrent, whether the journalism is lazy or dedicated. The justification for the success fee of up to 100 per cent, as has been explained, was that it would enable otherwise impecunious claimants to bring proceedings to vindicate their reputation on a conditional fee basis and to compensate lawyers...for the unsuccessful cases in which they act on such a basis. It is a swings and roundabouts approach. This rationale, in my experience, has been undermined by two factors that have not yet been mentioned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"First, a very large number of the claims in which these success fees are secured have been brought by claimants who were perfectly capable of paying their lawyers a proper professional fee. There is no restriction on these success fees to the impecunious. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The second problem is that not all but many lawyers operating in the field of libel and confidence choose very carefully the cases in which they act on a conditional fee basis."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, in evidence to the DCMS select committee, one partner of a law firm stated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I think it should be pointed out as well that, of course, when the Conditional Fee Agreement is entered into by a firm of solicitors it can represent a very considerable investment by that firm because you are agreeing to act on a 'no win, no fee'. In my firm we have a very rigorous risk assessment procedure at the outset to decide whether or not we are prepared to take on a case on a CFA. So it is not surprising that the cases we do take on CFAs are ones we expect to win."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having reviewed the relevant evidence the select committee reported:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"In the matter of success fees, the argument is made that they need to be high to compensate for the risks run by lawyers: they need relatively high fees in cases they win to balance the fees that are unpaid in cases they lose. This view is not, however, supported by the data available on the outcomes of cases of this kind. This data suggests that CFA-funded parties win the vast majority of their cases. The system is therefore tantamount to "always win, double the fee"." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the regime which will continue unless the draft SI is implemented. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the words of Lord Pannick, "&lt;em&gt;there is an urgent and serious problem about freedom of expression&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The proposed reform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The current and urgent predicament for free expression caused by the 100% uplift surely means that the proposed 10% reform should be implemented &lt;strong&gt;unless&lt;/strong&gt; the reform actually makes a dreadful situation worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the key question for those who oppose the 10% reform is whether it would make the current situation worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this, one of the opponents of the proposed, Tom Watson MP, made the following assertions in the last week (emphases added).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An unequivocal assertion in the &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/there%20is%20an%20urgent%20and%20serious%20problem%20about%20freedom%20of%20expression"&gt; Press Gazette&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"...this proposal &lt;strong&gt;would&lt;/strong&gt; deny access to many thousands of people".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A more equivocal statement in &lt;a href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/2010/03/31/why-i-opposed-libel-costs-reform-yesterday/"&gt; Liberal Conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"&lt;em&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;could&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;significantly &lt;/strong&gt;reduce the chances of people receiving justice."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in even more equivocal terms in the &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmgeneral/deleg1/100330/100330s01.htm"&gt;standing committee debate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I must say that the proposals &lt;strong&gt;would probably &lt;/strong&gt;remove every one of my constituents from libel justice&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, for none of these statements does he provide a jot of evidence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if there is no evidence, then it may be that Tom Watson and other MPs are happily promoting a bogus counterargument to the clear and urgent need for reducing the uplift amount.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The correct position is that any reduction in coverage for libel litigants would be entirely in the hands of the current specialist law firms, whom we are supposed to believe will start turning down work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But many such firms have already separated their risk analysis from their use of CFAs: there is little evidence of the desirable cross-subsidy happening in practice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only impact will be on the firm's profit margins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100325-0016.htm"&gt;House of Lords debate&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Pannick QC correctly observed of the 10% uplift:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"...it will make no difference at all, because the lawyers are understandably anxious to do the work and they will continue to do the work by and large in those cases where they think that they have good prospects of success on a conditional fee basis. If the case is interesting, they may, as many lawyers do, be prepared to do it on a no-fee basis...".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This must be the correct view. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There should be an uplift to reward risk. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as the standard practice of most libel law firms is already to run the "&lt;em&gt;always win, double the fee&lt;/em&gt;" the only disadvantage of the reform will be to the commercial models of those firms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would submit that the reason why no evidence has been provided to support the various alarmist statements - both equivocal and unequivocal - about the 10% reform is that there is no evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, if I am correct in this view, then on the substantial question of the merits of the reform - whether the free speech need for reform outweighs the access to justice objections of its opponents - then the former has to prevail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a 10% uplift there will still be access to justice but without the adverse effects for free speech.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procedural objections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those opposed to the 10% uplift then resort to two procedural arguments: the lack of consultation and the threat by the government to put the SI to a vote of the House of Commons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The contention is that the procedures followed in bringing forward the draft SI are flawed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As substance should never be the slave of procedure - especially when fundamental issues of free speech are at stake - then it would appear that any alleged procedural irregularity must be sufficiently significant if is to be used to defeat a welcome substantial reform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact there have been no such irregularities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the circumstances, the procedural objections are spurious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The consultation period was indeed four weeks, not three months. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But look at again at &lt;a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2010/draft/ukdsi_9780111496510_en_1"&gt; the draft SI&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is not a complex measure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is knocking out a zero: reducing the uplift from 100% to 10%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One does not need an additional eight weeks to work this one out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All a longer consultation exercise would do - and it appears that the demand is for a fresh three month exercise some time in the future - is to allow the law firms involved to amend their commercial model or to mobilise an even more effective lobby against the change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There has been consultation; there just has not been needless delay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Indeed, when I asked an anti-reform lawyer whether he would object to a consultation period of four weeks had the reform been to make the uplift 200%, he said "of course not".)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the potential vote of the whole House of Commons to overturn the MPs at the standing committee, it is difficult to see this as a grand constitutional outrage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government is not actually proposing to use some form of sneaky executive action to circumvent parliamentary procedure; instead the government is considering actually following such procedure so as to put the matter before all MPs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this fundamental free speech matter to be somehow defeated on the basis of the supposed precious rights of the hitherto obscure First Delegated Legislation Committee would be bizarre, especially if the House of Commons as a whole is minded to overturn that Committee's vote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I do not think there is even a need to concede there are procedural flaws in this draft SI; but even if there are, such flaws are certainly insufficient to mean the SI should not be enacted on its merits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only serious objection to the draft SI is not from Tom Watson MP but the Liberal Democrat frontbencher David Howarth MP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmgeneral/deleg1/100330/100330s01.htm"&gt;standing committee&lt;/a&gt;, he noted that it would cover privacy actions as well as libel actions (both of which are "publication proceedings" for the purpose of the SI).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having considered this carefully, and as someone in favour of privacy law and who who accepts the importance of Article 8, as well as being a personal fan of Mr Howarth, I am afraid I am not with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Privacy actions simply do not need the artificial addition of a 100% uplift to make them effective. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no reason why a 10% uplift would limit the readiness of law firms to take on winnable cases, just as there is no reason why they would affect libel cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if a newspaper does not defend a privacy case just because of the 100% uplift that is not giving effect to Article 8 of the ECHR: it is effectively removing the ability of the newspaper to rely on the rights it may have to interfere with privacy rights under Article 8(2).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore a 10% uplift is, in my view, more likely to lead to privacy cases succeeding or being defended on their merits under Article 8.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jam tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, there is the promise of better reforms some day if this draft SI is defeated: a vague reform package which may lull one into accepting the do-nothing option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, practical politics requires one takes the best reforms one can when they become available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wider libel reform may never happen; but this draft SI will take effect in days, subject only to a single House of Commons vote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One should never hold off an actual possible reform just because a better one is promised. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Governments - for various reasons - may just not get round to them - and ask the hereditary peers still in the House of Lords if you disbelieve me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reform today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a real chance to break the back of the current unfair costs regime which is undermining free expression. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The proposed reform retains CFAs and provides an appropriate 10% uplift for the lawyers prepared to take the risk of a no-win no-fee case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alleged procedural flaws are not such to defeat the merits of the substantial reform which is actually now possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alternative is to continue with the obscene costs regime which is undermining free expression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On any proper analysis, the draft SI is an improvement to this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the government puts the matter before the full House of Commons then MPs should support the enactment of the draft SI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published;

&lt;p&gt;The BBC, together with Science Channel, has just produced an excellent five-part series, &lt;em&gt;The Wonders of the Solar System&lt;/em&gt;, fronted by my colleague from the University of Manchester, physicist Professor Brian Cox (no, I haven’t met him). Cox is an extremely pleasant presenter who gets a lot of press because he is young (ish – 42), good looking (well, he has a lot of nice hair) and he used to be a pop star (he played keyboards in a band called D:Ream which had a 1994 hit with “Things can only get better”, which was notoriously played at the early morning celebration of the New Labour electoral victory in 1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His popularity is justified and undeniable – only three hours ago, one of my ex-students posted on Facebook “loves bryan cox. pop star and a physicist. amazing.” You can find an amusing profile of Cox &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2010/apr/04/brian-cox-observer-profile"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series has used some fantastic astronomical images to show how studies of terrestrial geological phenomena can inform us about what’s happening on other planets in the solar system. The last episode in the series, which I have just watched, was on the possibility of extraterrestrial life. [There's a BBC page about this episode &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8597161.stm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.] Cox’s focus being the solar system, he didn’t even mention the Fermi paradox (summed up in his question “where are they?” – given the size and age of the universe, the place should be heaving with bug-eyed monsters in flying saucers, but it clearly isn’t). Rather, he was interested in where there might be life in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two current candidates, apart from our Goldilocks planet (not too hot, not too cold, just right) – the planet Mars and Europa, Jupiter’s moon. There’s a lot of speculation involved, but it’s still fascinating stuff. Europa is covered with ice, but it is continually fractured and shifting, and measurements indicate that there is a massive ocean of salt water underneath the surface – an ocean that may be 100km deep. This is an awful lot of liquid water (more than twice the amount on Earth), and Cox made the case that because we can find bacteria living and reproducing within ice on Earth, it may also be the case that similar organisms live in Europa’s ice-shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem, however, is that the very size of the ocean may exclude Europa as a source for genuinely alien life, for the simple reason that for life to evolve, it would require a very stable, static, tightly controlled environment for those fragile molecules to come together. And that will be absent in the swirling black depths of Europa’s ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that on Earth the evolution of the first self-replicating molecules – probably RNA – did not take place in “some warm little pond” as Darwin put it, but rather in some tiny bubbles in the mud on the edges of such a warm pond, that would be stable and secure enough, for long enough (perhaps hundreds of years or even more). In other words, something like a cell was required before those amazing reactions that produce life could evolve. In Europa’s case, my guess would be that something similar would be necessary (perhaps tiny bubbles in the ice) for replicant molecules to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I suggested to Jerry that something like a cell (non-organic, of course) came before its contents, he was rather rude, but what does he know? Or me? Or anyone? It is the case that spherical “protobionts” made out fats occur spontaneously, “reproduce” and have semi-permeable membranes that can see various metabolic processes occur, as shown in this first-level undergraduate textbook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="protobionts" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/protobionts.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=276" alt="" width="500" height="276"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more intriguing for me was the section that dealt with something I knew nothing about, and about which other views have tweeted their disbelief about: snottites. These are slimy structures found in some caves, which are formed by archea – simple bacteria – that are able to metabolise hydrogen sulphide (in a dramatic scene, Cox went deep into one of these caves, where the atmosphere was virtually unbreathable, his personal hydrogen sulphide alarm bleeping away), and they excrete sulphuric acid. When these organisms live in limestone caves, they actually help etch away the caves through their respiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that I didn’t know about snottites is merely my ignorance (and shame). You can find a great NASA page about them &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/cave_slime.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:279px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/snottitecluster-small.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="SnottiteCluster-small" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/snottitecluster-small.jpg?w=269&amp;amp;h=400" alt="" width="269" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snottite cluster in Snot Heaven in Cueva de Villa Luz (a.k.a. Cueva de las Sardinas), Tabasco, Mexico. Photo by Kenneth Ingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;These are not only great extremophile organisms – they look like snot! they crap out acid! –  it also reinforces the idea that even if all the conditions currently found on Earth are not met, life may still evolve. Including on Mars and Europa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is hardly surprising in a way – when life evolved here 3.5 billion years ago, Earth wasn’t like it is now. In particular, atmospheric oxygen levels were at about 0.0007% of what they are now. It took life itself to change that, in two vitally important events – the Great Oxidation Event (2.5 billion years ago which saw levels shoot up to around 8% of current, followed by another massive surge, up to present-day levels, around 650 million years ago, “shortly” before the Cambrian Explosion. But that’s another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hTKwexm514"&gt;Here’s a trailer &lt;/a&gt;for the ET episode of &lt;em&gt;The Wonders of the Solar System &lt;/em&gt;(may not work outside UK…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhn8j7S4uKU"&gt;There’s also a great spoof &lt;/a&gt;of both Cox and the mind-bending amazingness of the solar system here. The success of the spoof owes much to the imitator getting Cox’s Oldham accent more or less spot on, and folk memories of the drug-crazed ramblings of Madchester bands like the Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses. Warning: contains rude words.&lt;/p&gt;

Probably undergrads, too, although I confess that I have no real idea what the calendar for that looks like.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, good luck with all that decision-making!  Here are links to our previous posts about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too much to add to the discussion there, but here’s an opportunity to chat about the process.  My own strong feeling is that how successful you are in school (grad or undergrad) is much more up to you than up to the institution.  Most places have more good opportunities than anyone can hope to take advantage of in a limited period of time.  Take the initiative, don’t wait for good things to come to you, and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/1dfw9y"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/soichi_aurora.jpg" alt="soichi_aurora" title="soichi_aurora" width="532" height="800"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/1dfw9y"&gt;This picture&lt;/a&gt; was taken by &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/Astro_Soichi"&gt;Soichi Noguchi&lt;/a&gt; looking out of the newly installed ISS cupola, which provides dramatic vistas of space from inside the station. You can see the Soyuz module that carried astronaut &lt;a href="http://topnews.co.uk/23321-soyuz-three-astronauts-docks-iss"&gt;Tracy Caldwell Dyson&lt;/a&gt; on board– incidentally, with &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; on its way to the ISS carrying three women, this will be the first time four women will have been in space simultaneously. &lt;em&gt;[Update: According to commenter &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/05/flying-through-the-aurora-at-28000-kph/#comment-256964"&gt;Ben Honey&lt;/a&gt;, that's actually a Progress capsule, and not the Soyuz. The profile does match a Progress, so I assume he's right. I stand corrected.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is simply fantastic. The aurora, commonly called the northern lights, are caused by subatomic particles slamming into our atmosphere and ionizing the oxygen and nitrogen atoms there like shrapnel from bullets hitting a target. Guided by the Earth’s magnetic field, these particles tend to hit at high latitudes. The glow itself is similar to that of a neon sign: when the wayward electrons recombine with the atoms, they give off light. The colors are characteristic of the atom in question, and can be used to identify the atmospheric constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green glow is actually much lower than the ISS; &lt;a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/ISSAurora/"&gt;that part of the aurora is usually at a height of 100 or so kilometers (60 miles)&lt;/a&gt;, while ISS is at 400 km (240 miles). The red glow can reach higher, to more than 500 km (300 miles), so when Soichi says he is flying through the aurora he is literally correct. The fantastic speed of the ISS is apparent in the trailing of the stars in the image, and the streaking of the purple clouds below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astonishing, lovely, poetic, beautiful… and Holy Haleakala, &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt;. When we humans want and choose to, &lt;em&gt;we can fly through the northern lights&lt;/em&gt;. What else can we accomplish when we set our minds to it? &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270494515907"><id gr:original-id="http://c2d10.blogspot.com/2010/04/get-ready-for-swirl.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2a19964f454f62c9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Get Ready for the Swirl</title><published>2010-04-05T13:06:57Z</published><updated>2010-04-05T13:06:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/NutjTcnGqDc/get-ready-for-swirl.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://c2d10.blogspot.com/2010/04/get-ready-for-swirl.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Many of the participants of Connect to Decode must be boarding trains today and tomorrow.

The IPW and TBGO team are working without a break to meet the schedule. This is probably the most intensive QC exercise you can come across. So its work time folks. But you bet, you are going to have a ball of a time. It will be one great learning exercise – for everyone- including the Connect to Decoders, the PIs, the organisers and the rest of us. All of us are eagerly awaiting your arrival. Buckle up for the fast drive!...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The context is this: many in the science establishment of the day had been chafing at the premier British institution, the Royal Society, which had grown stodgy and was infested with politicians, bishops, and other such hangers-on, and they formed a new institution, the British Association for the Advancement of Science. As part of the process of establishing their identity, they struggled with coming up with an appropriate noun to describe their membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly the &amp;#39;learned&amp;#39; embraced in their wide grasp all the branches of the tree of knowledge, mathematicians as well as philologers, physical as well as antiquarian speculators. But these days are past… This difficulty was felt very oppressively by the members of the BAAS at Cambridge last summer. There was no general term by which these gentlemen&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; could describe themselves with reference to their pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Philosophers&amp;#39; was felt to be too wide and lofty a term, and was very properly forbidden them by Mr Coleridge, both in his capacity as a philologer and metaphysician. &amp;#39;Savans&amp;#39; was rather assuming and besides too French; but some ingenious gentleman [Whewell!] proposed that, by analogy with &amp;#39;artist&amp;#39;, they might form &amp;#39;scientist&amp;#39; — and added that there could be no scruple to this term since we already have such words as &amp;#39;economist&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;atheist&amp;#39;—but this was not generally palatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is so familiar: the deference to a classical scholar, poet, and 'metaphysician' (although, actually, Coleridge was no dummy and did provide thoughtful contributions), and the use of French as an insult. I would warm to the analogy with 'atheist', but apparently, that comparison almost sank the word. To be tangled with &lt;i&gt;atheism&lt;/i&gt;…oh, my. Adam Sedgwick, the geologist and devout Anglican, was in a fury about &amp;quot;scientist&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better die of this want [of a term] than bestialize our tongue by such a barbarism!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a natural extension of the word, though, and was rapidly adopted — it was in the OED by 1840.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick, by the way, was an interesting fellow despite being encumbered with an excess of faith. He was an important contributor to modern geology who named the Devonian and Cambrian. He was also an adamant creationist who vehemently opposed that whole new-fangled theory of evolution when Darwin proposed it…but Darwin was a former student, and they remained friends throughout their dispute. He also made this well known statement about conflicts between science and the Bible, which I rather like for reasons other than Sedgwick&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No opinion can be heretical, but that which is not true… Conflicting falsehoods we can comprehend; but truths can never war against each other. I affirm, therefore, that we have nothing to fear from the results of our enquiries, provided they be followed in the laborious but secure road of honest induction. In this way we may rest assured that we shall never arrive at conclusions opposed to any truth, either physical or moral, from whatever source that truth may be derived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a statement that is simultaneously scientific and anti-scientific. He's saying that we should follow the evidence whereever it may lead, confident that we will arrive at the honest truth, which is good; however, he's saying it to reassure himself and the audience that science will never be in conflict with the Bible. He was wrong. His problem was in failing to administer the same standards of truth and robust reason to his holy book that he was applying to science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wrote a review of Robert Chambers' book, &lt;i&gt;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&lt;/i&gt;, that was a pre-Darwin evolutionary account of the history of life. Sedgwick did not like it, no sir, not one bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…If the book be true, the labours of sober induction are in vain; religion is a lie; human law is a mass of folly, and a base injustice; morality is moonshine; our labours for the black people of Africa were works of madmen; and man and woman are only better beasts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would remind him that "No opinion can be heretical, but that which is not true", and that if a consequence of the examination of the natural world was a revelation that "religion is a lie," then so be it. Atheist, scientist, there isn't necessarily a heck of a lot of difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;It was initially set up as a boys' club. Women were not allowed to be members until 1853; however, about a quarter of the attendees of the early BA meetings were women. They were only allowed to attend special sessions that had been reviewed to determine if they were &lt;i&gt;suitable&lt;/i&gt; for women, however.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/on_the_etymological_associatio.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/2c_BRnmBw8Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1270490391581"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/04/new_lovecraft_film_trailer.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d706ebd128b326d6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Film"/><title type="html">New Lovecraft Film Trailer</title><published>2010-04-05T18:43:56Z</published><updated>2010-04-05T18:43:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/3itqJC2teyo/new_lovecraft_film_trailer.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/04/new_lovecraft_film_trailer.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/pd5gWGfnK5M%26hl%3Dsv_SE%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Adam, of course, has been relegated to My Close Personal Friend™ status, but still. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, Craig is a big Mythbusters fan as well. When he came up with the idea of having a robot skeleton sidekick, he turned to the one man who could realize his dream: Miles Dyson. I mean, Mythbuster Grant Imahara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/04/he_has_no_armaments_does_craig.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/04/grantimahara_rssk.jpg" alt="grantimahara_rssk" title="grantimahara_rssk" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Grant has been working feverishly on the auto-sidekick for weeks, and tonight it will be unveiled on the show! I’m really squeeing over this, and can’t wait to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love The Late Late Show for many reasons, but the biggest is Craig himself: he’s very funny, and extremely smart. He’s self-taught in many ways, and has had a rough life — he’ll be the first to say it was self-inflicted, but the bottom line is he’s pulled himself out of the muck and turned it all around. His humor is whip-crack fast, and he’s clearly a big fan of science, so of course I am powerless not to like him. Did you see &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM-Zpjo4iLI"&gt;his 5 minute rant about Copernicus&lt;/a&gt; (starting around the four minute mark)? I mean, seriously, &lt;em&gt;Copernicus?&lt;/em&gt; Craig, I less-than-three you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as part of his Robot Skeleton Army — as he calls &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/craigyferg"&gt;his Twitter followers&lt;/a&gt; — I am very pleased that he’s using this occasion to raise money for &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-18010-Portland-TV-Examiner~y2010m4d4-Craig-Ferguson-fans-hold-tweetathon-for-Lollipop-Theater?cid=publish_facebook:18010"&gt;Lollipop Theater&lt;/a&gt;, a way to get movies and TV shows to sick kids. If you see the hashtag #lollipoptheater in my own tweets today, that’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about Craig and Grant’s excellent adventure on &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/04/he_has_no_armaments_does_craig.html"&gt;NPR’s Monkey See blog&lt;/a&gt; (where I got the picture of Grant above) and in a great post by my friend &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/erincmccarthy"&gt;Erin McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4350887.html"&gt;the Popular Mechanics site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And check your local listings for Craig’s show tonight. It’s on CBS, and is usually at 12:35 a.m. (11:35 p.m. central) though it may be delayed by basketball. And remember: it’s a great day for America everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:604px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/GD5248564@LONDON-NOVEMBER-08-8519.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="77762462CG003_UNPACKAGED_IS" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/04/GD5248564@LONDON-NOVEMBER-08-8519.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="390"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulk Foods at London&amp;#39;s Unpackaged (photo: Martin Argles/The Guardian)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://beunpackaged.com/"&gt;Unpackaged&lt;/a&gt; – At first glance, the list of products sold in this London shop sound like typical natural grocery stock: brown rice, muesli, organic olive oil, goat cheese, organic beer…the list goes on. But what makes Unpackaged so cool is all that stuff is, well, unpackaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine Conway started the shop in 2006, first as a small market stall, then as an actual storefront in northeast London. The idea was simply to provide groceries she liked, but without all the packaging. Customers bring their own jars, bottles, reusable bags, and Tupperware containers to buy kitchen staples, cutting out the need for excess non-biodegradable plastic bags. Even English puddings are sold in muslin cloths instead of tins or plastic containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop also happens to be elegantly designed, judging from this &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gallery/2007/nov/08/fooddrinks?picture=331207733"&gt;photo  slideshow&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. Its design – with super-modern, clean bulk bins and sleek refillable Ecover containers – is just as forward-thinking as the concept of zero packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just wish Conway would expand and open a few branches in the States. Know of a similar grocer in your area? Tell us about them below!&lt;/p&gt;

However, where the idea came from is less frequently retold (why, I don't know).  The polymath &lt;a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Somerville.html"&gt;Mary Fairfax Somerville&lt;/a&gt; described the situation before this discovery in her science popularization, &lt;i&gt;The Connexion of the Physical Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, first published in 1834:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The tables of Jupiter and Saturn agree almost perfectly with modern observation; those of Uranus, however, are already defective, probably, because the discovery of that planet in 1781 is too recent to admit of much precision in the determination of its motions, or that possibly it may be subject to disturbances from some unseen planet revolving about the sun beyond the present boundaries of our system.  If, after a lapse of years, the tables formed from a combination of numerous observations should be still inadequate to represent the motions of Uranus, the discrepancies may reveal the existence, nay even the mass and orbit of a body placed for ever beyond the sphere of vision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To coin a phrase, forevermore is shorter than before:  &lt;a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Adams.html"&gt;John Couch Adams&lt;/a&gt; read that passage in the sixth edition (1842) of Somerville's book and &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3604481?seq=4"&gt;was inspired&lt;/a&gt; to work out "the mass and orbit" of the body in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it wasn’t just emotional incontinence. He kept a large empire together in difficult times, expanded and, in many ways, improved it. It may not have been bad psychology for the people around him to fear his wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the rage was real, Henry’s contribution to standardising and centralising the law of his kingdom cannot be doubted. He energetically travelled miles to supervise legal proceedings, championed the use of juries and established the Royal Magistrate Courts. He also oversaw the decline in the outmoded use of trials by ordeal and combat.&lt;/p&gt;
