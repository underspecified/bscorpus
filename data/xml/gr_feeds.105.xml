They thus &lt;a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-01-23/obama-vs-the-press/" title=""&gt;equate&lt;/a&gt; Gibbs to Fleischer/Perino/McClellan and equate Obama to Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they are myopic and wrong.  And &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2009/01/20/write_self.html" title=""&gt;Jay Rosen explains&lt;/a&gt; why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush dissed the press by suppressing information. Obama disses the press by giving information directly to the people (just you wait, these are early days, but they are preparing for some serious two-way communication between the WH and the people). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From press' point of view - both are dissing them. From the point of view of democracy, its 180 degrees apart - what is important is if the information is available to the people, not the method (and filters) via which it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rove stonewalled the press in order to manipulate the message himself. Obama stonewalls the press in order to prevent the press from manipulating the message through High Broderism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If being blocked and being by-passed feels the same to the Washington press corpa, this means they are not aware or interested in availability of information, but only in their exclusive rights to get it and process it. They think they are supposed to be the gatekeepers and High Priests and hate seeing their authority destroyed and ridiculed. Which explains why they hate bloggers - it's jealousy: this President uses bloggy channels instead of going through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is good. Instead of going through two filters (WH+Press), information goes through only one (WH). Twice as much chance we'll get correct information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every White House will carefully manage the information coming out. Bush WH managed it by not letting any information out at all, unless they wanted something "leaked".  The Press Secretaries' job was to provide slogan of the day, and the press dutifully copied the slogans into next mornings' papers. Interesting how they are always good scribes for Republican Presidents, while looking for Monika's with all their might when it's a Democrat in the WH. Yup, "liberal press"...and I am the Pope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama WH will also manage information, but their credo is transparency. But you can't have full transparency if the message is distorted by the inane, gotcha, cocktail-circuit Washington press. You can't have transparency if the press is out to get you because their God is Broder. Just because they sip champagne with Republicans does not mean that the country is really center-right as the DC bubble believes, but they have no intention to take a hike through the countryside and mix up with the proles, so they will never learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve transparency, Obama WH must disable the filters imposed by the press, as those filters distort the information. Thus, Gibbs' job is to make sure that information bypasses the press, so it can freely flow to the people. His job is to keep the press occupied in the Press Room, diverted and distracted for long hours every day, while the information is going out to the people unhindered, via modern and filter-free channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish someone with Photoshop skills would draw this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panel #1: WH with wagons circled around it, each wagon with a face of Bush, Cheney, Rove, McLellan, Perino and Fleischer. An arrow (or 2-3 arrows) named "information" comes out of WH and bounces off a wagon right back in, nothing escapes. The press is depicted as a piece of paper and a feather-pen (or old mechanical  typewriter) with a picture of Broder who is visibly dismayed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panel #2: WH with just one wagon depicting Gibbs. Broder press still dismayed. Smiling Obama sends arrows ("information") from the WH straight to the cheering people (perhaps sitting at their computers, or checking Twitter on their iPhones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international research team of scientists from UC Riverside, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other institutions has found the oldest evidence for animals in the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined sedimentary rocks in south Oman, and found an anomalously high amount of steroids that date back to 635 million years ago, to around the end of the last ice age. The steroids are produced by sponges – one of the simplest forms of multicellular animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that the discovery of the sponges is evidence for multicellular animal life beginning 100 million years before the Cambrian explosion, a well-studied and unique episode in Earth history that began about 530 million years ago when, as indicated by the fossil record, animal life diversified rapidly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 635 million years old. For those keeping track, that’s 634,994,000 years before the creation of the entire universe, according to Young Earth Creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

Capricorn, Taurus, Aquarius, Aries, and Leo. Well that means I won’t be working for them. Tragic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you want to get a good laugh, here is the company’s ACTUAL defense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statistical study indicated that almost all of our best employees across Austria have one of the five star signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s how Austrians responded to this nonsense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was followed by a wave of protests from equality groups and led to an investigation by the country’s anti-discrimination authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of what we face in the U.S. for equally absurd prejudices.  So in case anyone demands to know what’s the harm in people believing a little astrology, tell them about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…of why we keep harping on this. A couple of days ago &lt;em&gt;The Scientist&lt;/em&gt; reported that the “economic stimulus package” may include a windfall for the NIH: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/55398/"&gt;Senate OKs big NIH bump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posted by &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/browse/blogger/31/"&gt;Bob Grant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Entry posted at 4th February 2009 04:12 PM GMT]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table width="90%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left" valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Senate, which is furiously debating the details of the economic stimulus package making its way through Congress, passed an amendment yesterday (Feb. 3) to add $6.5 billion in National Institutes of Health funding on top of the $3.5 billion already allotted to the agency in the bill…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how an NIH funding increase will be spent remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can bet that if this happens, the NCCAM will be licking its chops for some of that lettuce. Let’s continue to explore why it shouldn’t get any…   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NCCAM Insiders Join the Fib Fest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=351"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, we saw abundant evidence that the late NCCAM Director Stephen Straus and Deputy Director Margaret Chesney had stretched the truth in objecting to a critical &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16857923?dopt=Abstract"&gt;2006 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; by Drs. Donald Marcus and Arthur Grollman. In that article, Marcus and Grollman had mentioned a lost opportunity to submit the Center to responsible scrutiny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) was commissioned by NIH and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to “explore scientific, policy and practice questions that arise from the significant and increasing use of CAM [complementary and alternative medicine] therapies by the American public.” One of three tasks assigned to the IOM Committee was to “Identify major scientific, policy and practice issues related to CAM research.” Seven of the 17 committee members were CAM practitioners or directed CAM and integrative medicine centers…Unfortunately, the IOM committee did not evaluate the quality of NCCAM-funded trials or the value of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on CAM research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those comments apparently got under the skin of academics who feed at the NCCAM trough, because a couple of months later a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17110556?dopt=Abstract"&gt;letter &lt;/a&gt;appeared in &lt;em&gt;Science, &lt;/em&gt;authored by 7 of them: &lt;a href="http://www.osher.ucsf.edu/bios/folkman.html"&gt;Susan Folkman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.compmed.umm.edu/integrative/bberman-bio.asp"&gt;Brian Berman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=23653"&gt;Stuart Bondurant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.osher.hms.harvard.edu/people.asp"&gt;David Eisenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051217050359/http://som.georgetown.edu/cam/GUmed.pdf"&gt;Aviad Haramati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.csh.umn.edu/csh/about/centerstaff/kreitzer/home.html"&gt;Mary Jo Kreitzer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.rosenthal.hs.columbia.edu/Staff.html"&gt;Fredi Kronenberg&lt;/a&gt; (Bondurant, Berman, Eisenberg, and Folkman had been members of the &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/IOM/camcommittee.html"&gt;IOM Committee&lt;/a&gt;). They wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus and Grollman miss the mark…The processes through which proposals are submitted, reviewed, funded, and managed are all consistent with standard NIH practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcus and Grollman’s comment that the NCCAM research agenda is shaped more by politics than by science is gratuitous, as is their suggestion that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, &lt;em&gt;Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States&lt;/em&gt;, was flawed because some of the members of the panel were NCCAM grantees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No: Marcus and Grollman were exactly correct, as abundantly shown by &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;the history&lt;/a&gt; of the NCCAM, the memberships of its &lt;a href="http://csicop.org/si/2003-09/alternative-medicine.html"&gt;advisory councils&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=36"&gt;projects &lt;/a&gt;that it has funded, including the chelation trial and the Gonzalez trial, and much more that has been discussed or referenced on this site. To call the pro-”CAM” IOM report “flawed” is not gratuitous. It is an &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/07PoliticalActivities/iomreport.html"&gt;understatement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “CAM”7 asserted the fundamental scientific and ethical fallacy of human trials of implausible claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because CAM is already in the public domain, used by millions of people at a cost of billions of dollars each year and with health effects that largely have not yet been scientifically evaluated, it is appropriate that a significant focus be on clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, “clinical research” means human trials. I have previously explained why the “popularity” rationale is wrong: &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=97"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;em&gt;The Fallacy of Popularity&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://csicop.org/si/2003-09/alternative-medicine.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;em&gt;Human Studies Ethics and CAM&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7 offered a curious justification for why negative trials of implausible claims, such as those discussed in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=351"&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt; of this series, shouldn’t deter the NCCAM from pursuing more studies of the same claims:    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is true in clinical trials with new conventional drugs, we should expect that many trials of CAM treatments will not show definitive efficacy, and as with most research on understudied agents, multiple studies are often needed to develop a research base adequate for mature judgment concerning efficacy or the lack thereof. We need to be patient and use our best tool, that is, science, to understand and evaluate these widely used health practices. We believe that NCCAM has established a standard not for advocacy, but rather for rigorous objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers not familiar with the science and ethics of human trials, or with the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=68"&gt;misleading language&lt;/a&gt; of “CAM” advocates, might not recognize the deceptive content of that statement. First, drug trials, unlike their “CAM” counterparts, begin with &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=42"&gt;plausible hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;. That is because good science demands it, but also, as explained by the &lt;a href="http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm"&gt;Declaration of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, it is true that many clinical trials of new “conventional” drugs don’t show “definitive efficacy”; in almost all such cases, however, those drugs are quickly discarded. It is only when early trials &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; suggest efficacy that “multiple studies are often needed” or even justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their attempt to blur those distinctions, the “CAM”7 inadvertently exposed NCCAM processes as &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being “consistent with standard NIH practice.” According to the &lt;a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/NIHGPS_Part5.htm#_Toc54600085"&gt;NIH Grant Policy Statement&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be eligible for NIH funding, all clinical research involving INDs [Investigational New Drugs], drugs approved for a different indication, or experimental combinations of drugs must meet FDA’s IND regulations, FDA’s human subjects’ protection requirements, and HHS’s human subjects’ requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is language from the FDA’s regulations entitled “&lt;a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=312&amp;amp;showFR=1"&gt;INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION&lt;/a&gt;“:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?FR=312.21"&gt;Sec. 312.21 Phases of an investigation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) &lt;em&gt;Phase 3.&lt;/em&gt; Phase 3 studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. &lt;strong&gt;They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained&lt;/strong&gt;, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include from several hundred to several thousand subjects. [Emphasis added]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That regulation is not merely a definition. There are compelling scientific, ethical, and public policy reasons for not pursuing wild gooses of the sort that almost all NCCAM-sponsored trials chase. It’s rare enough for people with pretty good ideas about how nature works to generate fruitful hypotheses, as discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=49"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;under &lt;em&gt;Most Hypotheses are Wrong… . &lt;/em&gt;Human trials require a much higher prior probability of the hypothesis being correct than do laboratory trials: it is not ethically acceptable to exploit human subjects to test what &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/283/20/2701"&gt;Emanuel et al&lt;/a&gt; termed “trifling hypotheses,” nor is it ethical to allocate scarce research funds to such notions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT), named by Drs. Marcus and Grollman as deserving of comment and discussed at some length in the last post, is a Phase III trial of a combination of drugs for which there are not only no laboratory or animal studies suggesting effectiveness, but for which there is preliminary laboratory and substantial human evidence suggesting &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;effectiveness and danger: see &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18596934"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;em&gt;RCTs Revisited&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Risks for Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;EDTA Chelation and Supplements. &lt;/em&gt;This is hardly “consistent with standard NIH practice.” The TACT, like the Gonzalez trial and the NCCAM itself, was shaped by politics and rationalized by misrepresentations of science, as documented &lt;a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_house_hearings&amp;amp;docid=f:59973.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18596934"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/48041725.html?dids=48041725:48041725&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;amp;date=Jan+18%2C+2000&amp;amp;author=Susan+Okie&amp;amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;amp;edition=&amp;amp;startpage=A.01&amp;amp;desc=Maverick+Treatments+Find+U.S.+Funding%3B+Cancer+Therapy+to+Be+Tested+Despite+Mainstream+Medical+Doubts"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The “CAM”7: Fools or Frauds?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must wonder how the “CAM”7 could not have known at least some of these facts. Are the 7, purportedly clinical researchers all, ignorant of the Declaration of Helsinki (the consensus world opinion on human studies ethics), adherence to which almost every major medical journal &lt;a href="http://www.icmje.org/"&gt;expects &lt;/a&gt;as a condition of publishing research findings? Is it possible that Fredi Kronenberg, who heads Columbia University’s &lt;a href="http://www.rosenthal.hs.columbia.edu/index.html"&gt;“CAM” program&lt;/a&gt;, was unaware of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=92"&gt;origins &lt;/a&gt;or the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=298"&gt;fate &lt;/a&gt;of the Gonzalez trial, as we wondered last week about Straus himself? It was Kronenberg who, according to Victor Herbert, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=92"&gt;had first hired Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt; to give lectures at Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Berman was a member of the NCCAM Advisory Council that, &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/about/naccam/minutes/2000may.htm#p8"&gt;in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, passed the “concept” of a trial of “EDTA Chelation Therapy for Coronary Artery Disease,” by a vote of 11 in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstentions. So was &lt;a href="http://www.osher.hms.harvard.edu/peoplebio.asp?name=kaptchuk"&gt;Ted Kaptchuk&lt;/a&gt;, David Eisenberg’s Right-Hand Man at Harvard Medical School. Were Berman, Kaptchuk, and the rest of the Council aware of the &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18596934#id603659"&gt;history, science, and politics&lt;/a&gt; of chelation advocacy? If so, how could they not have opposed a trial? If not, why were they chosen to pass judgment on such a trial (to be funded by taxpayers), and why did they not recuse themselves? Either way, the “CAM”7’s above-quoted charges about “missing the mark” and “gratuitous” comments are categorically false, and they know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brian “Boondoggle” Berman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Berman is the Director of the University of Maryland &lt;a href="http://www.compmed.umm.edu/integrative/default.asp"&gt;&lt;font color="#585d8b"&gt;Center for Integrative Medicine&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He is the first author of the NCCAM-funded “&lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/acu-osteo.htm"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt;” of acupuncture for osteoarthritis of the knee, discussed at some length last week. Recall that within 3 years of the report’s publication in 2004, its claimed findings, &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/141/12/901.pdf"&gt;equivocal &lt;/a&gt;to begin with, had been disconfirmed: first by another &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/145/1/12.pdf"&gt;controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; twice the size of Berman’s, and shortly thereafter by a &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/146/12/868"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by…Berman!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his &lt;a href="http://www.compmed.umm.edu/integrative/bberman-bio.asp"&gt;bio &lt;/a&gt;on the U. Maryland website, we learn that “Dr. Berman is one of the most highly funded National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers in the area of integrative and complementary medicine, receiving over $30 million over the past 14 years.” We also learn that he still considers his “landmark study [to have shown] acupuncture to be a safe and effective therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee.” He told the same thing to the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/health/research/30tria.html?_r=1"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; only last fall. Has he repudiated his recent meta-analysis? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berman reports that he has been a major player at the OAM and the NCCAM from their beginnings, and was a member of the &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/07PoliticalActivities/iomreport.html"&gt;IOM panel&lt;/a&gt; on “CAM.” He was the “first chair of the &lt;a href="http://www.bravewell.org/transforming_healthcare/changing_physician_education/about_cahcim/"&gt;Consortium &lt;/a&gt;of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine” and received “the prestigious &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=Bravewell"&gt;Bravewell &lt;/a&gt;Leadership Award.” It is ironic that Berman worked for years with &lt;a href="http://nursing.umaryland.edu/faculty/osah/bausell.htm"&gt;R. Barker Bausell&lt;/a&gt;, a statistician who eventually concluded, even without considering prior probability, that “CAM” research is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4"&gt;Snake Oil Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and that “CAM” treatments are “nothing more than cleverly packaged placebos.” After Bausell’s book was published, according to the Baltimore Sun (quoted &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.org.uk/forum/showpost.php?p=31221&amp;amp;postcount=4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brian Berman…said he skimmed the book, calling its arguments “misleading about what the state of research is.” He called any conclusions about the value of CAM premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see: in 2007, Dr. Berman co-authored a meta-analysis that demonstrated acupuncture to be ineffective for osteoarthritis of the knee; in 2008 he &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/health/research/30tria.html?_r=1"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; that his 2004 “landmark study”—one of nine included in his meta-analysis—”establishes that acupuncture is an effective complement to conventional arthritis treatment.” Whose arguments are misleading about the state of “CAM” research? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, moreover, “any conclusions about the value of CAM [are] premature,” there can’t be any justification for spending public moneys to create &lt;a href="http://www.compmed.umm.edu/integrative/default.asp"&gt;“integrative medicine” centers&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating evidence-based complementary therapies into clinical care to help people achieve and maintain optimal health and well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can there? Dr. Berman’s most recent &lt;a href="http://somvweb.som.umaryland.edu/absolutenm/templates/?a=425&amp;amp;z=13"&gt;new hire&lt;/a&gt;, by the way, is Margaret Chesney, the NCCAM Deputy Director who had helped Director Stephen Straus stretch the truth in responding to Drs. Marcus and Grollman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Incest is Best &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of the paragraph in which the “CAM”7 accused Drs. Marcus and Grollman of “gratuitous” comments is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, like NIH, the IOM has procedures for recognizing and managing conflicts of interest. Those of us who participated in it were very mindful of any potential conflicts of interest and guarded against them in our deliberations. Further, the report was carefully reviewed by external, independent reviewers before publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in a world of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shruggies &lt;/a&gt;could such a blatant and insulting disregard for common sense—the sense, for example, to know a “made guy” when we see one—not trigger a scandal. Does anyone really buy that this tiny clique of academic fools (or frauds) is not wallowing together in one big vat of oily schmooze, oozing with conflicts of interest?&lt;/p&gt;

Teague says he is asking men and women everywhere to join him in prayer for America on March 4th.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh I see, they’re going to &lt;em&gt;pray&lt;/em&gt; also.  Well that’s a relief.  For a minute I thought it was going to be a walk only – a purely symbolic act that would make people feel they’re doing something but ultimately would have absolutely no effect at all.  But they’re going to &lt;em&gt;pray&lt;/em&gt; as well.  Phew!  Good to know this Teague guy has fully thought this through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best bit was at the end:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teague says he he has no doubt that God has blessed a drought stricken Johnson County with rain and snow recently because so many people have fought to keep the Ten Commandments in the courthouse. “It works at this level, and God can work at any level, and I believe he will.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wow, Teague has never heard of &lt;strong&gt;winter&lt;/strong&gt;.  I guess it’s not mentioned in the bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20111684c8ca1970c-pi" style="display:block"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20111684c8fca970c-pi" style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Scottteague" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20111684c8fca970c-800wi" style="width:204px;height:307px" title="Scottteague"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Strycharz, Craig S. Hollingsworth, Si Hyeock Lee, J. Marshall Clark (2008). Biochemical and Molecular Analysis of Deltamethrin Resistance in the Common Bed Bug (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Journal of Medical Entomology, 45&lt;/span&gt; (6), 1092-1101 DOI: &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585(2008)45%5B1092:BAMAOD%5D2.0.CO;2"&gt;10.1603/0022-2585(2008)45[1092:BAMAOD]2.0.CO;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues in bed bug control right now is the development of resistance to insecticides. In fact, the New York City population of bedbugs used in this study was &lt;strong&gt;264-fold more resistant&lt;/strong&gt; to 1% deltapermethrin compared with a population collected in Florida!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way:  the Florida bed bugs were killed in 19 minutes; the New York bedbugs took 5,048 minutes, or over 3.5 days, to die.  Uh Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research  paper itself is a rather technical evaluation of just how and where, in terms of molecular biology, the mutation that makes the bed bugs resistant occurs.  Interestingly, it’s &lt;em&gt;kdr&lt;/em&gt; resistance once again! (&lt;em&gt;kdr&lt;/em&gt; stands for “Knock-Down Resistance.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/ddt-malaria-insecticide-resistance/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;kdr&lt;/em&gt; mutations&lt;/a&gt; several &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/10/22/new-malaria-research-insecticide-cross-resistance/"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; here at the Bug Blog in discussions about DDT.  Basically, most insecticides act as a nerve poison for insects.  Insecticides block  &lt;a title="animation of ion flow" href="http://www.biology4all.com/resources_library/source/63.swf"&gt;ion flow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.bishopstopford.com/faculties/science/arthur/synapse.swf"&gt;(alternate animation)&lt;/a&gt; across a nerve membrane by attacking sodium channels. If the nerve can’t &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bookres.fcgi/neurosci/ch3f12.gif"&gt;depolarize&lt;/a&gt;, the cell (and animal) is effectively paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kdr&lt;/em&gt; mutations are usually &lt;a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=pointmutation"&gt;point mutations&lt;/a&gt; — a tiny change in one amino acid in a giant string of DNA.  It makes just enough of a change to make the bugs resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kdr&lt;/em&gt; mutations are also problematic because they often make a bug resistant to more than one insecticide. This means that an already difficult to control insect just got a lot harder to kill, since your tools (insecticides) wear out faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This evidence suggests that the two mutations are likely the major resistance-causing mutations in the deltamethrin-resistant NY-BB through a knockdown-type nerve insensitivity mechanism.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND:&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Because DDT has been used indiscriminately to control many insect pest species including bed bug, the widespread and frequent use of DDT is likely to have predisposed bed bug populations to pyrethroid resistance through the neuronal insensitivity mechanism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this new information tell us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DDT will be utterly useless against bed bugs, so people should stop asking for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re going to need a lot more research on ways to kill bedbugs other than just poisoning them with the usual pesticide suspects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In cities where there are active bed bug populations, insecticide choice for resistance management will be very important in urban entomology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bedbugs are not going to go away, and you should probably be getting a little paranoid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, you know, you weren’t &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; paranoid when you read &lt;a href="http://bedbugger.com/2008/08/22/usa-today-focuses-on-bed-bugs-in-dorms/"&gt;stuff like this&lt;/a&gt;.  What a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

So what is this super duper offensive advertising slogan that was too hot for Halifax? It must be pretty damned bad considering the Halifax Metro Transit previously accepted ads from Vagina Monologue ads that included the slogan “The Vaginas are coming” to ads for an anti-choice organization known as “Birthright.” So what was the super duper, ultra-offensive ad slogan that got denied?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can be good without God&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of a bitch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it?! That’s the slogan that the Halifax Metro Transit found so objectionable. Here’s what they had to say about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… We are not able to accept your message as it currently reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to submit an alternative message, we will submit that for approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All advertisements must meet acceptable community standards of good taste, quality and appearance. Furthermore, the ads will not be considered discriminatory, or objectionable to any race creed or moral standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so how do you make a less objectionable version of the slogan “You could be good without God” without losing the overall message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in London, &lt;a href="http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/878758/Christians-launch-anti-atheist-bus-campaign/"&gt;counter-atheist-ads&lt;/a&gt; are cropping up. They read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psalm 53.1: “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 47 million years ago, a whale was about to give birth to her young … on land. That’s according to skeletal remains of a pregnant cetacean whose fetus was positioned head-down as is the case for land mammals but not aquatic whales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000280" title=""&gt;Social Contact Networks and Disease Eradicability under Voluntary Vaccination&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Interest in infectious disease models that incorporate the effects of human behavior has been growing in recent years. However, most of these models predict that it should never be possible to eradicate a disease under voluntary vaccination, due to nonvaccinating "free riders" that emerge when vaccine coverage is high. This prediction contradicts the fact that smallpox was eradicated under a voluntary vaccination policy in many jurisdictions, and that other diseases such as polio are likewise near eradication. These previous models assumed that populations mix homogeneously. However, for some diseases, such as HIV and smallpox, individuals are more likely to get the disease from certain social contacts. Here we show that using a network model that captures this social structure can reconcile the previous theories to the empirical fact that diseases can be eradicated under voluntary vaccination. When infection is transmitted only through close contacts in the network, then an outbreak can be quickly contained using only voluntary vaccination. However, when infection can potentially be transmitted to almost everyone in the network (such as for measles), a disease outbreak can never be contained using voluntary vaccination. This latter observation may have some relevance to the Measles-Mumps-Rubella autism "vaccine scare."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000365" title=""&gt;Genome-Wide Association Studies in an Isolated Founder Population from the Pacific Island of Kosrae&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Isolated populations have contributed to the discovery of loci with simple Mendelian segregation and large effects on disease risk or trait variation. We hypothesized that the use of isolated populations might also facilitate the discovery of common alleles contributing to complex traits with relatively larger effects. However, the use of association analyses to map common loci influencing trait variation in large, inbred cohorts introduces analytic challenges, as extensive relatedness between subjects violates the assumptions of independence upon which traditional association test statistics are based. We developed an analytic strategy to perform genome-wide association studies in an inbred family containing over 2,800 individuals from the island of Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia. No alleles with large effect were observed with strong statistical support in any of the 15 traits examined, suggesting that the contribution of individual common variants to complex trait variation in Kosraens is typically not much greater than that observed in other populations. We show that the effects of many loci previously identified in Caucasian populations are indistinguishable in Caucasians and Kosraens, despite very different population genetics and environmental influences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000366" title=""&gt;A Gene-Based Linkage Map for Bicyclus anynana Butterflies Allows for a Comprehensive Analysis of Synteny with the Lepidopteran Reference Genome&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lepidopterans (butterflies and moths) are a rich and diverse order of insects, which, despite their economic impact and unusual biological properties, are relatively underrepresented in terms of genomic resources. The genome of the silkworm Bombyx mori has been fully sequenced, but comparative lepidopteran genomics has been hampered by the scarcity of information for other species. This is especially striking for butterflies, even though they have diverse and derived phenotypes (such as color vision and wing color patterns) and are considered prime models for the evolutionary and developmental analysis of ecologically relevant, complex traits. We focus on Bicyclus anynana butterflies, a laboratory system for studying the diversification of novelties and serially repeated traits. With a panel of 12 small families and a biphasic mapping approach, we first assigned 508 expressed genes to segregation groups and then ordered 297 of them within individual linkage groups. We also coarsely mapped seven color pattern loci. This is the richest gene-based map available for any butterfly species and allowed for a broad-coverage analysis of synteny with the lepidopteran reference genome. Based on 462 pairs of mapped orthologous markers in Bi. anynana and Bo. mori, we observed strong conservation of gene assignment to chromosomes, but also evidence for numerous large- and small-scale chromosomal rearrangements. With gene collections growing for a variety of target organisms, the ability to place those genes in their proper genomic context is paramount. Methods to map expressed genes and to compare maps with relevant model systems are crucial to extend genomic-level analysis outside classical model species. Maps with gene-based markers are useful for comparative genomics and to resolve mapped genomic regions to a tractable number of candidate genes, especially if there is synteny with related model species. This is discussed in relation to the identification of the loci contributing to color pattern evolution in butterflies.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_28.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/DT_8WruZsRg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233889274425"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/todays_carnivals_332.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c78469fbd9c8187b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-02-06T01:53:13Z</published><updated>2009-02-06T01:53:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Jdoqf394oSc/todays_carnivals_332.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/todays_carnivals_332.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I and the Bird #93: The Compelling Nature of Birds - now up on &lt;a href="http://vickiehenderson.blogspot.com/2009/02/compelling-nature-of-birds.html" title=""&gt;Vickie Henderson Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004378" title=""&gt;Web Queries as a Source for Syndromic Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the field of syndromic surveillance, various sources are exploited for outbreak detection, monitoring and prediction. This paper describes a study on queries submitted to a medical web site, with influenza as a case study. The hypothesis of the work was that queries on influenza and influenza-like illness would provide a basis for the estimation of the timing of the peak and the intensity of the yearly influenza outbreaks that would be as good as the existing laboratory and sentinel surveillance. We calculated the occurrence of various queries related to influenza from search logs submitted to a Swedish medical web site for two influenza seasons. These figures were subsequently used to generate two models, one to estimate the number of laboratory verified influenza cases and one to estimate the proportion of patients with influenza-like illness reported by selected General Practitioners in Sweden. We applied an approach designed for highly correlated data, partial least squares regression. In our work, we found that certain web queries on influenza follow the same pattern as that obtained by the two other surveillance systems for influenza epidemics, and that they have equal power for the estimation of the influenza burden in society. Web queries give a unique access to ill individuals who are not (yet) seeking care. This paper shows the potential of web queries as an accurate, cheap and labour extensive source for syndromic surveillance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neurospheres (NS) are colonies of neural stem and precursor cells capable of differentiating into the central nervous system (CNS) cell lineages upon appropriate culture conditions: neurons, and glial cells. NS were originally derived from the embryonic and adult mouse striatum subventricular zone. More recently, experimental evidence substantiated the isolation of NS from almost any region of the CNS, including the hypothalamus. Here we report a protocol that enables to generate large quantities of NS from both fetal and adult rat hypothalami. We found that either FGF-2 or EGF were capable of inducing NS formation from fetal hypothalamic cultures, but that only FGF-2 is effective in the adult cultures. The hypothalamic-derived NS are capable of differentiating into neurons and glial cells and most notably, as demonstrated by immunocytochemical detection with a specific anti-GnRH antibody, the fetal cultures contain cells that exhibit a GnRH phenotype upon differentiation. This in vitro model should be useful to study the molecular mechanisms involved in GnRH neuronal differentiation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004403" title=""&gt;The Cost of Simplifying Air Travel When Modeling Disease Spread&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Air travel plays a key role in the spread of many pathogens. Modeling the long distance spread of infectious disease in these cases requires an air travel model. Highly detailed air transportation models can be over determined and computationally problematic. We compared the predictions of a simplified air transport model with those of a model of all routes and assessed the impact of differences on models of infectious disease. Using U.S. ticket data from 2007, we compared a simplified &amp;quot;pipe&amp;quot; model, in which individuals flow in and out of the air transport system based on the number of arrivals and departures from a given airport, to a fully saturated model where all routes are modeled individually. We also compared the pipe model to a &amp;quot;gravity&amp;quot; model where the probability of travel is scaled by physical distance; the gravity model did not differ significantly from the pipe model. The pipe model roughly approximated actual air travel, but tended to overestimate the number of trips between small airports and underestimate travel between major east and west coast airports. For most routes, the maximum number of false (or missed) introductions of disease is small (&amp;lt;1 per day) but for a few routes this rate is greatly underestimated by the pipe model. If our interest is in large scale regional and national effects of disease, the simplified pipe model may be adequate. If we are interested in specific effects of interventions on particular air routes or the time for the disease to reach a particular location, a more complex point-to-point model will be more accurate. For many problems a hybrid model that independently models some frequently traveled routes may be the best choice. Regardless of the model used, the effect of simplifications and sensitivity to errors in parameter estimation should be analyzed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004409" title=""&gt;Antiproliferative Effect of Ascorbic Acid Is Associated with the Inhibition of Genes Necessary to Cell Cycle Progression&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ascorbic acid (AA), or Vitamin C, is most well known as a nutritional supplement with antioxidant properties. Recently, we demonstrated that high concentrations of AA act on PMP22 gene expression and partially correct the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease phenotype in a mouse model. This is due to the capacity of AA, but not other antioxidants, to down-modulate cAMP intracellular concentration by a competitive inhibition of the adenylate cyclase enzymatic activity. Because of the critical role of cAMP in intracellular signalling, we decided to explore the possibility that ascorbic acid could modulate the expression of other genes. Using human pangenomic microarrays, we found that AA inhibited the expression of two categories of genes necessary for cell cycle progression, tRNA synthetases and translation initiation factor subunits. In in vitro assays, we demonstrated that AA induced the S-phase arrest of proliferative normal and tumor cells. Highest concentrations of AA leaded to necrotic cell death. However, quiescent cells were not susceptible to AA toxicity, suggesting the blockage of protein synthesis was mainly detrimental in metabolically-active cells. Using animal models, we found that high concentrations of AA inhibited tumor progression in nude mice grafted with HT29 cells (derived from human colon carcinoma). Consistently, expression of tRNA synthetases and ieF2 appeared to be specifically decreased in tumors upon AA treatment. AA has an antiproliferative activity, at elevated concentration that could be obtained using IV injection. This activity has been observed in vitro as well in vivo and likely results from the inhibition of expression of genes involved in protein synthesis. Implications for a clinical use in anticancer therapies will be discussed.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_120.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/em1GlSFvp4c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233884247364"><id gr:original-id="484 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9058fd02d9a414d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Jeni Barnett" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/582"/><category term="MMR" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/302"/><title type="html">Jeni Barnett on MMR - The Complete Show</title><published>2009-02-06T00:24:56Z</published><updated>2009-02-06T00:24:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/484" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[bpsdb]&lt;/b&gt; This is hosted on &lt;a href="http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Bad_Science:_Jeni_Barnett_MMR_and_vaccination_slot_on_LBC_radio%2C_2009"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt;, so if I'm asked to take this link down, you can find it there (I am not hosting it on layscience.net).

It&amp;#39;s a two-school district, the elementary school (PK-5) and the high school (6-12). The total &lt;a href="http://www.greatschools.net/schools.page?district=179&amp;amp;state=TX"&gt;district enrollment is about 340 students&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an article at &lt;a href="http://democracyforamerica.com/blog_posts/27752-texas-teacher-suspended-for-being-liberal-and-an-atheist"&gt;Democracy for America&lt;/a&gt;, the teacher, Richard Mullens, taught history and government.  On  January 16, Mr. Mullens was put on paid administrative leave  for being &amp;quot;an atheist&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;too liberal&amp;quot;.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reaction from &lt;a href="http://westtennessee.blogspot.com/2009/01/i-really-really-need-your-help.html"&gt;one of  Mr. Mullens&amp;#39; students&lt;/a&gt;  at Brad Watkins&amp;#39; &lt;a href="http://westtennessee.blogspot.com/"&gt;Confession of a West Tennessee Liberal:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://westtennessee.blogspot.com/2009/01/i-really-really-need-your-help.html?showComment=1233616440000#c284460861653053275"&gt;I would like to start this comment&lt;/a&gt; off by saying I am a student in Brookeland ISD and have had Mr. Mullens as my history teacher since junior high. I am now a junior in school. Mr Mullens is a great teacher. Since when should we start judging teachers by their religious beliefs? What we&amp;#39;re dealing with here is not fair. They have jumped from one thing to the next here. What&amp;#39;s happening here is not just. I have learned so much from Mullens the past few years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chain of events: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 7, 2008, in a conversation between Mr. Mullens and the then-superintendent Lana Comeaux:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Ms. Comeaux] asked me if I was an atheist and I refused to answer the question. I said, &amp;quot;I won&amp;#39;t play this game. I didn&amp;#39;t know you had to take a religious test to be a teacher in the state of Texas.&amp;quot; Nothing was said after that point, although there was a lot of tension among the other coaches about whether they would be able to keep their jobs or not, because [Ms. Comeaux] also told them that many of them were on the list.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 7, 2009-- a female student leaves Mr. Mullens&amp;#39; classroom to tell the principal that there was an inappropriate discussion in his classroom.  The student&amp;#39;s mother also came to school, and had words with the principal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 12, 2009--a meeting between the mother, the school principal, and Mr. Mullens was held in the principal&amp;#39;s office. In Mr. Mullen&amp;#39;s words: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 [Mother of Student] was very angry. She accused me of being an atheist, saying I was too liberal, and that I allowed the students to talk about inappropriate things in the classroom. I told her that occasionally students would get on topics and say things, but I was unable to censor them before they were able to say them. She said that I called her daughter a name and I denied the accusation. But then she said that I didn&amp;#39;t believe in god and shouldn&amp;#39;t be teaching. She also said that she had spoken to 3 other board members who agreed with her that I shouldn&amp;#39;t be teaching because I was too liberal and I was an atheist.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 15, 2009--there was a regularly scheduled board meeting. Mr. Mullens was not on the agenda, but several individuals spoke about Mr. Mullens, expressing the concern that he was &amp;quot;an atheist&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;too liberal&amp;quot;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 16, 2009--Mr. Mullens was called to his principal&amp;#39;s office.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Principal] informed me that I had been put on administrative leave with pay. The reasons, as stated to me by [Principal] at the time, were that I was accused of being an atheist and teaching atheism in the classroom, and I was too liberal.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 23--A closed-door meeting was held between [Principal] and members of the school board. It is not clear from Mr. Mullens&amp;#39; account if the meeting included all seven members of the board, or a sub-set. It is also not clear where the meeting was held. It is possible that it was held at the Brookeland Missionary Baptist Church. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 24, in Mr. Mullens&amp;#39; words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; I received a certified letter from [Principal] that stated that the causes for my suspension apparently had been changed to inappropriate contact with students and comments. He admonished me in the letter for having contact with students who had text-messaged me during my first week of suspension, but I had not received any administrative directive, or anything in writing, prior to that time telling me I could not have contact with students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

February, 5, 2009


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
A Brookeland High School teacher said he is not sure what his next step will be after resigning from his job of six years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Richard Mullens, a teacher for more than 30 years, resigned his position as history teacher after being placed on paid administrative leave by the Brookeland Independent School District.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Richard Turner, the high school&amp;#39;s principal, said parents had voiced concerns about Mullens&amp;#39; classroom management.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These parents told school board members at a January board meeting that Mullens ran his classes too loosely and allowed students to discuss inappropriate topics, Turner said by phone Thursday.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mullens said the district and parents singled him out because of his religious and political views, which are in the minority.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;I teach in a very open classroom, (that) I love and like,&amp;quot; Mullens said by phone. &amp;quot;And the kids learn that way through open discussion and debate.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Brookeland ISD is located in the northeast corner of Jasper County. The district serves about 426 students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, Turner said. Students, parents and school personnel mix frequently and everyone is very close, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The conflict appears to stem from a Jan. 7 incident in one of his classes. According to Mullens, a student left his class-room upset about a conversation that had taken place.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He said that a pregnant student had gotten into a discussion with her former boyfriend about &amp;quot;whether he believed in love or not.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another student, who was not involved in the conversation, got up and left the class, saying she was uncomfortable with the conversation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That student&amp;#39;s mother later came to the school, spoke to the principal about the situation and verbally threatened Mullens. In a subsequent conference with Mullens and the principal, the parent accused Mullens of calling her daughter names and being an atheist. She said that several board members wanted him ousted because he was too liberal and an atheist, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since 2003, Mullens had been teaching history at the high school. This year he taught about 80 students a day from eighth-graders to seniors. Some classes were as small as five students, while others had almost 25, he said by phone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mullens said he made a habit of keeping a very open classroom, allowing students to discuss controversial issues.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;I like to get the kids interested,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I like to get all viewpoints.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Students would discuss issues like the separation of church and state and the presidential election, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nicole Ard, a senior at the high school, has been a student of Mullens&amp;#39; for five years. Ard, who is senior class president, said discussion often got heated, &amp;quot;but they were just debates.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Mostly people were upset because he supported Barack Obama, whereas a lot of people in Brookeland were against (Obama),&amp;quot; said Ard, 18.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
She said Mullens would often play the devil&amp;#39;s advocate in discussions, but he never pushed his viewpoints on students.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;I think it was more trying to get people to look at different viewpoints,&amp;quot; she said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mullens said in his six years at the school, he has never received a complaint from a parent or administrator. Turner, who is in his second year as principal, said that Mullens file has no record of infractions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On Jan. 15, though, between four and six parents told the school board about concerns with Mullens, said Turner who was at the meeting. Mullens did not attend because his name was not on the agenda and his son had a Little Dribblers basketball game.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Turner said the parents were concerned about Mullens&amp;#39; classroom management, specifically &amp;quot;about how loosely the classroom operated and that students were allowed to voice opinions that should not have been in the classroom.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He said parents said students called each other names, talked about sex, and discussed personal problems in his class-room. The undercurrent was that Mullins did little to stop the conversation, Turner said. One parent also voiced concerns about Mullens&amp;#39; religious beliefs, Turner said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Board members took no official action that evening, but Mullens was placed on administrative leave the next day pending an investigation, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
According to a letter dated Jan. 28 originally faxed to Brookeland ISD and later faxed to The Enterprise by Mullens, the school district at no time informed Mullens of specific allegations or requested a statement from him in response to allegations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Turner declined to comment about what was said when he informed Mullens of the situation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The district has since requested that students and parents bring concerns to the administration. Turner said about 15 people came forward. He declined to comment about what they said, but added that students had to sign a statement agreeing that what they were saying was based on fact and not hearsay.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ard, the senior class president, said that two students started a petition to get Mullins back, but were told by the school principal to stop. Turner said he had not heard of any students starting a petition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Turner said board members will consider at their next meeting the information provided by those people who came forward.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;We think at this point that we have resolved our problems with Mr. Mullens with his resignation,&amp;quot; Turner said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mullens said he just wants the truth to come out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;I just want to be able to teach again,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been a good teacher since 1971.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I didn't grow up in York, but I lived near there, and know it well enough for a vivid pictures to surface: both memories of Maine and memories of tense situations with police officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appear fairly ordinary here online, but in person I do not "pass for normal."  Not in movement, not in speech, not in social convention or verbal communication.  As a young adult I also lived an almost entirely nocturnal lifestyle in an attempt to avoid the overload and confusion of a loud and fast-paced daytime world.  I am also the sort of autie with too little anxiety rather than too much, so situations which are legitimately dangerous simply don't register to me as scary.  As such, I was often wandering the coastal towns of Maine in the wee hours of the morning, sometimes sitting at the docks for hours with a sketch book, or exploring ways to climb onto rooftops and into church gardens.  Which would inevitably lead to police officers accosting me and demanding to know what sort of drugs I was doing, what vandalism I was up to, and where I'd stashed my liquor.  Of course I'd done nothing like any of that, and would get confused and argumentative (if I could produce a response at all) which is really not how one should be interacting with the police late at night in the dark.  Looking back it's kind of a wonder I made it through some of those encounters with all my limbs intact--I think being a child-sized, attractive female was probably what saved me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a program like that implemented in York would have been a really good thing for me back when I lived in Maine--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--or, um, maybe not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my midnight gallivanting was done after I was no longer a child, and no longer lived with my parents.  As much good as the York program sounds, I'm completely baffled by its mention only of children.  Especially because a small child or even a teen acting strangely in front of a police officer is not going to result in the same kind of extreme bad as, say, a 250 pound 6'2" middle-aged man acting just as strangely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this just an oversight in reporting, and adults really are included in the program, just not mentioned to the press?  Or have adults been left out yet again?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233878975347"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/lbc_sic_lawyers_on_ben_goldacr.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a2759c97553cf0ff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">LBC sic lawyers on Ben Goldacre over criticism of MMR show</title><published>2009-02-05T22:14:43Z</published><updated>2009-02-05T22:14:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/lbc_sic_lawyers_on_ben_goldacr.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;News just in: London's &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lbc.co.uk/"&gt;LBC 97.3 radio&lt;/a&gt; are using &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect_(term)"&gt;legal chill&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to silence Dr Ben Goldacre's criticism of their scaremongering over the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Britain is currently in the midst of a measles epidemic due to a sharp drop in the takeup of MMR.

Leaving the seminar, we decided then and there that Gen Con Indy 2009 would have a skeptical presence to counter any and all woo that dares rear its ugly head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore, I invite you all to Gen Con Indy for our totally awesome skeptical seminar, "Skepticism, Critical Thinking, and Pop Culture!" Why pop culture? Because it's a pop culture convention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We may not be &lt;a href="http://badastronomy.com/"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;, but we plan to bring our A game nonetheless, and perhaps we'll get a good sized audience ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're a regular reader, you know what to expect, except there will be far less cursing because we want the seminar to attract as wide an audience as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're coming here from the Gen Con Events website, welcome! Here I'll give a brief rundown of our plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember, anything in here is in a constant state of flux, and any information will change and be updated as we solidify the details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like I said above, the current panel giving the seminar is made up of Tom, Wikinite, Magus, and me, four skeptics and bloggers with an interest in fostering critical thinking skills among the wider population. This list is subject to change if it has to; the details have not yet been 100% banged out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our "gaming group" title (the name of the crew organizing the event) is "Skeptical Powerhouse." I made that one up on my own and I hope it's okay with everyone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our general plan, as it stands at the moment, is to use pop culture paranormalism and pseudoscience as a vehicle to throw out some ideas about skepticism, critical thinking, and the scientific method. We hope to get you all thinking, &lt;i&gt;really thinking&lt;/i&gt;, about why you believe what you believe, and the need to back up your beliefs with good evidence and sound reasoning. We hope to impress upon you the power and utility of critical thinking, the importance of science and rationality, and the general silliness of many popular paranormal claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short: a heaping helping of education with just a &lt;i&gt;pinch&lt;/i&gt; of good, old-fashioned debunking. Topics covered might include (but are not limited to) Bigfoot, aliens and UFOs, ghosts and hauntings, and medical quackery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After we give our talk, we&amp;#39;ll open it up for a Q&amp;amp;A. This isn&amp;#39;t just any Q&amp;amp;A, though; this is a &lt;i&gt;themed&lt;/i&gt; Q&amp;amp;A. While you can feel absolutely free to ask us just about anything regarding our talk or ideas, the theme of the session is &amp;quot;Stump the Skeptics!&amp;quot; Come prepared with your extraordinary claims, your sacred cows, your obscure bits of belief and opinion, and throw them our way. We&amp;#39;ll do an impromptu skeptical analysis of any claim you care to throw at us, bringing our myriad knowledge and critical thinking skills to bear against it; just make sure that (1)it&amp;#39;s a real claim that&amp;#39;s out there in the culture, not something you made up just to annoy us, and (2)it can actually be empirically investigated: no politics or ideology, please.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All we ask is that you bring are open minds (but not so open that your brain falls out, as we sometimes like to say), good questions, and a good attitude. We don't intend or desire to offend anybody at this seminar, and we expect the same courtesy from anyone attending. We want to keep things light and fun so everyone can have a good time while they're learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We hope you're looking forward to the seminar as much as we are, and remember to keep checking back here to this blog entry for updates and further details as they become available. We'll see you in August!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-7618642527188024056?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233876297242"><id gr:original-id="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/?p=1018">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/11290d5e07893c67</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">MMR Scaremongering From Jeni Barnett: LBC Use Legal Chill Tactics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then on January 7th, a student in my classroom in second period left my class, went to the Principal's office, and told him that there was an inappropriate discussion in my classroom. I was informed by the principal, Richard Turner, that I needed to talk to her mother because she was very upset. Her mother came to class on January 7th, came to the school January 7th, very upset. She made some threats to me in the hallway. And then on January 8th, Mr. Turner informed me that I needed to call the parent, Mrs. Lowe. On January 9th, I had Vicki Smith, the school secretary, call "REDACTED" on my behalf to arrange a conference at 10:35 Monday, January 12th. Monday the 12th, I met with REDACTED and School Principal Richard Turner in his office. REDACTED was very angry. She accused me of being an atheist, saying I was too liberal, and that I allowed the students to talk about inappropriate things in the classroom. I told her that occasionally students would get on topics and say things, but I was unable to censor them before they were able to say them. She said that I called her daughter a name and I denied the accusation. But then she said that I didn't believe in god and shouldn't be teaching. She also said that she had spoken to 3 other board members who agreed with her that I shouldn't be teaching because I was too liberal and I was an atheist.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On January 15th, there was a board meeting. Nothing was on the agenda concerning me. During the open forum, several audience members spoke to their concerns that I was an atheist and I was too liberal. On January 16th, I was called to Mr. Richard Turner's office (my principal), and he informed me that I had been put on administrative leave with pay. The reasons, as stated to me by Mr. Turner at the time, were that I was accused of being an atheist and teaching atheism in the classroom, and I was too liberal. On January 23rd, Mr. Turner and members of the board met behind closed doors concerning my suspension and allegations that were directed at me. On January 24th, I received a certified letter from Mr. Turner that stated that the causes for my suspension apparently had been changed to inappropriate contact with students and comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He should count himself lucky. If the parents had accused him of being a witch, he might have been hanged by now. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/it_must_be_tough_to_be_an_athe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/7xRh5i3TNG0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233874465648"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5de1be03e6505e04</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Help!

Here’s a click-tease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times are tough for magazines and newspapers in need of advertising dollars. That may be why the &lt;a href="http://www.metrobostonnews.com/us/home/"&gt;Boston Metro&lt;/a&gt; is raking in the bucks by devoting full two-page spreads to the printed version of the infomercial, cleverly disguised as actual articles with the word “advertisement” printed in tiny font above them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though not as endearing as the &lt;a href="https://www.shamwow.com/ver8/index.asp"&gt;ShamWow&lt;/a&gt; or the ubiquitous &lt;a href="https://www.getsnuggie.com/flare/next"&gt;Snuggie&lt;/a&gt;, the Metro’s ads do have a certain amount of cheesiness. Last month, commuters were treated to &lt;a href="http://www.heatsurge.com/"&gt;HeatSurge&lt;/a&gt;’s miracle Amish electric fireplaces. These really are a miracle, considering that the Amish completely reject technology like, oh, electricity. The ads came complete with Photoshop-ilicious pics of Amishy-looking people in a barn, putting the finishing touches on blazing &lt;em&gt;electric &lt;/em&gt;fireplaces. “Call this 1-800 number in the next 48 hours only! Hurry!” Sure. As it happens, the Amish only made the mantles and the &lt;a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/business/stories/2008/02/29/amish_heaters.ART_ART_02-29-08_C10_589GBKT.html"&gt;Better Business Bureau received dozens of complains about the company&lt;/a&gt;, which has advertised the heaters as “free”—with the purchase of a $300 Amish-made mantle.&lt;/p&gt;

Since I'm no expert on the special education system in the U.S., I pinged &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/profile/view/143625"&gt;Clay Burrell&lt;/a&gt; over at the &lt;a href="http://education.change.org"&gt;Education blog&lt;/a&gt;.  Clay in turn introduced me to his special education expert, &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/profile/view/207089"&gt;Jennifer Parker&lt;/a&gt;.  I got pretty excited about Jennifer who not only has specific expertise working with students with invisible disabilities (including autism), but is also a special education attorney.  So I hit Jennifer up for more than one interview.  Here's the first, continuing the themes that were explored in the "real world" post--why can it be so hard to get seemingly simple accommodations from teachers?  Is this a problem with individual teachers, with teacher education, with the educational system, with--with what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: People often report high variability in their experiences with teachers. What reasons do you think there may be for this variability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer : I think the main reason for this variability is in the training of the teachers. Generally, most "regular education" teachers report having little to no preparation for working with students who have special needs.  Another reason for variability is comfort level with making accommodations and perhaps experience with working with children with disabilities.  Unfortunately, schools do not usually have school-wide policies for IEPs or any uniformity in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Do you think that current emphasis on standardized testing and curriculum-based structures makes it harder to meet the needs of students who don't learn in conventional ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: Absolutely. I have become a strong advocate for progressive reform in education away from high-stakes standardized testing towards individualized instruction because I have personally seen the negative impact that testing and scripted curriculum has had upon our students, especially those students in poorer districts. The current emphasis is a one-size-fits all system that does not meet the needs of any of our students and makes school a very un-engaging, stressful environment for everyone. Currently schools are so afraid of being labeled a "failing" school by not meeting AYP under No Child Left Behind that every resource goes toward teaching to the test. I have been appalled by how many IEP meetings I've gone to where the special education teacher has told me that we could not create our own learning goals or accommodations, but rather, had to use the standards-based goals used for every other child in that grade. No Child Left Behind has created a system that is in direct opposition to students who don't learn in conventional ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Do you think there are problems getting accommodations [like working on green paper or extra time on tests]  for students on the autistic spectrum that students with other disabilities don't have? Of so, what are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: Well, that's a good question, since working with green paper instead of white is not a costly accommodation. Also, more time on tests is free! I think parents who run into difficulties getting these types of accommodations are running into one of two things. Either the IEP team needs more education regarding the disability and need for those accommodations or - and this seems silly since, as I just stated, these are easy accommodations - this is a school district that is very rigid. I run into this now as an advocate. I serve three states. The city school system where I live is great about accommodations, but some of the suburban school districts are very rigid and refuse to make even small accommodations. These are school districts that have good reputations and good "report cards", and feel that they know best how to educate students and they do not waiver from their way. As I mentioned earlier, they have their own customs and culture. Also, they have a school attorney who tells them not to budge an inch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: What general advice would you give to parents and students on the autistic spectrum for better getting academic accommodations with minimal fuss?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: In general, I would take advantage of any local workshops on advocacy and learn to become a strong advocate for yourself or your child. These may be hosted by protection and advocacy organizations, education attorneys/advocates, hospitals, or autism organizations. If parents and students do not have a copy of "From Emotions to Advocacy" by attorney Pete Wright, they need to get a copy right away. This book's title is dead on: it teaches parents and students to move from an emotional state regarding their educational and developmental needs to a strong advocate state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: I've heard a lot of good things about &lt;a href="http://wrightslaw.com"&gt;writghtslaw.com&lt;/a&gt; too, do you recommend that site?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: Yes, it is Pete Wright's site. You can order any of his publications from the site, write in questions, peruse a library of articles on all kinds of topics, and see a listing of workshop locations. The only negative that I've found is that it's a very "crowded" site and a little difficult to navigate, but it is a wealth of information and support.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233866904569"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5892">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3a7e3a23d6be7dd6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 2.5</title><published>2009-02-05T20:04:49Z</published><updated>2009-02-05T20:04:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5892" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it’s true that there is some truth to all stereotypes, we should be able to list a bunch of stereotypes specific to skeptics.

According to police, Gregg-Glover allegedly "dumped her adopted daughter—who was possibly still alive—in [the] freezing creek and then made up a story about the girl running away," today's &lt;a href="http://www.insidenova.com/isn/news/local/article/mother_charged_in_teens_death_out_of_jail/29310/"&gt;Inside NoVa&lt;/a&gt; reports. Alexis is said to have had "severe autism and sickle cell anemia." Police think that Alexis may have had some kind of medical emergency on the morning of January 7 and that Gregg-Glover "did not get her proper medical attention." Gregg-Glover was released from jail on Monday after the Prince William Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court granted her a $5,000 bond on the child neglect charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever happened or didn't happen here, it's too late to help Alexis Glover. Why didn't Gregg-Glover ask for help?&lt;/p&gt;

In it, Los Angeles is cast in the role of the nation's transportation dystopia: a sprawling, smog-choked, auto-obsessed spaghetti bowl of freeways which meander from one bland suburban destination to the next. The heroes of the picture are cities like San Francisco, or especially New York, which are said to have created vastly more livable urban forms based on density and mass transit.

Since I'm no expert on the special education system in the U.S., I pinged &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/profile/view/143625"&gt;Clay Burrell&lt;/a&gt; over at the &lt;a href="http://education.change.org"&gt;Education blog&lt;/a&gt;.  Clay in turn introduced me to his special education expert, &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/profile/view/207089"&gt;Jennifer Parker&lt;/a&gt;.  I got pretty excited about Jennifer who not only has specific expertise working with students with invisible disabilities (including autism), but is also a special education attorney.  So I hit Jennifer up for more than one interview.  Here's the first, continuing the themes that were explored in the "real world" post--why can it be so hard to get seemingly simple accommodations from teachers?  Is this a problem with individual teachers, with teacher education, with the educational system, with--with what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: People often report high variability in their experiences with teachers. What reasons do you think there may be for this variability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer : I think the main reason for this variability is in the training of the teachers. Generally, most "regular education" teachers report having little to no preparation for working with students who have special needs.  Another reason for variability is comfort level with making accommodations and perhaps experience with working with children with disabilities.  Unfortunately, schools do not usually have school-wide policies for IEPs or any uniformity in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Do you think that current emphasis on standardized testing and curriculum-based structures makes it harder to meet the needs of students who don't learn in conventional ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: Absolutely. I have become a strong advocate for progressive reform in education away from high-stakes standardized testing towards individualized instruction because I have personally seen the negative impact that testing and scripted curriculum has had upon our students, especially those students in poorer districts. The current emphasis is a one-size-fits all system that does not meet the needs of any of our students and makes school a very un-engaging, stressful environment for everyone. Currently schools are so afraid of being labeled a "failing" school by not meeting AYP under No Child Left Behind that every resource goes toward teaching to the test. I have been appalled by how many IEP meetings I've gone to where the special education teacher has told me that we could not create our own learning goals or accommodations, but rather, had to use the standards-based goals used for every other child in that grade. No Child Left Behind has created a system that is in direct opposition to students who don't learn in conventional ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Do you think there are problems getting accommodations [like working on green paper or extra time on tests]  for students on the autistic spectrum that students with other disabilities don't have? Of so, what are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: Well, that's a good question, since working with green paper instead of white is not a costly accommodation. Also, more time on tests is free! I think parents who run into difficulties getting these types of accommodations are running into one of two things. Either the IEP team needs more education regarding the disability and need for those accommodations or - and this seems silly since, as I just stated, these are easy accommodations - this is a school district that is very rigid. I run into this now as an advocate. I serve three states. The city school system where I live is great about accommodations, but some of the suburban school districts are very rigid and refuse to make even small accommodations. These are school districts that have good reputations and good "report cards", and feel that they know best how to educate students and they do not waiver from their way. As I mentioned earlier, they have their own customs and culture. Also, they have a school attorney who tells them not to budge an inch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: What general advice would you give to parents and students on the autistic spectrum for better getting academic accommodations with minimal fuss?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: In general, I would take advantage of any local workshops on advocacy and learn to become a strong advocate for yourself or your child. These may be hosted by protection and advocacy organizations, education attorneys/advocates, hospitals, or autism organizations. If parents and students do not have a copy of "From Emotions to Advocacy" by attorney Pete Wright, they need to get a copy right away. This book's title is dead on: it teaches parents and students to move from an emotional state regarding their educational and developmental needs to a strong advocate state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: I've heard a lot of good things about &lt;a href="http://wrightslaw.com"&gt;writghtslaw.com&lt;/a&gt; too, do you recommend that site?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: Yes, it is Pete Wright's site. You can order any of his publications from the site, write in questions, peruse a library of articles on all kinds of topics, and see a listing of workshop locations. The only negative that I've found is that it's a very "crowded" site and a little difficult to navigate, but it is a wealth of information and support.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233858406023"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/05/the-face-of-beauty/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0eb17d2fce3fd9c9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><title type="html">The face of beauty</title><published>2009-02-05T18:26:02Z</published><updated>2009-02-05T18:26:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/05/the-face-of-beauty/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Edited to add: If you like this article, please &lt;a href="http://digg.com/space/The_face_of_beauty_Bad_Astronomy_Discover_Magazine"&gt;Digg it&lt;/a&gt; so others see it.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3255460903/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3493/3255497581_4670ab8410_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy Haleakala!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s NGC 4921, a face-on spiral galaxy in the Coma cluster of galaxies, over 300 million light years away. &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0901.html"&gt;This Hubble image&lt;/a&gt; is a mosaic of 80 separate images, and has stunning clarity and depth. Look at all those background galaxies! You really want to click that and get the bigger version. Trust me here. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spiral arms of this galaxy are a bit poorly defined, but that adds to the beauty of this in my opinion. That struck me instantly, and the reason struck me as well: spiral galaxies in clusters are odd ducks. Coma is a rich, dense cluster, with thousands of citizens. That makes collisions common, and spiral disks are relatively fragile. When a spiral collides with another galaxy of comparable mass the disk is disrupted. Whether the two galaxies pass through each other or eventually merge, the disk is usually collaterally damaged or destroyed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So NGC 4921 is a bit of a freak in that it exists at all. But the cluster itself is filled with tenuous gas, like smog in a city. As galaxies pass through it, the pressure from this gas pushes on the gas inside the galaxy, sweeping it out (like driving with your windows open removes bad odors lingering in your car, possibly also due to gas). In general (though not always!) spirals in rich clusters don’t have lots of gas, and so they can’t form stars. In &amp;quot;field&amp;quot; spirals — galaxies that are on their own in deep space, something like ours — images show them to have strings of intensely reddish concentrated gas clouds vigorously forming new stars, but NGC 4921 is devoid of those. Most of its gas has been swept away by the ram pressure of its travels across the cluster. That makes the spiral arms smooth. But since no stars have been formed in this galaxy for a long, long time &lt;em&gt;[Edited to add: whoa, hold on there. Maybe there has been recent star formation; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/05/the-face-of-beauty/#comment-153915"&gt;see this comment and my follow-up below&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;, the galaxy is also predominantly yellow-red, because all the hot young blue stars are long gone, exploded as supernovae shortly after they were born millions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, &lt;em&gt;yellow-red?&lt;/em&gt; But the galaxy looks blue! Yes, in real life this galaxy should look reddish, but this image is false-color: it was taken using a yellow filter and a near-infrared one. So what you see as bluish in the image is actually yellow or red to the eye. What’s seen as red is actually infrared. Weird, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see a ragged ring of dust circling the galaxy’s core. That’s interesting to me; the gas is gone, but dust remains. Either it’s harder to remove than gas, or it’s a relatively new feature created in stars and blown out into the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/hst_ngc4921_detail.jpg" alt="Detail in the image of NGC 4921"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And finally, the background galaxies. Wow. &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0901a.html"&gt;I strongly urge you to go to the Space Telescope page&lt;/a&gt; and grab one of the really big images, which are seriously huge. Then just scan the background and look at all the weird beasties lurking there. Ragged galaxies, elliptical galaxies, edge-on spirals, galaxy fragments… it’s a menagerie of shapes and color. And what’s that hanging above and to the right of NGC 4921? It looks like either a huge globular cluster of stars, or a dwarf elliptical galaxy. I lean toward the latter due to its size, but from this image alone it’s hard to tell… and this is the deepest image ever taken of this region, so I don’t think we’ll get an easy answer to that question. Even Hubble has limits.&lt;/p&gt;

Understandably, this body has been met with considerable criticism. Other bloggers have tackled this subject, (including the excellent &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/01/prince-charles-ofquack-is-dead-duck.html"&gt;Andy Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, and some wag who actually registered the &lt;a href="http://www.ofquack.org.uk"&gt;OfQuack.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; domain name), so I thought I'd provide a definitive article about them, and also do a little digging around to see if I could dig up anything that others have missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, whut?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, they think that people born under the signs of Capricorn, Taurus, Aquarius, Aries, and Leo are the best workers; something about being an animal, I guess. Hmmm… do banks hire Tauruses when the markets turn down? Too bad Ursa Major isn’t a zodiacal constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the company’s actual defense of this travesty of reality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statistical study indicated that almost all of our best employees across Austria have one of the five star signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, this is from an insurance company which should, in theory and in practice, understand statistics. I’d love to see that study of theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funniest part of this, though, is the brouhaha that ensued after the company advertised its desire for astrologically-based employees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was followed by a wave of protests from equality groups and led to an  investigation by the country’s anti-discrimination authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equality groups? Anti-discrimination? &lt;em&gt;Because of the time of year you were born?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anybody protested this practice because it’s, y’know, &lt;strong&gt;dumb&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, which graphic to use? Decisions, decisions. OK, why not both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that feels about right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wait — this one will be featured in some cheesy Sci-Fi channel creature feature in a few months. Paleontologists have dug up a fossil boa that lived 58-60 million years ago. They haven&amp;#39;t found a complete skeleton, but there&amp;#39;s enough to get an estimate of the size. Look at these vertebrae!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/titanoboa/titanoboa.jpeg" width="400" height="236" alt="titanoboa.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;, Type specimen (UF/IGM 1) in anterior view compared to scale with a precloacal vertebra from approximately 65% along the precloacal column of a 3.4 m &lt;i&gt;Boa constrictor.&lt;/i&gt; Type specimen (UF/IGM 1) shown in posterior view (&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;), left lateral view (&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;) and dorsal view (&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;). Seven articulated precloacal vertebrae (UF/IGM 3) in dorsal view (&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;). Articulated precloacal vertebra and rib (UF/IGM 4) in anterior view (&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt;). Precloacal vertebra (paratype specimen UF/IGM 2) in anterior view (&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;) and ventral view (&lt;b&gt;h&lt;/b&gt;). Precloacal vertebra (UF/IGM 5) in anterior view (&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;) and posterior view (&lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt;). All specimens are to scale.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to put it in perspective, the small pale blob between a and b in the photo above is an equivalent vertebra from an extant boa, which was 3.4 meters long. The extinct beast is estimated to have been about 13 meters long, weighing over 1100 kg (for us Americans, that's 42 feet and 2500 pounds). This is a &lt;i&gt;very big snake&lt;/i&gt;, the largest ever found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors used the size of this snake to estimate the temperature of this region of South America 60 million years ago. Snakes are poikilotherms, depending on external sources of heat to maintain a given level of metabolic activity, and so available temperature means are limiting factors on how large they can grow. By comparing this animal&amp;#39;s size to that of modern tropical snakes, and extrapolating from a measured curve of size to mean annual temperature, they were able to calculate that the average ambient temperature was 30-34°C (American cluestick: about 90°F); less than that, and this snake would have died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From other data, they know that the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration at this time was about 2000 parts per million, and that the forests it lived in were thick, wet, and rainy. They also estimate that slightly later, about 56 million years ago, mean tropical temperatures would have soared to 38-40°C (102°F), and would have killed off many species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go…this is one place I think I&amp;#39;d avoid if I had a time machine. It was a thick-aired, muggy, sweltering oven, with giant snakes crawling about. They were likely to have eaten large crocodilians, so I suspect a time-traveling human would be nothing but a quick hors d&amp;#39;ouevre. They&amp;#39;re still interesting, though, especially as an example of evolution and climate science meeting in a mutually revealing fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

This is yet another small advance in this area of research - the interface between biology and computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were able to etch a pattern in silicon and then bath that chip in a bath of specific proteins. The proteins - likely including some growth factors and other hormones - coaxed the neurons to grow along the pre-determined pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This represents an incremental technological step, but an important one. There are several research programs working on aspects of this technology - getting cells, whether neurons or stem cells, to grow how they want them to. Others are working on the interface of neurons and computer chips - getting them to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology is at an obviously early stage. It is similar to the time when physicists and engineers were making basic discoveries about electricity and how to control it. Each new discovery, about capacitors, circuits, resistance, etc., added one more piece to the puzzle. At the time I don’t think anyone could have seen how controlling electrical circuits would soon transform civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see the same thing happening with the technology to interface computers and biology - we are making baby-step advances in this technology, which are by themselves not that impressive, but I think we can see where this is headed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we extrapolate into the future, when all the pieces are in place, we will have incredible control over biological tissue and be able to combine that with increasingly sophisticated, small, and powerful computers. Researchers like speculating about possible applications. One obvious application is the repair of damaged nerves and spinal cords.  We could theoretically use such an implant to coax neurons to grow and make connections across an area of damage. Or we could reconnect nerves to muscle tissue, or even repair the damaged muscle itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When applied to stem cells this technology could lead to the ability to grow custom-designed tissue and organs. We are simultaneously making advances in stem-cell technology - for example researchers have discovered that by altering only four genes they can change an adult-derived cell into a stem cell with all the properties (at least so far investigated) of an embryonic stem cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again if we flash forward, this technology may allow us to take a skin cell from you and then grow you a new liver to replace your failing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other category of applications is in brain-computer interfacing. Getting neurons to grow on a chip means that those neurons can connect to and communicate with your brain cells and also connect to and communicate with a computer chip. Our brains are wonderfully plastic, so it is plausible that they can adapt these new connections to actual function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, someone with Parkinson’s disease has damage in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia. This is a circuit deep in the brain that is actually pretty-well understood. It regulates voluntary muscle activity, tweaking the gain of motor activation so that muscle control is smooth. Too little inhibition from this circuit and patients will have uncontrollable movements. Too much, and they will be stiff, even frozen. Drugs can help for a while, but they don’t replace the lost circuit - they cannot provide the moment-to-moment feedback loop necessary for optimal function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to actually fix Parkinson’s disease is with stem cells. Current transplants with fetal tissue are really just drug delivery systems - they create dopamine and dump it into the local environment, but they don’t repair the circuit. Stem cells that actually repair the lost connections could potentially be a cure, however. It is unclear how far off this technology is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option suggested by this current research is to build a replacement circuit for the basal ganglia in silicon (or whatever) interfaced with neurons and implant that, so that the neurons can make the connection between the basal ganglia and the replacement circuit. This would be a genuine brain prosthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain prosthetics could also be used to treat epilepsy - detecting seizures and stopping them in their tracks, before they spread.  Basic forms of this are already in the works. I think we will see this soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, as I have discussed in previous posts, brain function enhancement could be another application. Wireless chips in our brain could give us genuine ESP, or give us remote control over any computer-controlled device. It could also be a great communication aid for those with various impairments. Imagine the day when someone who is locked-in (paralyzed below the eyes) can still communicate with the world just by thinking, or can operate their motorized wheelchair complete with robotic arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today this may sound like science fiction, but it is all a highly plausible extrapolation from existing research and technology.  The fine details and the precise time-frame are hard to predict, but the broad brushstrokes of where this future technology will take us seems pretty clear. Actually if I am missing anything it is that there will be transformative applications of this type of technology that I have not yet conceived of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size:80%"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pillar of Eliseg, being the remains of an inscribed 9th century cross, sitting on a barrow of probable Early Bronze Age date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent Tuesday and Wednesday with Howard and his students on field trips into north-east Wales and back across the border into Cheshire and Shropshire. I got to see the area under highly unusual circumstances: covered in snow and lit by an unclouded sun. Beautiful! We've seen the early church site of Shotwick, the Cistercian abbey ruins of Basingwerk and Valle Crucis, the hillfort of Oswestry, the Offa's Dyke and Wat's Dyke defensive walls and the stone crosses of Maen Achwyfan and Eliseg, the latter sitting on a barrow beneath a forbidding mountainside. Not far from the barrow, Howard and I had a good pub lunch and finished it up with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/03/quest_for_dick_spotted_2.php"&gt;Spotted Dick&lt;/a&gt; in a custard lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Tuesday field trip I walked along the top of Chester's Medieval walls, saw the police prepare to fish a dead person out of one of the canal locks just outside, and studied the exhibits in the Grosvenor Museum. On Wednesday evening, I gave a talk on my Östergötland project to the department's faculty and students, and nobody fell asleep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves it so much, in fact, that he graciously wrote the theme song to &lt;a href="http://365daysofastronomy.org/"&gt;365 Days of Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, the year-long daily podcast for the International Year of Astronomy. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/09/365-days-of-astronomy/"&gt;The podcast is created by you&lt;/a&gt;: anyone who wants to talk about astronomy and can record their voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/holocaust-denying_conservative_bishop.php"&gt;noted an extremely disturbing story&lt;/a&gt;, a story that outraged me, a story that I would have found even more disturbing were I still a practicing Catholic but that I found disturbing enough even though I no longer am one. I'm referring to the difficult to explain decision on the part of Pope Benedict XVI to rehabilitate four heretical bishops who had been ordained without the Vatican's permission and who all belonged to a conservative Catholic organization known as the the &lt;a href="http://www.sspx.org/"&gt;Society of Saint Pius X&lt;/a&gt;. This organization was formed in the wake of Vatican II and its reforms, which its members explicitly reject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the four bishops whose excommunication by Pope John Paul II was rescinded is a grade-A super loony nutjob. Specifically, this particular bishop, Bishop Richard Williamson, is a Holocaust denier. Moreover, he is the most obnoxious, blatantly idiotic sort of Holocaust denier, parroting the most easily debunked of denier canards as though they were fact; even his friend David Irving is not so dense. Even worse, it turns out that Williamson's anti-Semitism is not at all subtle and over the years not even close to carefully hidden. Indeed, Williamson's vile views were noted nearly a year ago in a &lt;a href="http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/articles/a0000226.shtml"&gt;news story&lt;/a&gt; that described just what he believed, including his acceptance of the Czarist forgery &lt;em&gt;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&lt;/em&gt;, the classic anti-Semitic tract that purports to describe a conspiracy by Jews to rule the world as described by the elders in its title, as authentic, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooGBMFShUVo"&gt;his being a 9/11 Truther&lt;/a&gt;, who, like many 9/11 Truthers, believes that the U.S. government was somehow in on the attacks of that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may recall, I, along with many others, was outraged that the Pope would try to rehabilitate such a raging anti-Semite. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why on earth the Church would want to rehabilitate such a hateful crank.  One commenter by the 'nym efarris tried to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/holocaust-denying_conservative_bishop.php#comment-1364506"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The vileness of Williamson's statements is undeniable, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a far more "nuanced" issue than the reporting indicates. Of course, "Pope says suspended bishop who has idiotic political views will be allowed to take Communion again - if he shapes up" doesn't make nearly as sensational a news story as "Pope 'embraces' Holocaust denier."

&lt;p&gt;In answer to the questions about whether this means the four are bishops again...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifting their excommunication does NOT make them bishops in good standing with the Church. It is essentially an invitation to reconcile with Rome. There's a condition attached - to believe and obey what the Catholic Church teaches on faith and morals. This would include the recognition of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II) that officially condemned all forms of anti-Semitism. (You can look this one up.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are still suspended as clergy and any services they perform are illicit. Lifting their excommunication doesn't give them the right to function as priests or imply any approval of their views or actions. The only thing it does is give them permission to receive the sacraments of the Catholic Church. If you think (like many do) that those are meaningless, then the Pope has done --- absolutely nothing. The Church basically doesn't deny communion to people on the basis of their political views even if those views are at odds with Church teaching. When the Church doesn't deny communion to pro-choice American politicians, for example, most Americans think that this policy is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, of course, was a rather specious comparison, mainly because this issue was about far more than a single disagreement with the Church. It was about open heresy and the flouting of the Church's authority. Moreover, the very problem that I had with Benedict's action was that he didn't say that a "suspended bishop who has idiotic political views will be allowed to take Communion again - if he shapes up." He simply said that said suspended bishop who has idiotic political views will be allowed to take Communion again. Period. No preconditions. No requirements. The Pope didn't even demand that Williamson renounce his Holocaust denial, accept the Church's authority and teachings (including Vatican II, which SSPX despises), and ask forgiveness. That's some pretty easy forgiveness, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/better_late_than_never_the_vatican_demands.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/better_late_than_never_the_vatican_demands.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/C-FYiXMLkds" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233840943887"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_592.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c289e4ec432a5abc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-02-05T13:24:05Z</published><updated>2009-02-05T13:24:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Jp2qbpV-Bco/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_592.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_592.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_592.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_592.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Jp2qbpV-Bco" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233840737651"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/i_get_email_29.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c96e96881f92338b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">I get email</title><published>2009-02-05T12:48:17Z</published><updated>2009-02-05T12:48:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/VcsO5POL_Ps/i_get_email_29.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/i_get_email_29.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes these kooks reveal that they even read the blog…somewhat obsessively and angrily. This one seems to be a follow-up to yesterday&amp;#39;s email, and I think he&amp;#39;s unhappy that I put up that other crank&amp;#39;s letter and not his. I&amp;#39;m sorry, but I don&amp;#39;t even remember what his previous letter&amp;#39;s point was, and if this one is any indication, it was another spittle-flecked disjointed ramble, and I&amp;#39;m afraid I don&amp;#39;t read those with much attention. However, since he really wants to join the pantheon (a very crowded pantheon) of irate readers, I&amp;#39;m happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't get any ideas, though, all you other crackpots! This guy got away with it, but if you all start demanding your tirades be posted, I'm not going to be accommodating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well sir,
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I hesitate to believe that your silence is some kind of assent to the truth of what I tried to express in my previous e-mail message yesterday.  I notice in your "blog" today---somewhat amazingly considering the typical time constraints on an associate professor---that you graciously acknowledged receiving
"11 weird harangues . . . in my mailbox this morning."  Perhaps my harangue was one of these? Well mister you need to get a few harangues in your mailbox in the morning, if you don't mind my saying so. You opened up this silly door by being a "public figure" with an exceptionally big mouth who likes to put down other people---seemingly every day of his life---so take it like a man, would you please?  Go ahead, dismiss me all you want, laugh at me, lump me in with all the other people you marginalize and stereotype.  Oh I know, you probably feel so useful in your roles as atheist "blog-meister,"
small-town scientist, condemner of "inferior people,"  Lord over ALL "creationists" and defender of truth (as you seem to perceive it anyway), and you probably don't have &lt;u&gt;time&lt;/u&gt; for my little rants. So be it.  I don't care, I will write my rants anyway.  Really, I am not trying to be clever or to persuade you of anything. Why would I do that?  What would be the point? You've obviously heard it all before and you obviously know everything you need to know for your own personal fulfillment. So be it.   What I am doing, in fact, is condemning you, as best I can.  Why? Because in my estimation your actions reflect something that is fundamentally wrong and disgraceful, and I feel that it is &lt;u&gt;my duty&lt;/u&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;to write whether you read it or not---whether you butcher up my comments in your silly "blog" or not&lt;/span&gt;.  Since we will probably never meet in person, this is the best I can do.  It is, for me, a matter of principle or I would not feel or speak so strongly about it.  Like you, I will not remain silent when I am offended by something or someone, especially something or someone in the public eye.  This is not an attempt to offend you, rather, it is me telling you what I think about you since you have chosen to enter my world with your public presence.  How is that you say?  When, as of late, I have often to read about a certain person named "PZ Myers," often just in my ordinary non-specific reading, and when this person often does ridiculous bizarre things, apparently to gain attention to himself in furtherance of what appears to be a
self-perceived "cause," it becomes a nuisance to me, and to many others who don't take the time to write you. Since you are a "public" person, I am entitled to tell you what I think and feel, whether you care or not.  I am not writing depending on whether you care or not, obviously.  Why do you think so many people write these "harangues" anyway, professor?  Or perhaps you ONLY prefer to listen to the people who react favorably to you as a public entity?  Wouldn't that be nice, if everyone thought you were peaches and cream? &lt;u&gt;Think&lt;/u&gt; about it, would you please?  To pretend to worship you, as others might, for sharing some superior insight you believe you have into the nature of things, would be lying on my part to say the least.  I don't think that in much of any way, obviously quite the opposite is what I think:  I think that you offer NO insight into the nature of things of any real or lasting value, and the only reason that you persist is most probably because you enjoy being a nuisance for its own sake.  I think that if you actually did value getting at the true nature of our planet and the cosmos of which it is part, it wouldn't be so important for you to have daily opportunity to belittle others in a public forum like the internet---you would instead, as most decent people have in ages past, offer your particular contribution to knowledge humbly and with respect for others.  You have earned my disrespect with your actions and words against others, and you do &lt;u&gt;no service&lt;/u&gt; to humanity with such behaviour, no matter how strongly you feel about your scientific insights---they are not worth the pain you cause to others. Of course, you probably don't care to hear this.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Think about these two statements for a nanosecond:
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What do you know that I don't know?  What do you know that I need to know?&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I don't believe that you can answer these questions at all.  "Ahhh", you might say, (just to give a random example I picked up from your so-called "blog" today. You might say: (imagine a real arrogant guy with a beard for a second saying this)
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"You need to know that whales had babies on land at one time, and what a profound revelation that is!"
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is an example of what you daily worry about?  This is what I, therefore, need to worry about?  I need to worry and think about how scientists think whales used to reproduce in the past? Or, I need to overly concern myself the fact that scientists believe that whales may have changed over millions of years? That's IT? &lt;u&gt;That&lt;/u&gt; is an example of the kind of earth-shattering insight that you would share with humanity as a scientist? This is why you are so incessantly noisy and bothersome and offensive to others who don't happen to be scientists?  This is why God is dead for you?  Because whales like everything else in this incredible universe, have changed over time?  That's just wonderful. Great.  Do you think it is then justifiable to condemn other people because (for &lt;u&gt;whatever&lt;/u&gt; reason) they may not believe just as you do as a professional scientist, (and who gives a fig whether it's about whales, it could be anything, that's just my example).  Should we condemn the "common" people if they do not subscribe to certain ideas in other academic areas as well? Should this be the calling of all practitioners of academic subjects, to condemn others in an offensive manner, oh yes . . . in the &lt;u&gt;name of truth&lt;/u&gt;?  I honestly don't think you really care a bling for any brand of truth, but unfortunately that seems to have made you especially vociferous, and miracle or miracles the internet allows you to fully vent. 
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Probably you protest that we are strangers, and you object to receiving this kind of e-mail where I ask these kinds of questions and make these kind of observations.  Perhaps we &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; strangers, but only in the sense that I have never met you in person as a fellow human being, that is to say, as a flesh and blood person; but your persona, which is to say, your social facade via the internet, and your actions as a person in the public forum are regrettably there for all to see, and this is what I know about PZ Myers; and it is this public persona that offends me that I am addressing.  You are a professor at a university, but that of itself engenders nothing special to me, nor does it earn my automatic respect.  You went to college and majored in biology.  Would you like a medal or something? You seem to equate the noble profession of science, and particularly the subject of biology with atheism?  My question is, &lt;u&gt;why&lt;/u&gt;? And by what authority do you speak for scientists?  Do you have a right to speak for all scientists? Or even all atheists?  Can you see how your arrogant, dismissive attitude towards others might be offensive and an embarrassment to many, if not most scientists? Or, to many if not most atheists?  Do you think scientists or atheists want to be thought of as being like that "communion-wafer maniac." Based on your example, should all scientists crusade against people of religious faith in the most offensive possible manner? I may have majored in biology myself, for all you know, I may have more degrees than you, but that is not the point.  I have known and worked with many fine professors, and you sir, are not one.  Not because of what you do or do not know, but because of your actions as a public figure and your lack of comportment as a supposedly learned man in the public eye.  You undoubtedly believe that you are in some sense "saving the world" by condemning others, but what in God's name do you hope it will accomplish ?  In the hope that there will be more "intellectual", sarcastic, blow-hards such as yourself?  How liberating!  What a positive boon for thinking people everywhere! What a vision for the future well-being of the human race!  La-de-dah-de-dah-de-&lt;u&gt;da&lt;/u&gt;.   I have looked hard for a while now to find some redeeming qualities in all your brouhaha, but from one intellectual and humanist to another, they just ain't there.   
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You are a curiosity to me, as I find curious anyone---and forgive me here but I think that you yourself have made this a fact---as I find curious anyone who holds themselves in the public spotlight as possessing "special revelations" that we all need to know about as educated human beings.  For those who daily "blog-in" to praise you for your "special insights," it seems perfectly natural to them in their eagerness to identify with you, and you become a kind of (forgive me) messiah to some of them undoubtedly in their zeal.  I repeat: &lt;b&gt;What do you know that I don't know?  What do you know that I &lt;u&gt;need&lt;/u&gt; to know?  Answer: you don't know anything that I need to know.&lt;/b&gt;  You think you know something profound about the way the world works? So what.  Many people have this same delusion.  You think evolution explains the world. So what, could be.  I don't object to your &lt;u&gt;science&lt;/u&gt;, I object to your &lt;u&gt;arrogance&lt;/u&gt; in the public forum.  I have known and admired some wonderful iconoclasts who had some genuine insights worth considering, but my God, they knew when to shut up!  You are an embarrassment to the academic world.  With all your knowledge, your are in my estimation a failure as an educator, at least as far as one can judge from your public utterances and actions.  You educate others in the false way to behave.  You are doing more damage than good.  You are a negative karma engine.  As an atheist, perhaps the idea of doing damage while you can is for you a point of personal pride, but not everyone on the planet really gives a rat's behind about how you inject your personal vengeance against faith into your professional career, or how good you are at pretending to be superior to others.  It would be a hoot, I am sure, to sit in on one of your classes.  Who cares what the "truth" might be if it comes from some arrogant, prattle-mouth such as yourself.  God forbid that one of your students may not think as you do!  Do you really think you are doing scientists, your students, and the general public a favor by pretending to be some kind of lunatic, defacto "defender of the scientific cause"?  Even the other atheist scientists of the world find you obnoxious, and wish you would be quiet.  Probably never happen.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Don't let all the insipid praise that you may receive on your "blog" go to your head.  Do something surprising and print this e-mail in your little internet newspaper, I would love to read 500 tons of criticism of what I have just written by your fellow maniacs.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
just another human being,
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
David Hartmann &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, this guy really needs to learn that if I put something on the web, he is not required to read it, especially since he has declared that I don't know anything he needs to know.

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I think nearly all the blogs I read would be defined as “small,” including the Bug Blog. If you have an Authority of less than 150 on Technorati, you are considered &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt;.  But why worry about size queens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I proclaim today &lt;strong&gt;“Share The Love Day”&lt;/strong&gt;:  a day to recognize pretty much random blogs that I find amusing,  entertaining, and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.judgeabook.blogspot.com/"&gt;Judge a book by its cover: &lt;/a&gt;Deconstructing pulp fiction covers in a most amusing fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://pistil_museum.blogspot.com/2008/03/american-elves-yankoos.html#intro"&gt;The weirdest EVAR(?) nature book&lt;/a&gt;. Not a blog, but must be seen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://drboli.wordpress.com/"&gt;Dr. Boli&lt;/a&gt; is sort of a Victorian Monty Python. Um.&lt;br&gt;
Sort of.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A very warped version of LOLcats: &lt;a href="http://yourargumentisinvalid.com/"&gt;Your Argument is Invalid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dragonartz.wordpress.com/"&gt;DragonArtz Designs&lt;/a&gt; not only is an amazingly talented vector artist, but he/she posts all the work for Creative Commons use!! Yay!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t think it meets the “little” criterion, but I do love &lt;a href="http://www.unnecessaryquotes.com/"&gt;The “Blog” of “Unnecessary” Quotation marks.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For pretty photos of insects, you should check out &lt;a href="http://www.bugdreams.com/"&gt;Wild Light&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://insects.about.com/b/"&gt;Debbie’s Insects Blog&lt;/a&gt;. Normally I stay as far away from &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;about.com&lt;/span&gt; as I can, but Debbie seems like a very good sort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s 2 feet of snow on the ground, and reading &lt;a href="http://anthunter.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Ant Hunter&lt;/a&gt;’s adventures in Brazil makes me feel…well, envious, actually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can only read half of it, but the design and photos are lovely: &lt;a href="http://agrent.blogfa.com/"&gt;agrent.blogfa.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kolbykirk.com/news/"&gt;Kolby Kirk&lt;/a&gt;: A dude with mad CSS design skilz. His insect blog is &lt;a href="http://www.bugshutterbug.com/"&gt;Bug ShutterBug!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly–a request.&lt;br&gt;
I know that there are people that I’ve meant to add to the Blogroll here, but I’ve been having a very hectic…well, year. My job is settling down some, but I tend to drop balls all the time. So, if you’d like to be added to the Bug Blog roll, please leave a comment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also open to new and better category suggestions for making order out of a rather long blogroll list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=CDFEA6D52E5CC0EC"&gt;Monty Python has its own YouTube Channel now&lt;/a&gt;.  And there was much rejoicing!&lt;/p&gt;

All three have been big stories for the newspapers and other media. They are known as Pakigate, Sootygate, and most recently Gollygate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt; Prince Harry (one of the Queen's grandsons) was recently in deep trouble for uttering the word &lt;i&gt;Paki&lt;/i&gt; on the soundtrack of a cell phone video of some of his army buddies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt; Prince Charles (the Queen's son) was the subject of another newspaper outcry when it was learned that he followed others in addressing a long-time polo-playing Indian friend of his by the nickname &lt;i&gt;Sooty&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt; Carol Thatcher (daughter of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher) used the word "gollywog" in conversation and has now been removed from her role on The One Show, a BBC program she regularly contributed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should make it clear that racism is a significant issue to me.  Nobody hates it more than I do.  I think it is the single greatest social evil in the modern world, and more than that, for me it&amp;#39;s personal.  My son Calvin is black.  When he and I and his black Jamaican mother Joan lived together in Britain and later in the USA for many years, and we did sometimes see racism rear its ugly head.  For us, it was not an abstraction.  Joan and I have been spat at in the street (in Britain, by the way — never in the USA) for just walking along together.  That gets pretty close to home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am concerned about in the latest three scandals is whether racism is simply being trivialized (however unintentionally) through dim-witted word taboo.  But it is not at all clear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Harry was serving in the army when he took a few minutes of video of some of his friends using his cell phone.  His unit was waiting to ship out to Afghanistan, and they were sitting around, some of them dozing.  Harry went around recording them, just for something to do, and as he did a shot of his friend Ahmed Raza Khan he mumbled on the soundtrack that this was "our little Paki friend Ahmed."   The abbreviation "Paki" was not used as abuse.  It was just a shortened form of &lt;i&gt;Pakistani&lt;/i&gt; (Ahmed is indeed from Pakistan), an ethnic/national nickname like Brit, Aussie, pom, frog, or kraut (the British have a whole United Nations of such abbreviatory epithets).  The newspapers exploded with politically correct but somewhat implausible horror.  A royal apology was demanded, and was contritely given.  Episode over.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Charles's friend is the Indian businessman Kolin Dhillon.  He has said that he has borne the nickname Sooty since his schooldays, and doesn't mind it at all.  "You know you have arrived," he said, "When you acquire a nickname."  But Prince Charles was damned anyway, for having become known to have used the familiar nickname.  The story did not have any real legs, and faded away.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the case of Carol Thatcher that I at first thought was the silliest yet; but it may instead be the least silly.  It is not yet possible to tell.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened, it seems, was that she was sitting around in the Green Room, a large glass of white wine in her hand, in a group of a dozen people in an interval during a recording of The One Show, and she referred to a black professional tennis player as a golliwog.  It is important that she was not among friends in a private place.  The group included guests, production staff walking in and out, and a journalist or two.  Although it was not broadcast, it was on BBC premises during working hours.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than one member of the group was offended by the golliwog reference, and said so.  There was some kind of altercation between Thatcher and the comedienne Jo Brand.  Later a complaint was made to the BBC management. The BBC says it tried for five days to get a "sincere and fulsome" apology out of her and failed.  She holds that she was in a private conversation, and was merely a joking remark not calling for any apology.  So the decision was made that she would not be contributing to The One Show any more (she is a freelancer who sometimes gets work on BBC shows, not a career BBC staff member).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a transcript of the episode, of course.  Everything depends on what exactly was said, but of course no one can tell us — it was not recorded, and non-linguists are not competent to provide a precise report of the utterances made in the correct sequence and with the correct intonation.  (Plenty of linguists get their transcriptions of even quite short utterances wrong.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press reports imply that Thatcher may have expressed amusement at the way the tennis player resembled the golliwog on the jars of marmalade she remembered from her youth.  This would been the familiar cartoon figure, a stereotyped negro with a black face and fuzzy hair outline, that appeared on the label of every jar of such marmalades as Golden Shred and Silver Shred, manufactured by James Robertson &amp;amp; Sons.  The Robertson company used the golliwog logo right up till 2002. (See &lt;a href="http://www.gollycorner.co.uk/"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; for a wide variety of images of the Robertson golliwog on badges and so on.  Some of the badges depict the golly with a tennis racket.) Everybody refers to the golliwog on Golden Shred jars as the Robertson golliwog; there is no other name for him, other than the abbreviation &lt;i&gt;golly&lt;/i&gt; (said to originate as a childish pronunciation of &lt;i&gt;dolly&lt;/i&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4513939/Carol-Thatcher-golliwog-row-Behind-the-doors-of-the-Green-Room.html"&gt;now known&lt;/a&gt; that the tennis player Thatcher referred to was the 23-year-old Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.  But what exactly did she say about him? Suppose it had been, "He always reminds me of golliwog on marmalade jars; he's so sweet."  Would that be racism?  (It would certainly be wildly inaccurate; Tsonga is of mixed Congolese and French parentage, a serious young man with short hair and brown skin who looks rather like the young Muhammad Ali; the white British player Andy Murray on a mad hair day looks more reminiscent of the Robertson golliwog in silhouette than Tsonga.) But suppose instead she had said, "I was so glad when that fucking gollywog was knocked out of the Australian Open." That would be different, wouldn't it?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language Log's view is that when the alleged crime is linguistic, the utterance involved must be accurately reported, in detail.  In the case of Gollygate, that condition is not met.  We simply do not know if this was a case of politically-correct overreaching or a case of reasonable maintenance of workplace standards of behavior in a public institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Brief update: Tons more in the comments below.  But let me just add that at &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5671863.ece"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; we now learn that Thatcher called Tsonga a golliwog several times, and also referred to him (compounding her racial and national epithets) as a golliwog frog.  Not looking so nice, is it?  I've tried to set things out objectively above (though of course I repeatedly get called a naive fellow-traveller of racism below), but I really do get the impression that I personally wouldn't want to sit around the Green Room at the BBC drinking white wine and listening to Carol Thatcher and her merry jokes.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Just because a group of people congregate in a church to inventory and confess their sins in confidence, submit to a higher power, accept that they’re powerless to change their behavior,  accept that they’re just sick from the inside and can’t ever get better, dogmatically follow the teachings of a book referred to as “The Big Book”, and pledge to disconnect from loved ones who might tempt them back towards your sinning ways–that doesn’t make it a cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh wait. Maybe it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1872779,00.html"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; confirms what we already knew, that 12-step programs are Bullshit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/new-research-determines-12-step-programs-are-still-worthless/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/QGjRzvbnaFk/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the alternative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In last month’s &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6T90-4T2RYTG-2&amp;amp;_user=6806842&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=6806842&amp;amp;md5=59d703321e8a0ea1b95fda594df80ef4"&gt;Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment&lt;/a&gt;, University of New Mexico addiction specialist William Miller and his colleagues presented findings from two controlled trials in which patients underwent drug treatment. Some of the patients received spiritual guidance as part of the treatment — learning such practices as prayer, meditation and service to others, all of which are central to 12-step programs. Others received secular psychotherapy. Because of the enduring popularity of AA and similar programs that involve a spiritual component, Miller and his team expected the patients in the spiritual group to do better than those in the secular group. They were wrong — at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While both groups eventually benefited relatively equally from their treatment — abusing substances on fewer days — it took longer to see improvement among those in the spiritual group. What’s more, those who received spiritual guidance reported being significantly more anxious and depressed after four months than those who got secular help.&lt;/strong&gt; Those problems abated at about the eight-month point, but because substance abusers are at high risk for suicide, some worry that it may not be a good idea to put them through demanding spiritual calisthenics in the early months of their recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea! Secular programs work better than voodoo!! BIG SURPRISE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the  &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/05/30/alternatives-to-alcoholics-anonymous/"&gt;secular alternatives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Their middle child, Marissa, is on the autism spectrum. As a toddler her tantrums were "off the charts"; now, at the age of 13:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marissa's behavior has not passed; it has, in fact, become worse. According to Bilson, Marissa and her tantrums rule the household. "I don't want to hear her screaming and tantruming, so we pretty much let her do what she wants," [Mary] Bilson says. "We" means Mary, her husband, John, and their two other children, Brittany, 15, and 6-year-old Brendan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the peace means that, when it comes to Marissa, the rules are different. She is allowed unlimited time on the one family computer. She is allowed access to her siblings' rooms and possessions. She is allowed to eat dinner at the computer instead of the family table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this "911" situation a behavior analyst, Rick Schoeder of &lt;a href="http://www.autismpartnership.com/"&gt;Autism Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, is called in to help.  &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/04/autism.resolution/"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; notes that "usually this type of treatment costs about $20,000 a week, and it's not covered by insurance, but because CNN was allowed to videotape the entire process, AP waived the fee for the Bilsons." (Cynical me thinks, is this CNN getting content for an "autism reality tv show" and Autism Partnership getting some national exposure?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Marissa is in need of help; when I read about her, I wondered if her being an adolescent might be contributing to her challenges. (My own son, also an adolescent, has certainly been having his share of late.) &lt;a href="http://www.autismpartnership.com/"&gt;Autism Partnership&lt;/a&gt; is an ABA agency and ABA---Applied Behavior Analysis---has been part of my son's education since he was just over two years old, first at home and, even since he was 4 1/2, in a school setting. The CNN "Autism 911" series seems to be pitching ABA as "the answer" to Marissa's needs: "Teen's family transformed after autism intervention" is the &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/04/autism.resolution/"&gt;title of Wednesday's segment&lt;/a&gt;. But there are at least two important points overlooked in CNN's report, from my perspective as a parent who's found ABA very important in my son's education, and who has---over the past nine years---found much to question and critique about ABA---about behavior therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a thorough critique of ABA and the troubled history of behavior modification in general and on autistic individuals and children more particularly, see Michelle Dawson's &lt;a href="http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Autism Crisis&lt;/a&gt; blog and &lt;a href="http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2006/04/lovaas-aba-bad-old-days.html"&gt;Autism Diva&lt;/a&gt; on the "&lt;a href="http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2006/04/lovaas-aba-bad-old-days.html"&gt;bad old days&lt;/a&gt;." When Jim and I first learned about ABA from reading Catherine Maurice's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Let-Me-Hear-Your-Voice/dp/0449906647"&gt;Let Me Hear Your Voice: A Family's Triumph Over Autism&lt;/a&gt;, our first thought was, &lt;em&gt;behavior modification&lt;/em&gt;? How can we do that? We decided to try ABA after numerous "experts" and teachers and therapists, after spending time with Charlie, said "he's unteachable" in so many words. Charlie's ABA has always been centered around where he's at and his learning style. It's the relationships between him and his numerous teachers and therapists that have been key to his learning, with an emphasis on the positive and on fun, always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/04/autism.resolution/"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;'s report on the Bilson family misses is that it's not as simple as someone appearing and "intervening" with a child and then all's going to be well.  Learning is a work in progress for any student, and Charlie no less. There have been changes after Autism Partnership's Schroeder came, but what about after he leaves? According to &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/04/autism.resolution/"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marissa -- who before the therapy was, in Schroeder's words, "out of control" -- now has rules to follow, something she didn't have before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marissa's mother also learned some lessons about her daughter that week. "I learned that Marissa is smart," Mary Bilson said. "Smarter than I thought."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days inside the Bilsons' cozy house, there is a lot less screaming and more boundaries are in place. The balance of power is tipping back into the hands of the parents and away from Marissa and her tantrums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the long haul, I've learned to wonder? Like my son, Marissa is getting older and, if she's like Charlie, seeking to be more and more independent every day. I can't tell you how much I'm thrilled to see my son growing up and wanting to do so much more and (just like any adolescent, right?) not listen to mom but do the eye-roll or, very simply, "No." It would be a real service if CNN or some media outlet could show that the real story---the reality---about life with autism and life as a parent raising a child on the spectrum is that autism is lifelong. We don't just need band-aid interventions, but effective, long-lasting, well-thought out, humane and ethical solutions for teaching kids and supporting them in the ways that encourage their abilities, throughout their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the rest of what happens to Marissa that is the real reality story.&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t imagine it’ll be hard to track down the robber. Just shout out that Captain Picard’s favorite tea was English Breakfast Tea and the robber will no doubt run over to correct you, insisting that Picard prefers Earl Grey. Obviously this man is no Klingon as there is no honor in robbing a convenience store. It is the tactic of a cowardly  p’tach! I suspect a Romulan frame job.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of you voiced concerns about Sanjay’s nomination, specifically because of his poor handling of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/01/sanjay_gupta_for_surgeon_gener.php"&gt;Raelians’ Clonaid fiasco&lt;/a&gt;, his inability to counter Michael Moore’s health statistics as presented in &lt;em&gt;Sicko&lt;/em&gt; and his relationship to the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wondered about what Sanjay Gupta might be like as Surgeon General – and specifically how he might assist in “restoring science to its rightful place” – I decided to educate myself about his thought processes by purchasing his recent book “Chasing Life.” The question I sought to answer was, “is Sanjay Gupta a crank?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is: I’m not sure.  Although I wouldn’t go so far as to say that he is a crank, I think he’s more likely to be a shruggie. For those of you who haven’t read &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;my post on shruggies&lt;/a&gt;, here’s the definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shruggie &lt;/em&gt;(noun): a person who doesn’t care about the science versus pseudoscience debate. When presented with descriptions of exaggerated or fraudulent health claims or practices, their response is to shrug. Shruggies are fairly inert, they will not argue the merits (or lack thereof) of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or pseudoscience in general. They simply aren’t all that interested in the discussion, and are somewhat puzzled by those who are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer answer involves an exploration of Gupta’s disturbing insistence on flirting with cranks, if it gets him publicity. The back cover of &lt;em&gt;Chasing Life&lt;/em&gt; caries an endorsement from Deepak Chopra – and the inside page a favorable review from Andrew Weil. Normally, I would assume that the author of any book endorsed by those two would contain an intolerable blend of science and pseudoscience and refuse to read it. But for the sake of the readers of &lt;em&gt;Science Based Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, I stifled my gag reflex and purchased the book. I hope that my sacrifice will benefit you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Wrong With Sanjay’s Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing Life does not deliver what it promises. At the outset, Gupta suggests – with noteworthy grandiosity – that he has traveled the entire world on a quest for the secrets of long life. In reality, he cites interviews with researchers and centenarians in the US almost exclusively – with two notable exceptions: a conversation with a 103-year-old woman in Okinawa who attributes her good health to her 76-year-old boyfriend, and a bizarre visit to a “stem cell” laboratory in Russia. I hardly felt that I was reaping much benefit from his international “investigative journalism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta’s facts are impossible to check. There is no reference section in his book to “chase down” his reasoning behind statements like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider this: if we were able to maintain our body as it is when we’re eleven – when our healing capacity is at its maximum – we could live to an estimated 1,200 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting today, there are things you can do to fend off the toxic forces trying to unravel your DNA and shorten your telomeres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences in the bacteria in peoples’ digestive tracts may allow some people to eat 30 per cent more calories daily than another without gaining weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta listens with rapt attention to delusional people.  He entertains the fantasy that longevity can be purchased at a Russian spa, and that those who believe they might live 1000 years are credible scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, his just might be the face of a man who has found something that has eluded adventurers for the last thousand years. [Gupta’s conclusion after speaking with a Russian man who injects people with “stem cells” derived from a customer’s own fat.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil himself says he expects to live at least one thousand years. If that sounds crazy, you haven’t sat down and listened to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta is careless in representing science outside of his field of expertise. In one case, he suggests that because central obesity puts people at higher risk for heart disease, they should reduce their abdominal fat by performing core strengthening exercises. (As if one can truly spot reduce belly fat with sit ups.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another part of the book, Gupta describes the evidence for an herbal mixture’s ability to extend life this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a very small study with only 29 participants, but statistically very strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Right With Sanjay’s Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta demonstrates appropriate skepticism about vitamin supplements and their potential contribution to slowing the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He correctly identifies healthy behaviors – daily exercise, a calorie-reduced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates, and stress reduction techniques (including good sleep hygiene, maintaining a positive attitude, engaging in mentally challenging activities throughout the life cycle, and being married to a supportive spouse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the quackometer scale (where zero is Barker Bausell’s &lt;a href="http://getbetterhealth.com/good-science-makes-bad-television-and-other-truths/2007.12.18"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snake Oil Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and 10 is anything written by Suzanne Somers) I’d give this book a 5. Not exactly full frontal quackery, but also some really concerning misstatements and an openness to snake oil that scares me. Can Sanjay Gupta be drawn out of shruggiedom and back into science-based medicine?  Only time will tell – and since he claims to be following all of his own longevity principles – perhaps we’ll have 1000 more years to decide. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

The classic example of quote mining, when creationists try to alter the intent by taking it out of context is Darwin’s discussion of the evolution of the eye. The quote mine is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists like to point to this quote and say, see Evolutionists, even Darwin admits that the eye couldn’t have evolved by chance. The other of the review linked to above explains the error here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This quote is from the sixth chapter of The Origin of Species. Immediately after this quote, Darwin goes into great detail describing just how the eye could in fact have formed by natural selection. This is thus an excellent example of a quote mine; it is both out of context and relies on an argument from authority. Like many quote mines, the authority in question is poor; in this case, Darwin died over a century ago. Given the nature of scientific progress, it is laughable that this 100 year old quote is persuasive evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So onto the Expelled “book of quotes.” First of all, it seems like it’s not much of a book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book, entitled, “The Wonder of the Universe,” is more of a small pamphlet than an actual book. Each page has a single quote in the middle of the page with the rest of the page blank. The entire content could fit on a single sheet of 8 ½ by 11 paper if both sides are used. The quotes are poorly formatted with occasional errors of punctuation and no details of citation other than the author’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really interesting is the authors of the quotes and their content. Slightly under half of the quotes in the book come from the Founding Fathers of the United  States or from other respected US politicians such as Abraham Lincoln. There is a dearth of quotes from scientists. The most modern scientist quoted, Steinmetz, died in 1923. He is in fact the most recent author cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quotes themselves fall primarily into two broad categories, quotes trumpeting the importance of free exchange and quotes arguing for the existence of God using the standard argument that “X is complicated so X must have been designed by God.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it seems this is as profound as creationism gets, quoting non-scientists about science. Good thinking! Or rather should I say, “god thinking.” That at least explains the lack of even internal consistency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-indent:.5in"&gt;I’m forced to conclude that Stein or whichever of Stein’s colleagues compiled this book thinks that the Founders of the United States were so intelligent and saintly that ideas held by them must be given special weight. This is a bit odd since the book also includes the standard quote from Galileo that “In questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben: Please make up your mind. Do authorities matter or does reasoning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more in the review. It’s definitely worth a read since if you’re a creationist you’ll have something new to piss you off and if you’re sane to get a good laugh at the transparency of the poorly designed propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the recipe, the meat was to be cut into small pieces or slices, sprinkled with “myrrh and at least a little bit of aloe” and then soaked in spirits of wine for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it was to be hung up “in a very dry and shady place.” In the end, the recipe notes, it would be “similar to smoke-cured meat” and would be without “any stench.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johann Schröder, a German pharmacologist, wrote these words in the 17th century. But the meat to which he was referring was not cured ham or beef tenderloin. The instructions specifically called for the “cadaver of a reddish man … of around 24 years old,” who had been “dead of a violent death but not an illness” and then laid out “exposed to the moon rays for one day and one night” with, he noted, “a clear sky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOL. That is awesome! I knew medicine back then was bad, even to the point where it was usually more dangerous than the very things it was supposed to heal but holy crap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In recent years, academics across the country have started using blogs to relay information and ideas. Many are now incorporating the medium into their classes, asking students to take to their keyboards and post thoughts or resources on course material.

&lt;p&gt;The time commitment means professors need to prioritize when it comes to blogging. Those who write personal blogs do so outside of their teaching requirements, but as blogs become more popular, the question of their role in academic research and publishing becomes more complex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's so new that (universities) haven't quite incorporated it yet into the three areas that we're responsible for -- teaching, research and service," Perry said. "But it really kind of overlaps in all those areas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perry said he believes that blogging could be considered applied research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in an interview, University Provost Teresa Sullivan said that blogging lacks an important element, which generally elevates the credibility of a publication: peer review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Peer review is an important quality marker," said Sullivan. "With electronic media now, anybody can publish anything."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the University doesn't view blogs as a form of official research or publishing, Sullivan said she encourages professors to use them, even if they express controversial opinions or ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That's what universities are about," Sullivan said. "The university is the place where you're free to put ideas out there, and we're tolerant of other people's ideas but it also means you've got to be ready for somebody to go after you and attack your ideas."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogs considerably raise the profile of University professors, which is good for the University. Through their archive of posts, professors advertise their expertise in a given field. Establishing that authority leads calls from the media -- and the University's name appearing in print.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good, positive article, including quotes from some well-known academic bloggers.  Except for the very first sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The booming blogosphere is a world dominated by celebrity gossip, confessionals and radical opinions. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know that corporate journalists have to say something offensive whenever they mention blogs, as a loyalty test, lest they be expelled from their guild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/university_professors_turn_to.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/-Rs0RMyu1sg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233813735103"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/making_an_emerging_cage_video.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e664d522c734c77a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Insects"/><title type="html">Making an Emerging Cage (video)</title><published>2009-02-05T03:14:21Z</published><updated>2009-02-05T03:14:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/hPv3Vw0WxBU/making_an_emerging_cage_video.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/making_an_emerging_cage_video.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They’re selling a bunch of shirts that label the individual wearing them “EX-” followed by whatever they want to label themselves as being against. Some actual examples:  EX-Masturbater, EX-fornicator (good cause we can do without you f-ing up our gene pool), EX-atheist, EX-homosexual (cause that worked SO well with Ted Haggard). And here are 2 slogans that are bound to become hip and cool with the kiddies:  EX-Rebel and EX-Hustler.

Barack Obama has been “billed as our savior and messiah. ” &lt;a href="http://www.obamadeception.net/"&gt;That’s what Alex Jones says&lt;/a&gt; so I have to accept that it’s true because Alex Jones, as you probably know, is our savior and messiah. I know this because Alex Jones says so and Alex Jones also constantly says he is telling the truth again and again and again and therefore everything he says must be the truth. Why else would he say so every other sentence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait. Does America worship Barack Obama as a messiah? Certainly Oprah called him “The One.” But then everyone just made fun of Oprah for it. I know I was supporting Hilary Clinton before she was knocked out of the race and before Obama won me over with an increasingly better campaign. And while he might have begun with rather empty rhetoric that simply called for “Change” and “Hope” without delving into any specifics that drastically changed during the final leg of the election when he suddenly started to lay out his plans point by point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even after Obama swept the election, did Obama just get a pass because as Alex Jones says, he was “billed as our savior and messiah”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, when he made decisions we didn’t like we told him so. For instance, myself and many, many others harshly criticized his choice of Rev. Rick Warren at his inauguration. And that was just over a symbolic gesture. And now there is much controversy surrounding his stimulus package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who exactly is blindly worshiping Barack Obama as a messiah? Sure, right now an overwhelming majority of the country support him. After all, he’s our president and he’s already united the country in a way that George Bush never did. He’s also unquestionably smart and has surrounded himself with some of the smartest people in their respective fields. Unlike his predessor he’s taken a strong pro-science stance. And I don’t mean he just talks a good game. His choices for science-related cabinet positions are top notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Barack Obama was just all talk I wouldn’t support him. Back in the beginning of last year I didn’t support him because his rhetoric was empty. The reason I now support him is because he’s proven he can walk the walk and has already shown better leadership qualities than any other president in my life time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if Obama does something I don’t like, I’ll express my grievences like I did with the Rick Warren incident. But excuse me if I find it rather hard to believe that Barack Obama and George Bush are both part of an evil conspiracy out to get us all when the 2 men’s policies could not be any more dissimilar. But sadly a whole lot of credulous people who have projected their own blind faith in the Church of Alex Jones onto those of us who have the audacity to actually like Barack Obama (or at least unlike Rush Limbaugh hope he successfully improves the country) are just going to buy Alex Jones’ crap because he’ll call his nonsense “True,” and that’s good enough for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader Pascal Poirier tells us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure you are aware of the bus ads in London, UK.  In case you were not aware, we had recent developments in Halifax, NS, Canada, with the attempt by Humanist Canada to put the toned-down slogan "You can be good without God" on our buses.  It appears that this true statement was too controversial for the transit authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This campaign was undoubtedly inspired by the currently successful bus-ad campaign in London, England, encouraged and supported by Richard Dawkins. Signs stating "There's probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life" are seen all over that city, though Dawkins had reservations about including the word, "probably" in the text...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233806999615"><id gr:original-id="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=230">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/43b1583f85be71e8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Miseducation"/><category term="Urban legend"/><title type="html">Action News 6 buries the lead</title><published>2009-02-05T04:07:53Z</published><updated>2009-02-05T04:07:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=230" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://autism-news-beat.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia’s Action News 6 covered all the bases when reporting on parents &lt;a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/health&amp;amp;id=6636466&amp;amp;status=ok"&gt;who deliberately expose&lt;/a&gt; their children to a potentially dangerous disease via chicken pox parties. Cue well-meaning but dangerously misinformed mother. Quote doctors who set the record straight. Close with mom’s opposing view. It’s a wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s wrong with this picture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piece opens with “Carrie”, a pseudonymous parent more concerned with privacy than flesh eating bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My 7-year-old daughter has been to six of these parties,” said Carrie, who also runs an online forum that helps parents organize and find parties in their neighborhoods. “Unfortunately, we have not caught the pox yet, but I’m keeping my eye out for more parties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrie, who also believes that vaccines cause autism,  explains why it’s better to “catch the disease naturally” than succumb to medical experts with their “diplomas” and their “knowledge”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I found out that children require booster shots, what that said to me was that there is no prolonged effect and that the vaccine doesn’t work in the long term,” Carrie said. “If it did, there would be no need for multiple shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my mind, that puts children at greater risk because they get vaccinated when they’re young and if, for some reason, they don’t get the booster shot or the booster shot isn’t effective, the virus will be significantly more dangerous as they get older,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s only after we hear from the concerned parent that Action News 6 introduces us to the experts. First we hear from Dr. Lou Cooper, a former president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m aghast at the thought of these parties,” said Dr. Louis Cooper, a spokesman for the Infectious Disease Society of America and a professor emeritus of pediatrics at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I deeply regret that parents who are trying to do the right thing just don’t get it,” Cooper said. “The fact is that they’re right, chickenpox for most children is a mild illness. But when you see children who have the misfortune of one of the complications that are possible, you never forget it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper said that he has seen children contract conditions as serious as encephalitis, a brain infection, and has even had young patients die from the virus after developing &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/necrotizing-fasciitis-flesh-eating-bacteria-topic-overview"&gt;flesh-eating bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The child does not need to be immune-deficient or malnourished to have these complications,” said Cooper, who recommends that all parents vaccinate their children against the virus. “It can be an ordinary healthy child, it’s Russian roulette.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we hear from Dr. Paul Offit, a widely-quoted infectious disease expert from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thinking many parents have is that the natural infection is more likely to induce higher levels of antibodies and longer-lasting immunity than vaccines,” Offit said. “That’s generally true but the problem is if you make that choice you are also taking the risk of a natural infection, which can mean hospitalization and sometimes death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers now say the chickenpox vaccine has slashed the occurrence of the disease in children by 90 percent but still worry that parents like Carrie are preventing the virus from disappearing all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offit believes that if the chickenpox vaccine becomes as widely used as the measles vaccine was back in 1963, chickenpox would go the way of the measles: away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we introduced the measles vaccine, which is another virus that gets worse for patients as they get older, in 1963, we dramatically reduced the instance of measles,” Offit said. “That is what will happen here with chickenpox.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty tough stuff coming from top experts in the field. So why aren’t their comments in the lead? A couple thoughts come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the reporter doesn’t understand that chicken pox, despite the wacky name, is dangerous. Sure, most kids suffer without complications, and people who didn’t die from complications of varicella &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; tell you who that chicken pox was no biggie back then. But the fact is, this is a contagious disease with potentially serious consequences. Would Action News 6 treat the story any differently if parents were holding polio parties? You betcha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second thought is that Action News 6 didn’t want to upset the mothers of Philadelphia. Lots of women I’m sure identify with “Carrie”, and have heard about chicken pox parties. Best not to upset the viewers too badly. It’s one thing to hear about Philadelphia gang wars and young lives cut short by violence. It’s another to find out what you thought you knew about your child’s health and well being was all wrong. Best to break it to them slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we come to the big finish - “Carrie” rebuts the experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we introduced the measles vaccine, which is another virus that gets worse for patients as they get older, in 1963, we dramatically reduced the instance of measles,” Offit said. “That is what will happen here with chickenpox.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Carrie doesn’t agree. She says that the fact that some children still get the virus despite being vaccinated is evidence that chickenpox will never disappear completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Something like this will continually mutate and potentially be worse than before,” Carrie said. “Kind of the way the overuse of antibiotics has happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what doctors say about how parents who don’t vaccinate their children might be putting them at increased risk, Carrie is unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything you do every day puts my child at risk,” she said. “Putting her in a car puts her at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can all only make the decisions that are right for our families, and this is what happens to be right for my family at this moment in time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No vaccine is 100% effective, which is why herd immunity is so important. Vaccines helped &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/"&gt;eradicate smallpox&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href="http://http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp"&gt;decrease polio&lt;/a&gt; cases to about 1,600 cases a year.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004385" title=""&gt;Climate Change and Trophic Response of the Antarctic Bottom Fauna&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As Earth warms, temperate and subpolar marine species will increasingly shift their geographic ranges poleward. The endemic shelf fauna of Antarctica is especially vulnerable to climate-mediated biological invasions because cold temperatures currently exclude the durophagous (shell-breaking) predators that structure shallow-benthic communities elsewhere. We used the Eocene fossil record from Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula, to project specifically how global warming will reorganize the nearshore benthos of Antarctica. A long-term cooling trend, which began with a sharp temperature drop ~41 Ma (million years ago), eliminated durophagous predators--teleosts (modern bony fish), decapod crustaceans (crabs and lobsters) and almost all neoselachian elasmobranchs (modern sharks and rays)--from Antarctic nearshore waters after the Eocene. Even prior to those extinctions, durophagous predators became less active as coastal sea temperatures declined from 41 Ma to the end of the Eocene, ~33.5 Ma. In response, dense populations of suspension-feeding ophiuroids and crinoids abruptly appeared. Dense aggregations of brachiopods transcended the cooling event with no apparent change in predation pressure, nor were there changes in the frequency of shell-drilling predation on venerid bivalves. Rapid warming in the Southern Ocean is now removing the physiological barriers to shell-breaking predators, and crabs are returning to the Antarctic Peninsula. Over the coming decades to centuries, we predict a rapid reversal of the Eocene trends. Increasing predation will reduce or eliminate extant dense populations of suspension-feeding echinoderms from nearshore habitats along the Peninsula while brachiopods will continue to form large populations, and the intensity of shell-drilling predation on infaunal bivalves will not change appreciably. In time the ecological effects of global warming could spread to other portions of the Antarctic coast. The differential responses of faunal components will reduce the endemic character of Antarctic subtidal communities, homogenizing them with nearshore communities at lower latitudes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004389" title=""&gt;Risks for Central Nervous System Diseases among Mobile Phone Subscribers: A Danish Retrospective Cohort Study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate a possible link between cellular telephone use and risks for various diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). We conducted a large nationwide cohort study of 420 095 persons whose first cellular telephone subscription was between 1982 and 1995, who were followed through 2003 for hospital contacts for a diagnosis of a CNS disorder. Standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) were derived by dividing the number of hospital contacts in the cohort by the number expected in the Danish population. The SHRs were increased by 10-20% for migraine and vertigo. No associations were seen for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis or epilepsy in women. SHRs decreased by 30-40% were observed for dementia (Alzheimer disease, vascular and other dementia), Parkinson disease and epilepsy among men. In analyses restricted to subscribers of 10 years or more, the SHRs remained similarly increased for migraine and vertigo and similarly decreased for Alzheimer disease and other dementia and epilepsy (in men); the other SHRs were close to unity. In conclusion, the excesses of migraine and vertigo observed in this first study on cellular telephones and CNS disease deserve further attention. An interplay of a healthy cohort effect and reversed causation bias due to prodromal symptoms impedes detection of a possible association with dementia and Parkinson disease. Identification of the factors that result in a healthy cohort might be of interest for elucidation of the etiology of these diseases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004382" title=""&gt;A Ligand Channel through the G Protein Coupled Receptor Opsin&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The G protein coupled receptor rhodopsin contains a pocket within its seven-transmembrane helix (TM) structure, which bears the inactivating 11-cis-retinal bound by a protonated Schiff-base to Lys296 in TM7. Light-induced 11-cis-/all-trans-isomerization leads to the Schiff-base deprotonated active Meta II intermediate. With Meta II decay, the Schiff-base bond is hydrolyzed, all-trans-retinal is released from the pocket, and the apoprotein opsin reloaded with new 11-cis-retinal. The crystal structure of opsin in its active Ops* conformation provides the basis for computational modeling of retinal release and uptake. The ligand-free 7TM bundle of opsin opens into the hydrophobic membrane layer through openings A (between TM1 and 7), and B (between TM5 and 6), respectively. Using skeleton search and molecular docking, we find a continuous channel through the protein that connects these two openings and comprises in its central part the retinal binding pocket. The channel traverses the receptor over a distance of ca. 70 Å and is between 11.6 and 3.2 Å wide. Both openings are lined with aromatic residues, while the central part is highly polar. Four constrictions within the channel are so narrow that they must stretch to allow passage of the retinal β-ionone-ring. Constrictions are at openings A and B, respectively, and at Trp265 and Lys296 within the retinal pocket. The lysine enforces a 90° elbow-like kink in the channel which limits retinal passage. With a favorable Lys side chain conformation, 11-cis-retinal can take the turn, whereas passage of the all-trans isomer would require more global conformational changes. We discuss possible scenarios for the uptake of 11-cis- and release of all-trans-retinal. If the uptake gate of 11-cis-retinal is assigned to opening B, all-trans is likely to leave through the same gate. The unidirectional passage proposed previously requires uptake of 11-cis-retinal through A and release of photolyzed all-trans-retinal through B.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004390" title=""&gt;Phylogenetic Resolution and Quantifying the Phylogenetic Diversity and Dispersion of Communities&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Conservation biologists and community ecologists have increasingly begun to quantify the phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic dispersion in species assemblages. In some instances, the phylogenetic trees used for such analyses are fully bifurcating, but in many cases the phylogenies being used contain unresolved nodes (i.e. polytomies). The lack of phylogenetic resolution in such studies, while certainly not preferred, is likely to continue particularly for those analyzing diverse communities and datasets with hundreds to thousands of taxa. Thus it is imperative that we quantify potential biases and losses of statistical power in studies that use phylogenetic trees that are not completely resolved. The present study is designed to meet both of these goals by quantifying the phylogenetic diversity and dispersion of simulated communities using resolved and gradually 'unresolved' phylogenies. The results show that: (i) measures of community phylogenetic diversity and dispersion are generally more sensitive to loss of resolution basally in the phylogeny and less sensitive to loss of resolution terminally; and (ii) the loss of phylogenetic resolution generally causes false negative results rather than false positives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004379" title=""&gt;Probing Evolutionary Patterns in Neotropical Birds through DNA Barcodes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Neotropical avifauna is more diverse than that of any other biogeographic region, but our understanding of patterns of regional divergence is limited. Critical examination of this issue is currently constrained by the limited genetic information available. This study begins to address this gap by assembling a library of mitochondrial COI sequences, or DNA barcodes, for Argentinian birds and comparing their patterns of genetic diversity to those of North American birds. Five hundred Argentinian species were examined, making this the first major examination of DNA barcodes for South American birds. Our results indicate that most southern Neotropical bird species show deep sequence divergence from their nearest-neighbour, corroborating that the high diversity of this fauna is not based on an elevated incidence of young species radiations. Although species ages appear similar in temperate North and South American avifaunas, patterns of regional divergence are more complex in the Neotropics, suggesting that the high diversity of the Neotropical avifauna has been fueled by greater opportunities for regional divergence. Deep genetic splits were observed in at least 21 species, though distribution patterns of these lineages were variable. The lack of shared polymorphisms in species, even in species with less than 0.5M years of reproductive isolation, further suggests that selective sweeps could regularly excise ancestral mitochondrial polymorphisms. These findings confirm the efficacy of species delimitation in birds via DNA barcodes, even when tested on a global scale. Further, they demonstrate how large libraries of a standardized gene region provide insight into evolutionary processes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004375" title=""&gt;Ticks Associated with Macquarie Island Penguins Carry Arboviruses from Four Genera&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Macquarie Island, a small subantarctic island, is home to rockhopper, royal and king penguins, which are often infested with the globally distributed seabird tick, Ixodes uriae. A flavivirus, an orbivirus, a phlebovirus, and a nairovirus were isolated from these ticks and partial sequences obtained. The flavivirus was nearly identical to Gadgets Gully virus, isolated some 30 year previously, illustrating the remarkable genetic stability of this virus. The nearest relative to the orbivirus (for which we propose the name Sandy Bay virus) was the Scottish Broadhaven virus, and provided only the second available sequences from the Great Island orbivirus serogroup. The phlebovirus (for which we propose the name Catch-me-cave virus) and the previously isolated Precarious Point virus were distinct but related, with both showing homology with the Finnish Uukuniemi virus. These penguin viruses provided the second and third available sequences for the Uukuniemi group of phleboviruses. The nairovirus (for which we propose the name Finch Creek virus) was shown to be related to the North American Tillamook virus, the Asian Hazara virus and Nairobi sheep disease virus. Macquarie Island penguins thus harbour arboviruses from at least four of the seven arbovirus-containing genera, with related viruses often found in the northern hemisphere.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004332" title=""&gt;Evolution of Genome Size and Complexity in &lt;i&gt;Pinus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genome evolution in the gymnosperm lineage of seed plants has given rise to many of the most complex and largest plant genomes, however the elements involved are poorly understood. Gymny is a previously undescribed retrotransposon family in Pinus that is related to Athila elements in Arabidopsis. Gymny elements are dispersed throughout the modern Pinus genome and occupy a physical space at least the size of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. In contrast to previously described retroelements in Pinus, the Gymny family was amplified or introduced after the divergence of pine and spruce (Picea). If retrotransposon expansions are responsible for genome size differences within the Pinaceae, as they are in angiosperms, then they have yet to be identified. In contrast, molecular divergence of Gymny retrotransposons together with other families of retrotransposons can account for the large genome complexity of pines along with protein-coding genic DNA, as revealed by massively parallel DNA sequence analysis of Cot fractionated genomic DNA. Most of the enormous genome complexity of pines can be explained by divergence of retrotransposons, however the elements responsible for genome size variation are yet to be identified. Genomic resources for Pinus including those reported here should assist in further defining whether and how the roles of retrotransposons differ in the evolution of angiosperm and gymnosperm genomes.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_119.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/bCOY3TSL-CM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233803851391"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/antarctic-warming-is-robust/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/77e2e46efd0f9e54</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Arctic and Antarctic"/><category term="Instrumental  Record"/><category term="Climate Science"/><title type="html">Antarctic warming is robust</title><published>2009-02-05T02:56:14Z</published><updated>2009-02-05T02:56:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/antarctic-warming-is-robust/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The difference between a single calculation and a solid paper in the technical literature is vast. A good paper examines a question from multiple angles and find ways to assess the robustness of its conclusions to all sorts of possible sources of error — in input data, in assumptions, and even occasionally in programming. If a conclusion is robust over as much of this as can be tested (and the good peer reviewers generally insist that this be shown), then the paper is likely to last the test of time. Although science proceeds by making use of the work that others have done before, it is not based on the assumption that everything that went before is correct. It is precisely because that there is always the possibility of errors that so much is based on &amp;#39;balance of evidence&amp;#39; arguments&amp;#39; that are mutually reinforcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://faculty.washington.edu/steig/nature09data/cover_nature.jpg" align="right"&gt;So it is with the &lt;a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/steig/nature09data/"&gt;Steig et al paper&lt;/a&gt; published last week. Their conclusions that West Antarctica is warming quite strongly and that even Antarctica as a whole is warming since 1957 (the start of systematic measurements) were based on extending the long term manned weather station data (42 stations) using two different methodologies (RegEM and PCA) to interpolate to undersampled regions using correlations from two independent data sources (satellite AVHRR and the Automated Weather Stations (AWS) ), and validations based on subsets of the stations (15 vs 42 of them) etc. The answers in each of these cases are pretty much the same; thus the issues that undoubtedly exist (and that were raised in the paper) — with satellite data only being valid on clear days, with the spottiness of the AWS data, with the fundamental limits of the long term manned weather station data itself - aren&amp;#39;t that important to the basic conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quick point about the reconstruction methodology. These methods are designed to fill in missing data points using as much information as possible concerning how the existing data at that point connects to the data that exists elsewhere. To give a simple example, if one station gave readings that were always the average of two other stations when it was working, then a good estimate of the value at that station when it wasn't working, would simply be the average of the two other stations. Thus it is always the missing data points that are reconstructed; the process doesn't affect the original input data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper clearly increased the scrutiny of the various Antarctic data sources, and indeed the week, errors were found in the record from the AWS sites 'Harry' (West Antarctica) and 'Racer Rock' (Antarctic Peninsula) stored at the SCAR &lt;a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/READER/"&gt;READER database&lt;/a&gt;.  (There was a coincidental typo in the listing of Harry's location in Table S2 in the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7228/suppinfo/nature07669.html"&gt;supplemental information&lt;/a&gt; to the paper, but a trivial examination of the online resources — or the paper itself, in which Harry is shown in the correct location (Fig. S4b) — would have indicated that this was indeed only a typo). Those errors have now been fixed by the database managers at the British Antarctic Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/1957_2006_trends_AWS_from_SI.jpg" align="right"&gt;Naturally, people are interested on what affect these corrections will have on the analysis of the Steig et al paper. But before we get to that, we can think about some '&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability"&gt;Bayesian priors&lt;/a&gt;'. Specifically, given that the results using the satellite data (the main reconstruction and source of the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; cover image) were very similar to that using the AWS data, it is highly unlikely that a single station revision will have much of an effect on the conclusions (and clearly none at all on the main reconstruction which didn't use AWS data). Additionally, the quality of the AWS data, particularly any trends, has been frequently questioned. The main issue is that since they are automatic and not manned, individual stations can be buried in snow, drift with the ice, fall over etc. and not be immediately fixed. Thus one of the tests Steig et al. did was a variation of the AWS reconstruction that detrended the AWS data before using them - any trend in the reconstruction would then come solely from the higher quality manned weather stations. The nature of the error in the Harry data record gave an erroneous positive trend, but this wouldn't have affected the trend in the AWS-detrended based reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all of the above, the Bayesian prior would therefore lean towards the expectation that the data corrections will not have much effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/Difference_AWS_trends.jpg" align="right"&gt;The trends in the AWS reconstruction in the paper are shown above. This is for the full period 1957-2006 and the dots are scaled a little smaller than they were in the paper for clarity. The biggest dot (on the Peninsula) represents about 0.5ºC/dec. The difference that you get if you use detrended data is shown next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we anticipated, the detrending the Harry data affects the reconstruction at Harry itself (the big blue dot in West Antarctica) reducing the trend there to about 0.2°C/dec, but there is no other significant effect (a couple of stations on the Antarctica Peninsula show small differences).  (Note the scale change from the preceding figure — the blue dot represents a change of 0.2ºC/dec). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/noharrydifference.jpg" align="right"&gt;Now that we know that the trend (and much of the data) at Harry was in fact erroneous, it's useful to see what happens when you don't use Harry at all.  The differences with the original results (at each of the other points) are almost undetectable.  (Same scale as immediately above; if the scale in the first figure were used, you couldn't see the dots at all!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, speculation that the erroneous trend at Harry was the basis of the Antarctic temperature trends reported by Steig et al. is completely specious, and could have been dismissed by even a cursory reading of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we are not yet done. There &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; erroneous input data used in the AWS reconstruction part of the study, and so it's important to know what impact the corrections will have. Eric managed to do some of the preliminary tests on his way to the airport for his Antarctic sojourn and the trend results are as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/aws_trenddifferences.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference at Harry of course - a reduction of the trend by about half, and an increase of the trend at Racer Rock (the error there had given an erroneous cooling), but the other points are pretty much unaffected.  The differences in the mean trends for Antarctica, or WAIS are very small (around 0.01ºC/decade), and the resulting new reconstruction is actually in slightly &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; agreement with the satellite-based reconstruction than before (which is pleasing of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayes wins again! Or should that be &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability#History"&gt;Laplace&lt;/a&gt;?  &lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (6/Feb/09):&lt;/strong&gt;The corrected AWS-based reconstruction is &lt;a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/steig/nature09data/"&gt;now available&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the main satellite-based reconstruction is unaffected by any issues with the AWS stations since it did not use them.&lt;/p&gt;

Modelled after BarCamp and started in Colorado, Skepticamp is an ‘un-conference’ - a gathering where the content is provided by the participants.  Each participant gives a talk, leads a discussion or volunteers in some way.  We’ve been extremely lucky to have support from various skeptical organizations and a really amazing response. So much so that we had to extend the event from one day to two.  I hope you can join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re not in the Atlanta area, make sure you’ll check to see if there are other Skepticamps planned in your area - there are &lt;a href="http://barcamp.org/SkeptiCamp"&gt;plans underway&lt;/a&gt; for events in Arizona, Ohio, New York, Washington, Colorado and British Columbia!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233801138548"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/let_the_bread_and_circuses_con.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/477ba6075c79ef1d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Wasting your time"/><title type="html">Let the Bread and Circuses Continue!</title><published>2009-02-04T23:59:40Z</published><updated>2009-02-04T23:59:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/WKhc4MS3nRg/let_the_bread_and_circuses_con.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/let_the_bread_and_circuses_con.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Obama has delayed am important political risk: &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/04/BU5L15N8V6.DTL&amp;amp;tsp=1"&gt;he's pushed back the DTV transition&lt;/a&gt;.

I wanted to share some poetry that expresses my experiences as a child, as an institutionalised teen and of finding community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clamoring &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is clamoring &lt;br&gt;
turned up too loud &lt;br&gt;
the branch scraping on the gutter &lt;br&gt;
at the back of her mind&lt;br&gt;
ever clamoring, &lt;br&gt;
relentless, &lt;br&gt;
no peace, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a past waiting to be rediscovered &lt;br&gt;
cracks opened by her words &lt;br&gt;
and an existence starved of meaning &lt;br&gt;
yet seeming meaningful &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where did she come from? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ever pacing &lt;br&gt;
up and back,&lt;br&gt;
up and back &lt;br&gt;
through her mind &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;its grubby hands &lt;br&gt;
over her mouth &lt;br&gt;
and the feeling&lt;br&gt;
that if she were sick now she would drown&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s there clamoring &lt;br&gt;
breaking pieces off her soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in a small room&lt;br&gt;
fists slam home, &lt;br&gt;
they stare ice &lt;br&gt;
shards of ice &lt;br&gt;
through her soul &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is the past or part of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘are you in there &lt;br&gt;
are you still there &lt;br&gt;
or did you leave for another planet -  &lt;br&gt;
probably did &lt;br&gt;
f**k knows&lt;br&gt;
 let’s go find someone else’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;never knowing the word no &lt;br&gt;
or having the power to use it &lt;br&gt;
never tasting the truth &lt;br&gt;
or an approximation of humanity  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she would ask for punishment &lt;br&gt;
if she thought it would help &lt;br&gt;
but another’s tongue is swift enough &lt;br&gt;
and relentless without rhyme or reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they marked her from early on &lt;br&gt;
and marched her through her childhood &lt;br&gt;
tasting blood more times than she should have &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teeth meeting her knuckles &lt;br&gt;
sometimes brought relief &lt;br&gt;
from the seemingly painless &lt;br&gt;
baptism of human chemical flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Institution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear ate her a path to its door.&lt;br&gt;
Once inside, the four walls contained her. &lt;br&gt;
And for keeping’s sake they named her.&lt;br&gt;
She stayed there under sedation. &lt;br&gt;
This, a double incarceration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucidity left her &lt;br&gt;
and she stumbled &lt;br&gt;
through halls and doorways, &lt;br&gt;
weeks and months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hole where her thoughts should be, &lt;br&gt;
faces talked at her, assuring her, &lt;br&gt;
that this was a better kind of reality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she looks back now &lt;br&gt;
she knows she suffered &lt;br&gt;
under the cure regime they proffered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just a question of chemistry, &lt;br&gt;
she now knows her brain works differently. &lt;br&gt;
Not a split or a schism, she has Autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Traffic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
What pills proffered, &lt;br&gt;
numb the traffic of the mind. &lt;p&gt;seated in the stark room she bathes &lt;br&gt;
in emotion &lt;br&gt;
suspended between the past and the present &lt;br&gt;
robbed of the moment –&lt;br&gt;
grasping at the liminal &lt;br&gt;
shaping the ether with her subconscious &lt;br&gt;
reality fragmented &lt;br&gt;
walls splintering &lt;br&gt;
senses overwhelmed by open space. &lt;br&gt;
Choice mediated &lt;br&gt;
by a chemical straight jacket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Lost Soul?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You came to drive her &lt;br&gt;
out of the back of her mind. &lt;br&gt;
But in the back of your mind &lt;br&gt;
there is doubt &lt;br&gt;
as to whether you have the right &lt;br&gt;
to be pursuing the root of her ‘madness’.&lt;/p&gt;
She would offer it to you&lt;br&gt;
in all of its complexities &lt;br&gt;
but fear of the unknown &lt;br&gt;
would eat a hole &lt;br&gt;
in the fabric of your existence. &lt;p&gt;You can be assured though &lt;br&gt;
that there are others like her &lt;br&gt;
who will hold a mirror to your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ythanya of Aspergia &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is unsure of what she makes of first light &lt;br&gt;
for she hasn’t seen it for so long. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She has kept strange hours. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The days awaited so eagerly by all her kind &lt;br&gt;
have come upon her, almost unannounced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Saturn returned, &lt;br&gt;
time passing has been punctuated &lt;br&gt;
by a desire to achieve.&lt;br&gt;
A path unfurls before her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has come to realise &lt;br&gt;
her seeking days are at and end. &lt;br&gt;
She now stands before the rising sun &lt;br&gt;
an initiate to her people&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Katharine Annear</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233789057452"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/the_things_you_can_find_on_dar.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dbe9d4c6a47d0584</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">The things you can find on Darwin Day</title><published>2009-02-04T22:45:03Z</published><updated>2009-02-04T22:45:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/EqcdTFVBXcY/the_things_you_can_find_on_dar.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/the_things_you_can_find_on_dar.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.darwinday.org/events/"&gt;Darwin Day website has a calendar of events&lt;/a&gt;, and you can search for cool things that might be happening near you next week.

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to celebrate Darwin's birthday by listening to some cranks and crackpots make up stuff about the science, preach about jebus, and teach your children a hodge-podge of lies, there you go, have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's a bit inappropriate, myself. Although I am looking forward to a fun summer when I can reciprocate and crash Vacation Bible School to tell the little kiddies about the fallacies and inconsistencies of the bible, and how the Earth is 4.6 billion years old and life evolved upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't tell me that would be rude. They started it!&lt;/p&gt;

My son only spends about 20 minute total going each way but "getting on the bus" looms large as an event in all three of our days. While Charlie has gotten used to the school day starting an hour earlier, waking up and getting up happen in very slow motion and there's been mornings when, try as we all might and knowing that other kids are waiting to be picked up, I have to rush out to ask the bus driver if she can just wait a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many drivers have told us not to worry about them waiting and encouraged Charlie on days when he hesitated. The driver for the first part of this school year was rather not so inclined to......ok, let's just say, when the double doors opened, either silence or "hurry up, Charlie" as heard.  About two weeks ago there was another driver who told us she'd be the regular driver, and turned to greet Charlie with an easy "hey, Charlie!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small thing, a "hello," but what a huge difference. After reading about 7-year-old Gustavo Romano who stopped speaking after being left for two hours on a schoolbus in Brooklyn last fall (from the &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/02/03/2009-02-03_boy_in_trauma_after_he_was_left_on_the_b.html"&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/a&gt;) and about organized crime possibly retaining "influence in the New York City school bus market" (from yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/nyregion/04bus.html?hp"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)---sometimes you really have to wonder who's driving the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So . . . . I was watching Jeopardy! the other night, and I ran like four categories in a row before missing a clue. Now, I’m not a trivia master or anything like that, but I usually do fairly well at questioning the answers. That night, however, the categories were right in my wheelhouse, and I was unstoppable. It reminded me of the classic episode of Cheers where &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=botdmsQilnU&amp;amp;eurl=http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=cliff+clavin+jeopardy&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;emb=0&amp;amp;aq=f"&gt;Cliff Clavin made an appearance&lt;/a&gt; on the game show, and got his dream board before melting down in the Final Jeopardy round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In what areas are you a font of knowledge? What categories would make up your Jeopardy! dream board?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, just for fun, try to end your comment with a trivia question for subsequent commenters to answer. I’ll start: &lt;em&gt;What does a labeorphilist collect?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233782493921"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-6510738911531063695">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/206096e2bce13bc0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Jeffrey Amos on &amp;quot;Why I Am An Atheist&amp;quot;</title><published>2009-02-04T18:40:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-04T18:43:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/531797864/jeffrey-amos-on-why-i-am-atheist.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/6510738911531063695/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=6510738911531063695" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/jeffrey-amos-on-why-i-am-atheist.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">This is a &lt;a href="http://failingtheinsidertest.blogspot.com/2009/01/why-i-am-atheist.html"&gt;pretty good statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;

Is global warming real – and if so, why it is happening? Do scientists really now think that sun exposure prevents cancer? Is organic food healthier? Do antidepressants trigger suicides? Every day, the media is packed with stories about health and science: stories that can sometimes mean the difference between life and death. Which of these stories really matter? Non-scientists desperately need tools for telling the difference between real science and misleading science. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lies, Damned Lies, and Science: How to Sort through the Noise around Global Warming, the Latest Health Claims, and Other Scientific Controversies (FT Press Science, ISBN-13: 9780137155224, $24.99, 224 pps, hardcover, February 2009) www.ftpress.com/science helps readers sort out today’s noisiest scientific debates -- and gives them common-sense techniques for evaluating any health or scientific claim.  Sherry Seethaler, a science writer and educator at University of California, San Diego, works with scientists to explain their discoveries to the public. Seethaler holds an M.S. and Master of Philosophy in biology from Yale, and a Ph.D. in science and math education from UC Berkeley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seethaler says, “Those who promote incorrect information, either because they are trying to manipulate you, or because they themselves have been duped or are simply misinformed, rarely have more knowledge about science than you do. What they have are skills at using information to suit their purposes.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;This could be very good, or very not-good.

Commenter Becca &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/02/the_debate_over_dr_bidenpart_2.php#comment-1370424"&gt;makes the case thusly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Why are people threatened by the idea that a profession ought to have professional standards, anyway?"&lt;/i&gt;
1) It gives the gatekeepers even more power than they already have. Given a world where professional credentials are denied to certain groups, it can get a bit ugly. I think the worst part is that people who are traditionally trodden upon, because they fought so hard to get the darn credential, end up being the ones most viciously fighting against respect for people without the credentials.
2) I'm not horribly opposed to professional standards in general, I just don't think they should necesarily apply to researchers. If an MD doesn't know what she's doing, she kills people. If a scientist doesn't know what she's doing, she can change the status quo by doing something incredibly novel that others couldn't imagine (not that it's the most likely scenario; the most likely scenario is she will fall flat on her face... but there is an important distinction nonetheless). Heck, a kid in a science fair can discover something new (ocassionally, at the highest levels like Westinghouse, even something that academics should recognize- something publishable).

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't take "Dr." as a proxy for respect. No one will ever earn my respect by spending X years in school. Plenty of people without PhDs will earn it.&lt;br&gt;
I've met very few PhDs who have unearned my respect for their hard work and intelligence that got them that degree (note the distinction between symbol = degree and reality = character). But there have been a few. I feel no obligation to call them "Dr.".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Seriously, what is the problem with recognizing expertise, hardwork, perseverence, and yes, intelligence? Why is that not progressive?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There's nothing wrong with it, and a great deal right!&lt;br&gt;
But the relationship between schooling, expertise, hardwork, perserverence and intelligence and the number of letters displayed after your name is not a one to one function. Anyone who says otherwise is selling something (most likely a diploma).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Ms. Manners would suggest that the polite thing to do would be to inquire of Dr. Biden which she would prefer, and (so long as the preference is for an honorific she has earned) use that."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Did you mean Miss Manners? On the original discussion I posted her commentary on this. It can be summed up as: if someone wants to use a title, give it to them. If you are thinking of your own title, however, it's a tad crude to draw excessive attention to your need for status. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sympathetic to Becca's points here, so I want to explore why it is I find myself leaning in the other direction on the appropriateness of "Dr." as an honorific.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/honorifics_credentials_and_res.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/honorifics_credentials_and_res.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/IRbwk7Y7mOI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233778363791"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3837">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b0b5382fc66a5d8c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="beauty"/><category term="modeling"/><category term="Q&amp;A"/><title type="html">Bring Your Questions for the Ugly Scout</title><published>2009-02-04T19:33:59Z</published><updated>2009-02-04T19:33:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/LmkoPB_rFFw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/bring-your-questions-for-the-ugly-scout/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">&lt;strong&gt;Simon Rogers&lt;/strong&gt; moved to New York from London when he was 28 to begin his modeling career.

You'll see photos of his clients throughout the rest of this post. 

As Rogers once &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/fashion/02real.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, UglyNY serves the market for "great-looking people, people who've really been hit with the ugly stick, and everything in between." UglyNY's recent clients include Clairol, Walmart, and &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;. Demand for "real people," Rogers says, is growing -- in part because of the influences of reality TV, MySpace, etc. Plus they are often cheaper.

(What one defines as “high-energy” depends on one’s upbringing; we’re talking about energies of up to 100 times the mass of the proton.)  The impression is given that this is a brand-new result casting doubt on the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/11/25/somethings-in-the-air/"&gt;earlier claims&lt;/a&gt; that PAMELA might have detected evidence for dark matter; that’s not really a correct impression, so it’s worth getting it all straight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PAMELA satellite, an Italian/Russian/German/Swedish collaboration, looks at high-energy cosmic rays from orbit, and pays particular attention to the presence of antimatter — basically, positrons (anti-electrons) and anti-protons.  Part of the idea is that a high-energy matter particle can simply be a particle that had been lying around for a while and was accelerated to large velocities by magnetic fields or other astrophysical processes, whereas you need some pretty high energies to produce antiparticles in the first place.  Say, for example, from the annihilation of dark matter particles with each other.  There are certainly some high-energy collisions in the ordinary non-dark-matter world, so you expect to see a certain fraction of antimatter, but that fraction should noticeably diminish as you get to higher and higher energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in October the experiment released two papers back to back:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4995"&gt;arXiv:0810.4995&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look closely, you’ll notice the second paper has 10 trackbacks to its abstract on arxiv, while the first doesn’t have any (until now!).  The reason is clear:  the second paper has the word “anomalous” in the title.  The PAMELA measurements of positrons deviate significantly from the theoretical expectation, while the measurements of anti-protons reported in the first paper are exactly what you might have predicted.  Who wants to write about observations that fit theories we already have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might remember the PAMELA positron result as the one that created a stir when they gave a talk before submitting their paper, and theorists in the audience &lt;a href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2008/09/08/paparazzi-or-preprints/"&gt;snapped pictures of the data&lt;/a&gt; with their cell phone cameras and proceeded to write papers about it.  Those wacky theorists.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the relevant positron plot, from paper 2 above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/pamela-positrons.jpg" alt="PAMELA positron fraction"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The vertical axis is the fraction of positrons in the total sample of electrons+positrons, plotted against energy.  The red dots are the data, and the black curve is the theoretical prediction from ordinary astrophysical processes.  Not the best fit, eh?  At low energies that is not a surprise, as “weather” effects such as solar activity can get in the way of observing low-energy positrons.  But at high energies the prediction should be more robust, and that’s where it’s the worst.  Indeed, it’s pretty clear that the fraction of positrons is &lt;em&gt;increasing&lt;/em&gt; with energy, which is pretty baffling, but could conceivably come from dark matter annihilations.  See &lt;a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.com/search?q=PAMELA"&gt;Resonaances&lt;/a&gt; for more discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the version for antiprotons, from paper 1 above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/pamela-antiprotons.jpg" alt="PAMELA antiproton fraction"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now that’s what we call a fit to the data; again, fraction of antiprotons plotted versus energy, and the data go up and down just as predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened is that the PAMELA collaboration submitted their second paper (anomalous positrons) to &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, and their first paper (well-behaved antiprotons) to &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;.  The latter paper has just now appeared in print, which is why Simon Swordy’s commentary in &lt;a href="http://physics.aps.org/articles/v2/10"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared, etc.  Although the idea behind &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; (expert-level commentary on recently published articles) is a good one, it’s sponsored by the American Physical Society, and therefore pretends that the only interesting articles are those that appear in journals published by the American Physical Society.  Which &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; is most surely not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one might get the impression that the antiproton result is a blow against the idea that we are seeing dark-matter annihilations.  Which it is; if you didn’t know any better, you would certainly expect to see an excess of antiprotons in dark-matter annihilations just as surely as you would expect to see an excess of positrons.  But it’s not a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; blow; the papers appeared on arxiv (which is what really matters) at the same time!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not a blow that can’t be recovered from.  All you have to do is declare that your dark matter candidate is “hadrophobic,” and likes to annihilate into electrons and positrons rather than protons and antiprotons.  Not an easy task, but that’s why theorists get paid the exorbitant salaries we do.  (Without ready access to champagne and caviar, we can hardly be expected to justify unusual branching ratios in WIMP annihilations.)  The favorite model out there right now belongs to &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0713"&gt;Arkani-Hamed, Finkbeiner, Slatyer, and Weiner,&lt;/a&gt; featuring a new gauge force that is broken at relatively low energies.  But there are various models on the market, and the number is only going to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely the PAMELA positron excess is coming from something that can be fit quite nicely into the Standard Model of particle physics, like pulsars.   That’s my guess, anyway.  Happily, there’s all sorts of data coming down the pike that will help us sort it out. &lt;/p&gt;

Here's the context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Blogosphere is abuzz about an article in the LA Times regarding Second Lady Jill Biden's preference to be acknowledged by her honorific title of "Doctor," which references her Ph.D in education. The article states that many prominent newspapers, including the LA Times and the Washington Post, only use the honorific title in articles if the doctorate degree in question is in a medical field, calling into question the context in which the "Dr." title is used in other situations, and whether it is more accepted for males to be acknowledged by this title than females.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-dr-jill-biden2-2009feb02,0,548459.story"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the article that started it all. The stupid, it burns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll put it very briefly, as an M.D. If a person has earned a doctorate in a field that is recognized by academia at an accredited college or university, then that person has the right to be referred to as "doctor."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, I bet you you thought I was going to defend the hegemony of medical doctors or the ridiculousness of journalistic conventions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_most_ridiculous_kerfuffle_ever.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_most_ridiculous_kerfuffle_ever.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/u5N4qDlGpjE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233774301636"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d50757ec8fe03755</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Randi Speaks, Episode 5</title><published>2009-02-04T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-04T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/413-randi-speaks-episode-5.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">

&lt;p&gt;Like a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1095#comment-21217"&gt;recent LL commenter&lt;/a&gt;, many people think that societies should explicitly legislate grammar, and punish those who disobey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Trying to refute a prescriptivist by showing that people have always done it the other way is as absurd as saying that there should be no law against murder because millions of people have commited [sic] it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than calling this "prescriptivist grammar", we should probably call it "statist grammar", or something of the sort. There's a presupposition that leaving people to work such things out for themselves is intolerable, either morally or practically, so that the principles must be codified and enforced by some authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative — which most modern linguists prefer — is not to treat language as unsystematic or unconstrained, but rather to view it preferentially as a natural rather than an artificial phenomenon, what Hayek called a &amp;quot;grown&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;endogenous&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;spontaneous&amp;quot; order, rather than a &amp;quot;made&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;exogenous&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;artificial&amp;quot; order. (See &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=475"&gt;Oblivious to usage advice?&lt;/a&gt;", 8/12/2008, for some discussion and links.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this respect, descriptive linguists are libertarians, or perhaps classical liberals, while prescriptivists are &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005205.html"&gt;authoritarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005501.html"&gt;rationalists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a curious thing. At least in the U.S., the very people who are authoritarian rationalists in linguistic matters, and thus philosophically aligned (for example) with other authoritarian rationalist movements from the French Revolution to Mao's China, tend to think of themselves as political "conservatives". Thus  the commenter quoted above complains on his own blog about "that kind of woolly, leftist thinking that particularly inflames me".&lt;/p&gt;

What we are also seeing, I believe, is the emergence of hybrid forms of Chinese and English in which not only the lexicons, but also the grammars and the phonologies of the two languages merge with each other in surprising ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I here offer, first, an example of Chinese affecting English, and then an instance of English affecting Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A regular correspondent, Victor Steinbok, wrote to me as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A headline grabbed my attention because it proclaimed, "China, EU vow to deepen cooperation".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/31/content_10738742.htm"&gt;http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/31/content_10738742.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's easily parseable, but what on earth possessed them to use "deepen" in this context?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I jumped to Google and, to my surprise, got 1.5+ mil raw hits. But if you look carefully at the websites, aside from a couple of NATO pages, and singular hits from the likes of  "America.gov", Finland and Surinam, the majority of the first 100 hits are from China and other Asian countries (some Vietnam, Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore). But there is no mistake that the Chinese sites (in English) are dominant. Skipping ahead further (p. 22+), gives more Chinese and Vietnamese sites (about 5+ combined out of every 10), but now also includes single shots from Belgium, Sweden, Japan. But I see virtually no US, UK, Canada and Australia sites, except some that refer to Australian treaties with Asian countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is this some sort of Chinglish derivative that made it into standard diplomatic talk? Or am I missing something else? Certainly, this is the way diplomatic talks would be reported in Russian. (Uglubit' sotrunichestvo", or something to that effect) But, in English, this is not what comes to mind when I hear "deepen".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steinbok's observations are astute.  He has identified a good specimen of what may be called "Xinhua English" (henceforth XE).  There can be no doubt that "deepen cooperation" is the XE equivalent of Chinese JIA1QIANG2 HE2ZUO4 加強合作 (for examples of JIA1QIANG2 HE2ZUO4 being matched with "deepen cooperation," see &lt;a href="http://www.lawinfochina.com/Wbk/displayModeTwo.asp?id=36&amp;amp;keyword="&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), which might more literally be rendered in English as "strengthen cooperation."  On the other hand, if we back-translate "deepen cooperation" into Chinese, we are likely to end up with JIA1SHEN1 HE2ZUO4 加深合作.  However, Chinese speakers show a clear preference for JIA1QIANG2 HE2ZUO4 over JIA1SHEN1 HE2ZUO4.  It is curious that a Google search for JIA1QIANG2 HE2ZUO4 yields almost exactly the same total number of occurrences as Steinbok's search for "deepen cooperation" did (1.56 mil raw hits), whereas JIA1SHEN1 HE2ZUO4 results in a measly 40,800.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably won't be long before native English speakers say "deepen cooperation" without any qualms, just as they now say "paper tiger" and "running dog" with little queasiness.  Never mind that, when I first heard these XE expressions (derived from ZHI3 LAO3HU3 紙老虎 and ZOU3GOU3 走狗) back in the 1950s, they sounded very strange to my ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.bjshengr.com/bjs/2009/01/zhonglish-for-two-year-olds/"&gt;over at Beijing Sounds&lt;/a&gt;, we have an "uncle's" dismay over the Anglicization of two-and-a-half year old Cici's Mandarin. The gross intrusion of English grammar into Chinese documented in the Beijing Sounds blog is a phenomenon with which I'm well acquainted, having upon many occasions heard such priceless exchanges as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother:  QING3 GUAN1MEN2 請關門 ("Please close the door.")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child:  I am GUAN1ing ("I'm closing it").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, "-ing" has already become a part of Chinese grammar, but this post has gone on long enough, so I will wait for another time to document this intriguing development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233769543699"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/i_get_email_28.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/25e4e8a04f554470</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">I get email</title><published>2009-02-04T16:43:13Z</published><updated>2009-02-04T16:43:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/z-M0fZUjalM/i_get_email_28.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/i_get_email_28.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nothing new here, just more of the same. I thought this time I'd insert my reactions into the stream of a fairly typical creationist letter that I received this morning. Really, people: you may think you're very clever and persuasive, but I hear all of this same stuff every single day, and you've never got a new argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for removing all doubt as to what will be taught at U-Morris.&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Yes. We will be teaching science, not creationism.]&lt;/span&gt; My daughter was considering attending after she graduates next year. &lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Good for her! She sounds like a smart young woman already]&lt;/span&gt;That will not be the case anymore.&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[I am very sorry to hear that—she clearly needs a good education to correct the indoctrination of her father. But then, &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; good school she gets into will teach her the same things I would]&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For you to take it upon yourself to have people e-mail U of Vermont, protesting the invitation to have Ben Stein speak at commencement, shows a narrow minded disdain for relevant&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[From Stein? Nixonian hack with no knowledge of science and a failed track record in economics?]&lt;/span&gt; opposing &lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Some opposing views can be wrong because they are stupid, you know]&lt;/span&gt; views
in not only science but probably everything else. 
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Everyday. And I mean everyday. Your 'we come from goo'&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Uh-oh. Your true colors as a devotee of the crazy people at Answers in Genesis are showing]&lt;/span&gt; stance is loosing&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Maybe your daughter can be an English major]&lt;/span&gt; ground &lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Actually, no — evolution is doing very well, is beautifully supported by the evidence, and is getting stronger year by year among people who bother to evaluate the evidence]&lt;/span&gt; and you and your ilk&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Nice word]&lt;/span&gt; are scared to death of continually being proven wrong&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Not at all. Easy to refute: prove evolution wrong. Go ahead. I'll listen. Just don't regurgitate AiG nonsense at me, OK?]&lt;/span&gt;. So you go nuts at these opposing views of creation&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Just being an "opposing view" does not make it valid. You really need to learn some critical thinking skills.]&lt;/span&gt; and what not. Funny thing is Stein is a nice guy&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Stein: "Science leads to killing people"]&lt;/span&gt; and probably wouldn't even talk about that scary creation point of view anyway&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Maybe instead he'd talk about his inane and demonstrably wrong views on the economy. Which is scarier?]&lt;/span&gt;. You have got to lighten up.&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Dude, you're the one writing a long letter to a stranger protesting that you're going to dictate which schools your daughter can attend, because you don't want her exposed to different ideas about evolution.]&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Please do not take this personally&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Since yours is one of 11 weird harangues I found in my mailbox this morning, I won't. I just laugh.]&lt;/span&gt;, since I have never met you or even heard of you&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Nor I you. But I have heard this same cookie-cutter, boring creationist spiel a few thousand times.]&lt;/span&gt; until I saw Pharyngula. There are lots of people over the years that have been ramming&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Really? Ramming? I suppose you could say your math teachers also rammed algebra down your throat.]&lt;/span&gt;  this impossible Theory of Evolution&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Sir, you do not understand the theory of evolution, and you are clearly planning to make sure your children don't, either. Not only is it possible, it's been demonstrated time and again]&lt;/span&gt; down our throats. But that does not mean its true.&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Funny. I have never heard a scientist say evolution is true because we have indoctrinated people into it. That's more the kind of thing that is true of creationists]&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We need to keep open minds and field and teach opposing views and let truth take it where it leads no matter how improbable a direction&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[I repeat, guy: your whole letter is built on an assertion that you will not allow your daughter to be exposed to ideas you dislike. Why are you creationists always so oblivious?]&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Respectfully,&lt;span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;color:red"&gt;[Somehow, I doubt it]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/195/479800580_0272feb43c.jpg?v=0" alt="a globe with Austrialia highlighted" style="float:left;margin:10px" width="300px"&gt;There has been an increased focus on autism in Australia in recent years to the point of it becoming an federal election issue. Autism has been portrayed as a crisis, an epidemic, a puzzle, an over diagnosed condition, a struggle and a financial burden for families, a scientific curiosity as well as the root of special and extraordinary talents. Television debates have been held regarding the treatment of people with autism and national newspapers and magazines have run various features on autism. Culturally the portrayal of autism is robust and varied. Movies such as The Black Balloon and Max and Mary, bands such as The Vines, Rudely Interrupted and Donna and the Aspinauts, and an all Autistic theatre ensemble named Triple A have all made recent contributions to the cultural landscape of autism in Australia sparking controversy and debate and offering insight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning life with autism in Australia can be complex. Obtaining an ASD diagnosis varies from state to state as does eligibility for services dependant on an ASD diagnosis.  The accepted standard seems to be diagnosis by a multidisciplinary team, using the DSM IV TR Criteria and standardised diagnostic tools. There are many pathways to diagnosis including via state run health services, some local not for profit Autism Associations and private practitioners. The Federal Government recently introduced rebates through the Medicare system for diagnosis of children under the age of 13 as well as treatment items for children up to the age of 15. The Government also recently introduced grants of $6,000 a year for two years to contribute to the costs of early intervention from multidisciplinary teams for each child under the age of seven with a Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Each of these services and systems has their own set of paperwork and/or registrations. Waiting times of up to 12 months are often experienced for families of children seeking a diagnosis. Adult diagnosis is a far more problematic area with little government support or expertise available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning with autism in Australia has its own set of challenges. Access to education for people with ASD again varies from state to state with some states having autism schools and autism satellite classrooms and others having fully inclusive education policies that mainstream most students with ASD with varying degrees of success. The tertiary system has the National Regional Disability Liaison Officer Initiative through which students can develop Access Plans to ensure appropriate access to curriculum and environments through an Officer at each institution, providing you have the skills to access the Officer.  Access to all education is covered by the Australian Disability Discrimination Act. However, despite legislation, the reality for many students is that it is hard to access appropriate education opportunities and recent studies show that over 90% of students with ASD are bullied at school, choice is limited and exclusion rates for students with ASD are high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living a full and rewarding life with autism in Australia is a dream shared by many. However the biggest challenge facing Australian Autistics is the lack of planning for the future. There is no system of support for young people to grow into, no approach to ensuring that the education, accommodation, employment, health and community needs of Autistic adolescents and adults are met. The major parent driven advocacy organisation Autism Asperger Advocacy Australia (A4) has previously been a loud voice for the needs of children and promoting the early intervention agenda and have had some of their needs met with the Federal Government’s initial package for children. For over 10 years there has also been a group of Australian Autistic adults surviving and supporting each other online. In 2004 they organised as grass roots advocacy group called AANSA and in 2008 became the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) of Australia and are slowly moving adult issues into prominence. The challenge now is for self advocates to open up a dialogue with the government and key stakeholders and to demand a National Autism Plan with a view to the use of good science, extensive consultation and innovation in service design and delivery for life long services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Australia offers those with autism now has to be hope, hope that governments will keep listening, hope that communities will unite around this issue as they do with so many others, hope that Australia’s culture of ‘a fair go’ extends to all citizens, hope that Australia will join others on the international human rights stage and sign the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities affording us real human rights protection. Hope that together we can come up with a plan that delivers real quality of life to all Autistic citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that we will find a cure - A cure for the desire to profit from people who live with autism, people, who should be afforded the best science, the best education, the best healthcare, and the best support simply because they have a right to it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Katharine Annear</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233768810182"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/04/paricedolia/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7ad8e759f1a5cea8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Pareidolia"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><title type="html">Paricedolia</title><published>2009-02-04T17:00:09Z</published><updated>2009-02-04T17:00:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/04/paricedolia/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How cool (HAHAHAHAhahahaha!

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s a face in an icicle. It’s an incredible example of pareidolia, one of the best I’ve ever seen (nothing will ever beat &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/lenin.html"&gt;Lenin&lt;/a&gt;, though). Yahoo &lt;a href="http://uk.green.yahoo.com/blog/environmentalgraffiti/168/is-this-the-real-jack-frost.html"&gt;has a funny article about it&lt;/a&gt;, saying tongue-in-cheek it’s Jack Frost. I had to laugh; after all, who would think that some random collection of shapes that happens to look like a face would actually be a real manifestation of a supernatural entity?&lt;/p&gt;

Just such a story cropped up on my radar this morning, involving a Christian nurse who was allegedly suspended for offering prayers to her patients. It's the latest in a long line of similar stories that have appeared in the press recently, from the Christian counsellor who was disciplined for refusing to give advice to homosexuals, to the Christian pharmacist who wouldn't sell contraceptive pills. The stories are related for obvious reasons, but in the press today a name appeared, and from that name and a bit of searching around I found that there is another, more interesting connection between these stories.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d never have guessed that an encyclopedia which anyone can contribute to would become the most referenced thing on the internet (the internet being something that I didn’t predict would become the centre of my work and life). I didn’t think for a second that television progs would be available on demand, or that pausing and rewinding live TV would be standard. It never occurred to me that I’d own an affordable, pocket-sized device which could fit and play my entire CD collection and a large number of movies. I never thought I’d find friends from all over the world and keep in daily contact with them at the click of a button, and who could have known that I’d be able to play a Playstation game with ten of them at once?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t guess that by 2009 I’d do almost 100% of my shopping on the internet, or that Rick Astley would become known to entirely new generation. Ten years ago I had no idea that I’d be able to simulate a snowboard in my own home using a Wii Balance Board. I’d have laughed at the suggestion that I’d be able to read a minute-by-minute commentary of Stephen Fry’s personal life written by him and pumped live into my phone. It would have amazed me to know that within ten years there would be a vaccine for cervical cancer, or that the President of the USA would have the middle name ‘Hussein’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would not have thought that at any point would evolution be under attack, or that the British Government would find the need to intervene to stop religious propaganda making its way to classrooms. I couldn’t have guessed that the IRA would no longer be the terrorist threat people lost sleep over, or that a racist political party would gain leverage as a result. It would have astounded me to learn that children’s health and lives could be under threat again due to decreasing MMR vaccination, or that eyesight defects could be fixed by lasers in a lunchtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d have been shocked to see a woman walking down a British street covered entirely from head to foot, hands and face behind a veil, and wouldn’t have guessed that I’d one day pose (twice!) for a risque calendar. If you’d said that Big Brother would still be going, I’d have dismissed your claims, but if you’d told me that within ten years families across the world would be sitting down together to watch new Doctor Who, I’d have said “oh I do hope that’s true!”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re in tough time, folks. But we’re also in amazing times. Whatever hardships are ahead, let’s not forget that time brings dramatic changes both good and bad, and the human race endeavours, aspires, builds and progresses. It’s sometimes one step back, but it’s always two steps forward. I have the luxury of living in a country where opportunities and liberty are at their best, and I don’t want my gratitude for that to be drowned by the sea of media doom and gloom. Here’s to the next ten years, whatever they bring.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>tkingdoll</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233764472296"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4133">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/42e9747cfe56876e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Letter from Holland</title><published>2009-02-04T15:56:36Z</published><updated>2009-02-04T15:56:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/letter-from-hol.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just received the following letter from Holland:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday 3 Feb, the Dutch evangelical, TV presentator and former 
director of the Evangelical Broadcast Organisation (EO),
Andries Knevel, openly rejected his belief in Young Earth Creationism 
and ID. He apologised for promoting those beliefs
in the past years to his children and the public. He wants 
credibility, reliability and belief. He desires an open debate about
God and evolution with believers and non-believers alike. He believes 
GOD and evolution do not exclude each other.
Both science and belief have their own value. He still belief that 
God created heaven and earth en that Jezus is our Saviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 27 2007 it was discovered and documented 
&lt;a href="http://evolutie.blog.com/1962396/" rel="external "&gt;http://evolutie.blog.com/1962396/&lt;/a&gt; that the EO censored all evolution
and old earth from the BBC documentaries of David Attenborough.
Now the EO no longer denies it was censorship indeed by showing 
fragments they censored in the past years.
This is a remarkable breakthrough and conversion. Especially hopeful 
in the Darwinyear 2009.
There are still YEC’s in Holland, but the main evangelical television 
station has made a very promising move.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a user-supplied meeting, where skeptics themselves are the show.  Attendees make the presentations, and it’s totally interactive. I attended the Denver Skepticamp last year and had a great time, so I strongly urge you to check out the one in Atlanta. The JREF, by the way, is a happy and proud sponsor of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

Just such a story cropped up on my radar this morning, involving a Christian nurse who was allegedly suspended for offering prayers to her patients. It's the latest in a long line of similar stories that have appeared in the press recently, from the Christian counsellor who was disciplined for refusing to give advice to homosexuals, to the Christian pharmacist who wouldn't sell contraceptive pills. The stories are related for obvious reasons, but in the press today a name appeared, and from that name and a bit of searching around I found that there is another, more interesting connection between these stories.&lt;/p&gt;

So I simply have to protest when those evil (Stein was right!) scientists announce a major discovery on a Tuesday, which just happens to be the very worst day of the week for me. They've gone and found &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; important whale transitional fossil, &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004366"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maiacetus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm just going to have to tell you to go read a bunch of other fine blogs that already have it covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/maiacetus_lg.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/maiacetus.jpeg" width="400" height="365" alt="maiacetus.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skeletons of the Eocene archaeocete whales &lt;i&gt;Dorudon atrox&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Maiacetus inuus&lt;/i&gt; in swimming pose.

(A, B)- &lt;i&gt;Dorudon atrox&lt;/i&gt; (5.0 m; 36.5 Ma) based on UM 101222 and 101215 [11] in lateral and dorsal views, respectively. (C, D)- &lt;i&gt;Maiacetus inuus&lt;/i&gt; (2.6 m; 47.5 Ma) based on male specimen GSP-UM 3551 in lateral and dorsal views, respectively.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's beautiful. It's clearly adapted for aquatic life, but it has another revealing feature: this specimen was pregnant at death, and the fetus is oriented for a head-first birth, which is not good for birth at sea (the head would pop out, baby would take its first breath, and drown before the tail emerged), so this animal would have had to give birth on land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like I said, you'll have to read &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/02/03/the-backward-whale/"&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/02/fossil_foetus_shows_that_early_whales_gave_birth_on_land.php"&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/02/maiacetus_the_good_mother_whal.php"&gt;Brian Switek&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/02/amazing_fossil_finding_proto_w.php"&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt; this time around for all the details. Or read the &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004366"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; yourself!

&lt;p&gt;This is such a good joke, and in retrospect such an obvious one, that it&amp;#39;s hard to believe that Randall Munroe was the first one to tell it — but I can&amp;#39;t find any precedents. Of course, &amp;quot;significant other&amp;quot; has only been in common use since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a scientific context, plain "significant" is usually interpreted to mean "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significance_testing"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — this might be one of the most important lexicographical developments of the 20th century. I believe that the credit, or blame, goes to the public-relations genius of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.A._Fisher"&gt;Ronald Fisher&lt;/a&gt; (1890-1962), exemplified in his brief popular article, "&lt;a href="http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/fqi22e00"&gt;Mathematics of a Lady Tasting Tea&lt;/a&gt;". (For some relevant discussion in earlier LL posts, see "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005420.html"&gt;Listening to Prozac, hearing effect sizes&lt;/a&gt;", where "statistically significant" is contrasted with "clinically significant"; or "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001455.html"&gt;The secret sins of academics&lt;/a&gt;", which includes some fun quotes from Deirdre McCloskey on the perils of significance testing without a loss function; or the series of posts beginning with "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004965.html"&gt;The 'Happiness Gap' and the rhetoric of statistics&lt;/a&gt;" and ending with "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004987.html"&gt;The 'Gender Happiness Gap': statistical, practical and rhetorical significance&lt;/a&gt;".)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the female lead in this xkcd strip makes her point, not with a t-test or some other method from inferential statistics, but rather with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxplot"&gt;boxplot&lt;/a&gt;, and the common-sense assertion that "you spend twice as much time with me as with anyone else". Boxplots (R help page &lt;a href="http://stderr.org/doc/r-recommended/library/graphics/html/boxplot.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) are a method of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis"&gt;exploratory data analysis&lt;/a&gt;" (EDA), invented by another great public-relations genius of 20th-century statistics, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey"&gt;John Tukey&lt;/a&gt; (1915-2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, even a combination of inferential and exploratory statistics with clever wordplay is not enough to guarantee happiness: the strip&amp;#39;s mouseover title is &amp;quot;… okay, but because you said that, we&amp;#39;re breaking up.&amp;quot; Here&amp;#39;s hoping that the male character gets over his (feigned?) commitment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among John Tukey&amp;#39;s best-known coinages, outside of the realm of EDA, are the terms &amp;quot;bit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;software&amp;quot;. My personal favorite, though, is his term for the Fourier transform of the log of the squared magnitude of the Fourier transform of a signal — since this is the spectrum of the spectrum, in some sense, he suggested that it should be called the &amp;quot;cepstrum&amp;quot;. And since a Fourier transform takes us from time to frequency, a second one obviously takes us from the frequency domain to the quefrency domain. And since a filter enhances or attentuates frequency components, an operation that enhances or attentuates quefrency components must be a lifter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the only example that I can think of where scientific or mathematical terminology was created by spoonerism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For various interesting reasons (for example, when two signals are convolved, their cepstra are added), the cepstrum is in fairly wide use — the standard acoustic parameters for speech recognition are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstral_coefficient"&gt;mel-frequency cepstral coefficients&lt;/a&gt; (MFCCs), for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: in addition to the 3/7/2008 &lt;a href="http://www.bitstrips.com/user/296/read.php?comic_id=1813&amp;amp;subsection=1"&gt;webcomic precedent&lt;/a&gt; found by atta in the comments, Victor Steinbok sent email citing a &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/events/seattle-12th-annual-stranger-valentines-day-bash-with-dan-savage"&gt;Yelp page&lt;/a&gt; from December 2007, an &lt;a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/30987/Boyfriend-plumber"&gt;ask.metafilter.com page&lt;/a&gt; from January 2006, and a &lt;a href="http://shadowdappled.blogspot.com/2002_02_01_archive.html#10239844"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from 2/1/2002, which all deploy the &amp;quot;statistically significant other&amp;quot; phrase in one way or another. (The 2002 blog post: &amp;quot;My statistically significant other comes in with p &amp;lt; .001, so I think I&amp;#39;ll keep him.&amp;quot;)  This is the result of Victor&amp;#39;s exhaustive search of the Google hits for the phrase. Considering the reflex association &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;em&gt;statistically significant&lt;/em&gt;, this is a remarkably small number of precedents — I guess it reflects exactly the compartmentalization of mathematics and romance that xkcd so strikingly overcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor also notes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… &amp;quot;insignificant other&amp;quot; has earned an entry in the Urban Dictionary.

This occurs amid growing scientific criticism of these programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very good thing, and something I would like to see replicated in the US. The scientific community is appropriately concerned about such programs for a number of reasons. We have also been highly critical of them here at SBM - for example take a look as Wallace Sampson’s excellent analysis of academic medicine &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=234"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=150"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and David Gorski’s summary of Medical Academic Woo &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=72"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic institutions have an implied contract with society - they are given resources (donations, scholarships), power (the ability to grant recognized degrees), and respect (the institutions and their members are often given the assumption of credibility and knowledge), and in exchange they agree to follow a code of professional ethics.  This contract is similar to many professions, like physicians or lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional ethics of academic institutions should include mechanisms for quality control. This is largely self-enforced - academia generally regulates itself - and also partly government regulated through accreditation, but even then this is left to the academics to decide on standards and how to assess them. What this means is that in general the public expects that our universities and schools are not teaching our children utter nonsense, indoctrinating them into a belief system, or pursuing a personal agenda in the guise of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time academia feels an ethical imperative (and this is where it gets tricky) to respect academic freedom. The most tangible manifestation of this notion is that of tenure - once professors achieve a certain status they are granted an enduring appointment so that they will feel free to express their academic freedom without fear of being fired. But also it is expressed in the overall attitude of deans and chancellors toward their professors, which is largely one of benign neglect. Unless powerful forces are brought to bear, the community of academics are largely left to regulate themselves, and individual quirkiness and dissention is tolerated by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many things, there is a balance to be struck between academic freedom and quality control. This issue is coming up in many contexts recently. Intelligent design proponents are using the academic freedom argument to try to push what is essentially a religious belief into schools and universities. That violates the quality-control ethic of not teaching a personal belief system as if it were science, and their efforts have been largely unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAM proponents, on the other hand, have been very successful in recent years. They are essentially trying to do the same thing, promoting a personal and sometimes overtly spiritual belief system as if it were science-based. They have simply been more successful at packaging their claims and exploiting the various weaknesses of modern academia than ID proponents. Health care is also much more personal and it has been easier to characterize scientific opposition to unscientific medicine as resulting from conflicts of interest, rather than genuine quality control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harm done by granting science degrees in something like homeopathy is multifactorial. First, it breaks the public trust. Universities should only grant science degrees in disciplines that quality as genuine science, and homeopathy does not fit the bill - it is a pseudoscience. This lends false legitimacy to quackery, confuses the public about the nature of science, and decreases public confidence in academia. This causes a ripple effect of harm to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it has been easy to get scientists to complain about the teaching of creationisms as science, it has been extremely difficult to get them to complain about CAM, even when they personally believe it to be mostly nonsense. This has been both puzzling and frustrating for those of us defending science-based medicine. Val Jones has characterized those reluctant to defend SBM as “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shruggies&lt;/a&gt;,” an apt term.  But there is more than apathy at work - misguided political correctness and confusion about the actual claims and beliefs of CAM proponents also being significant factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore heartening to hear that scientists are finally taking notice and recognizing the threat posed by CAM to science, medicine, and academic in general. Granting a science degree in pseudoscience diminishes science, the university, everyone who has ever received a science degree (especially from that university), and the public trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article5614896.ece"&gt;TimesOnline report&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The University of Salford said it planned to wind down the undergraduate programme in traditional Chinese medicine “for financial and strategic reasons”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that the course had been criticised by the scientific establishment, but said that the university would continue “to encourage and promote research into complementary and alternative medicine”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “It is not our role to comment on the views of others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the conflict in these few statements - the university is bowing to pressure from scientists, but does not want to bad-mouth CAM because that would be politically incorrect, and then justifies their hands-off default approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that it is the role of academic institutions to have an opinion about what constitutes legitimate academia. Universities decide what science degrees to grant - you cannot do this without deciding what constitutes legitimate science.  Therefore that last comment is a bizarre non-sequitur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us hope this trend continues. There seems to be a growing recognition of the importance of science and science education to society, and to national competitiveness in a global economy. Also, it seems (although this may be wishful thinking on my part) that the skeptical and science-based community has been successful to some degree in making defense of science and criticism of pseudoscience more politically acceptable, in addition to demonstrating the importance of defending science in the public square.&lt;/p&gt;

I remember Carl Sagan talking about the techniques astronomers planned to use to find such planets back in the 1980’s. Then, in 1995 these plans came to fruition with the first discovery of an exoplanet - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51_Pegasi_b"&gt;51 Pegasi b&lt;/a&gt;, a Jovian planet around a star 50 light years away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery was just the first. In the last 14 years a total of 339 exoplanets have been discovered, and this number is growing every week. Frequently we hear about the largest exoplanet, the hottest, the closest to its parent star, and the smallest. New superlatives are being made on a regular basis. It’s all very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common method used for discovering these exoplanets is called the radial velocity method. This looks for the wobbling of the star due to gravitational tugs from planets orbiting it. This method, however, favors large planets close to their stars. This new planet was discovered using the transit method - when a planet passes in front of its star as viewed from the earth, the total amount of light measured from that star dips a bit. This technique has been made possible by better telescopes and better computers able to process the information from those telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have once again broken a new exoplanet record - the new smallest exoplanet yet discovered. The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7868100.stm"&gt;BBC reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we have unambiguously detected a planet that is ‘rocky’ in the same sense as our own Earth,” said Malcolm Fridlund, Corot project scientist from the European Space Agency (ESA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We now have to understand this object further to put it into context, and continue our search for smaller, more Earth-like objects with Corot,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a planet just like earth is the holy grail of exoplanet astronomy.  This is partly for psychological reasons - humans are very egocentric - but also does have serious implications. Earth-like planets are more likely to support life similar to life on earth. Therefore we are interested in planets that are rocky and are a similar distance from their sun with similar average temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This planet does not fit that bill. It is the smallest planet yet discovere, only about twice as big as earth. That size planet could plausibly harbor life. It is also rocky, so it has a surface and is not just a ball of gas. However, it is very close to it’s star. It orbits once every 20 hours and has a surface temperature of 1,000-1,500C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As better telescopes go online we will soon be able to detect earth-size planets at hospitable distances from their stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the cool is about to get even cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, actually, it's been hard to take him seriously for at nearly four years now, ever since he wrote his paean to antivaccinationists, &lt;a href="http://www.evidenceofharm.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Evidence of Harm&lt;/a&gt;, in which no conspiracy-mongering related to mercury as an alleged cause of autism was too out there, too ridiculous, for Kirby to parrot. Since then, he's become antivaccine apologist number one, the go-to guy for the antivaccine movement whenever the twisting of science, logic, and reason was needed to spin an event or a study that refutes the "vaccines cause autism" hypothesis. He's also cheerleader number one for the antivaccine movement whenever he sees a news event or a result that he can twist as somehow supporting the concept that vaccines cause autism (and all sorts of other horrific things). No one can gloat as gleefully and full of smarm as he can over any bit of news he can twist to argue, no matter how tangentially, that vaccines are the tool of the devll, while all the while disingenuously opining that he is, really, truly not "antivaccine." In this, he's like our &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_get_away_from_my_alma_mate.php"&gt;favorite pediatrician Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt; on steroids. At least Dr. Gordon seems to have a sense of shame at times. Not our David Kirby. He's loud and he's proud, and he wants so very, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; much for you to believe that he knows what he's talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's one thing Kirby can do, it's to twist any little bit of information and make it seem as though it supports his diehard belief that vaccines cause autism, even when they do not. The most blatant example of this talent on display came when, ghoul-like, Kirby jumped all over the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/the_hannah_poling_case_and_the_rebrandin.php"&gt;Hannah Poling case&lt;/a&gt; and flogs the Autism Omnibus every chance he gets, knowing that verdicts for some of the test cases are due soon. As I've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/vaccines_and_autism_the_incredible_shrin.php"&gt;said before&lt;/a&gt;, science may not matter in these cases because (1) the courts are not a good place to decide science and (2) the &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation"&gt;National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt; is set up by design to give plaintiffs every benefit of the doubt. Consequently, what is decided legally and what is scientifically supportable are two entirely different things, often related only by coincidence. Scientific medicine is decided by experimentation, clinical trials, and data, not adjudicated by the courts, no matter how much David Kirby and his posse of worshiping cranks wish it were otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this stops our master of obfuscation, Kirby the Klueless, who is practically orgasmic at a recent ruling of the special masters of the vaccine court on a different omnibus proceeding. This one happens to be about the question of whether the Hepatitis vaccine causes demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Naturally, he is &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/vaccine-court-hepatitis-b-shot-causes-ms.html"&gt;proclaiming his joy to the world on that home of antivaccination looniness, Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; and stringing together the "what ifs" like no other apologist of pseudoscience can:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/david_kirbys_logic_the_hepatitis_b_vacci.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/david_kirbys_logic_the_hepatitis_b_vacci.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/Wm51amiANaE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233747776114"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/choosing_a_medical_specialty_i_2.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8d8feb309fae307</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medical Education"/><title type="html">Choosing a Medical Specialty IV -- Interviews!</title><published>2009-02-04T11:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-04T11:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/dXAQ39ZOT1Y/choosing_a_medical_specialty_i_2.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/choosing_a_medical_specialty_i_2.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The process of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/choosing_a_medical_specialty.php"&gt;choosing a medical specialty&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/choosing_a_medical_specialty_i_1.php"&gt;applying for residency programs&lt;/a&gt; is nearly complete as I have returned from my tour of the West Coast and am nearly done with interview season.  This is when medical students travel the country at great (and unreimbursed) expense to find their future training program.  When all is said and done, all your research into programs and time spent interviewing boils down to a simple question.  Do you want to work with these people for the next 3-7 years of your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also nice to see the cities where you may live and get a feel for the type of lifestyle you may enjoy.  You also get to take pictures from helipads!  Like this one from UNC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is the famous medical art like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gross_Clinic"&gt;the Gross Clinic&lt;/a&gt; at Penn which also graces a common surgery text: &lt;br&gt;

According to the &lt;a href="http://www.iacc.hhs.gov./events/2009/full-committee-mtg-announcement-feb4.shtml"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt;, in the morning there will be a presentation on supports and services for individuals on the autism spectrum by Ellen W. Blackwell, MSW, &lt;a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/cmsleadership/07_office_cmso.asp"&gt;Center for Medicaid &amp;amp; State Operations&lt;/a&gt;, and by Ann Clemency Kohler, Director of Health Services, National Association of State Medicaid Directors, &lt;a href="http://www.aphsa.org/Home/home_news.asp"&gt;American Public Human Services Association&lt;/a&gt;. In the afternoon, there will be a presentation on vaccine study considerations by Lyn Redwood, R.N., M.S.N., C.N.R.P., of &lt;a href="http://www.safeminds.org"&gt;Safe Minds&lt;/a&gt; and Mark Noble, Ph.D., &lt;a href="http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/"&gt;University of Rochester Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. Bruce Gellin, M.D., M.P.H., will speak about the &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/"&gt;Vaccine Policy Office, DHHS&lt;/a&gt;. And, there will also be further discussion of the IACC's &lt;a href="http://www.iacc.hhs.gov./strategic-plan/"&gt;Strategic Plan&lt;/a&gt; for research on ASDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_curious_incident_of_the_iacc_vaccines_and_autism_speaks"&gt;curious incident&lt;/a&gt; that happened happened prior to the previous IACC meeting in December----the resignation of IACC member Alison Tepper Singer from her position as Executive Vice President of Autism Speaks---and given that any discussion on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/new_study_on_vaccine_safety"&gt;vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt; seems a surefire way to get a volatile exchange going----seems like there might be some fireworks (hey, it is &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_year_of_the_earth_ox"&gt;Chinese New Year&lt;/a&gt;). But will anything truly earth-shattering arise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can listen in to the meeting via a webinar or via a conference call (instructions are &lt;a href="http://www.iacc.hhs.gov./events/2009/full-committee-mtg-announcement-feb4.shtml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;): Will research about vaccines be included in the Strategic Plan and will further research enable us to let go and move on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rather suspect not. There seems to be an insatiable need to have totally 110-plus positive proof about various things regarding vaccines, and no study can provide the yearned-for certainty. Maybe the most earth-shattering thing of all would be the quiet acknowledgement that there is plenty enough----shortages of housing and employment for individuals with disabilities; shortages, too, of understanding; no shortage of discrimination and insufficient, inadequate accommodations in schools and in the community---plenty plus to devote our energies to, to empower individuals with disabilities rather than to be so focused on one possible, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hypotheses_but_no_correlation_vaccines_amp_autism"&gt;hypothetical&lt;/a&gt; cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's two somewhat less potentially earth-shattering, but still notable, things that happened on Tuesday here in the Garden State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/morristown/index.ssf/2009/02/morris_plains_mayor_100_calls.html"&gt;real earthquake&lt;/a&gt; (3.0 on the Richter scale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, after a snowy ride----Jim had taken Charlie into Jersey City to meet me at my office, after which Jim was off to the Bronx and Charlie and I drove back west and stopped for groceries---Charlie and I pulled into the parking lot outside our condo and started unloading the car. I had all my work stuff and Charlie had brought an old backpack and a few other items with him, and all of that had to be carried in. There were still three big canvas bags of groceries in the trunk. I was starting some things for dinner and opening the door for the dryer when I heard Charlie clomp-clomping down the stairs to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reappeared with a heavy bag of groceries over one shoulder. I went down the stairs and found the other two canvas bags on the first-floor landing, neatly placed against each other. I went to shut the trunk of the black car and when I turned around, Charlie had come back down the stairs and hoisted both bags one over each shoulder and was heading back inside. After taking off his shoes and coat, he went into the kitchen and put everything away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing earth-shattering exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, depends, perhaps, on what the priorities are.&lt;/p&gt;

They were huge, they were marine and they were mammals, but their evolutionary ancestry was open to speculation. Some (like Darwin himself) hypothesized that the terrestrial ancestor of whales looked like a bear.  Others favored the idea of a hippo-like or even a pig-like ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, two things happened. First, the revolution in molecular biology and computing power allowed scientists to compare many genes of many mammals and thus infer genealogical relationships between whales and other groups of mammals. Second, some smart palaeontologists decided that a good place to look for fossil whales would be Pakistan. The rest is, as they say, history. Digs in Pakistan unearthed a wealth of whale fossils over the years, so many of them, in fact, that the fossil record of prehistoric whales is now one of the best examples of the bushy tree of mammalian evolution in any lineage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now know that there were several gradual changes in whales over their evolutionary history from terrestrial animals to a number of branches of aquatic animals - some of these branches went extinct over time, while others have living descendants today. They tended to increase in size. Their front legs evolved into flippers. They gradually lost their hind legs: the large, strong hind legs of early whales were used for swimming by paddling, but later decreased in size as the undulating mode of swimming (and the evolution of the flat horizontal tail) took over.  Today's whales have remnants of hind legs still hidden deep inside their large bodies, in the form of two smalish bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While genetics discovers evolutionary relationships, and fossils can tell us about evolution of morphology, it is much more rare that a fossil find allows us to infer much about an extinct animal's physiology, behavior or ecology. And the discovery of one such fossil was just published in PLoS ONE today: &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004366" title=""&gt;New Protocetid Whale from the Middle Eocene of Pakistan: Birth on Land, Precocial Development, and Sexual Dimorphism&lt;/a&gt; (also watch the accompanying &lt;a href="http://www.ns.umich.edu/podcast/video.php?id=718" title=""&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of the fossil). Here is the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protocetidae are middle Eocene (49-37 Ma) archaeocete predators ancestral to later whales. They are found in marine sedimentary rocks, but retain four legs and were not yet fully aquatic. Protocetids have been interpreted as amphibious, feeding in the sea but returning to land to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methodology/Principal Findings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two adult skeletons of a new 2.6 meter long protocetid, Maiacetus inuus, are described from the early middle Eocene Habib Rahi Formation of Pakistan. M. inuus differs from contemporary archaic whales in having a fused mandibular symphysis, distinctive astragalus bones in the ankle, and a less hind-limb dominated postcranial skeleton. One adult skeleton is female and bears the skull and partial skeleton of a single large near-term fetus. The fetal skeleton is positioned for head-first delivery, which typifies land mammals but not extant whales, evidence that birth took place on land. The fetal skeleton has permanent first molars well mineralized, which indicates precocial development at birth. Precocial development, with attendant size and mobility, were as critical for survival of a neonate at the land-sea interface in the Eocene as they are today. The second adult skeleton is the most complete known for a protocetid. The vertebral column, preserved in articulation, has 7 cervicals, 13 thoracics, 6 lumbars, 4 sacrals, and 21 caudals. All four limbs are preserved with hands and feet. This adult is 12% larger in linear dimensions than the female skeleton, on average, has canine teeth that are 20% larger, and is interpreted as male. Moderate sexual dimorphism indicates limited male-male competition during breeding, which in turn suggests little aggregation of food or shelter in the environment inhabited by protocetids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions/Significance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discovery of a near-term fetus positioned for head-first delivery provides important evidence that early protocetid whales gave birth on land. This is consistent with skeletal morphology enabling Maiacetus to support its weight on land and corroborates previous ideas that protocetids were amphibious. Specimens this complete are virtual 'Rosetta stones' providing insight into functional capabilities and life history of extinct animals that cannot be gained any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean? Unlike the gradual loss of hind legs, graudal increase in size, gradual evolution of front legs into flippers and gradual evolution of the horizontal tail, we did not have information about the way the prehistoric whales gave birth. We know that all large terrestrial mammals give birth head-first, while all aquatic mammals (not just whales, but also manatees and such) give birth tail-first. But we did not know when did this switch occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper shows that some early whales, already well along the way of evolving into creatures recognizable as whales but still possessing sizeable hind legs they used for swimming, gave birth head-first.  This indicates that these animals, at least on those rare occasions when they were giving birth to their young, had to go up onto dry land. Thus, we now have the timing a little better on the question of when exatly did the whales become completely aquatic, i.e., never coming to land at all, and it is somewhat later than we thought until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to explain this in as simple language as possible - suitable for complete laymen or middle-school students, but if you want a little more detail and some better expert opinion on this fossil find and the paper that describes it, please read what others have written about it:&lt;/p&gt;

It's not at all notable, except for one little comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stein said he has spoken at many universities, including Columbia, Yale, Stanford, and American University, "and no one has said boo. Somehow at UVM, it has become a big issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend that we make it a big issue at every university where he speaks. The man who said flatly that &lt;a href="http://belowthebeltway.com/2008/04/30/ben-stein-science-kills-people/"&gt;"science leads you to killing people"&lt;/a&gt; should not be honored at &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever get a little motion sick from an illusion graphic designed to look like it’s moving? A new study suggests that these illusions do more than trick the eye; they may also convince the brain that the graphic is actually moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Japan, led by Akiyoshi Kitaoka of Kyoto’s Ritsumeikan University, monitored brain activity as participants viewed the Rotating Snakes illusion, where concentric circles appear to rotate continuously (see below). The resulting article, Functional brain imaging of the Rotating Snakes illusion by fMRI, was recently published in the Association of Research in Vision and Ophthalmology’s Journal of Vision as part of a collection of papers on neuroimaging in vision science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000;font-size:x-small"&gt;It reminds me of the spiral you’d see in cartoons when characters were supposed to be hypnotized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The bottom line is that the House version of the bill will reinvigorate basic science in this country. The Senate version of the bill is not as encouraging. According to an email alert sent out by the APS, the Senate summary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…did not offer many details about how much funding science would receive in that package.  However, we are receiving troubling signs that science may not receive the same levels of funding as in the House package and would even, in some scenarios, be cut or even eliminated.  We are therefore urging the Senate to follow the House lead in helping to ensure American competitiveness in the 21st century by making critically needed infrastructure investments.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science Magazine has compiled a &lt;a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/01/house-and-senat.html"&gt;side-by-side comparison&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the House bill funds the NSF at $3 Billion, while the Senate version is at $1.4 Billion. The DOE Office of Science (which is the largest source of funding for basic research in the physical sciences in the US) gets $2 Billion from the House, and $430 Million from the Senate. These are huge gaps. And note that all of the CV bloggers are funded, at least in part, by these agencies (for doing science, not for blogging). The AAAS analyzes the differences between the two versions of the bill in some &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/stim09s.htm"&gt;detail here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A staggering amount of national treasure is about to be spent in an attempt to stimulate our economy. [The picture below is of &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/site/artmarcovici/"&gt;one billion dollars&lt;/a&gt;, in $100 bills (hat tip to commenter &lt;a href="http://carlosscheidegger.wordpress.com/"&gt;Carlos&lt;/a&gt;).] &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/one_billion_dollars.jpg" title="one billion dollars"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/one_billion_dollars.jpg" alt="one billion dollars" width="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Although one can certainly criticize the idiocy that has brought us to this crisis, and second-guess the appropriate dollar amounts, few would question that some sort of action is appropriate. Congress is currently being bombarded with suggestions for how to spend our national treasure. Roads and bridges will most certainly be built. However, I believe a &lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11463"&gt;compelling case can be made for funding science&lt;/a&gt;, both as a way to create short-term jobs and benefits, but also as an essential path to ensuring the future vitality of our country (both economically and spiritually). Fortunately, this message has already been heard, and Congress is struggling to do the right thing. But scientists are notoriously bad at contacting their representatives, and reminding them that we exist and are worth supporting. This is a participatory democracy, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is to be done? CV readers have had an easy time of it thus far, enjoying the spectacle, chiming in on occasion, and generally basking in the glow of their monitors. But now it’s time to get off your duffs and click a few buttons. (Non-American readers are off the hook.) The APS has made it simple and painless to send emails to your Senators encouraging them to support basic science. Just &lt;a href="http://www.congressweb.com/cweb4/index.cfm?orgcode=apspa&amp;amp;hotissue=81"&gt;click on the link&lt;/a&gt;, change the subject and a line or two of the form email, and click submit. These emails really do make a difference, especially if there are many of them. This is why the NRA and the AARP have so much clout. Spend a minute on the web form. If you are slightly more ambitious, you can also &lt;a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm"&gt;call your Senators&lt;/a&gt;. A friendly young staffer is eagerly awaiting your call, and will jot down another checkmark next to the “fund basic science” entry on their ledger. Every checkmark matters. Then you can rest easy, knowing that you’ve put in your two cents on the way your government spends your hard-earned tax dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stein also insists he’s not not anti-science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he was by no means “anti-science,” as some of his critics have described him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am far more pro-science than the Darwinists,” Stein said later in an e-mail. “I want all scientific inquiry to happen — not just what the ruling clique calls science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, I wonder why anyone would think he was anti-science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. [PZ] Myers, talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed.” - Ben Stein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t imagine. My favorite quotes from this article about Stein’s tantrum are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stein called the university’s response to the furor “chicken sh**, and you can quote me on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the commencement speech, he said, “I didn’t really want to do it in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sources tell me Stein then took his ball back and went crying to mommy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and then there was this bit of understatement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stein said the Holocaust references probably resulted from “Expelled,” a film he worked on that came out about 10 months ago. “In the movie, we visited a Nazi killing center called Hadamar,” Stein said. The center’s victims had included people with developmental disabilities. “I asked the curator, ‘Why did they do this?’ and was told ‘Darwinism.’ That was in the film, and that’s what was said.” To portray Stein as “anti-scientific” on that basis is “a joke,” he said, “nonsense,” “just someone’s delusion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could this anti-science label have come about because of Expelled? Ya think?&lt;/p&gt;

So 1 patient objected and complained to the health organization, and so now she’s under disciplinary review. Of course she’s got her defenders who use their own personal comfort with this unprofessional behavior in order to insist everyone else should just be cool with it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don’t see any meaningful difference between this and the Mormon posthumous baptisms of Jewish Holocaust victims to Mormonism, which inflamed relations between the religion and the cult a month or 2 ago. While I’m confident all gods are imaginary I can also see how a person who was devout in their belief in their own 1-god religion would be outraged to here that their nurse was praying to what they feel to be a false god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurses have to be professional. And being professional means respecting the beliefs and boundaries of those you interact with at work. I think it becomes much clearer of an issue when you consider the ramifications if the nurse had been praying to Satan for her patient to get well. Devout Christians who actually believe there is a literal Satan that’s out to steal their souls might not be too happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;

Why should you care?  Elephant was an upscale store based in the Bay Area, the epicenter for wooishness.  If this type of business fails here, how well will woo do elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's something to be said for the idea that perhaps people know that woo doesn't work, and maybe they cut back when the economy goes bad.  Could the popularity of alternative medicine be a reflection of economic exuberance?  Will individuals act more rationally when they have less money to spend? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article/comments/view?f=/c/a/2009/02/03/BUST15ME5A.DTL"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; on the Chronicle site are fun to read.  Gives you an idea of the atmosphere here on alternative medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

However, Paul’s concept of soteriology has a number of major problems!&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Paul’s doctrine of &lt;em&gt;Original Sin&lt;/em&gt;, sin entered in to the world by one man (Adam) and spread throughout to the entire human race as a result of the &lt;em&gt;Fall&lt;/em&gt; (Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—Romans 5:12). Below, I have considered a number of major problems with Paul’s theology before, as well as after the fact, of the Fall in Eden:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Fact is, both Adam and Eve were going to die anyway and the gods (“&lt;em&gt;Us&lt;/em&gt;”) of the Garden of Eden wanted an terminus for Adam and Eve ending in their deaths. According to the text, what the gods feared the most was, that after the humans ate of the &lt;em&gt;Tree of Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, they would next eat of the &lt;em&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/em&gt; and live forever as gods themselves. “Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever”— (Genesis 3:22) In light of this, Paul’s theology of &lt;em&gt;Original Sin&lt;/em&gt; fails to take into account that death was already part of both the human and the animal world since, without death - being a natural process from disease - the population of both humans and animals would have quickly exceeded the small limitations of the Garden of Eden. This fact is completely missed by Paul as he never considered the &lt;em&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/em&gt; in his theology!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Paul’s theology fails to take into consideration the fact that God lied and the serpent told the truth that in the same day you eat of it, you shall surly die.” Thus, God himself displayed the vices of sin in untruthfulness. “The LORD God commanded the man, saying, “From any tree of the garden you may eat freely; 17 but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, &lt;strong&gt;for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die&lt;/strong&gt;.” (Genesis 2 16 – 17)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is re-enforced by Eve: 2 “The woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3 but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.” (Genesis 3: 2-3)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But both divine and human statements are countered by the talking serpent : 4 “The serpent said to the woman, ‘You surely will not die! 5 For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.’” (Genesis 3: 4 – 5)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; Paul’s theology would have had a sinless Jesus living forever. In fact, if the Romans had not killed Jesus, who being without Original Sin to caused his natural death (the Biblical three score and ten or 70 years old), Jesus would still be walking and healing among us even today at 2,000 years old (Note: In the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_king_list"&gt;Sumerian King List &lt;/a&gt;we regularly find kings living tens of thousands of years, so a 2,000 year old Jesus is nothing!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.&lt;/strong&gt; According to Paul’s theology, if the Romans had not had killed Jesus by bleeding him in crucifixion (shedding his blood in atonement), someone would have had to step up to the plate and do the world a salvation favor by causing Jesus enough bodily trauma to cause massive bleeding ending in his death within minutes (The same amount to time for an animal slain with its throat cut on the altar of the Jerusalem Temple to bleed to death. Paul totally fails to understand that suffering is NOT part of animal atonement in Temple sacrifices!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E.&lt;/strong&gt; If we take Paul’s theology at face value, only 50% of salvation was done on Jesus’ part, but the other 50% was given to Christianity by the Romans who basically did the world a favor by killing Jesus. In light of this fact, Christians might want to consider making Judas a saint or honoring Pilate as part of their salvation process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F.&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, the statements in Genesis proves that animals can reason by the fact in that they understood language such as Hebrew “Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name.” (Genesis 2: 19), plus the fact that the serpent could think and reason too and was cursed in the Fall, there needs to be a savior and salvation for animals too. (In the Book or Revelation, we read about animals in Heaven).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the final analysis, Jewish theology is superior to Christian doctrine by the simple reason it avoids Paul’s blunders!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepsi TV ad pushing gay lifestyle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the TV ad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 26, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepsi is now using its TV spots to promote the gay lifestyle. AFA asked Pepsi to remain neutral in the culture war. Pepsi refused. The company said it will continue major financial support of homosexual organizations seeking to legalize homosexual marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepsi gave $500,000 to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the largest and most powerful gay lobbying group in America. The company also gave $500,000 to Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG). The total gift of $1,000,000 to the two homosexual activist groups was to help promote the gay lifestyle in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pepsi gave their money to HRC, HRC gave $2.3 million to oppose California’s Prop 8, an initiative which defined marriage as being between one man and one woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepsi also forces its employees to attend sexual orientation and gender identity diversity training, where they are taught to accept homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Action!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Watch the 30-second TV ad.&lt;br&gt;
• If you haven’t already done so, sign the Boycott Pepsi Pledge.&lt;br&gt;
• After signing the pledge, please call Pepsi (914-253-2000 or 1-800-433-2652) and tell the company you will boycott its products until its stops promoting the gay agenda. Please be polite.&lt;br&gt;
• Pepsi’s products include Pepsi soft drinks, Frito-Lay chips (800-352-4477), Tropicana (800-237-7799), and Gatorade (800-367-6287).&lt;br&gt;
• Print and distribute the Boycott Pepsi Petition to family, friends, fellow church members, and others. Millions of people are not aware of Pepsi’s support of the gay lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;
• Join our cause on Facebook&lt;br&gt;
This boycott has nothing to do with whether or not Pepsi hires homosexuals, or if homosexuals purchase Pepsi products, or how Pepsi treats its homosexual employees. This boycott is about the fact that, as a corporation, Pepsi is promoting the gay lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how the AFA particularly rail against Pepsi for spending millions of dollars supporting tolerance, equality, and human rights. (Those monsters!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I say interesting, because it's at least a little bit unusual in
its approach. It's not just the same old regurgitation of the same talking
points. It's still not a great argument, but it's at least not as boring as
staring at the same stupid arguments over and over again. Alas, it's not entirely
new, either. It's an argument that the mutation rates required for humans to have evolved from a primate ancestor would have to be impossibly high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremy’s site begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 2009, the Texas State Board of Education met to consider a draft of their new science standards. At that meeting, the Board’s Chairman, Dr. Donald McLeroy, proposed a new student expectation for the Biology standards regarding evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard concerned the fossil evidence of evolution and would require students to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyze and evaluate the sufficiency or insufficiency of common ancestry to explain the sudden appearance, stasis and sequential nature of groups in the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In support of this proposal, Dr. McLeroy read a long list of quotes into the public record. These quotes were from various scientific books and articles that Dr. McLeroy claimed to have read in preparation for his remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on his comments, Dr. McLeroy clearly believed that this list of quotes presented a compelling case for the existence of a scientific controversy concerning evolution. Apparently, a majority of his fellow Board members agreed, and the new student expectation was added to the current draft of the Biology standards, pending a final vote in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as Jeremy’s thorough research shows, all of McLeroy’s quotes are inaccurate and misleading quote mines.  Visit &lt;a href="http://www.anevolvingcreation.net/collapse/" rel="external "&gt;Collapse of a Texas “Quote Mine”&lt;/a&gt; and read for yourself.  Jeremy has done an excellent job of dissecting the dishonesty behind McLeroy’s presentation, and this information deserves to be widely circulated in the hopes that Texas BOE members will change their minds and rescind their ill-considered statement about common ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And you might add Jeremy and Cheryl Shepherd-Adams’ blog, &lt;a href="http://www.anevolvingcreation.net/standup/blog.htm" rel="external "&gt;Stand Up for Real Science&lt;/a&gt; to your reading list.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004335" title=""&gt;Species-Specific Seed Dispersal in an Obligate Ant-Plant Mutualism&lt;/a&gt; by Elsa Youngsteadt, Jeniffer Alvarez Baca, Jason Osborne, Coby Schal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout lowland Amazonia, arboreal ants collect seeds of specific plants and cultivate them in nutrient-rich nests, forming diverse yet obligate and species-specific symbioses called Neotropical ant-gardens (AGs). The ants depend on their symbiotic plants for nest stability, and the plants depend on AGs for substrate and nutrients. Although the AGs are limited to specific participants, it is unknown at what stage specificity arises, and seed fate pathways in AG epiphytes are undocumented. Here we examine the specificity of the ant-seed interaction by comparing the ant community observed at general food baits to ants attracted to and removing seeds of the AG plant Peperomia macrostachya. We also compare seed removal rates under treatments that excluded vertebrates, arthropods, or both. In the bait study, only three of 70 ant species collected P. macrostachya seeds, and 84% of observed seed removal by ants was attributed to the AG ant Camponotus femoratus. In the exclusion experiment, arthropod exclusion significantly reduced seed removal rates, but vertebrate exclusion did not. We provide the most extensive empirical evidence of species specificity in the AG mutualism and begin to quantify factors that affect seed fate in order to understand conditions that favor its departure from the typical diffuse model of plant-animal mutualism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004374" title=""&gt;An Ethical Facade? Medical Students' Miscomprehensions of Substituted Judgment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We studied how well first-year medical students understand and apply the concept of substituted judgment, following a course on clinical ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Method&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students submitted essays on one of three ethically controversial scenarios presented in class. One scenario involved a patient who had lost decisional capacity. Through an iterative process of textual analysis, the essays were studied and coded for patterns in the ways students misunderstood or misapplied the principle of substituted judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students correctly articulated course principles regarding patient autonomy, substituted judgment, and non-imposition of physician values. However, students showed misunderstanding by giving doctors the responsibility of balancing the interests of the patient against the interests of the family, by stating doctors and surrogates should be guided primarily by a best-interest standard, and by suggesting that patient autonomy becomes the guiding principle only when patients can no longer express their wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students did not appear to internalize or correctly apply the substituted judgment standard, even though they could describe it accurately. This suggests the substituted judgment standard may run counter to students' moral intuitions, making it harder to apply in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even if you haven't heard of Bisphenol A (BPA), you've likely been exposed to it. The endocrine disrupting compound is common in plastic infant bottles, water bottles, food cans and lots of other products. Scientists debate its dangers but the National Toxicology Program (based in RTP) acknowledges BPA as a source of  "some concern" due to its possible harm to the brains and behavior of fetuses, infants and children.

&lt;p&gt;On Wed. Feb. 18, at noon, come hear NCSU assistant biology professor Heather Patisaul share what she's finding about BPA's potential permanent effects in a talk entitled "Effects of Developmental Exposure to Bisphenol-A on the Ovary and Brain." &lt;/p&gt;

For my whole life I have watched the federal government bounce along with a few hundred billion dollars of non-military discretionary spending, give or take.  Mostly take - this portion of the federal budget is the part most under pressure, year to year.  Of course the largest portion of federal spending goes into servicing the national debt, and into Medicare and Social Security.   But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, under extreme economic duress brought about, ultimately, by the collapse of the housing market and with mortgage-backed securities added as an accelerant, the economy is in free fall.  The government is seemingly on the verge of an absolutely massive, $900 billion spending spree, most of which is for the sorts of discretionary spending that would have taken years, or decades, to happen.  If ever.  It’s among the most extraordinary things I think I have seen in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many in Washington appear to be very, very, nervous about doing this, but just about all are convinced that the government needs to do something, whatever it can, to avert  what would amount to a very long, deep economic depression.  Opinions abound, and there is a lot of crazy stuff being said on both sides.  A lot of it comes down to the old partisan bickering about how the Dems want to tax and spend, and all the Repubs want is to stop spending and cut taxes (though all they did when in power was cut taxes, for corporations and the already rich, and dramatically increase spending).  There has been a lot of noise about this or that item in the various versions of the bill, with detractors invariably questioning its “stimulatory” value.  (For example, check out what the GOP thinks is non-stimulatory &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/02/gop.stimulus.worries/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the best thing for the government to spend money on?  Where does one get the best bang for the buck?  Lost in the main stream media discussions has been any mention of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money"&gt;velocity of money&lt;/a&gt;.  If the government spends a dollar on something, how likely is it that it will be spent again, and again?  How likely is it to generate revenue?  Create jobs?  Increase GDP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If money has velocity, then its mass must be its value.  The product of the two is the momentum of the economy.  And, as good physics students, we all know that to change momentum you need a force.  That, I assume, would be prices: the less the price the more likely you are to spend it, increasing the velocity.  But, then, the lower the price the more value the money has - here the analogy with Newtonian physics breaks down.  It’s non-linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at MotherJones.com there is a very interesting, if short, &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2009/01/stimulus-is-for-suckers.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by James K. Galbraith.  But even more interesting is the graph accompanying it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/bang-for-the-buck.jpg" title="bang-for-the-buck.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/bang-for-the-buck.jpg" width="600" alt="bang-for-the-buck.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say this comes from Moody’s Economy.com, though I have not found it yet…I am not a subscriber.  It purports to show the economic return enjoyed for each type of dollar spent, though I am not quite clear on just how economic return is defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, taken at face value this graph would seem to squelch definitively the incessant chant for tax cuts, and give strong motivation for spending on infrastructure and the economic safety net.  Come on, MSM, cover this story!  Galbraith’s main point is that the government ought to be taking a much longer view, and I think that at least part of the $900 billion stimulus does exactly that: the portion devoted to research and development can lead to the sorts of new technologies that will truly sustain the next economic expansion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to see added to the graph above a bar corresponding to federal support for basic scientific R&amp;amp;D.  Even if you just figure that if you give a professor money she spends it all on hiring a postdoc, how does that impact the economy?  One of my main worries is that all the science money in the stimulus package will go to “one-shot” big-ticket items, when what we need is people, too.  But that kind of money is not represented by a one-off stimulus, but a sustained year to year program of spending on science.  What we need is a long-term increase in federal spending on science.  A long term commitment, in other words, reflecting basic science policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, also lost in the discussion has been this: just what the hell is the federal budget for 2010?  Ordinarily, the administration’s budget request would be rolled out the second week of February or so.  Like, next Monday.  Not to mention that there would usually be a State of the Union address; all we know for the past 10 days is that Obama will address Congress some time in mid-February.  If I were him I would like to do it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; passing the stimulus package… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do live in interesting times.&lt;/p&gt;

From pages 276 - 277,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contemplating patterns of human thought, we can, in a crude fashion, identify superstition with one kind of error and denial with the other.  Superstitions typically involve seeing order where in fact there is none, and denial amounts to rejecting evidence of regularities, sometimes even ones that are staring us in the face.  Through introspection and also by observation of other human beings, each of us can detect an association of both sorts of error with fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the one case, people are scared by the unpredictability and especially the uncontrollability of much that we see around us...The resulting scarcity of rhyme and reason frightens us and so we impose on the world around us, even on random facts and chance phenomena, artificial order based on false principles of causation...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of denial, we are able to detect genuine patterns but they scare us so much that we blind ourselves to their existence...Numerous beliefs, including some of the most tenaciously held, serve to alleviate anxiety over death.  When specific beliefs of that kind are widely shared in a culture, their soothing effect on the individual is multiplied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such beliefs typically include invented regularities, so that denial is accompanied by superstition.  Moreover, taking another look at superstitions such as those of sympathetic magic, we see that belief in them can be maintained only by denying their manifest defects, especially their frequent failure to work.  The denial of real regularities and the imposition of false ones are thus seen as two sides of the same coin.  Not only are human beings prone to both, but the two tend to accompany and support each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often as I sift through news articles, web sites claiming "scientifically proven autism treatment," and sadly even some popular autism research, I am thinking of Gell-Mann's idea of pattern-read errors from fear.  Autism can be a big scary unknown, and not just for non-autistics--for many years I thought my meltdowns were caused by ESP, that I was in "psychic overload" and that I could "cure" this by rubbing magic stones.  This is a perfect example of pattern read errors turning into superstition--I wasn't psychic and the stones weren't magic; I was just relieving stress with a fairly "socially acceptable" stim.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the ideas that bring certainty in the face of the unknown may not be reflective of reality.  A series of anecdotal accounts does not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/causation_correlation_and_ice_cream_sundaes"&gt;causation&lt;/a&gt; make, and dismissing evidence that refutes such a conclusion doesn't change reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gell-Mann's analysis provides a useful tool for filtering fact from fiction, not just in the broader world of science and culture, but in the more intimate world here of autism facts, fictions, fears, and genuine attempts at understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233704258172"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=366">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/95cc9c840c934a2f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Homeopathy"/><title type="html">University of the Sciences in Philadelphia Justification for Scientific Honor of Homeopathic Leader, John A.

Borneman, III, pharmacist graduate (1952),  founder of the &lt;font size="-1"&gt;Board Member, Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United States, Southeastern, PA, and Chairman, Standard Homeopathic Company, Bryn Mawr, PA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university, known prior to 1998 as the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science (PCP&amp;amp;S), has been led by Dr. Philip Gerbino, a gentleman whom I hold in highest regard for his leadership and dedication to pharmacy practice. As I increasingly appreciate the time demands on a university administrator, I was grateful to receive a very prompt response from Dr. Gerbino following &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=355"&gt;the public posting here&lt;/a&gt; of my letter of objection last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman"&gt;Dear Dr. Kroll,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman"&gt;I would like to thank you for e-mailing myself and our provost, Dr. Russell DiGate, on Jan. 26 with your concerns regarding our Founders’ Day honoree. We most certainly respect your opinion and thoughtful correspondence.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman"&gt;We had no intention of eroding the honorific nature of science with our selection of John A. Borneman, III, P’52, RPh. Instead our objective was to honor a man who is a founder, innovator, and successful entrepreneur.  His selection for the Honorary Doctorate of Science degree is not about the rigors of science, nor the appropriate applications of science to homeopathic and alternative medicines, but about a founder who possesses remarkable leadership qualities and who is willing to share some of those with our students.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman"&gt;Mr. Borneman’s selection as our Founders’ Day degree recipient provided a source of considerable discussion internally. I can say that in the end, it was decided that since one of our missions is to provide our students with academic and personal development through intellectual, cultural, and ethical understanding and awareness, Mr. Borneman’s honor would ultimately benefit them on their own paths to becoming future leaders and innovators. As point of emphasis, and in this context, we honor founding, not the field of homeopathic medicine. We honor a founder with entrepreneurial spirit.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman"&gt;Again, we appreciate your interest and comments and value your opinion. This letter is not intended to change your mind. It is provided to offer a better understanding of our decision. A good criticism is healthy and often inspiring. While it is not always necessary that we all agree, the basis of academia is to provide an environment of inquiry, debate, and critical thought where all opinions are respected.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="sans serif"&gt;Sincerely.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman"&gt;Philip P. Gerbino, PharmD&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Again, readers, please keep in mind that I hold Dr. Gerbino in my highest regard.  He has been a university leader since I conducted my very first research project at PCP&amp;amp;S in 1984. Knowing what I know of him personally, even considering the unrecognized challenges of being a lead university administrator, I am led to register an even stronger objection to this honor of Mr. Borneman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;At first, I thought it might be more appropriate to acknowledge Mr. Borneman with an honorary MBA from the university.  However, even this recognition would honor leadership and entrepreneurship in the absence of ethics by promoting the sale of products with no medicinal value under the guise of health remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Not to be melodramatic, but if I were to collect lawn clippings from my yard and sell them as a cure for cancer with 30% of patients claiming they were helped, would I be worthy of an Honorary Doctorate of Science from my alma mater?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;And I also submit that Mr. Borneman’s grandfather, John P. Borneman (1907) was a PCP graduate and promoter of both botanical medicines *and* homeopathics at a time when dose-response pharmacology was first being realized in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;My most serious point is that one cannot, as Dr. Gerbino proposes, separate the business leadership and success of Mr. Borneman from the fact that the business is one of deceptive products marketed in the name of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Whatever Mr. Borneman offers to my alma mater in terms of business acumen and leadership training, I find his honor highly deficient in ethics and an affront to the principles of authenticity and scientific rigor put forth by the founders of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Unfortunately, my compatriots are graduates of a small college with a small alumni organization. I was graduate number 17,346 since 1821 and the school has only had between 900 and 2,500 students per year in the last 20 years. I doubt seriously that a significant public objection can be mounted against the honoring of Mr. Borneman.  I’m sure he is a fine gentleman personally, and I hope to meet him at some point to discuss these issues, but I am disgusted by the imprimatur about to be given to him by the same institution whose academic endorsement hangs above my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The newest planet to hold the record in its tiny hand is &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEM7G6XPXPF_index_0.html"&gt;COROT-Exo-7b&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;which has only twice the diameter of the Earth!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEM7G6XPXPF_index_0.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/corot_exo_7b.jpg" alt="Drawing of smallest planet found around another star"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COROT is a European satellite that stares at stars and looks for tiny drops in their brightness. There are many causes of such events, but one is from a planet passing in front of the star, making a mini-eclipse. This has a distinctive signature in the way the light of the star dims, so a planetary transit can be distinguished from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know so much about the way stars behave now that by looking at how much the star dims, we can get a decent handle on the size of the planet (a big planet blocks more light, and a smaller one makes a smaller dip). In this case, the planet has a diameter of about 25,000 kilometers or so. That’s far smaller than the usual &amp;quot;hot Jupiters&amp;quot; detected, which are more than 100,000 km across. Like them, however, it’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; close to its parent star: it only takes about 20 hours to make an orbit! Even Mercury takes 88 days to round the Sun, so this new dinky ball must be practically touching the surface of its sun. Even though the star is a K0 type (slightly cooler than the Sun), the surface temperature of the planet must be well over 1000 C. Just so’s you know, this system is over 450 light years away from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big questions is, what’s the mass of this planet? These observations cannot determine that; they only get its size. To find its mass, astronomers will have to take spectra of the star and look for a shift in the wavelengths from the Doppler shift as the planet tugs the star. I have not read the journal paper for this discovery — it’s not published yet — but it seems to me that kind of observation may still be beyond our current technology. The planet may not have enough mass to pull on the star hard enough for us to detect it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until we know that, we can’t say much about this little guy. Is it solid metal, or rock? What characteristics does it have? We simply don’t know. I’ll add that a lot of news stories — even the press release itself — are saying this is a planet that has a surface we could walk on. That’s baloney, no matter what. First of all, walking on a surface glowing red hot may be your idea of a fun perambulation, but it ain’t mine! Second, if the planet is rocky, the surface may very well be molten. Third, planets have surprised us before. While I doubt this is a gaseous body, we simply don’t know enough about it to say much about it past its size and temperature. In other words, saying anything more is pure speculation, and should be regarded as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, a planet this size strongly implies it’s rocky, like Earth, as opposed to a gas giant like Jupiter. We are very, very close to detecting an Earth-sized planet orbiting another star, maybe even one in an Earth-like orbit. I wouldn’t be surprised if we find one in the next year or two… but even then, we won’t know much about it besides its size and temperature. But that’s &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; enough to make for some exciting news!&lt;/p&gt;

Is the only way to discuss science and religion to treat both as equal truths, or is that inherently a compromise too far into the hands of religion?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow"

Thomas Roche" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/2647964165_0b2b2ba553_m.jpg" height="240" alt="" width="240"&gt;Yesterday, Florida elementary school teacher Wendy Portillo appealed her one-year-suspension and termination of her tenure for having her kindergarten students &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/different_you_dont_have_our_vote"&gt;vote out their classmate, Alex Barton&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="http://www.cbs12.com/news/quote_4713968___article.html/students_put.html"&gt;CBS 12&lt;/a&gt; news. 18 teachers from Morningside Elementary School have signed a petition supporting Portillo's return to the classroom; some 2000 have emailed, calling for Portillo to be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a teacher, I simply find the whole situation unfathomable. I teach college students, but there are ground rules for, yes, the behavior of students, and also for teachers. It goes without saying that students must be taught at all times with respect and dignity and if there's problems, there are ways to address these, but never by turning the rest of the class into a kind of impromptu jury to pass judgment on their classmate. As a parent, I would not wish for Portillo to be my son's teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portillo is, it seems, a well-regarded teacher by her peers, from the &lt;a href="http://www.cbs12.com/news/quote_4713968___article.html/students_put.html"&gt;CBS 12&lt;/a&gt; report. One hopes that she can do the right thing now to show that she truly has the best interests of students in mind and, most of all, of Alex Barton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; 6.45pm EST, from &lt;a href="http://www.cbs12.com/news/portillo_4714017___article.html/teacher_months.html"&gt;cbs12.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portillo retold the events of the day in May that stirred up controversy in the autism community and worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we are ready for you to come back at this time." Portillo told Alex,  "So I said let's take a poll. One of the students said what is a poll? I said, it is like a vote..it was just yes or no."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portillo said she put slash marks on the board in sets of 5, and had the students count their vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ok, 5-10, and they counted 11,12, and it turned out it was 14 to 2.  And I said Alex we are sorry we are not ready for you at this time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex was voted out, sent back to the Principal's office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Alex's behavior is common among children like him with Asberger's, a form of Autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I thought it was an opportunity to show my students there are consequences for actions and to show empathy and understand that what they do affects others." Portillo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district suspended Portillo for her actions for one year, banning her from ever working with elementary students ever again.  The district said Portillo brought worldwide scrutiny to the district and she embarrassed a student with special needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hearing is to appeal her punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Absolutely not.  I would not do it again. I did not think at that time I was hurting anyone at that time." Portillo said, "If I could even take that morning back I would. I, I apologized to Alex's mom that day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portillo testified twice she apologized to Alex's family..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why did you apologize?" the district's attorney Elizabeth Coke asked in cross-examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because she said to me that I embarrassed her son." Portillo testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not true says Alex's mother, keeping a close watchon the hearing form outside the door..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She lied under oath." said mother Melissa Barton, "I asked him how he felt and he said I felt bad mommy, and she slammed her hand down on the table and pointed at him and said no you didn't."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She did not apologize to me. She never apologized to me. Never."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As you might have guessed, the four songs are &amp;quot;Oh Boy,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;ll Be the Day,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Rave On,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Not Fade Away.&amp;quot; You can check out the column &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1687/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As a postscript, one of those four song titles has an extra syntactic wrinkle that's worth mulling over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not Fade Away&amp;quot; consists of the adverb of negation &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; plus the verb-particle construction &lt;em&gt;fade away&lt;/em&gt;, and as such it is an example of a &lt;em&gt;non-constituent title&lt;/em&gt; of the type documented by Geoff Pullum &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005333.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005334.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Geoff focused mainly on book titles that are not syntactic constituents, like &lt;em&gt;A Scanner Darkly&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sometimes a Great Notion&lt;/em&gt;. Those are few and far between, but he noted that &amp;quot;things are freer, and there is more experimentation,  in pop music song titles.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when a song title is not a constituent, we still expect the string of words to appear somewhere in the song itself as part of a syntactically well-formed lyrical sequence. Take, for example, the Justin Timberlake song &amp;quot;SexyBack&amp;quot; (discussed by Semantic Compositions &lt;a href="http://semanticcompositions.typepad.com/index/2007/02/im_bringin_synt.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), which uses as its title the last two words of the line, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m bringin&amp;#39; sexy back.&amp;quot; (Of course, to appreciate that as a well-formed sequence requires a construal of &lt;em&gt;sexy&lt;/em&gt; as a noun.) The case of &amp;quot;Not Fade Away,&amp;quot; however, is significantly more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcripts vary quite a bit, but here is how I would render the first stanza of the original Buddy Holly recording (you can hear it on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd6zBMZ423g"&gt;this YouTube clip&lt;/a&gt; while watching a spinning 78): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm a-gonna tell you how it's gonna be &lt;br&gt;
You're gonna give your love to me &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I wanna love you night and day &lt;br&gt;
You know my love (ah!) not fade away&lt;br&gt;
Well you know my love (ah!) not fade away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the words &amp;quot;not fade away&amp;quot; at the end of the first stanza is complicated by Holly&amp;#39;s signature hiccup, which I&amp;#39;ve indicated with (&lt;em&gt;ah!&lt;/em&gt;). By inserting an extra syllable, the hiccup has allowed some listeners to interpret the line more grammatically as &amp;quot;You know my love &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;not fade away&amp;quot; — or at least the reduced version &amp;quot;…my love&lt;em&gt;'ll&lt;/em&gt; not fade away.&amp;quot; Others hear it as &amp;quot;You know my &lt;em&gt;lovin'&lt;/em&gt; not fade away,&amp;quot; which still lacks the expected future auxiliary &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;'ll&lt;/em&gt;. But based on the rest of the song, I feel confident in my hiccup interpretation. Just listen to the very next line, which has another complicating hiccup: &amp;quot;My love (&lt;em&gt;ah!&lt;/em&gt;) bigger than a Cadillac.&amp;quot; Again, the hiccup seems to elide a syntactically expected element, in this case the copula &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words &amp;quot;not fade away&amp;quot; are repeated later in the song, but never in an obviously well-formed context (e.g., following a form of the verb &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; or a modal auxiliary like &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;). The second stanza ends &amp;quot;Love for real, not fade away,&amp;quot; and the third stanza (a variation of the first) ends &amp;quot;Love is love and not fade away.&amp;quot; Or perhaps that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Love is love (&lt;em&gt;ah!&lt;/em&gt;) not fade away.&amp;quot; (Others, predictably, hear &amp;quot;Love is &lt;em&gt;lovin' &lt;/em&gt;not fade away.&amp;quot;) In any case, it&amp;#39;s clear that &amp;quot;not fade away&amp;quot; ends up functioning in the song like a slogan or mantra, rather than fitting neatly into a syntactic slot. Thus it works just fine as a song title, regardless of its non-constituency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his essay collection &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EQR3U2pjwrQC&amp;amp;pg=PA315"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back to a Shadow in the Night&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, music critic Jonathan Cott identifies both the hiccuping vocal motif and the peculiar syntax as part of the &amp;quot;playfully ironic, childlike quality that defines and gives the key to Buddy Holly&amp;#39;s style.&amp;quot; A fine observation, but then he goes on to describe the line &amp;quot;You know my love not fade away&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;telegraphing its message like a Chinese ideogram.&amp;quot; A &amp;quot;Chinese ideogram&amp;quot;? Really? How is that &amp;quot;telegraphic,&amp;quot; exactly? My guess is he&amp;#39;s got a stereotypical image of Chinese immigrants speaking a syntactically simplified pidgin English (of the &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/special-collections/papers/notickee.htm"&gt;no tickee, no shirtee&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; variety) and is somehow mapping that back onto Chinese native-language use (their &lt;em&gt;ideograms&lt;/em&gt;, even!). Sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't let Cott off the hook for that description, but I certainly have no problem granting Buddy Holly poetic license to bend syntax to his will. R.I.P., Buddy, not fade away.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233692291106"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5855">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f7d723af9b414c85</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 2.3</title><published>2009-02-03T20:00:23Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T20:00:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5855" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1bf777bb9635655676b4221d9cca69d8&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week I had a very exciting trip to the Emergency Room, thanks to a rogue MRSA bug trying to colonize my neck.  Within 24-hours of me first noticing it, I had a temperature of 105, and a VERY stressed out the.real.boy.  Oh, and also?  I started to hallucinate and talk nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the only mind-altering drug I’ve ever used recreationally is alcohol. (Yes, I’m square.  I’ve learned to embrace it.) After last Thursday’s trip during the ER trip, I know that was the right choice for me.  Tripping for this girl= DO NOT WANT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, in my own roundabout way I hope you’ll consider endearing, it got me thinking about the things I don’t like even though lots of other people do.   I don’t like chocolate much.  I don’t like the way bacon feels so I don’t eat that either. Don’t like the way I felt during and after my ER Trip Trip (ERTT.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how do you, dear readers, go against the grain?  What mainstream “everybody loves it” (or at least tries it) sorts of things do you dislike?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>a.real.girl</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233691895075"><id gr:original-id="http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/staff-fridge-your-lack-of-mil/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/601ea7910d4a7a1d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">staff fridge, your lack of mil…</title><published>2009-02-03T20:09:13Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T20:09:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/staff-fridge-your-lack-of-mil/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;staff fridge, your lack of milk disturbs me *mechanical breathing*&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233691386728"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/todays_carnivals_330.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f1a4f750d8f0c41</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-02-03T15:20:01Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T15:20:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/UjDTSWtFBPs/todays_carnivals_330.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/todays_carnivals_330.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Grand Rounds - Vol 5, no. 20 are up on &lt;a href="http://nottotallyrad.blogspot.com/2009/02/grand-rounds-vol-5-no-20.html" title=""&gt;Not Totally Rad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The ARC solicited information from adults with disabilities, parents and guardians, community support professionals, physicians, and other health care professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found that, among other reasons, many internists avoid disabled patients because of uneasiness with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, many doctors feel that insurers do not pay enough to compensate them for the longer time it often takes to listen to - and care for - these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, I do (unhappily) concur with that assessment.  I use a speech device which slows things down and can upset doctors who are not used to it (I've literally had doctors become hostile when they saw the device).  The general questions health care professionals are taught to ask make no sense to me, so it takes forever for a support person just to explain to me what the doctor wants to know.  The list of barriers goes on...  Two years ago at my most recent attempt at a basic exam, the office refused to schedule extra time for me, resulting in the need to go back for a second appointment--along with the trauma that entails for both for me and for the poor soul who goes with me.  I was then graciously (see: sarcasm) allocated 20 minutes instead of 15. So I left with my medical questions unanswered.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently I was lucky--at least that internist agreed to see me at all.  (I have not had the same luck however with dentists.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_disparities"&gt;health disparities&lt;/a&gt;, the difference in quality of heath care between people from different populations, comes originally from work with racial, ethnic, or cultural minorities.  It applies just as much to the minority population of people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2006 review focusing on people with intellectual disabilities, the issue is described as a "cascade of disparities" ("A Cascade Of Disparities: Health And Health Care Access For People With Intellectual Disabilities", &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112305210/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;amp;SRETRY=0"&gt;citation and full text download&lt;/a&gt;) including yes, access issues, but also issues of poor health in general, poor health practices, and poor health promotion.  Improving access to medical care may be only one piece of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope ARC of MA posts more details on their study in the weeks ahead.  Health disparities are a serious issue for many autistic adults.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233686525648"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-96088503557170302.post-4277090496467540039">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fd99e72e5b7ee688</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="complementary and natural healthcare council" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="complementary medicine" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="ben bradshaw" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Bad Science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="ofquack" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">I wish to register a complaint....</title><published>2009-02-03T17:39:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T22:06:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/02/i-wish-to-register-complaint.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/4277090496467540039/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=96088503557170302&amp;postID=4277090496467540039" title="19 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XSCXYE5_zNo/SYi_vOIiDCI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/yHa0GBCbN9Q/s1600-h/ofquack.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:200px;height:70px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XSCXYE5_zNo/SYi_vOIiDCI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/yHa0GBCbN9Q/s200/ofquack.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;...about the new Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council, or &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;amp;hs=9WP&amp;amp;q=ofquack+-ofqual&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;meta="&gt;Ofquack&lt;/a&gt;, as it is becoming known, first coined by &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/01/prince-charles-ofquack-is-dead-duck.html"&gt;The Quackometer&lt;/a&gt; many moons ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:right"&gt;From the fat fingers of Dr* T&lt;br&gt;Thinking is Dangerous Cottage&lt;br&gt;Skeptic's Lane&lt;br&gt;New Reason&lt;br&gt;Englandshire&lt;br&gt;RCT 0BS&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;3rd February 2009&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Mr Ben Bradshaw MP,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;I am writing to you to communicate my concern over the newly-formed Complementary and Natural Healthcare council (CNHC), which you recently oversaw the opening of, in your role as Health Minister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CNHC gives its key purpose as the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;CNHC key purpose is to protect the public by means of regulating practitioners on a voluntary register for complementary and natural healthcare practitioners.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would very much like you to explain how the CNHC can provide any protection when it has no input or interest as to the efficacy or otherwise of these treatments. Given the wealth of information available in the form of research on these treatments, it is fair to say that the majority of them have no effect more than a placebo or similar administered sham treatment. However, some of these treatments have active ingredients which can enhance or detract from real medicine being taken by the patient. How can the CNHC provide protection without knowledge of efficacy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a slightly grander scale, the legitimising of these treatments tacitly disregards the wealth of scientific information available which demonstrably shows their inefficacy in the main. It also gives a governmental rubber stamp to purveyors of anti-scientific hand-waving, which I believe is disempowering to people trying to elucidate real effective treatments from invented theatre. It is comparable to ensuring a CORGI-registered tradesmen is of good character, but having no evidence as to his ability to fix a gas boiler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CNHC &lt;a href="http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=6"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; to be a regulatory body, stating on its FAQ:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The CNHC is a regulatory body, whose main function is public protection by setting standards for safe practice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why then is it acting as a lobbying group to further and promote the businesses associated with these treatments?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I note from the Minutes of a meeting of the Federal Regulatory Board of the CNHC held on Thursday 20 November 2008 at 10.30 at the Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health, that Jenny Gordon suggested the possible use of patients with ‘good news’ regarding complementary therapies on &lt;a href="http://www.patientvoices.co.uk/"&gt;http://www.patientvoices.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; in a PR role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find this suggestion appalling. It is a huckster PR trick that some pharmaceutical companies have in the past used, which I find despicable. Trying to infiltrate forums where people are writing their genuine experiences with the posts of those with a financial interest at the behest of a Government-funded organisation is a notion I find disturbing. I would be interested in your view on this matter - regulatory groups should not be promoting business interests, are we to see the Financial Services Authority lobbying on behalf of beleagured Royal Bank of Scotland?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CNHC claims its mission is to provide a:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;uniquely positive, safe and effective experience&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Uniquely" suggests that other (i.e experimentally proven and useful) treatments are not positive, safe or effective. Incredibly, the CNHC is on a mission to provide 'effective' experiences without even commenting on the efficacy! Surely you agree with me that this is an embarrassing situation to be in?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I understand there may be a need to distinguish between unscrupulous and well-meaning practitioners in the alternative therapy field - if people want to pay for these evidence-free therapies they should be able to do so, but I as a taxpayer do not want to pay for a Council which will promote complementary and alternative treatments as being positive, safe and effective, without requiring &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; evidence that they are positive, safe, or effective!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I look forward to hearing your response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many thanks,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr* T&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hat tips to &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Allo v Psycho&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;MOJO&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=7565"&gt;BadScience forum&lt;/a&gt; for some of the, er, wording of the above :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-4277090496467540039?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233686029546"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/03/tams/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bad4c46362accd6f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="JREF"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">TAMs!</title><published>2009-02-03T18:21:15Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T18:21:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/03/tams/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;put on JREF hat&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two very, very cool things: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; I am very, very excited to let everyone know that registration for The Amaz!ng Meeting 7 will open on February 25! The James Randi Educational Foundation sponsors this meeting every year, and it’s become THE meeting for critical thinking, with close to 1000 people attending. We always have great speakers, and this year is no exception: our keynote is (squee squee!) Bill Prady, the executive producer for &amp;quot;The Big Bang Theory&amp;quot;. Regular readers know of my love for both him and the show (like &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/08/a-big-bangin-panel-at-comic-con/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/17/the-big-bang-theory-back-on-the-air/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/25/comic-con-day-2/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and it didn’t hurt that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/25/comic-con-day-2/#comment-106531"&gt;he left a comment here once&lt;/a&gt;. Bill is a great speaker; he’s funny, smart, and a geek like us. He’ll be a tremendous addition to TAM 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also have lots of other great guests, including &lt;a href="http://www.jenniferouellette-writes.com/"&gt;Jennifer Ouellette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com"&gt;Michael Shermer&lt;/a&gt;, My Close Personal Friend Adam Savage&amp;amp;#153, and a slew of others. TAM 7 will be in Las Vega$ from July 9-12, 2009, at &lt;a href="http://www.southpointcasino.com"&gt;the South Point Hotel and Casino&lt;/a&gt;. You can already book rooms there and get a group discount if you tell them you’re booking for TAM 7 with JREF. Call them at 866-791-7626.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;to the JREF website&lt;/a&gt; for more info as we announce it, and of course I’ll have tons of information here on Bad Astronomy as events progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) &lt;/strong&gt; And if that weren’t enough, let me also announce that &lt;strong&gt;we’re holding a TAM in London in October!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup. There is such a strong presence in England and environs that we decided to go international! So on October 3-4, 2009 we’re doing TAM London, and we have some truly brilliant speakers lined up, with more coming. I won’t say who we have or whom we’re still wheedling, but I will say that if you’re a skeptic in the UK you do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want to miss this one. We’ll have a website with registration info and all that set up soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there’s &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/inbox/?ref=mb#/group.php?gid=58881253486"&gt;a Facebook group set up for it&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ll make sure info is fed there as it comes in. It already has more than 200 people signed up! You can also &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/TAMLondon"&gt;follow TAM London on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see lots of BABloggees at these events. If you like my blog, you’ll love the TAMs. It’s a fantastic chance to meet lots of people: movers and shakers in the field, as well as just people who want to see reality for the way it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theatheistsway.com/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/aw_cvr.gif" alt="The Atheist&amp;#39;s Way Cover" width="100" height="216"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I wanted to let you know about a book that has just been published, that is getting terrific reviews, and that looks to be an important addition to the atheism literature. The book is called &lt;em&gt;The Atheist’s Way: Living Well Without Gods&lt;/em&gt; and it’s written by Eric Maisel, known for his many books in the creativity field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Mills, author of &lt;em&gt;Atheist Universe&lt;/em&gt;, endorsed &lt;em&gt;The Atheist’s Way&lt;/em&gt; this way: “I find Maisel’s writings more witty than Hitchens, more polished and articulate than Harris, and more informative and entertaining than Dawkins. A 5-star read from cover to cover!” John Allen Paulos, author of &lt;em&gt;Irreligion: A Mathematician Explains Why the Arguments for God Just Don’t Add Up&lt;/em&gt;, wrote: “How do you bravely face the world as it is and create meaning for yourself without the crutch of a divine benefactor? The Atheist’s Way is a wonderful resource for your quest.” &lt;em&gt;The Atheist’s Way&lt;/em&gt; has gotten many more endorsements like these and I’m also recommending it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the link to &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atheists-Way-Living-Well-Without/dp/1577316428/ref=sr_1_34?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1213652533&amp;amp;sr=1-34"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The patient objected and complained to the health organization — after all, the patient may not &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; her nasty bronze age god, and may feel put upon that a presumed professional is proposing to waste her time on chanted magic spells. It's also a matter of courtesy: when I'm teaching, I don't hector my students on matters outside the course content, like atheism, and when I'm being treated by a nurse or doctor, I expect them to leave irrelevant superstitions out of the examining room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, poor suffering Nurse Petrie, martyr of the Baptist faith, is currently under disciplinary review for springing hare-brained mysticism on a patient in her care. Good. I don't think she should lose her job over one infraction (although apparently she's done similar things before), but she ought to be disciplined and taught what is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no, that's not enough for the deranged dingbat Melanie Phillips, who declares that "&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1134042/MELANIE-PHILLIPS-British-police-running-Muslim-demonstrators-Christian-nurse-facing-sack-offering-pray-patient--way-society-dies.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the way society dies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a Jew; but when my mother was in the last stages of her terminal illness she was cared for by deeply devout Christian nurses who regularly prayed for her. Far from being offended by this, I was touched and comforted by this signal that they cared so much about her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They cared so much that they bowed their head and babbled to an imaginary being while doing nothing. If someone &lt;i&gt;wants&lt;/i&gt; a litany of nonsense recited nearby, sure, go for it…but purveyors of such useless fairy-stroking wastes of time think they have the privilege of pushing it on others, they&amp;#39;ve got another thing coming. And then she plays the Muslim envy card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demonstrating 'a personal and professional commitment to equality and diversity' apparently means that offering Christian solace to anyone at all, even if they don't belong to another faith, somehow damages 'equality and diversity'. Would the same action be taken, one wonders, against a Muslim nurse offering to pray for a Muslim patient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, "Christian solace" is only solace if you &lt;i&gt;share&lt;/i&gt; a belief in the virtue of prayer; to rationalists, it's all humbug and noise and not comforting at all. And secondly, yes, it doesn't matter what religion the looney person is practicing. If they're bowing on a prayer mat, ululating, waving burning incense over my head, sacrificing a chicken, clicking magic beads, or hollerin' for god to come down and smite the devil in me, get them the hell out of my hospital room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, there is a poll on the odious Phillips' screed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1134042/MELANIE-PHILLIPS-British-police-running-Muslim-demonstrators-Christian-nurse-facing-sack-offering-pray-patient--way-society-dies.html"&gt;Would you object to a nurse offering to pray for you?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes 11%&lt;br&gt;
No 89%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needs fixin'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who think atheists are being too touchy, here are two additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put yourself in the position of the patient. You are sick and dependent on this person to help you get better, and she declares that your belief in her god is important. What do you do? There is an element of coercion here that should not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the nurse were sincere in her faith, there's something very easy she could do. Don't ask, just go quietly off by herself and pray for the patient. The &lt;i&gt;request&lt;/i&gt; is an unnecessary element that is little more than a ploy for attention, a declaration of her piety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The writer, Michael Levenson, really went for blood, showing how the track records of the country’s various furry Nostradamuses aren’t much to brag about. Phil himself may hit 70% accuracy (in one statistician’s estimation), but Boston’s version should really just give up and find other work, possibly in the adult entertainment industry. (Fun fact: groundhogs are also known as land beavers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that &lt;a href="http://bostonist.com/2009/01/28/skepchick_globe_misses_the_point_of.php"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; I ripped the Globe a new one for advertising pet acupuncturists under the guise of journalism, I figured this week I’d highlight a slightly more rational article. Thus ends my praise, and begins my rant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Boston Globe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you debunking groundhogs instead of con artists? Why? WHY? WHHHHYYYYYYY? Can we please take Mr. Levenson off the beaver beat and put him on the possible-con beat? Please? I mean, look at the sidebar on that article, where there’s a close-up of the little bastard’s eyes with a subhead reading “Punxsutawney Phil: Sage or fraud?” Can’t you just picture that with Sylvia Browne?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to recap: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;skepticism about fun, goofy things = good&lt;br&gt;
skepticism about serious &amp;amp; potentially harmful things = better&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233682010546"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=470">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/560d0339b9e48a75</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Technology"/><category term="General Science"/><title type="html">Singularity University</title><published>2009-02-03T17:20:54Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T17:20:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=470" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Skeptics by nature take a conservative approach to scientific conclusions - they should reasonably track with plausibility and evidence. Annoyingly often, however, paranormal enthusiasts and other targets of skeptical critique misinterpret this skeptical conservatism as applying to the generation of new ideas and scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite the opposite is true. Science is often about exuberant exploration, tearing down existing ideas and paradigms, challenging authority, and flights of imaginative speculation. At the leading edge of science is creative chaos which rewards imagination, the ability to think in new ways, and to challenge assumptions. It also rewards risks, which means that most new ideas will be wrong - and that’s OK, even necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great science balances these two imperatives - rigorous, methodical and conservative testing with rebellious imagination. Without the former, ideas are disconnected from reality and will tend to spin off into fantasy land. Without the latter, ideas are stuck in neutral and progress is stalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too often when skeptics point out the need for rigorous testing of ideas they are criticized by those who dislike their conclusions as being against new ideas themselves. It’s a deceptive straw man that just won’t go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for risky and creative imagination is exactly why I applaud the opening of &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8b162dfc-f168-11dd-8790-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1"&gt;Singularity University&lt;/a&gt;. Google and NASA are both supporting this new endeavor of Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and inventor. It’s not technically a real university, but it is a school that will focus on nanotechnology, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray Kurzweil is a somewhat controversial figure. He is the author of The Singularity is Near, in which he lays out his ideas on the rate at which information-based technology advances. He argues that information-based systems tend to benefit from a feed-forward type of feedback loop where the more they progress the faster they progress. Information creates the ability to gather new information more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In applying this to current technology, he sees several trends. The most obvious of which is Moore’s law - the density of transistors on computer chips double roughly every 18 months - translating into about a doubling of overall computer power. Advances in computer power feed into advances in other technologies that depend upon information processing and communication, including scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, he argues that increasingly our technologies are becoming information-based.  The focus of Singularity University on nanotechnology, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence is very deliberate - these are the technologies that will make all other technologies essentially information-based, subjecting them to a Moore’s law type of accelerating progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil further argues that we are approaching the rapid part of the curve, where it turns up sharply and technological progress explodes. He calls this tipping point in progress the singularity, and argues that we cannot extrapolate human civilization beyond this point because it will be too transformative. For futurists the singularity is like a back curtain we cannot see through - we must wait until we pass through to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil’s ideas are certainly “out there” - meaning that they are highly speculative. Attempting to predict the future has also proven to be a fool’s errand and therefore invites ridicule, and is also almost a guarantee of error. Kurzweils faith in the future strikes many as “irrational exuberance.” He also seems highly invested in the notion that he will personally experience that future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my book the most dubious claims made by Kurzweil are for his &lt;a href="http://www.rayandterry.com/index.asp"&gt;supplement regimen&lt;/a&gt;. He takes about 230 supplements that he believes will extend his life. Not only is compelling evidence for this utterly lacking, its likely that aggressive supplementation causes more harm than good. Clinical medicine should strike a more conservative balance than other scientific arenas because of it’s direct impact on individual and public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But - Kurzweil is a provocative thinker with interesting ideas. He is not afraid to take risks and some of them have paid off. I think he is essentially correct when it comes to artificial intelligence - eventually computers will be able to out-think humans. I am not as confident as he about predicting the time frame (he thinks by 2050 computers will outstrip humans), but I think at most he may be off by a few decades - not a long time in the scope of human history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific research is both an investment and a gamble - because you never know how a specific research program will pan out. It makes sense to spread out our investments and hedge our scientific bets. This partly means that while we may spend the bulk of research dollars on high-probability translational research, it is reasonable to invest progressively smaller percentages on progressively more speculative programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that creative and intelligent people should, to some extent, be free to pursue their interests, passions, and hunches. Such research has paid off historically, even though most of it may lead to dead ends. That is the nature of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are limits, of course. There should be some plausibility and rationale behind scientific research.  Not all ideas are worthy of exploration, and some have already been adequately rejected by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil may end up being thought of as the Nikola Tesla of his day - a genuine scientist and eccentric figure with some far out but useful (whether right or wrong) ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;______________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is some more information on AI that came up in the comments, but wanted to put the references in the body of this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a better idea of where we are, project Blue Brain in March of 2008 was able to virtually simulate a neocortical column from a rat. (&lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/news/2008/03/out_of_the_blue.php"&gt;http://seedmagazine.com/news/2008/03/out_of_the_blue.php&lt;/a&gt;)  Here is an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took less than two years for the Blue Brain supercomputer to accurately simulate a neocortical column, which is a tiny slice of brain containing approximately 10,000 neurons, with about 30 million synaptic connections between them. “The column has been built and it runs,” Markram says. “Now we just have to scale it up.” Blue Brain scientists are confident that, at some point in the next few years, they will be able to start simulating an entire brain. “If we build this brain right, it will do everything,” Markram says. I ask him if that includes selfconsciousness: Is it really possible to put a ghost into a machine? “When I say everything, I mean &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;,” he says, and a mischievous smile spreads across his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is a separate story from two years ago about simulating the complexity of about half a mouse brain at 1/10 speed. (&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6600965.stm"&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6600965.stm&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half a real mouse brain is thought to have about eight million neurons each one of which can have up to 8,000 synapses, or connections, with other nerve fibres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelling such a system, the trio wrote, puts “tremendous constraints on computation, communication and memory capacity of any computing platform”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team, from the IBM Almaden Research Lab and the University of Nevada, ran the simulation on a BlueGene L supercomputer that had 4,096 processors, each one of which used 256MB of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this machine the researchers created half a virtual mouse brain that had 8,000,000 neurons that had up to 6,300 synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying we will be able to simulate an entire brain over the next few years seems overly optimistic to me, just from a computing power point of view.  But again there is no fundamental reason why this research will not lead to a virtual brain, once we have the requisite computing power and knowledge of brain connections. I think its likely that the first simulated brain will not be precisely human - because we don’t understand the connections precisely enough yet. But we’re getting there, and these computer simulations will actually help us get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of virtual brain consciousness is a tough one, as I discussed in detail here: &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=392"&gt;http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=392  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Donna Garner, one of the members of the forces of darkness, has distributed a &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/garners-dahmer-e-mail/"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; in which she claims that the atheists are winning Texas (I wish!), and that those of us who are working to teach evolution must be opposed more fiercely. And, of course, any accusation levied against scientists is perfectly fair. The &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/jeffrey-dahmer-believed-in-evolution/"&gt;kicker in her letter is a bit of slander&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Dahmer, one of America's most infamous serial killers who cannibalized more than 17 boys before being captured, gave an [sic] last interview with Dateline NBC nine months before his death, and he said the following about why he acted as he did:  "If a person doesn't think that there is a God to be accountable to, then what's the point of trying to modify your behavior to keep it within acceptable ranges?  That's how I thought anyway. I always believed the theory of evolution as truth, that we all just came from the slime.  When we died, you know, that was it, there was nothing...." (Dateline NBC, The Final Interview, Nov. 29, 1994).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, of course! Why didn&amp;#39;t we think of consulting a convicted and confessed sexual sadist and serial killer on matters of ethics and science? I guess this is one perspective in which the religious have an advantage over us atheists — they&amp;#39;re already accustomed to regarding the clergy as authorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/texas_creationists_sink_to_a_n.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/LYFTSzlPuvk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233681003081"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3875">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0bf09f212627a945</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="cars"/><category term="eric morris"/><category term="gasoline"/><category term="transportation"/><title type="html">The Rebound Effect of Higher M.P.G.</title><published>2009-02-03T16:40:22Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T16:40:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/3Kchwm0b42E/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/the-rebound-effect-of-higher-mpg/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In my last post, I blogged about my (mostly) favorable reaction to California's program to increase fuel economy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newspapers, including The Times, generally do not use the honorific "Dr." unless the person in question has a medical degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then she trots out Bill Walsh of the Post and the vapid little god-bunny, Amy Sullivan, to agree that you only call &lt;i&gt;medical&lt;/i&gt; doctors "Dr."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, right. How many appendectomies have Dr Kissinger, Dr Condoleezza Rice, and Dr Martin Luther King done, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They claim that this is the convention. Step onto any college campus. Look at the directories and ask around. You&amp;#39;ll find that the formal title for faculty and staff with doctoral degrees is &amp;quot;Dr.&amp;quot; (although you&amp;#39;ll also find that many of us prefer not to be addressed quite so formally). All I can assume is that these lazy journalists are completely unfamiliar with higher education…and I am not surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more reactions from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2009/02/differing_definitions_of_pompo.php"&gt;Mike Dunsford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2009/02/02/doctor-in-the-house/"&gt;Wesley Elsberry&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"A lot of people believe 13 is an unlucky number,"&lt;/span&gt; Warner said, &lt;span&gt;"but I've kind of embraced it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: &lt;span&gt;"A lot of negative things come with the No. 13. My life is never dictated by superstitions. My faith is first and foremost. If you believe that God's in control, there is no reason to believe in superstitions."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believing in bad luck is superstition, but thinking that rituals dedicated to a great hairy ju-ju in the sky will let you carry a football across a chalk line in the grass is not? Bwahahahahaha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#39;ve often observed, the semantic relationship between the elements of English complex nominals is very variable — consider for example &lt;em&gt;olive oil&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;hair oil&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;midnight oil&lt;/em&gt;. But my intuition, FWIW, says that &amp;quot;anger management&amp;quot; can&amp;#39;t mean &amp;quot;management of angry people&amp;quot; — and not just because the phrase is already taken for another meaning. (Of course Satchel, who thinks that &amp;quot;jerk chicken&amp;quot; is a job description, is an amusingly unreliable lexicographer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in other nominal news from unreliable sources, Daniel Schaefer in the Financial Times recently warned us about a German compound noun bubble ("&lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/11e4a508-eed9-11dd-bbb5-0000779fd2ac.html"&gt;The German language goes long&lt;/a&gt;"):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;At first glance, Germany has avoided the sort of bubbles that have burst elsewhere. There was no house price inflation in a country lacking homeowners. Neither did the nation of savers have a decent credit bubble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;But beware. A dangerous bubble is taking over a country famed for its steadiness. The financial crisis and the notorious German Angst have combined to form an explosive boom: in compound nouns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This verbal euphoria appears innocent when it comes to words such as Rettungsschirm (“rescue umbrella”), Rettungspaket (“rescue package”) or Kapitalspritze (“capital injection”). But it takes on ear-bursting brutality with words such as Abwrackprämie (“scrap premium”) – recently offered for trading in old cars to stimulate the automobile industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;More worryingly, this passion for joining up nouns, albeit unlikely to spread around the world as fast as a subprime mortgage bond, is growing quickly in Germany.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schaefer's premise is, of course, a silly excuse to poke fun at Germanic compounding, and in particular the German spelling convention of writing many compounds without hyphens or spaces, which people have been finding funny at least since Mark Twain's 1880 essay "&lt;a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/twain.german.html"&gt;The Awful German Language&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In my note-book I find this entry:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;July 1.–In the hospital yesterday, a word of thirteen syllables was successfully removed from a patient–a North German from near Hamburg; but as most unfortunately the surgeons had opened him in the wrong place, under the impression that he contained a panorama, he died. The sad event has cast a gloom over the whole community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;That paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about one of the most curious and notable features of my subject–the length of German words. Some German words are so long that they have a perspective. Observe these examples:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Freundschaftsbezeigungen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Dilettantenaufdringlichkeiten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Stadtverordnetenversammlungen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;These things are not words, they are alphabetical processions. And they are not rare; one can open a German newspaper at any time and see them marching majestically across the page–and if he has any imagination he can see the banners and hear the music, too. They impart a martial thrill to the meekest subject. I take a great interest in these curiosities. Whenever I come across a good one, I stuff it and put it in my museum. In this way I have made quite a valuable collection. When I get duplicates, I exchange with other collectors, and thus increase the variety of my stock. Here are some specimens which I lately bought at an auction sale of the effects of a bankrupt bric-a-brac hunter:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Alterthumswissenschaften.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Kinderbewahrungsanstalten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Unabhaengigkeitserklaerungen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Wiedererstellungbestrebungen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Waffenstillstandsunterhandlungen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Of course when one of these grand mountain ranges goes stretching across the printed page, it adorns and ennobles that literary landscape–but at the same time it is a great distress to the new student, for it blocks up his way; he cannot crawl under it, or climb over it, or tunnel through it. So he resorts to the dictionary for help, but there is no help there. The dictionary must draw the line somewhere–so it leaves this sort of words out. And it is right, because these long things are hardly legitimate words, but are rather combinations of words, and the inventor of them ought to have been killed. They are compound words with the hyphens left out. The various words used in building them are in the dictionary, but in a very scattered condition; so you can hunt the materials out, one by one, and get at the meaning at last, but it is a tedious and harassing business. I have tried this process upon some of the above examples. &amp;quot;Freundshaftsbezeigungen&amp;quot; seems to be &amp;quot;Friendship demonstrations,&amp;quot; which is only a foolish and clumsy way of saying &amp;quot;demonstrations of friendship.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Unabhaengigkeitserklaerungen&amp;quot; seems to be &amp;quot;Independencedeclarations,&amp;quot; which is no improvement upon &amp;quot;Declarations of Independence,&amp;quot; so far as I can see. &amp;quot;Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen&amp;quot; seems to be &amp;quot;General-statesrepresentativesmeetings,&amp;quot; as nearly as I can get at it–a mere rhythmical, gushy euphuism for &amp;quot;meetings of the legislature,&amp;quot; I judge. We used to have a good deal of this sort of crime in our literature, but it has gone out now. We used to speak of a things as a &amp;quot;never-to-be-forgotten&amp;quot; circumstance, instead of cramping it into the simple and sufficient word &amp;quot;memorable&amp;quot; and then going calmly about our business as if nothing had happened. In those days we were not content to embalm the thing and bury it decently, we wanted to build a monument over it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Twain points out, the German morphology, syntax, and sylistics of compounding — relative to English — go beyond mere omission of hyphens and spaces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;But in our newspapers the compounding-disease lingers a little to the present day, but with the hyphens left out, in the German fashion. This is the shape it takes: instead of saying "Mr. Simmons, clerk of the county and district courts, was in town yesterday," the new form put it thus: "Clerk of the County and District Courts Simmons was in town yesterday." This saves neither time nor ink, and has an awkward sound besides. One often sees a remark like this in our papers: "MRS. Assistant District Attorney Johnson returned to her city residence yesterday for the season." That is a case of really unjustifiable compounding; because it not only saves no time or trouble, but confers a title on Mrs. Johnson which she has no right to. But these little instances are trifles indeed, contrasted with the ponderous and dismal German system of piling jumbled compounds together. I wish to submit the following local item, from a Mannheim journal, by way of illustration:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"In the daybeforeyesterdayshortlyaftereleveno'clock Night, the inthistownstandingtavern called 'The Wagoner' was downburnt. When the fire to the onthedownburninghouseresting Stork's Nest reached, flew the parent Storks away. But when the bytheraging, firesurrounded Nest ITSELF caught Fire, straightway plunged the quickreturning Mother-Stork into the Flames and died, her Wings over her young ones outspread."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Even the cumbersome German construction is not able to take the pathos out of that picture–indeed, it somehow seems to strengthen it. This item is dated away back yonder months ago. I could have used it sooner, but I was waiting to hear from the Father-stork. I am still waiting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I'm afraid that Schaefer has not improved on Twain, even in respect to an alleged compound-length record:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;German wordsmiths have long contemplated ways of constructing ever larger compound nouns. A high point came with the coming of Donaudampfschifffahrtskapitän (“Danube steam ship captain”), widely presumed to be the longest compound noun on record.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Schaefer's Donaudampfschifffahrtskapitän is a paltry 29 letters (or, I think, 28 after the spelling reform). Twain's Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen is 37 letters. A small internet search turns up Fernsprecherteilnehmerverzeichnis, Einhandmotorkettensägenführerlehrgangsteilnahmebestätigung, and a &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A29639046"&gt;BBC article citing a compound of either 79 or 80 letters, depending on how you count.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of Schaefer&amp;#39;s joke — that &amp;quot;this passion for joining up nouns&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;growing quickly in Germany&amp;quot;, in a way that&amp;#39;s analogous to the housing bubble elsewhere in the world — is too feeble to bother debunking. Still, if I could find a German morph analyzer that did a decent job of detecting compound words, I&amp;#39;d try a quick test of the hypothesis that there&amp;#39;s been a recent increase in the number, size or novelty of compound nouns in German texts, just for fun. Who knows, maybe there&amp;#39;s really a change in one direction or the other?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233677096859"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/nerdy-fun-with-urls/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f504e3e76da1332</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="bad science"/><title type="html">Nerdy fun with URLs</title><published>2009-02-03T15:50:10Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T15:50:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/nerdy-fun-with-urls/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscience.net/" type="html">Heh, er, so obviously I’m delighted that my grown up humour slipped unnoticed into the Guardian’s Media Monkey today, but “Utter Cock As Usual” was not the web address of the Express’s recent story “Danger from just 7 cups of coffee a day“.

The response was not to fire the school's IT administrator, but to charge Ms. Amero with felony child endangerment.



The charges and subsequent trial were well-covered by Karoli at &lt;a href="http://www.drumsnwhistles.com/"&gt;Odd Time Signatures&lt;/a&gt;. She has recently followed up with &lt;a href="http://www.drumsnwhistles.com/2009/01/26/julie-amero-featured-on-gma/"&gt;Julie Amero on GMA:
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Julie Amero was a victim of malware and sloppy network administration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She doesn’t have her teaching license and she doesn’t have her good name restored. She is, however, at least free of the spectre of jail hanging over her head, which I suppose is something, at least. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and the republication of &lt;a href="http://www.drumsnwhistles.com/2009/01/31/julie-amero-heroes-and-villains/"&gt;Julie Amero: Heroes and Villains,&lt;/a&gt; in which Karoli analyzes the character of Norwich Police Detective Mark Lounsbury. On Feb. 1, Karoli published &lt;a href="http://www.drumsnwhistles.com/2009/02/01/julie-amero-is-innocent-period/"&gt;Julie Amero is INNOCENT. Period.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I really shouldn’t have to write this. AGAIN. But it seems that Detective Lounsbury is dissatisfied with the outcome of the case. For Det. Mark Lounsbury, this is a zero-sum game. Just like recently-disgraced Gov. Blagojevich, Detective Lounsbury continues to advocate for Julie Amero’s guilt in the public eye, using whatever tools are at his disposal. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yesterday, Karoli published &lt;a href="http://www.drumsnwhistles.com/2009/02/02/cyberbullying-julie-amero/"&gt;Cyberbullying Julie Amero
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What was striking to me about the interview with Lounsbury was how smoothly he was able to craft a reason for writing what he has. Read through the blog post — it drips with sarcasm, defensiveness, and a real need to trash Amero for his own self-aggrandizement. Yet, when he is in front of the camera, he appears calm, smooth, perfectly reasonable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Have you ever known someone like this? Someone who seethes with anger and whose intensity is nearly overwhelming until they are in public? In the public persona, they appear calm, cool, and perfectly collected, sending the message that everyone around them overreacts.

I left on time, but several delays (getting gas, putting oil in the car, forgetting my PIN at the bank, and a half dozen more assininities) had me about 15 minutes behind. I got on a side road with no traffic lights to speed things up, hoping to catch up on lost time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure. When I do things like that, usually some disaster occurs to slow me down. But this time, what slowed me down was made of awesome. I noticed something odd on one the very tall power line towers following the road; was that a pair of insulators on top? Or two birds? Yeah, birds. But geez, hawks aren’t that big. Could it be… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3247724647/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3343/3247724647_f281f2b72d.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See them there, at the top left? Maybe this will help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3248550616/sizes/o/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3402/3248550616_b233893cdc.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, they’re bald eagles (click the pictures to enoblify them, and there are &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3247725667/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3248551386/in/photostream/"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3248552036/in/photostream/"&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; of them on Flickr). I’ve seen what I thought were eagles at least twice in the past near here, but they were far away and it was hard to tell. I’ve been fooled by hawks before. This time, though, there’s no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea where this pair — are they mates? — are nested. There are no tall trees for literally miles around. Maybe they fly in from the foothills, but that’s at least four miles away. I don’t know how far they’re willing to travel to hunt; but the poles lie next to a vast open farming expanse which must have thousands of rabbits, mice, and other prey. We see foxes and coyotes along this area as well, so the wildlife spotting here is truly wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly hope I see this pair again, and when I do, I hope to have with me either a better camera or my brother-in-law, who has an awe-inspiring camera and telephoto. I’d very much like to get better shots of these gorgeous and majestic birds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233674878297"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3879">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7306cee167f94a38</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Daniel hamermesh"/><category term="discounting"/><title type="html">The Continuing Saga of the Suits</title><published>2009-02-03T15:22:01Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T15:22:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/A9uO8ducfFU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/the-continuing-saga-of-the-suits/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In facing the "Buy one, get one free" suit deal, my quick-thinking wife said, "Let's take the second suit anyway." She called our older son on her cell phone from the store, as we knew he was shopping for a suit, and he said he was interested.  

The store has a branch where he lives, so we are taking the suit to him this week when we visit. He will take it in and exchange it at no cost to himself for the suit he wants. While I would have derived perhaps $50 of consumer surplus from the "free" second suit, a suit's value to him is at least $300; and with the pick of the store, he'll buy a fancier suit.

I really did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular readers may (or may not) remember back in March, when, in one of my usual flights of fancy, I decided that I could write a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/woo_invades_the_military.php"&gt;short fictional interlude, a combat scene&lt;/a&gt;. True, I didn't do it because I wanted actually to write a fictional story (although I have always wondered if I could write decent short stories or a novel if I put my mind to it). Rather, I did it to make a point, and argument, a &lt;em&gt;reductio ad absurdum&lt;/em&gt;, if you will, of a program in the Air Force to bring "battlefield acupuncture" to the our fighting men and women in the military. You see, I was rather perturbed. The reason was simple: I happen to believe that the men and women who put their lives on the line for this nation deserve nothing but the best science- and evidence-based medicine. Unfortunately, that's not what I perceived "battlefield acupunture" to be. So I made up a story of a wounded soldier in Iraq who, after having been seriously wounded, was most disturbed to see a medic bringing him, not the morphine he needed to control his pain, but &lt;a href="http://www.n5ev.com"&gt;Colonel Robert Niemtzow&lt;/a&gt;'s special brand of woo, his "battlefield acupuncture, which is in reality acupuncture lite in that it only involves sticking really tiny needles into the earlobe. Heck, this wasn't even "real" acupuncture! Worse, the studies upon which he based his acupuncture program included a pilot study that was completely unblinded and didn't use any control at all and a photoessay. Even by the standards of acupuncture studies, these were thin gruel indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months went by and I didn't hear anything about Col. Niemtzow or his special brand of woo again. Then in December, right before the holidays, Col. Niemtzow resurfaced. Boy, did he ever resurface with a vengeance!  This time around, he was again pushing his "battlefield acupuncture," but he had also &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/battlefield_acupuncture_revisited_only_t.php"&gt;published a new study&lt;/a&gt; that purported to show the great efficacy of his technique. Unfortunately, its design was no better than Col. Niemtzow's previous study--and arguably even worse. Again, there was no real blinding, no real control group. As a clinical trial, it was about as lame as lame can be.

The pioneering surgery, carried out on a 48 year-old woman for the purpose of organ donation, is much less painful and invasive than traditional surgery, and results in three tiny pea-sized scars rather than the normal six--inch scar. The team hopes it will encourage more women to donate a kidney stating: "An organ donor, in particular, is most deserving of a scar-free, minimally invasive and pain-free procedure."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/02/natural-orifice-surgery-is-the.html"&gt;Full story at New Scientist blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

I made sure it was written into Charlie's IEP that he was on a special diet free of this that and the other thing, and was at pains to distinguish "food intolerance" from "food allergy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had heard about the gluten-free casein-free diet as a "dietary intervention" for autism in June of 1999, just around the time Charlie was being &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/9-years-ago-charlie-was-diagnosed/"&gt;diagnosed&lt;/a&gt;. I stopped at the health food store on the way home from my office and Charlie, and our household, was purged of anything wheat or dairy shortly thereafter. I bought &lt;a href="http://www.difflearn.com/product/Special_Diets_for_Special_Kids/biomedical"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.difflearn.com/product/Special_Diets_for_Special_Kids_TWO/parenting_family_needs"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.autismndi.com/store/gallerydisplay.asp?show=books+and+publications&amp;amp;item=20040725220308"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; (and spoke to both authors). Until about a year ago, I was the Food Police when bagels and pizza and cupcakes came anywhere near Charlie's orbit. Gradually we reintroduced wheat for Charlie, primarily because not letting him eat it isolated him from his classmates, when their mothers brought in treats and when we were at gatherings with families and friends. As of last summer, Charlie was &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/forbidden-fruit-syndrome-and-getting-your-just-desserts/"&gt;no longer on&lt;/a&gt; "the diet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a funny thing happened that a friend and I like to call "&lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/forbidden-fruit-syndrome-and-getting-your-just-desserts/"&gt;forbidden fruit syndrome&lt;/a&gt;." After ten years on "the diet," Charlie has still preferred to eat the same as he did, with the occasional bite of baguette and brownie. He still prefers Asian food (&lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/sushi-scare"&gt;sushi&lt;/a&gt;........) and his old staple, rice with some stir-fried protein and vegetables. And I may as well put in a permanent order to &lt;a href="http://www.conradricemill.com/"&gt;this Louisiana rice mill&lt;/a&gt;, as their "&lt;a href="http://www.conradricemill.com/Details.asp?ProdID=33"&gt;green crackers&lt;/a&gt;" (because the box, not the crackers, is green) are Charlie's ultimate comfort food. On the weekends when Jim and I order a pizza, Charlie's been saying "no thank you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/once_upon_a_time_i_tried_to_recover_my_son_from_autism"&gt;Once&lt;/a&gt; my efforts (Jim has always been more easy-going, to his endless credit) to &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/The-parental-right-to-choose-to-vaccinate-or-not/"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt; what went into Charlie extended to every aspect of his schooling, home therapy sessions, therapy sessions at a clinic, all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was mad at the world for what it'd given Charlie and I thought (unconsciously) that, if I could control everything around Charlie, he'd be all right. I was mad at the world when people stared or sentmean looks our way. I wished for a magic wand (or at least, a &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/no-magic-pill-for-autism-on-risperdal-and-the-importance-of-autism-education/"&gt;magic treatment&lt;/a&gt;), to make it all right. Winding myself into &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/confessions-of-a-former-warrior-mom/"&gt;warrior-mom-mode&lt;/a&gt;, I felt I was doing all I could for Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not so sure about that anymore. For Jim and me, doing the right thing by Charlie increasingly involves heavy-duty teamwork, involves dialoguing (over debating) about what Charlie needs and how he goes about it with an ever-growing cast of teachers, aides, therapists, the occasional administrator, the case manager, former therapists whose email addresses you can be sure I've saved, parents, self-advocates, my colleagues at work, my students studying to be teachers.I used to think I was the solitary mom on a mission. Now I work my way through every day, remind myself to listen and learn and play my part in thinking ahead to the future for Charlie and his three classmates and all the kids like him and them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I worked my way carefully through the &lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=x33lcx4bxbMZ6Bwm55ApOQ_3d_3d"&gt; New Jersey Adults with Autism Task Force (NJAATF) survey&lt;/a&gt;. As noted in an article about the numerous &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/aroundnj/NJ_moves_forward_on_autism_services.html"&gt;autism bills passed in New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; in the past year or so, the NJAATF's report to the governor is due in June. I've heard too many stories of 20-somethings sitting at home because, after years of solid autism education, but no jobs, no housing, no nothing was there for them when they turned 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand why so much attention is focused on early intervention and getting treatments and therapies for younger children on the spectrum. But autism is lifelong and I think we need to refocus advocacy and educational efforts with this in mind. For one thing---something that seems to get forgotten----kids on the spectrum grow up into adolescents on the spectrum into adults on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, at the rate Charlie is going---watching me so carefully as I made him rice and stir-fry yesterday evening---I'm thinking it won't be long before he learns to use the rice cooker. And then from there (if you can trust the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/dining/01rice.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;) the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like those of a certain boy I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yes, Monday was good, with lots of good talking.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treatment, involving B&amp;amp;W ointment and dressings of scalded burdock leaves, was developed by John Keim, an Amish farmer and natural healer. The Amish have a tradition of taking care of their own, and they try to avoid hospitals whenever possible. In the booklet, they even recommend treating hip fractures at home without surgery. (Which, after all, is what we did before we had hospitals and surgery).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim that with the B&amp;amp;W burn treatment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painful burns are rendered non-painful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healing is faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painful debridement is not necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skin grafting is not necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scarring seldom occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iatrogenic harm from hospitals is avoided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients can be treated at home at much less expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Keim, with his method it seldom takes more than seven days to get a completely new skin cover on second and third degree burns, and in over two decades he never had an infection. He saw only 2 cases of scarring, and they were minimal. He does not charge for his services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ointment and a booklet by John Keim are available on &lt;a href="http://www.betterthangreens.com/Product_443.html"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;. The ointment costs between $1.50 and $3.00 per ounce, depending on the amount purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ingredients of the B&amp;amp;W ointment are honey, lanolin, olive oil, wheat germ oil, aloe vera gel, wormwood, marshmallow root, comfrey root, white oak bark, lobelia, vegetable glycerin, and beeswax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been unable to find how he decided which ingredients to include and how much of each to use, but I did find this example of his methods of discovery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was in dire need for a remedy to treat the burns on his own son, he had gone to the woods to meditate and seek Divine guidance. In due time, his attention was drawn to some nice, big plantain leaves right before him which he believed would serve as an ideal non-stick barrier between the salve he had applied to his son’s body and the gauze body wrap. It worked, but later, it was discovered that burdock leaves are more effective, although plantain leaves are still used under certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the ingredients (aloe vera, lobelia) – reduce inflammation. Several of them are inert emollients. I’m puzzled as to why comfrey is included, since the &lt;em&gt;Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database&lt;/em&gt; warns that it should only be used on unbroken skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main ingredient, and probably the active ingredient, is honey. This is nothing new. Honey was recommended for burn treatment in ancient Egyptian papyrus medical texts. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in honey, especially Manuka honey, for which special claims have been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some research to support honey for burns. &lt;a href="http://www.medbc.com/annals/review/vol_9/num_1/text/vol9n1p33.htm"&gt;One recent study &lt;/a&gt;compared honey to conventional treatment for partial thickness burns, and found that the honey-treated burns healed faster with less scarring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11702616?ordinalpos=25&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;this article &lt;/a&gt;from the Honey Research Institute (a possibly biased source?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past decade there have been many reports of case studies, experiments using animal models, and randomized controlled clinical trials that provide a large body of very convincing evidence for its effectiveness, and biomedical research that explains how honey produces such good results. As a dressing on wounds, honey provides a moist healing environment, rapidly clears infection, deodorizes, and reduces inflammation, edema, and exudation. Also, it increases the rate of healing by stimulation of angiogenesis, granulation, and epithelialization, making skin grafting unnecessary and giving excellent cosmetic results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11405898?ordinalpos=28&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;One systematic review &lt;/a&gt;found that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some or all outcomes honey was superior to all these treatments. Time for healing was significantly shorter for honey than all these treatments. The quality of studies was low. CONCLUSION: Confidence in a conclusion that honey is a useful treatment for superficial wounds or burns is low. There is biological plausibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18843679?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; concluded  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of honey compared with other treatments for burns or in other acute or chronic wound types. Honey may improve healing times in mild to moderate superficial and partial thickness burns compared with some conventional dressings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t find any data on honey for third degree burns, and I found evidence that it is ineffective for leg ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does plain honey compare to the B&amp;amp;W mixture? We have absolutely no idea, because the B&amp;amp;W treatment has never been scientifically tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is puzzling that in a booklet touting the B&amp;amp;W treatment, they also mention that many other alternative treatments have worked for them, notably lard-and-flour poultices, bag balm, and olive oil. It is their impression that the B&amp;amp;W ointment works best, but that seems to be based on nothing more than opinion. They also say if burdock leaves are not available, you can use any clean leaves, grass or sprouts, scalding them first to provide moisture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment is not without side effects. In many of the case histories, patients developed rashes, redness, red pimples, prickliness, and hives, interpreted as reactions to burdock leaves or to the ointment itself, requiring substitution or alternation with lettuce leaves, grape leaves, flaxseed paste, bag balm or other natural products. When reactions and pain occur, they use a remedy called Calm Crème. There seems to be a lot of improvisation: B&amp;amp;W is supposed to work so well, but when it doesn’t they resort to trial and error with pretty much anything that occurs to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest dangers in burns is infection. Keim tells patients not to worry about fever. He says fever is perfectly normal and part of the healing process but you should watch for a bad smell to detect infection. Fever can be treated with vitamin C powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one testimonial a child was hospitalized and got 8 days of conventional burn treatment, then B&amp;amp;W was used when the child was back at home. Guess which got the credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One case I found particularly troubling was that of a 14 year old boy with a leg injury. After 5 days of treatment, “the tissue of the leg broke apart, draining so much that a bed pan was kept under the leg to catch the fluids while redressing.” The dressing had a putrefying odor. The calf muscle was no longer attached to the bone on one side and they kept pushing it back into position. Burdock leaves were “drawing too much fluids” so they were replaced with gauze. On day 12 a mixture of milk of magnesia and brown sugar replaced the B&amp;amp;W to help dry up the wound, also colloidal silver was used. Then B&amp;amp;W was used again and he developed an allergic reaction to it. When the healing “came to a halt,” they put him on a diet of lemonade with maple syrup and cayenne pepper, no food. The healing resumed after 5 days of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think he was a very lucky boy to survive both the wound and the treatment. A healthy body has great healing powers and we tend to forget that even without effective treatment people sometimes get well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the medical advice in the booklet is irresponsible. One parent claims his doctor told them to treat dehydration by sitting the child in lukewarm water for 30 minutes at a time so the body could absorb water through the skin. Another article claims that “Our bodies breathe through the skin” –a man who fell into vat of paint died because his pores were clogged so he couldn’t absorb enough oxygen through his skin. Don’t add sugar to boiling water, as it decomposes the sugar. “Dehydrated children should never be given plain water as this may make their condition worse.” Give juices instead. You can determine if a patient is responding and has “good vitals” by doing one simple test: verifying that his pupils constrict briskly when you shine a light in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testimonials are impressive and they may be onto something, but there are so many unanswered questions! Is the B&amp;amp;W mixture better than just honey? Does it matter what kind of honey you use and whether it is raw or pasteurized? Are all 12 ingredients necessary and are the amounts optimal? Is there something special about burdock leaves? Is it possible that the ointment or the leaves could introduce bacteria or contaminants into the wounds? (The blanching process would not sterilize the leaves). Can we trust a parent’s assessment that the child really had third degree burns over 20% of the body surface and second degree burns over another 10%? Would the patients who healed without skin grafts really have needed skin grafts with conventional treatment? Was the absence of pain due to the treatment or to the fact that third degree burns destroy the nerve endings and are painless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testimonials themselves reveal a real danger: treating burns at home can kill people. The booklet describes a 2 ½ year old girl who was treated at home, became unresponsive and died en route to the hospital. They say she died of shock and explain that shock can be from loss of body fluids but in this case they attributed it to the trauma she had gone through. Another 3 year old died of dehydration during treatment. They explain that if they had known then what they know now about using a water/salt/sugar oral rehydration solution, her death might have been prevented. Maybe. It seems certain that both deaths would have been prevented by prompt conventional burn treatment in a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amish have enlisted the cooperation of doctors who are now allowing them to use the B&amp;amp;W treatment in the hospital under supervision. That’s a step in the right direction, because it will allow for detection of dehydration and infection, will permit professional assessment of burn depth and extent, and hopefully will produce accurate case histories that can be published in peer reviewed journals, a step up from the testimonials of uneducated and scientifically naïve parents. But what is really needed is a simple controlled study comparing conventional burn treatment to the B&amp;amp;W/burdock treatment. Until that is done, all we have is speculation, opinion, and guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With most mammals, the biggest and most aggressive male claims the alpha male role and gets his choice of food and females. But a new study from the University of Minnesota suggests that at least among chimpanzees, smaller, more mild-mannered males can also use political behavior to secure the top position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orphaned chimpanzee infants given special ‘mothering’ by humans are more advanced than the average child at nine months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also suffering are Oral Roberts’ ministry and the late D. James Kennedy of “The Coral Ridge Hour” TV show.&lt;/p&gt;

In previous years, I’ve marked the occasion with examples of how the people we met during the year might answer the age old chicken / road question. Here are those previous years’ versions: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 2006 - &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2006/02/why_did_the_chi.html"&gt;Why did the chicken cross the road?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;February 2007 - &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2007/02/why_did_the_chi.html"&gt;Why did the chicken re-cross the road?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;February 2008 - &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/02/chicken-road-ye.html"&gt;Chicken, Road, Year Three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some serious woo in those first three years. I wondered whether to continue with the tradition this year, wondered if it wasn’t getting a little tired, or if there was enough material.  But then I read through some of the year’s posts and I decided that yes, there really was enough woo again this year for more chicken/road answers (including a late entry by Michael Egnor).  And yet again, Deepak Chopra makes an appearance – the only person to be featured in all four years’ chicken/road celebrations.  Choprawoo – the woo that truly keeps on giving.  And the actual reason I started this blog and wrote my &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/02/_a_friend_sent_.html"&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; in 2005.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now you’re all up to date, with no further ado, here are the chicken abusers we met last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 align="center"&gt;Why did the chicken cross the road in 2008?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/02/alf-terrorists.html"&gt;Animal Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; (ALF)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re going to firebomb anyone who works with chickens crossing roads. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/03/god-huckabee.html"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not for a chicken reason. But because people prayed for it. [Turns to aide.] (What? The chicken didn’t cross the road? Not even after we prayed?)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/03/autism-still-no.html"&gt;David Kirby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was the vaccines!

That experiment would consist of two chickens. One of the two chickens would cross the road, while the other would wait on this side. Were ‘time’ to exist, then the two chickens, a few feet apart (one this side, and one on the “other side” of the road) would be affected at a similar rate by the surrounding-them same speed of ‘time’. As ‘time’ does not exist, but the physical process of change does, the first chicken that has “crossed the road” is on “the other side”, while the chicken that has not crossed would remain on this side indefinitely, for as long as that chicken does not cross the road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/08/criss-angel-fake-escape-demolition.html"&gt;Criss Angel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It didn’t – it was all a camera trick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/08/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-cam-encyclopedia.html"&gt;Manish Bhatia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To set up a Wiki for people uncritical of alternatives to chickens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/08/humans-cant-digest-wheatgrass.html"&gt;Wheatgrass Proponents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To drink some wheatgrass juice, dammit.

Yes, this is going to be a post worthy of that sort of expression.  If I may:&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/xpDMzj1tc44%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly, as you likely know, I'm a massage therapist up here near Toronto.  As such, I tend to get lots of pamphlets and shit from a wide variety of vendors selling their wares and peddling the most recent rounds of pseudo-scientific horsepucky.  The latest offering from &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.easterncurrents.ca"&gt;Eastern Currents&lt;/a&gt; (in their flyer for January/February 2009) features an absolute howler of a course; I find it difficult to even read the description as it is beyond hokey and delves well into the domain of the fucking ludicrous.  Please allow me to quote liberally from the outline of &lt;i&gt;Esoteric Acupuncture with Dr. Mikio Sankey&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;The general thinking of people in the West is to consider becoming healthy only after they have a physical or emotional imbalance.  The real power of acupuncture is to harmonize and strengthen the body systems before a disease stage.  Why try to get healthy only after you are sick?  Can the problems of today in the Age of Aquarius be adequately handled by solutions developed in the Age of Pisces?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complex problems require complex solutions.  Esoteric Acupuncture was developed to address the imbalances experienced today on the physical, etheric, astral, mental, casual, buddhic, atmic (sic?), and monadic planes....Esoteric Acupuncture requires that one opens the Heart Chakra to rely on a higher intuitive power of the heart and head chakras, rather than relying solely on the academic left brain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Tired yet?  I mean, jesus christ, I've heard some bullshit in my day - from Deepak to a two-day &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism#Scientific"&gt;YEC&lt;/a&gt; lecture series, from Hinn to Samraj - but this guy damn near takes the cake.  And the candles on the top.  And my mom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But oh my friends, it gets so much better...&lt;blockquote&gt;You will be taught how to find imbalances in the astral level by using a pendulum, as well as how to build your Antahkarana&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, your "Rainbow Bridge" to higher consciousness.  There will be a discussion on the energetics of the major acupuncture points used in Esoteric Acupuncture....Everything you eat and think is transferred through yourhands and mind into your needle....After the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;two-day workshop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, each participant should be able to treat chakra imbalances and to align the Qi so it flows smoothly to the Crown Chakra and higher.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Emphasis added by me.  Oh, and just in case you want to read the whole thing for yourself - making your brain hate you, jump out of your head and go read about the latest happenings on &lt;i&gt;The Bachelor&lt;/i&gt; for some intelligent stimulation - please to &lt;a href="http://www.easterncurrents.ca/database/rte/regformsankey2009(1).pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to immerse yourself in the full course details.  I'll save most of you the trouble and tell you that the weekend course costs $404.25 or $446.25, depending on whether or not you're an "early bird" or not.  Not bad, considering you'll be building an entire "rainbow bridge".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd have more jokes about what Sankey is about but he's too much of an easy target.  It'd be like slapping a mopey dog.  I will say, however, that one of his two Ph.Ds is from &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.aluniversity.edu/indexfinal.html"&gt;American Liberty University&lt;/a&gt;, which has been thrown some flack for potentially being a diploma mill.  Please see &lt;a href="http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20070211/NEWS/702110399/0/FRONTPAGE"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, this paragraph:&lt;blockquote&gt;American Liberty University, a school given a waiver from a full review, set up a “campus" in Montgomery but comes from California. On its Web site, ALU lists that it is licensed by the state but does not inform visitors that ALU is not recognized by the federal Department of Education as an accredited institution. That means its credits will be nearly impossible to transfer to accredited institutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The school also gives credit for “experiential learning," defined as “previous life or work experience outside of the classroom, or self-study in some courses and departments."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giving academic credit for life experience is a red flag, said George Gollin, a professor at the University of Illinois who tracks fraudulent colleges.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Right.  So now we're down to one Ph.D, and that's from Honolulu and his fucking specialization was in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;iridology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  Yeah, &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/iridology.html"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; iridology.  I think we can safely say that Mikio's credibility, if it was the U.S. homeland security color-coded alert level, would be well into the red, if not all out black.  At least our good "Dr." can get his colors back into order with a simple adjustment of his pancreatic chakra and a nice fig newton.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It saddens me that this guy will likely make a lot of money off of people that I will eventually have to deprogram.  What an ass.  Woo!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1.

Comment threads on blogs are an important aspect of the blogging culture.  But I disagree that it is a defining aspect - there are many excellent blogs out there with no commenting allowed. Such blogs usually have a prominently displayed contact information for direct e-mailing to the author. One can always link to and trackback on one's own blog in response: blog-to-blog conservation is just as important to the blogosphere as a whole, if not more, than comments on any individual post. Other blogs have their feeds exported to LiveJournal or FriendFeed where one can post comments as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how &lt;a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/2009/01/30/a-postscript/" title=""&gt;Dorothea Salo&lt;/a&gt; explains (not &lt;a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/2006/10/11/still-no-comments/" title=""&gt;for the first time&lt;/a&gt;) why her blog has no commenting function. John Hawks explains it at the end of &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/meta/blogging-tenure-part-2-2008.html" title=""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, there are hybrids - for instance some posts have comments and some don't on &lt;a href="http://leiterreports.typepad.com/" title=""&gt;Leiter Reports&lt;/a&gt;.  Or, you cannot comment on &lt;a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/" title=""&gt;Talking Points Memo&lt;/a&gt;, but you can on other parts of the site, e.g., on TPMMuckraker, TPMDC and TPMCafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you allow comments on your blog, how do you, yourself, behave in your own comment threads?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bloggingwithoutablog.com/how-your-comment-response-policy-can-change-the-dynamics-of-your-community/" title=""&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; post tries to make a classification of commenting tactics of blog owners.  I think I mix them up, using one or another as I see fit, depending on the context, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you do on your blog? What type of host's behavior you prefer to see on a blog's comment thread?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Background to the debate: Ghostwriting occurs when someone makes substantial contributions to a manuscript without attribution or disclosure. It is considered bad publication practice in the medical sciences, and some argue it is scientific misconduct. At its extreme, medical ghostwriting involves pharmaceutical companies hiring professional writers to produce papers promoting their products but hiding those contributions and instead naming academic physicians or scientists as the authors. To improve transparency, many editors' associations and journals allow professional medical writers to contribute to the writing of papers without being listed as authors provided their role is acknowledged. This debate examines how best to tackle ghostwriting in the medical literature from the perspectives of a researcher, an editor, and the professional medical writer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000028" title=""&gt;Mutation Patterns in the Human Genome: More Variable Than Expected&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The development, survival, and reproduction of an organism depend on the genetic information that is carried in its genome, yet the transmission of genetic information is not perfectly accurate: new mutations occur at each generation. These mutations are the primary cause of the genetic diversity on which natural selection can operate, and hence are the sine qua non of evolution. A better knowledge of mutation processes is crucial for investigating the causes of genetic diseases or cancer and for understanding evolutionary processes. This knowledge is also important for different practical reasons. First, comparative sequence analysis is widely used to find functional elements within genomes. The basic principle of this approach is that functional elements are affected by natural selection, and hence can be recognized because they evolve either slower or faster than expected given the local mutation rate. Hence, to be able to annotate genomic sequences, it is necessary to have a good knowledge of the underlying pattern of mutation. Moreover, this knowledge is also essential for ensuring the accuracy of the methods that analyze sequence divergence to determine the phylogeny of species or the demographical history of populations. Finally, the study of mutational processes also provides valuable information about genome function in processes such as replication, repair, transcription, and recombination. During the last few years, several important factors affecting mutation rates have been uncovered. However, a paper in this issue of PLoS Biology [1] reveals an unexpected additional layer of complexity in the determinants of mutation rates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000027" title=""&gt;Cryptic Variation in the Human Mutation Rate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Understanding the process of mutation is important, not only mechanistically, but also because it has implications for the analysis of sequence evolution and population genetic inference. The mutation rate is known to differ between sites within the human genome. The most dramatic example of this is when a C is followed by G; both the C and G nucleotides have a rate of mutation that is between 10- and 20-fold higher than the rate at other sites. In addition, is it known that the mutation rate may be influenced by the nucleotides flanking the site. Here we show that there is also very substantial variation in the mutation rate that is not associated with the flanking nucleotides, or the CpG effect. Although this variation does not depend upon the adjacent nucleotides, there are nonrandom patterns of nucleotides surrounding sites that appear to be hypermutable, suggesting there are complex context effects that influence the mutation rate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000029" title=""&gt;Gene Regulatory Network Interactions in Sea Urchin Endomesoderm Induction&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In recent years, "gene regulatory networks" (GRNs) have provided integrated views of gene interactions that control biological processes. One of the earliest networks to be activated in the developing zygotes is the one controlling endomesoderm development. In the sea urchin, this network includes several subnetworks that function in adjacent tiers of cells that form the endoderm and mesoderm of the developing embryo. Although classic embryological manipulations have shown that the precursors of the embryonic skeleton induce endomesoderm fate in adjacent cells, the GRNs regulating this interaction are not understood. To investigate these networks, we ectopically activated a GRN that operates in skeletogenic precursors and characterized the responding GRN in neighboring cells, which adopt an endomesoderm fate. By testing the responsiveness of every core factor in the responding GRN, which allowed us to identify a subset that executes the response to the induction, we demonstrated that the signaling molecule, ActivinB, is an essential component of this induction and that its function is physiologically relevant: it is required during normal embryonic development to activate the same GRN that responds to signals from skeletogenic precursors. Furthermore, the network response to ActivinB signaling reveals greater complexity in an additional uncharacterized inductive signal emitted by skeletogenic precursors. Our results thus highlight how interacting GRNs can be used to understand a fundamental signaling process.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_biolo_35.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/yQCI3DGcplk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233630101002"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/beer_or_souls.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d19c2653cad2b396</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Beer or souls?</title><published>2009-02-03T04:10:44Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T04:10:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/TujEFxzhthw/beer_or_souls.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/beer_or_souls.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Phil Zuckerman has written a book called &lt;i&gt;Society without God: What the Least Religious Nations Can Tell Us About Contentment&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0814797148/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=0814797148&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0814797148&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=0814797148" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; I haven't read it yet, but it sounds like a good approach, looking at secular societies like Scandinavia and comparing them to religious societies, like the US. At this point, I don't know much more about it other than what I see in the reviews, and &lt;a href="http://depthdeception.blogspot.com/2009/02/maybe-religion-does-poison-everything.html"&gt;the Depth Deception blog&lt;/a&gt; finds an unwittingly hilarious &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/february/13.57.html?start=1"&gt;review in &lt;i&gt;Christianity Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The final paragraph will leave you giggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerman sells humanity short. If people are content but no longer care about transcendent meaning and purpose or life beyond death, that's not a sign of greatness but tragic forgetfulness. Their horizon of concern is too narrow. They were made for more. &lt;b&gt;What does it profit a society if, as this book's jacket notes, it gains "excellent educational systems, strong economies, well-supported arts, free health care, egalitarian social policies, outstanding bike paths, and great beer," but loses its soul?&lt;/b&gt; Can a country build strong social systems and keep its soul? While I am thankful for Zuckerman's reminder about Christianity's social implications, and the example of a place that meets those obligations differently than we do, I am sad he misses the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait…&lt;i&gt;societies&lt;/i&gt; have souls? Weird. So is the Roman Republic in heaven? Do they still bicker with the Macedonian soul?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to go out on a limb here, though, and admit that if I had the choice between a country with free health care and great beer, and one that had neither of those things but that claimed to possess an imaginary, invisible, intangible ghost, I'd go with the ghostless one with health care and beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least it was a good review.

Like any guy, I read it hoping to discover the magic switch that turns women on, but as expected, the message is that female arousal is very, very complicated. This was not a surprise. One of the curious results, though, was that not only do men and women differ in the specificity of stimuli that induce arousal, but women&amp;#39;s brains (measured by self-reporting) and women&amp;#39;s bodies (measured by plethysmograph) don&amp;#39;t agree — vaginal arousal was measured when subjects saw video clips of mating bonobos and a variety of different sexual situations, while at the same time they reported a lack of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's fascinating stuff, but I have to raise an objection. They try to use evolution to explain what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the bonobos, a body of evidence involving rape has influenced her construction of separate systems. She has confronted clinical research reporting not only genital arousal but also the occasional occurrence of orgasm during sexual assault. And she has recalled her own experience as a therapist with victims who recounted these physical responses. She is familiar, as well, with the preliminary results of a laboratory study showing surges of vaginal blood flow as subjects listen to descriptions of rape scenes. So, in an attempt to understand arousal in the context of unwanted sex, Chivers, like a handful of other sexologists, has arrived at an evolutionary hypothesis that stresses the difference between reflexive sexual readiness and desire. Genital lubrication, she writes in her upcoming paper in Archives of Sexual Behavior, is necessary "to reduce discomfort, and the possibility of injury, during vaginal penetration. . . . Ancestral women who did not show an automatic vaginal response to sexual cues may have been more likely to experience injuries during unwanted vaginal penetration that resulted in illness, infertility or even death, and thus would be less likely to have passed on this trait to their offspring."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Evolution's legacy, according to this theory, is that women are prone to lubricate, if only protectively, to hints of sex in their surroundings. Thinking of her own data, Chivers speculated that bonobo coupling, or perhaps simply the sight of a male ape's erection, stimulated this reaction because apes bear a resemblance to humans -- she joked about including, for comparison, a movie of mating chickens in a future study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all sounds very plausible, but plausibility isn&amp;#39;t enough — this is a perfect example of a just-so story. I&amp;#39;d want to see comparative data, but our closest relatives, the chimpanzees, are so different from us in sexual behavior that it would be difficult to generate an appropriate comparison. I&amp;#39;d want to see the causal and molecular basis for this behavior in women, but again, it&amp;#39;s going to be so complex that I doubt we&amp;#39;ll find simple relationships, let alone molecular evidence of selection. I&amp;#39;d want to see historical evidence that women who lacked a lubricity response to the prospect of unwanted sexual activity were more prone to injury that affected childbearing, but that doesn&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not doubting the physiological relevance of the research, this too-willing cooption of evolutionary explanations just bugs me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an antidote, I have to recommend a book I've mentioned before, an excellent survey of evolutionary explanations for female sexuality, &lt;i&gt;The Case of the Female Orgasm: Bias in the Science of Evolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674022467/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=0674022467&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0674022467&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=0674022467" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, by Elisabeth Lloyd. It steps through various proposed scenarios and shows the lack of legitimate evidence or, in quite a few cases, neglect of evidence that &lt;i&gt;contradicts&lt;/i&gt; the hypotheses. It's one of the best books around for demonstrating how rigorous evolutionary logic should be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that book doesn't tell me what women want, either. The conclusion is that the female orgasm is probably an evolutionary byproduct, and that adaptive explanations are inappropriate and unjustified. I suspect the same answer applies to the work on female arousal.&lt;/p&gt;

President Daniel Fogel of the University of Vermont has given several interviews on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/university_of_vermont_makes_an.php"&gt;Ben Stein affair&lt;/a&gt;, and clarified quite a few matters. He explicitly says he did not ask Stein to withdraw from the commencement ceremonies, but when you read these comments, it's clear that that there was a lack of support from the UVM administration and that he was confronted with some serious objections, and Stein withdrew knowing that if he persisted it was going to get ugly. Here's one &lt;a href="http://straightfromthesource.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/uvms-president-responds-to-questions-about-commencement-speaker-ben-stein/"&gt;interview with Fogel&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the fundamental concern of the people that wrote to me was that, while they are quite open to having a speaker with Mr. Steins views on campus, they felt that he should not be honored at the commencement ceremony when so many of his views seemed to be affronts to the basic premises of the academy, about scientific and scholarly inquiry and collaterally, people were deeply disturbed by his views on the roll of science in the Holocaust.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But I have to say, the issue here, and this is important, is not freedom of expression.  Ben Stein has come to our campus to speak, and some of the faculty that are colleagues here wrote to me to say that they have no objection to him coming here to speak.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It was the legitimate concern among members of the community regarding the implications of granting an honorary degree to &lt;b&gt;someone whose ideas fundamentally ignore the basics of scientific inquiry&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's a smart and important point: this was not about freedom of expression, since Stein clearly has a surfeit of venues in which he opens his tendentious mouth, but a question of a scientific research institution giving a science denier and propagandist a platform to validate his anti-university views. &lt;a href="http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=9774534&amp;amp;nav=4QcS"&gt;He reiterates this position in another interview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not, to my mind, an issue about academic freedom or the openness of the campus to all points of view. Ben Stein spoke here last spring to great acclaim," UVM President Dan Fogel said. "It's an issue about the appropriateness of awarding an honorary degree to someone &lt;b&gt;whose views in many ways ignore or affront the fundamental values of scientific inquiry&lt;/b&gt; and I greatly regret that I was not attuned to those issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fogel just shot way up in my esteem…and ouch, that has got to sting Stein&amp;#39;s well-padded keester.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/vogel_speaks.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/yK_N2xDPZs0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233627493571"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/whats_in_an_honorific.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/79e1d5091049cee3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academia"/><title type="html">What's in an honorific?</title><published>2009-02-03T01:59:08Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T01:59:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/CssFsiSRT6s/whats_in_an_honorific.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/whats_in_an_honorific.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It would seem that &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-dr-jill-biden2-2009feb02,0,548459.story"&gt;the &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;

it is dangerous&lt;/a&gt;.  Of course, it’s true—so is riding in a train, but it sure beats walking.  And that’s the danger of this particular fallacy—yes, medicine is a sharp tool, but it’s also an &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; tool, so we must use it properly.  And this is where the tools of evidence- and science-based medicine can give us a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential harms of modern medicine must be approached carefully.  If they are ignored or approached in an ineffective way, we’ll miss an opportunity to save lives.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/01/alternative_medicine---back_to.php#comment-1360968"&gt;This comment&lt;/a&gt; from my other blog is typical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You asked if so-called traditional Chinese medicine has ever eradicated any diseases. Well, yes. It pretty much eradicated one that is in epidemic numbers in the U.S. and most of the developed world: Iatrogenic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is wrong is so many ways.  The definition of “iatrogenic” is difficult.  The traditional definition is “adverse effects of medical treatment or advice.”  I suppose one could broaden this to include &lt;em&gt;failure&lt;/em&gt; to give proper advice, as &lt;em&gt;inaction&lt;/em&gt; by a physician has similar consequences to action, but perhaps that is a discussion for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way in which this is truly wrong is the false dichotomy. Yes, medical errors would be reduced to zero if we didn’t treat people, but the consequences would be rather dramatic.  Our goal should not be to abandon modern medicine because it sometimes causes harm.  Our goal is to reduce iatrogenic illness in a science-based way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, this is being done.  A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine (effectively discussed &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/surgical_checklists_as_a_strategy_to_reduce.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) described a study in which surgical checklists reduced errors.  This study was based on earlier work by Peter Provonost of Johns Hopkins, the subject of &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_gawande"&gt;a terrific piece in the New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;.  (Related commentary &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/01/when_human_subjects_protection_stifles_i.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is this:  intravenous  catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) often become infected.  While they are necessary for the delivery of medications and the monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, infections can be devastating.  This study made use of a large number of ICU beds (including 85% of ICU beds in my home state).  The project, called “Keystone”, asked the ICU staff to do one simple thing (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The study intervention targeted clinicians’ use of five evidence-based procedures recommended by the CDC and identified as having the greatest effect on the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection and the lowest barriers to implementation.&lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/26/2725#R1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The recommended procedures are &lt;strong&gt;hand washing&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;using full-barrier precautions&lt;/strong&gt; during the insertion of central venous catheters, &lt;strong&gt;cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;avoiding the femoral site if possible&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;removing unnecessary catheters&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategies to increase the use of these procedures have been&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;described elsewhere.&lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/26/2725#R10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Briefly, clinicians were educated about practices to control infection and harm resulting from catheter-related bloodstream infections, a central-line cart with necessary supplies was created,&lt;strong&gt; a checklist was used to ensure adherence to infection-control&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;practices&lt;/strong&gt;, providers were stopped (in nonemergency situations)&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;if these practices were not being followed, the removal of catheters&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;was discussed at daily rounds, and the teams received feedback&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;regarding the number and rates of catheter-related bloodstream&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;infection at monthly and quarterly meetings, respectively. In&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;April 2004, a letter and a baseline survey were sent to the&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;chief executive officers (CEOs) of the participating hospitals.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;The letter outlined the evidence supporting the use of chlorhexidine&lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/26/2725#R1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and asked the CEOs to stock chlorhexidine in their hospitals&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;before implementing the study intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A checklist was used.  Supplies were provided. Non-emergent procedures were stopped if procedures weren’t followed.  And a checklist was used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseline rate of catheter-related infections was about 2.7/1000 catheter days.  After implementation, the rate was zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular serious iatrogenic illness was effectively eradicated by a simple, easy-to-implement intervention.   My earlier commenter was correct; if we stop using modern medicine, we will have no iatrogenic disease.  We also will be left with a much sicker populace and a lower age of mortality.  It turns out we have a third path—use science-based medicine to solve the problem of iatrogenesis.  Not all problems will be solved so well as this one—there will always be some non-zero rate of serious medical complications, but as this study shows, it doesn’t always take a whole lot to make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

The radio interview is embedded below; to play the broadcast from its source page, see &lt;a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/12/05#segment114886"&gt;The Frowners&lt;/a&gt; about half way down the page. (I was not able to find a transcript for this broadcast and suspect one &lt;a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/tapestranscripts.html"&gt;may not exist&lt;/a&gt;--boo for lousy accessibility!)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a sweet little interview that's just neat to listen to, and I smiled more than once during it.  It also brings up some (to me anyway) really interesting questions about diagnosis--how it can hurt, how it can help, and how it can change lives for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confess to feeling more than a little kinship with Emanuel's story; my own story is in some ways similar.  And because of that, I too have explored many of the same questions that were brought up in the interview.  What did I gain from not being diagnosed as a child (back when dirt was young)--and what did I lose?  Considering when I was a child, if I'd been diagnosed at the time I most certainly would have at the very least been denied an education, and, well, that would have been that.  But a lot of bad came from not knowing too, both psychological damage and real survival risks that would have been avoided if I'd had proper support.  It would have been good for me if I'd been able to find "my people" sooner too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today some things are different from when I was a child, or from when Emanuel was a child.  Today there are some better educational opportunities for people on the spectrum (including &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/online_schools_naturally_accommodate"&gt;options for school from home&lt;/a&gt;).  But there are a lot of the same old problems too.  Diagnostic labels can be used to crush our potential just as easily as they can be used to help us realize our potential.  The world is still not very safe for those of us who are very different.  Let's keep working together to fix those problems.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, 1 of my readers sent me a link to &lt;a href="http://straightfromthesource.wordpress.com/"&gt;a site with President Fogel’s detailed responses to questions concerning this controversy&lt;/a&gt;. I for one am very happy with his responses and I would like to thank UVM President Fogel for his candor and for standing up for the academic community. Clearly, he respects science and understands how ignorant Ben Stein is with regards to science. And I even get the sense that he’s actually a sincere fan of Richard Dawkins. So my opinion is that the University of Vermont is fortunate to have Fogel respresenting their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also that ordinary one-dimensional strings don’t form knots in higher dimensions of space, so extra-dimensional bondage requires extended objects.  So really the guy in the cartoon should probably be “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Polchinski"&gt;Dr. Polchinski&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

Look in the Mirror at The Core Knowledge Blog&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;  The state of K-16 education in Nevada is where the public–that is you out there–has allowed it to sink. Your only relationship with the education system is to ship your unprepared kids to school not with the expectation of success, but with the demand that an education system, inadequately funded, develop and/or repair children that you as a parent did not prepare for school or support while your children attended school. If you want a competent and productive education system, tell your Governor and legislators to fund it. They do what they think you want them to do. That’s why they’re called public servants. It is the public–that means you– that has created this disaster of a public education system. 

It’s a blistering Jeremiad. Nevadans once hoped to see their kids go to college, but today are satisfied if their children graduate from eighth grade, Rogers says. And don’t blame educators for the state’s poor schools. The founder and owner of Sunbelt Communications Company, which owns and operates 16 NBC and FOX affiliate television stations in five western states, Rogers says when he became Nevada’s chancellor five years ago he came to the job with a sense that education was “an overweight, lazy, unproductive massive intellect, with no direction and little desire to get there fast.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233611011926"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/freerice.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/40ed20972efa4293</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cultural Criticism"/><title type="html">FreeRice</title><published>2009-02-02T20:59:32Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T20:59:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/freerice.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;a title="FreeRice" href="http://freerice.com/index.php"&gt;FreeRice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;is alsomst addictive</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233609898175"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/my_son_is_not_a_monster">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/854a01973bd19924</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">My Son Is Not a Monster</title><published>2009-02-02T21:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T21:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/my_son_is_not_a_monster" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/01/dan-real-story.html"&gt;&lt;img title="dan2 by Asperger Square 8" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/dan2-300x225.jpg" height="225" alt="" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Let me say it again: My son is not a monster. You know that as well as I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, on the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/advocacy_in_action_amp_adolescence"&gt;NYC subway Saturday night&lt;/a&gt;, after Charlie---two hoods (parka and sweatshirt) pulled over his head---boarded and made his way over to a seat beside a young woman in spike-heeled boots, a shopping bag from a fancy yoga clothing shop on her wrist, the young woman glanced at the woman beside her. The second woman wasted no time in moving to the end of the row of seats, and her friend slid quickly down and crossed her legs. Jim had already taken a seat opposite Charlie and shot me a look; I raised my eyebrows back and sat in between Charlie and the two women (who were now showing an amazing fascination about the anti-drug-ads posted near the ceiling). I gave Charlie a quick hug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call me over-sensitive. But, even if I wasn't Charlie's mother, I'd say that someone didn't want to sit next to him. Now that Charlie's older and taller, people seem to notice that he's "different." This has certainly made going out in public more (euphemism) &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;. I like to think the best of people but too often I suspect, they see Charlie as---ok, I'm just gonna say it---"too bad," "kind of slow," "a tragedy," "that must be very hard for you," "what a burden," "I feel very sorry for you." Etc., etc..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who gets to know my son knows that's all not the case. His teacher isn't saying "he is really smart" to make me feel better (she tells it to us like it is and we've told her, keep doing so, please). Charlie's a kid with a long long list struggles and challenges. He's the most social kid in his class, the only one who'd rather be doing things with the teachers and aides than plopping himself in front of a TV set to watch a video or play on the computer. He's affectionate and loves affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that's what you heard about autism and individuals on the autism spectrum, what would be your image of autism? Your understanding? Autism is not a death sentence. There is a lot on Charlie's life and our lives that is not easy, but there is so, so much hope, and I know this most when I'm with Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son is not a monster. But a recent ad campaign by the British charity &lt;a href="http://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/videos_gallery.aspx?assetcategoryID=87"&gt;Action for Children&lt;/a&gt; depicts autism as a monster that controls children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Simon Baron-Cohen has issued a &lt;a href="http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/02/professor-simon-baron-cohen-speaks.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; disagreeing with the campaign. You can read it on &lt;a href="http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/02/professor-simon-baron-cohen-speaks.html"&gt;The Voyage blog&lt;/a&gt; by Sharon Fennell.

I say &amp;quot;I think&amp;quot; because it was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; cool that even the usual exponential decay of excitement after a wonderful event still runs strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel, called &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/21/explore-cosmic-limits-with-me/"&gt;The Mysteries of the Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;, was all about the limits of what we know in astronomy. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/29/program-notes-for-the-pasadena-panel-tomorrow/"&gt;The panelists&lt;/a&gt; — Andrea Ghez, Mike Brown, Debra Fischer, and Saul Perlmutter — all study things at those limits: extrasolar planets, supermassive black holes, Kupier Belt objects, and the eventual fate of the Universe itself. I was the moderator, an honor I am still chuffed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day of the panel was fun. Discover Magazine, aka The Hive Overmind, was one of the sponsors, and will have a full spread on the panel in an upcoming issue. They wanted still photos of of all of us, so I got to be a model. Full makeup (using an airbrush, which was partially awesome and partially bizarre), eyebrow trim, pimple spackling, the whole works. Then lots of photos of me looking dorky, happy, dorky, pensive, dorky, dramatic, and then, finally, dorky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was whisked down to do a short series of video Q&amp;amp;A; the panel was to be taped, and they wanted some background material. That was fun, and having Mike Brown there behind the camera making faces at me helped.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then had a few hours off, and got some work done (no rest, ever, for the weary). Eventually the five of us were brought together for a splash picture for the magazine, done Vanity Fair style, which was fun. I don’t think I’ve ever posed on a ladder with another astronomer before. There &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; that time in the 80s when I needed the money, but I hardly think that counts…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it was time for the panel. I was surprised to find myself nervous! I give lots of public presentations, and I honestly haven’t been nervous to go onstage in years. I get excited, of course, but c’mon, butterflies in my stomach? &lt;em&gt;Please!&lt;/em&gt; On the other hand, there were quite a few friends in the audience, and the Overmind was depending on me to not totally screw this up, so yeah, I was nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that — and one or two fairly minor flubs on my part — I think it went really well. The four panelists were relaxed, happy, and did a great job with the questions I tossed at them. We then went for an audience Q&amp;amp;A that lasted about an hour, and that was &lt;em&gt;terrific&lt;/em&gt;. We had some fantastic questions, including several from little kids (like age 7 or so) that the panel handled wonderfully. My sense of the audience was that they really had a good time, got a lot of laughs, and learned a few things… which was precisely the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were at least 500 folks in the audience, including some BAtweeps, some old friends who came to see me, &lt;a href="http://www.jenniferouellette-writes.com/"&gt;Jennifer Ouellette&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/"&gt;Sean Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, and at least one actress. Who would that be, you wonder? Why, I’m glad you ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3248418792/sizes/l/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3330/3248418792_27b974ce3a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s &lt;a href="http://www.breagrant.com/"&gt;Brea Grant&lt;/a&gt;, from &amp;quot;Heroes&amp;quot;, who is something of an astronomy junkie. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/27/twitter-colossal-waste-of-time-or-most-colossal-waste-of-time/"&gt;I found out she follows me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and haven’t let my brother-in-law forget it ever since (he’s a big fan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I didn’t take many pictures. There really wasn’t much time for it, and most of what I have isn’t fit to publish (people caught in the act of talking, or blinking, or out of focus). When the event is covered in Discover I’m sure they’ll have great photos… and in fact, maybe I’m happy with that. I sometimes take too much time getting pictures when I should instead simply be enjoying the moment. That happened many times over the weekend, and I’m just happy to have been there and asked to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to Henry, Tricia, Jackie, Darlene, the folks from the NSF, Chuck, and of course Mike, Andrea, Debra, and Saul: thank you for everything. That was a fantastic day. I can’t wait to read the Discover article and see the video!&lt;/p&gt;

Testing their products for lead is just too expensive, they argue.  They have successfully lobbied to delay lead testing rules for children's toys.  Joseph Pereira and Melanie Trottman of the Journal &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123354219894838207.html"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Under pressure from manufacturers, federal regulators have postponed for one year certain testing requirements for lead and other toxic substances in toys and other children's products.

&lt;p&gt;But unless Congress acts, retailers and manufacturers still won't be allowed to sell products that don't comply with tougher lead standards that are set to take effect on Feb. 10. "Congress will need to address that issue -- the CPSC cannot," Nancy Nord, acting chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stay allows manufacturers, which have been hit hard by the recession, to put off costly product testing for levels of lead, used to stabilize the plastic in products, and phthalates, which are chemicals used to soften plastic. The testing rules were supposed to have taken effect on Feb. 10 as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let's just hope that there's no lead in the toys you buy your kids in the next year.  Oops, wait a minute.  There is lead in them.  All you have to do is test to find it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Friday, the Center for Environmental Health, an advocacy group in Oakland, Calif., said it found several Valentine's Day stuffed-animal toys sold by Rite Aid Corp. and Longs Drugs, a unit of CVS Caremark Corp., with lead exceeding the new national standards that take effect on Feb. 10. The lead levels found in one of the stuffed-animal toys were more than 15 times the new federal limit, the Center for Environmental Health said. "There should be something to back up a claim that the products are safe, but without testing and certification there's no assurance," said Charles Margulis, a spokesman for the group.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/lets_just_hope_theres_no_lead.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/V_Ccd6yBrzw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233607315299"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5838">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb54cc9e36ed5a51</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Sylvia Browne"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 2.2.09</title><published>2009-02-02T20:00:42Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T20:00:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5838" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eabf0397d6a4639a524a2211391c2d47&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It breaks my heart to bid you all farewell, but January is over and you must turn the page. Hopefully you will find Teek’s February semi-nudity to be as fulilling as mine was last month. (If you don’t know what I’m talking about, you don’t have a calendar and are totally missing out on some really hot skeptics. You might also not know that we’re in February, but we are.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as wonderful as Teek is, I’m missing you all terribly. Why don’t you cheer me up this afternoon? Given that Darwin’s birthday is coming this month, why don’t we go with a snarky young earth creation theme today?&lt;/p&gt;

Oto jego treść:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;Witam serdecznie,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chciałbym zwrócić Państwa uwagę na fakt, że 25 i 26 października na Uniwersytecie Warszawskim odbędzie się konferencja naukowa pt. „AUTISM AND VACCINATIONS: IS THERE A LINK?".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Z informacji zawartych na stronie reklamującej konferencję można się dowiedzieć, że głównymi gośćmi będą Dr Mark Geier i David Geier - jedni z najbardziej znanych przeciwników szczepień, uczestnicy procesów, w których domagano się odszkodowań za szkody jakie miały rzekomo wyrządzić szczepionki, badacze przeprowadzający wiele kontrowersyjnych metodologicznie i etycznie eksperymentów oraz właściciele firmy "leczącej" autyzm, który miał być rzekomo wywołany szczepieniami.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inni uczestnicy konferencji są również znani z wypowiedzi i prac wymierzonych przeciwko szczepieniom. Bardzo często są związani oni z kontrowersyjnymi organizacjami promującymi niesprawdzone terapie, które rzekomo mają leczyć autyzm lub promującymi szeroko pojętą&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;"medycynę" alternatywną.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Na wielu forach internetowych dla rodziców małych dzieci informacje o tej konferencji są podawane jako dowód na to, że ze szczepieniami "coś jest nie tak" i należy bronić się przed szczepieniem dzieci. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Czy w związku z tym Polskie Towarzystwo Wakcynologii ma zamiar przyjrzeć się tej sprawie bliżej i ewentualnie zbadać merytoryczną stronę tej konferencji?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oto adres strony: http://www.ipin.edu.pl/autism/page08.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Z wyrazami szacunku.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nie doczekałem się niestety żadnej odpowiedzi. Choć może nie do końca. Jak się okazało &lt;a href="http://ptwakc.org.pl/"&gt;Polskie Towarzystwo Wakcynologiczne&lt;/a&gt; wystosowało &lt;a href="http://www.wsse.gorzow.pl/pssenowasol/download.php?what=news/tresc_listu_protestacyjnegp.pdf"&gt;list protestacyjny&lt;/a&gt; do organizatorki tej konferencji (&lt;a href="http://www.ipin.edu.pl/autism/index.html"&gt;prof. Marii Doroty Majewskiej)&lt;/a&gt;, w której krytykują jej wypowiedzi medialne na temat szczepień i charakter zorganizowanego przez nią spotkania. Oto próbka:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Chcemy podkreślić, że osoba zatrudniona w państwowej instytucji naukowo-badawczej i naukowiec z tytułem profesora wypowiadając się publicznie i tak jednoznacznie na tematy medyczne, musi opierać stwierdzenia na rzetelnej analizie systematycznie zebranych wszystkich danych naukowych o najwyższej z dostępnych wiarygodności (badania kliniczne z randomizacją lub badania obserwacyjne analityczne: kohortowe, kliniczno‑kontrolne, lub ich metaanalizy) i nie mylić hipotezy badawczej z dowodem naukowym. Każda hipoteza wymaga bowiem udowodnienia w badaniach, których metodyka musi być adekwatnie dobrana do rodzaju pytania klinicznego. Ignorowanie najbardziej wiarygodnych z dostępnych i aktualnych wyników badań klinicznych oraz wybiórcze przedstawianie danych należy uznać za przejaw nierzetelności naukowej. Nie można również publicznie epatować hipotetyczną szkodliwością szczepień, bez wspomnienia o realnym ryzyku poważnych konsekwencji wynikających z rezygnacji z tej najbardziej efektywnej metody profilaktyki chorób infekcyjnych.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Oraz:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Zdecydowanie protestujemy także przeciwko formule konferencji, którą Pani zorganizowała w dniach 25 i 26 października w Instytucie Psychiatrii i Neurologii w Warszawie pt. „Autism and vaccinations: is there a link?” Jednostronny, tendencyjny dobór tematów i wykładowców (zwłaszcza gości zagranicznych znanych jako zdeklarowani przeciwnicy szczepień, ignorujących rzetelne badania naukowe) uniemożliwił rzeczową i obiektywną dyskusję o problemie autyzmu i szczepieniach opartą na systematycznej analizie najbardziej wiarygodnych z dostępnych danych naukowych, a konferencja stała się festiwalem ruchów antyszczepionkowych, których celem jest szerzenie irracjonalnego strachu przed szczepieniami. Niestety taki przekaz dzięki wypowiedziom wykładowców towarzyszył również doniesieniom medialnym o tej konferencji (m.in. w TVN), a fakt, że zorganizowano ją w państwowym instytucie naukowo‑badawczym zwiększył tylko zaniepokojenie rodziców dzieci w Polsce, co może zaowocować zmniejszeniem zaufania do jednej z najbardziej efektywnych metod walki z poważnymi chorobami zakaźnymi, jakimi są szczepienia. Przypominamy, że podjęta przez rodziców pod wpływem echa Państwa konferencji i fałszywych przesłanek decyzja o rezygnacji ze szczepienia naraża dziecko nad realne ryzyko zachorowania i poważnych powikłań chorób infekcyjnych, którym można zapobiegać za pomocą szczepień. Czy etycznym jest wprowadzanie w błąd naszych pacjentów, granie na ich emocjach i manipulowanie nimi? Oparty na hipotezach, domysłach, nierzetelnych badaniach i wybiórczej analizie danych naukowych kuriozalny apel organizatorów do Ministra Zdrowia o zmniejszenie liczby szczepień w Programie Szczepień Ochronnych jest dowodem skrajnej nieodpowiedzialności.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Brawo, brawo! Bardzo polecam lekturę &lt;a href="http://www.wsse.gorzow.pl/pssenowasol/download.php?what=news/tresc_listu_protestacyjnegp.pdf"&gt;całego tekstu&lt;/a&gt;, gdzie mowa o dziesiątkach badań, które stwierdzają jednoznacznie o brak związku między szczepieniami i autyzmem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bardzo się cieszę, że PTW zauważyło problem i zdecydowało się zaregować. Mam nadzieję, że telewizja TVN również otrzymała kopię tego tekstu i następnym razem zastanowi sie dwa razy zanim w swojej naiwności nada ponownie materiał dający głos medycznemu marginesowi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nie mam natomiast złudzeń co do tego, że któryś z zatwardziałych antyszczepieniowców zmieni zdanie po lekturze tego listu lub choćby poszukał badań, o których w nim mowa. Z szybkiej lektury niektórych for internetowych wynika, że pani prof. Majewska będzie postrzegana jako męczennik za sprawę, prześladowany przez medyczny i farmaceutyczny establishment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>Modne Bzdury</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233606770979"><id gr:original-id="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/?p=176">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/320dfd8a58aec42a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Xocai Acai Rubbish</title><published>2009-02-02T15:04:52Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T15:04:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/xocai-acai-rubbish/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">[BPSDB]I just followed a bad science link to the Xocai chocolate website.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once one of the nation's most popular televangelists, the Rev. Robert H. Schuller is watching his life's work crumble.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His son and recent successor, the Rev. Robert A. Schuller, has abruptly resigned as senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. The shimmering, glass-walled megachurch is home to the "Hour of Power" broadcast, an evangelism staple that's been on the air for more than three decades.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The church is in financial turmoil: It plans to sell more than $65 million worth of its Orange County property to pay off debt. Revenue dropped by nearly $5 million last year, according to a recent letter from the elder Schuller to elite donors. In the letter, Schuller Sr. implored the Eagle's Club members - who supply 30 percent of the church's revenue - for donations and hinted that the show might go off the air without their support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not just Schuller!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's increasingly fragmented media landscape is also to blame, said Quentin Schultze, a Calvin College professor who specializes in Christian media.
Church-based televangelism led by powerful personalities filled TV in the 1980s, but now only a handful of shows remain, he said. Among the struggling ministries are those of Oral Roberts and the late D. James Kennedy of "The Coral Ridge Hour" TV show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, I dream of a day when all of the churches are in collapse. Unfortunately, the article doesn't say that the loss of attendees is because of growing enlightenment: it's because these organizations are dependent on the personal charisma of their leaders, and when they go, people just go searching for another happy sheep-fleecer. It's still a start, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/cheerful_news_of_the_day.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/xcrjl0lAvto" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233605434528"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3797">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cae9fa48b3f0fab0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="contest"/><category term="motto"/><category term="schwag"/><title type="html">Contest: A New Six-Word Motto for the U.S. (Again)</title><published>2009-02-02T20:01:11Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T20:01:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/D1j41fA1zbQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/contest-a-new-six-word-motto-for-the-us-again/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">One year ago, we ran a simple contest on this blog: come up with a new six-word motto for the U.S. There were more than 1,000 submissions, a heated runoff between the finalists, and eventually a winner: "Our worst critics prefer to stay."

&lt;p&gt;Title of Event: Rob Dunn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NCSU ecology professor Rob Dunn will discuss and sign copies of his new book, Every Living Thing: Man's Obsessive Quest to Catalog Life, from Nanobacteria to New Monkeys. Dunn, an engaging science popularizer, tells the exhilarating story of humanity's quest to discover everything about our natural world from the unimaginably small in the most inhospitable of places on earth to the unimaginably far away in the unexplored canals on Mars. For more information see the &lt;a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rrdunn/index.htm" title=""&gt;author's website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the book descripiton:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Biologists and laypeople alike have repeatedly claimed victory over life. A thousand years ago we thought we knew almost everything; a hundred years ago, too. But even today, Rob Dunn argues, discoveries we can't yet imagine still await.

&lt;p&gt;In a series of vivid portraits of single-minded scientists, Dunn traces the history of human discovery, from the establishment of classification in the eighteenth century to today's attempts to find life in space. The narrative telescopes from a scientist's attempt to find one single thing (a rare ant-emulating beetle species) to another scientist's attempt to find everything in a small patch of jungle in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. With poetry and humor, Dunn reminds readers how tough and exhilarating it is to study the natural world, and why it matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/every_living_thing_mans_obsess.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ZLkDxTrJf-4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233603483296"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/augmentative-and-alternative-communication-aac-from-teaching-learners-with-multiple-special-needs.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1923cd9ae5aba31f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Learning Disabilities"/><title type="html">Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) from Teaching Learners with Multiple Special Needs</title><published>2009-02-02T19:19:39Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T19:19:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/augmentative-and-alternative-communication-aac-from-teaching-learners-with-multiple-special-needs.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I really didn&amp;#39;t know much about AAC before I read &lt;a href="http://www.schuylersmonsterblog.com/"&gt;Rob Rummel-Hudson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s book,&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Schuylers-Monster-Fathers-Wordless-Daughter/dp/0312538804?&amp;amp;camp=212361&amp;amp;linkCode=wey&amp;amp;tag=schusmons-20&amp;amp;creative=380733"&gt; Schuyler&amp;#39;s Monster.&lt;/a&gt;  Here&amp;#39;s an introduction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we all have heard the rumor that some people believe implementation of AAC will impede speech development in people with developmental disabilities, most of us know this is not true. In fact most studies, as show by this frequently cited meta-analysis, indicate that speech production will either not change or will increase. Increased verbal production is by far the more likely of the two!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233603370684"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3873">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9fa8978fce3e1376</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="airlines"/><category term="Behavioral Economics"/><category term="default"/><title type="html">Airlines and Opting Ethics</title><published>2009-02-03T22:09:32Z</published><updated>2009-02-03T22:09:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/PWOjNuVsduY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/airlines-and-opting-ethics/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Here's a post with my co-author and colleague at Yale Law School, Jonathan Macey.

Inclement weather delayed my flight, but the taxi driver who took me into town was a clement man and we had a nice chat. I have located my friend Howard Williams and my room on campus, and I expect to have a login for the ambient wifi there soon. Wifi is not a common offering in UK cafés though -- took me a while to find one that had it among the quaint shops of central Chestah. Have started to make friends with the staff and faculty, and been reunited with a number of my co-diggers from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/09/digging_starts_at_sattuna.php"&gt;four months ago&lt;/a&gt; at Sättuna. Tonight I'm having dinner at the Williams mansion in rural Wales, a storied country that I've never visited before. My ideas about it are coloured by Lloyd Alexander, Howard Marks, the &lt;i&gt;Mabinogion&lt;/i&gt; and the Super Furry Animals.

If this pattern keeps up a "Monday Potpourri" may become a regular feature here...  Last week's items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. A Massachusetts teen has been creating picture cards for autistic children to use with first responders, as &lt;a href="http://www.patriotledger.com/news/x1378224436/Pembroke-teenager-works-to-help-autistic-children-communicate"&gt;reported in the Patriot Ledger&lt;/a&gt;.  The teen is also working on a binder to help police find lost autistic children (what about other kids who may wander?).  Training is also being provided "to first responders so they were able to recognize situations involving children and adults with autism."  This issue of emergency personnel re. autistics is truly a critical issue, and the reason why this article never made it into a main post is that I ended up creating these horrible multi-page out of control drafts on it.  Clearly, emergency response is something I'll need to address coherently in the future (and in multiple small, actually readable, pieces).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The &lt;a href="http://www.politickernj.com/voss-schaer-mckeon-adults-autism-task-force-bill-signed-law-11679"&gt;New Jersey Adults with Autism Task Force (NJAATF)&lt;/a&gt; has put up an &lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=x33lcx4bxbMZ6Bwm55ApOQ_3d_3d"&gt;online survey&lt;/a&gt; with the statement, "The purpose of the NJAATF is to develop a comprehensive and actionable plan for meeting the various needs of adults with autism living in the State of New Jersey. This survey will provide valuable insight in forming the recommendations included in this plan."  Super nifty idea (you can only take the survey if you live in the state of New Jersey).  Perhaps a good model for other states to follow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In a little &lt;a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/autism-kids-one-2295344-social-children"&gt;interview for the Orange County Register&lt;/a&gt;, UCLA education professor &lt;a href="http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/members/kasari"&gt;Connie Kasari&lt;/a&gt; discussed her recent research showing, "The best way to help autistic students fit in at school is by training the child's typical peers."  I did go looking for the primary source, but the research does not appear to have been published yet (likely one of the "in press" articles listed on Kasari's site), so there's not a whole lot else to say (yet).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233599343039"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/76c3d593072a7517</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Two big TAM news items!</title><published>2009-02-02T17:54:05Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T17:54:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/419-two-big-tam-news-items.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have two big TAM-related news items for you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TAM 7 will be from July 9 - 12, 2009 at &lt;a href="http://www.southpointcasino.com/"&gt;the South Point Hotel and Casino&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas, Nevada. As always, we have a fantastic lineup of guest speakers, including Mythbuster &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/meet/adam-savage.html"&gt;Adam Savage&lt;/a&gt;, skeptical investigator &lt;a href="http://www.joenickell.com/"&gt;Joe Nickell&lt;/a&gt;, science writer and head of the Science and Entertainment Exchange &lt;a href="http://www.jenniferouellette-writes.com/"&gt;Jennifer Ouellette&lt;/a&gt;, and of course our very own Phil Plait and the head guy himself, James Randi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also very pleased to announce that our keynote speaker is Bill Prady, Executive Producer of the hit TV show &lt;a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/big_bang_theory/"&gt;"The Big Bang Theory."&lt;/a&gt; Bill is a science and scifi buff, and The Big Bang Theory has done a great (and hilarious) job of mainstreaming science and scientists on television. He'll be speaking on how the show got on the air, how they portray science, and what the environment is like in Hollywood for science-minded programming.&lt;/p&gt;

I loved it, and I’m really glad (s)he liked the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have to give the edge to Joanne from &lt;a href="http://www.joannelovesscience.com/"&gt;Joanne Loves Science&lt;/a&gt;. She put together &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv5bDogUrl0"&gt;a video review&lt;/a&gt;, which is pretty cool. She does reviews of books and such for her students, and clearly is passionate about science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of her review (about five minutes in) is when she talks about why I don’t have any math in the book. She’s precisely right about that. It would’ve cut book sales in half. &lt;/p&gt;

I completed a B.S. in Chemistry with Honors there and then I stayed on to do obtain my M.D. Several of my longtime friendships were forged or solidified during those years. Consequently, I still care about the place. That's why it distresses me when I see my alma mater shoots itself in the foot. Now, I'll grant you that what I'm about to discuss probably doesn't bother me as much as the plight of the Michigan Wolverines bothers me, given that never before in my life (at least not since I was old enough to pay attention), have the Wolverines sucked so hard for an entire season. Given that level of utter hopeless suckitude, though, I consider it even more important that my alma mater not provide any more ammunition to those who would enjoy making fun of it. It doesn't matter to me that I never went to law school at Michigan; it's all part of the same campus to me, and it's bad enough that Ann Coulter attended law school there at almost the same time I was attending medical school there. She was even an editor of the &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt;, this time around the embarrassment comes in the form of an &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=217"&gt;article in that august journal&lt;/a&gt; by a person who has previously been a subject of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_warrior.php"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_to_the_stars.php"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;. I'm referring to &lt;a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, who has been--correctly, I believe--labeled as being, if not &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;fully anti-vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, at least a prominent and major &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_to_the_stars.php"&gt;apologist for the anti-vaccine movement&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, because he is the pediatrician taking care of Jenny McCarthy's son Evan, he has gained even greater prominence in the antivaccine movement than ever, to the point where he gave a speech last summer to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=139"&gt;antivaccine "Green Our Vaccines" march on Washington&lt;/a&gt; and where he is regularly called up by TV producers to give a false "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/run_dont_walk_from_these_doctors.php"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt;" whenever a discussion of vaccines and/or autism comes up. He also wrote the foreword to Jenny McCarthy's latest paean to autism quackery and attack on vaccines as the cause of autism in which he blithely repeated some of the worst distortions of the antivaccine movement. Unfortunately, Dr. Gordon lacks the intestinal fortitude to stop  the piteous denials any time he is called out for his parroting of antivaccine pseudsocience and to embrace his inner antivaccinationist. Then, at least, we wouldn't be treated to the spectacle of his simultaneously claiming he is "pro-safe vaccine, not anti-vaccine" while at the same time saying he "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;doesn't give a lot of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;" and admitting that parents have actually &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bookclub/2008/10/finally_science_pushes_back_ag.php#comment-1135651"&gt;had to persuade him to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what was the topic of the &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt; article that Dr. Gordon was apparently asked to pen? It's actually an interesting question from a legal, political and civil rights standpoint, specifically: Whether or not parents should be held legally liable for refusing to vaccinate their children. Not surprisingly, Dr. Gordon takes the "no" position. Unfortunately, as we've come to expect of Dr. Gordon, in doing so he uses a number of highly dubious arguments. However, more interesting to me, having had a nearly four year history sparring online with him off and on, was the seemingly "kinder and gentler" antivaccine stance that he took in this article. What I rapidly realized, though, was that underneath that seemingly "kinder and gentler" demeanor was the same old apologist for die-hard antivaccinationists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, let's take a look at the debate. The symposium published in &lt;em&gt;First Impressions&lt;/em&gt; (the online companion to the &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt;) is entitled &lt;a href="http://www.michiganlawreview.org/firstimpressions/vol107/vaccination.pdf"&gt;Liability for Exercising Personal Belief Exemptions from Vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and it contained the following articles:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_get_away_from_my_alma_mate.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_get_away_from_my_alma_mate.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/B15XbSvuAJM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233597926591"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4086">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/903fbf24e708df48</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="1000words" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="1000 words"/><category term="natureimages" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="nature images"/><title type="html">Periophthalmus chrysospilos</title><published>2009-02-02T18:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-06T05:41:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/periophthalmus.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo by Kelly Lyon&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="http://kellylyonphotography.com" rel="external "&gt;&lt;a href="http://kellylyonphotography.com" rel="external "&gt;http://kellylyonphotography.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Isn't it amazing that someone like Darwin is celebrated for his thoughts. Evolution is bunk! I am not a creationist either. But to evolve an animal had to make a conscious decision. An example: a fish had to decide that land was the next place it was going to make its home. How many fish had to make that decision and how many realized they would have to die before their gills evolved into lungs? Yet there are people who actually believe in evolution. Somebody is not thinking things through.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way to combat the stereotype that personal trainers aren't that bright!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, the only show that rises to this challenge is &lt;a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/numb3rs/"&gt;NUMB3RS&lt;/a&gt;, the CBS drama featuring Charlie Epps, a math professor at a suspiciously Caltech-esque university who teams up with his FBI-agent brother to solve crimes.  The shows creators, Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, had a goal from the beginning of creating an entertaining hour of television that would involve science in an intimate way.  (I suppose math is almost as good.)  As part of the effort, they’ve partnered with &lt;a href="http://numb3rs.wolfram.com/"&gt;Wolfram Research&lt;/a&gt; to follow each episode with a web page delving into the various mathematical concepts that were discussed, including Mathematica notebooks to illustrate the various ideas: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href="http://numb3rs.wolfram.com/"&gt;The Math Behind NUMB3RS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 11 this year was entitled “The Arrow of Time.”  Here’s the opening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the full episode &lt;a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/numb3rs/video/video.php?cid=446410306&amp;amp;pid=hPpMG_nSKA9Hc6P8NViazPfgv2Z0Q7VM&amp;amp;category=popular&amp;amp;play=true"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; the math page is &lt;a href="http://numb3rs.wolfram.com/511/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Top-of-the-line models were available for $600, and they were on sale: "Buy one, get one free." I was going to buy one even without the sale, and $600 was about what I wanted to spend. But I have almost no use for the "free" suit; I derive little consumer surplus even from a "free" second new suit.

One was grey, black and white, and we called him Batman. Two were ginger, and I don't remember what we called them, but the neighbour who took one of them in called him Sophus. He grew up to become a fine tomcat and a great hunter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophus and his owner lived on the ground floor with a little garden on the edge of a park. So the cat would come home with prey and lay it at his owner's feet. There were birds, including the fast ones, and small rodents. Sophus was good. But hunting wasn't always good. After his second-worst day in that park, Sophus came home with an earthworm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his blackest day ever, Sophus the cat came home with a potato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; depression. You’d have one too if you had a great gaping pit on your surface that seems to defy explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3246779424/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3350/3246779424_66c0df6886.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bowl-shaped pit on Mars. Click to brobdignangify (or &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005813_2150_anacut_b.jpg"&gt;get the original version&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br&gt;Courtesy NASA/JPL/University of Arizona.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; in 3D? Use red/green glasses (red on the left) to see this in all its bichromatic anaglyphic glory. &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005813_2150"&gt;This is a red/green stereo pair&lt;/a&gt; from the HiRISE camera onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, my favorite camera in the solar system right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This crater-like feature is located in what’s thought to be a mud flow, near a volcano. It’s almost certainly not an impact crater, since it lacks many of the features associated with impacts (no raised rim, for example). It looks like the surface collapsed, which makes some sense. There could have been water or ice under it, and some volcanic event happened to remove it, which also removed the support. &lt;em&gt;Whoomf!&lt;/em&gt; Sink hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentric rings are common in such things, due to the way the material falls in on itself (watch a video of an ant lion digging a pit in sand and you’ll see similar features). But if you look around it, you see radial features called rays. Those are &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; due to impact events which throw out streamers of materials! But rays are also usually thin, a layer of dust coating the surface. These rays have depth and width, as if they are from something flowing out of the pit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m no geomorphologist, so I’m guessing, but I wonder if the collapse of the denser surface forced lower density water up, filling the depression with water and making it overflow the pit. Think of jamming a sock into a nearly full glass to get the picture. Or maybe water was squeezed out of the layers just below the surface, and it flowed away, boiling in the low pressure. What a sight that would be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s all that easy to say exactly what happened here. But the 3D view might give scientists some insight into what happened here — it provides them with the angle of the sloping sides, for example, as well as how much volume was lost, which can be used to get information about the collapsed material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you didn’t notice, the rippling in the very center? Those are &lt;em&gt;sand dunes&lt;/em&gt;. So very cool.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233585003492"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/celebrating_the_year_of_scienc.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f2d4a56a868ad566</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogospheric science"/><title type="html">Celebrating the Year of Science.</title><published>2009-02-02T13:19:40Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T13:19:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/_WyJVbGrab0/celebrating_the_year_of_scienc.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/celebrating_the_year_of_scienc.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/upload/2009/02/yos3.jpg" width="252" height="86" alt="yos3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Some of you may be aware that, at least in certain corners of the blogosphere, November is celebrated as &lt;a href="http://whatis-wrong-withyou.blogspot.com/2007/10/inadwrimo-2007.html"&gt;International acaDemic Writing Month&lt;/a&gt;.  Indeed, in November 2007 I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/11/inadwrimo_help_me_get_writing.php"&gt;jumped onboard the InaDWriMo bandwagon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past November I did not, largely because my November usually turns out to be a ridiculous month for serious writing.  There's Thanksgiving and the attendant food-related preparation activities, plus the run up to the December holidays.  Also, this year my kids were still playing soccer into December (which is what you get for being too successful in your weekly games), so I was tangled up in that.  And the days getting shorter and colder did not help one bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holidays are behind us now, and there's still academic writing to be done.  At &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencewomen/"&gt;ScienceWoman's&lt;/a&gt; urging (what is it with her?), I'm going to invite others who may have sat out the November frenzy of academic writing to join me in using February and March to try to establish some sort of regular writing groove.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/finding_my_academic_writing_gr.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/finding_my_academic_writing_gr.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/QuEG5j5vYNg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233584893647"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5827">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/06d729a54850ec99</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Contests"/><title type="html">Whoops!

Elyse and I are very sorry about leaving you all hanging in the contest department and have vowed to make 2009 a great year for contests! We are filled with that can-do spirit (and possibly vodka).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February is a very important, special month for us skeptics, so the theme for the contest is, of course, going to be Darwin-tastic. You remember the Darwinian Pick-up Lines? Or The Darwinian Valentine’s Day cards? Well this contest continues in the same vein (sort of):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix Your Darwinian iTunes (or other music player) Playlist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the scoop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give us a list of your top ten picks of songs you think best represent Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much the only rule. Simple yet effective!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entries need to be in by Feb 12th and on Feb 14th, Elyse and I will pick a winner and shower them with candy and love*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your entries in the comment section as usual. Can’t wait to see your playlists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*love will most likely be in the form of candy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jill</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233584893645"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5831">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5b13b239377119ed</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 2.2</title><published>2009-02-02T14:00:20Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T14:00:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5831" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Much of science and skepticism, in fact, is the art and logic of arguing, and most of these blog posts on NeuroLogica are just long written arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/articles.asp?id=38"&gt;How to argue&lt;/a&gt; logically is therefore one of the core intellectual skill-sets of scientific skepticism. It is why skeptics will frequently whip out their logical fallacy detectors when arguing with defenders of not-so-critical thinking or true-beliefs. Even in everyday conversations we commit and encounter countless errors in logic. It is therefore highly valuable to be familiar with the common ways in which human logic goes astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the internet has resulted in an explosion of human communication, especially, it seems, arguing. Much of the social constraints are lifted when typing over the intertubes under a pseudonym. Knowledge of good and bad arguing are therefore more essential than ever for the computer literati and wannabe internet flame warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently was pointed to &lt;a href="http://www.indiauncut.com/iublog/article/38-ways-to-win-an-argument-arthur-schopenhauer/"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;, which reprints an internet meme that has been going around for a while.  It presents &lt;em&gt;38 Ways To Win An Argument&lt;/em&gt; by Arthur Schopenhauer, and offers advice on how to intentionally use logical fallacies in order to flummox your opponent, deceive your audience, and thereby win arguments. The person who pointed me to that website, however, missed the fact that the advice is satirical - it is meant to expose these tactics, not recommend them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the author of this list is not really Arthur Schopenhaur, but is a modern adaptation of his writing. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"&gt;Arthur Schopenhaur&lt;/a&gt; was a German philosopher who lived from 1788-1860. He was a rationalist and logician. What he did write was a book called The Art of Controversy - here is a &lt;a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/controversy/complete.html"&gt;free 0nline English translation&lt;/a&gt; (another wonder of the internet).  In this book Schopenhaur does indeed review the tactics of deceitful and fallacious arguments, but he does not frame them as satirical advice. He is exposing them in a straightforward fashion, giving examples of each. The prose is also more typical of what we would expect from a 19th century philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first section Schopenhaur gives some background on the nature of logic and discourse. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logic, therefore, as the science of thought, or the science of the process of pure reason, should be capable of being constructed à priori. Dialectic, for the most part, can be constructed only à posteriori; that is to say, we may learn its rules by an experiential knowledge of the disturbance which pure thought suffers through the difference of individuality manifested in the intercourse between two rational beings, and also by acquaintance with the means which disputants adopt in order to make good against one another their own individual thought, and to show that it is pure and objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While logic is pure and based entirely on first principles, argument is partly a learned and quirky human endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section titled &lt;em&gt;Stratagems&lt;/em&gt; is the part that was adapted to the 38 Ways to Win an Argument. Here is the first translated directly from Schopenhaur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Extension&lt;/em&gt;.—This consists in carrying your opponent’s proposition beyond its natural limits; in giving it as general a signification and as wide a sense as possible, so as to exaggerate it; and, on the other hand, in giving your own proposition as restricted a sense and as narrow limits as you can, because the more general a statement becomes, the more numerous are the objections to which it is open. The defence consists in an accurate statement of the point or essential question at issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then follows with specific examples. And here is the modern adaptation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Carry your opponent’s proposition beyond its natural limits; exaggerate it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The more general your opponent’s statement becomes, the more objections you can find against it.&lt;br&gt;
The more restricted and narrow your own propositions remain, the easier they are to defend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know who originally wrote the adaption, as every reference I could find credits Schopenhaur for writing it (if someone finds a reference let me know). I therefore assume this is open-access internet content, and for convenience reproduce the entire list below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth a read, as is Schopenhaur’s much longer original. It is time worth dedicating to perfecting skills in logic and discourse, especially in this age of internet skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——————————————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38 Ways To Win An Argument&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Adapted from The Art of Controversy by Arthur Schopenhauer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Carry your opponent’s proposition beyond its natural limits; exaggerate it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The more general your opponent’s statement becomes, the more objections you can find against it.&lt;br&gt;
The more restricted and narrow your own propositions remain, the easier they are to defend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Use different meanings of your opponent’s words to refute his argument.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: Person A says, “You do not understand the mysteries of Kant’s philosophy.”&lt;br&gt;
Person B replies, “Oh, if it’s mysteries you’re talking about, I’ll have nothing to do with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Ignore your opponent’s proposition, which was intended to refer to some particular thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rather, understand it in some quite different sense, and then refute it.&lt;br&gt;
Attack something different than what was asserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Hide your conclusion from your opponent until the end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mingle your premises here and there in your talk.&lt;br&gt;
Get your opponent to agree to them in no definite order.&lt;br&gt;
By this circuitous route you conceal your goal until you have reached all the admissions necessary to reach your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Use your opponent’s beliefs against him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If your opponent refuses to accept your premises, use his own premises to your advantage.&lt;br&gt;
Example, if the opponent is a member of an organization or a religious sect to which you do not belong, you may employ the declared opinions of this group against the opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 Confuse the issue by changing your opponent’s words or what he or she seeks to prove.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: Call something by a different name: “good repute” instead of “honor,” “virtue” instead of “virginity,” “red-blooded” instead of “vertebrates”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 State your proposition and show the truth of it by asking the opponent many questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By asking many wide-reaching questions at once, you may hide what you want to get admitted.&lt;br&gt;
Then you quickly propound the argument resulting from the proponent’s admissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Make your opponent angry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An angry person is less capable of using judgment or perceiving where his or her advantage lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 Use your opponent’s answers to your question to reach different or even opposite conclusions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 If your opponent answers all your questions negatively and refuses to grant you any points, ask him or her to concede the opposite of your premises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This may confuse the opponent as to which point you actually seek him to concede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 If the opponent grants you the truth of some of your premises, refrain from asking him or her to agree to your conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Later, introduce your conclusions as a settled and admitted fact.&lt;br&gt;
Your opponent and others in attendance may come to believe that your conclusion was admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 If the argument turns upon general ideas with no particular names, you must use language or a metaphor that is favorable to your proposition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: What an impartial person would call “public worship” or a “system of religion” is described by an adherent as “piety” or “godliness” and by an opponent as “bigotry” or “superstition.”&lt;br&gt;
In other words, insert what you intend to prove into the definition of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 To make your opponent accept a proposition, you must give him an opposite, counter-proposition as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If the contrast is glaring, the opponent will accept your proposition to avoid being paradoxical.&lt;br&gt;
Example: If you want him to admit that a boy must to everything that his father tells him to do, ask him, “whether in all things we must obey or disobey our parents.”&lt;br&gt;
Or , if a thing is said to occur “often” you are to understand few or many times, the opponent will say “many.”&lt;br&gt;
It is as though you were to put gray next to black and call it white; or gray next to white and call it black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 Try to bluff your opponent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If he or she has answered several of your question without the answers turning out in favor of your conclusion, advance your conclusion triumphantly, even if it does not follow.&lt;br&gt;
If your opponent is shy or stupid, and you yourself possess a great deal of impudence and a good voice, the technique may succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 If you wish to advance a proposition that is difficult to prove, put it aside for the moment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Instead, submit for your opponent’s acceptance or rejection some true proposition, as though you wished to draw your proof from it.&lt;br&gt;
Should the opponent reject it because he suspects a trick, you can obtain your triumph by showing how absurd the opponent is to reject an obviously true proposition.&lt;br&gt;
Should the opponent accept it, you now have reason on your side for the moment.&lt;br&gt;
You can either try to prove your original proposition, as in #14, maintain that your original proposition is proved by what your opponent accepted.&lt;br&gt;
For this an extreme degree of impudence is required, but experience shows cases of it succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16 When your opponent puts forth a proposition, find it inconsistent with his or her other statements, beliefs, actions or lack of action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: Should your opponent defend suicide, you may at once exclaim, “Why don’t you hang yourself?”&lt;br&gt;
Should the opponent maintain that his city is an unpleasant place to live, you may say, “Why don’t you leave on the first plane?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 If your opponent presses you with a counter-proof, you will often be able to save yourself by advancing some subtle distinction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Try to find a second meaning or an ambiguous sense for your opponent’s idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 If your opponent has taken up a line of argument that will end in your defeat, you must not allow him to carry it to its conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Interrupt the dispute, break it off altogether, or lead the opponent to a different subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19 Should your opponent expressly challenge you to produce any objection to some definite point in his argument, and you have nothing to say, try to make the argument less specific.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: If you are asked why a particular hypothesis cannot be accepted, you may speak of the fallibility of human knowledge, and give various illustrations of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 If your opponent has admitted to all or most of your premises, do not ask him or her directly to accept your conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rather, draw the conclusion yourself as if it too had been admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 When your opponent uses an argument that is superficial and you see the falsehood, you can refute it by setting forth its superficial character.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But it is better to meet the opponent with a counter-argument that is just as superficial, and so dispose of him.&lt;br&gt;
For it is with victory that you are concerned, not with truth.&lt;br&gt;
Example: If the opponent appeals to prejudice, emotion or attacks you personally, return the attack in the same manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22 If your opponent asks you to admit something from which the point in dispute will immediately follow, you must refuse to do so, declaring that it begs the question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23 Contradiction and contention irritate a person into exaggerating their statements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By contradicting your opponent you may drive him into extending the statement beyond its natural limit.&lt;br&gt;
When you then contradict the exaggerated form of it, you look as though you had refuted the original statement.&lt;br&gt;
Contrarily, if your opponent tries to extend your own statement further than your intended, redefine your statement’s limits and say, “That is what I said, no more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 State a false syllogism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your opponent makes a proposition, and by false inference and distortion of his ideas you force from the proposition other propositions that are not intended and that appear absurd.&lt;br&gt;
It then appears that opponent’s proposition gave rise to these inconsistencies, and so appears to be indirectly refuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25 If your opponent is making a generalization, find an instance to the contrary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Only one valid contradiction is needed to overthrow the opponent’s proposition.&lt;br&gt;
Example: “All ruminants are horned,” is a generalization that may be upset by the single instance of the camel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26 A brilliant move is to turn the tables and use your opponent’s arguments against himself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: Your opponent declares: “so and so is a child, you must make an allowance for him.”&lt;br&gt;
You retort, “Just because he is a child, I must correct him; otherwise he will persist in his bad habits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27 Should your opponent surprise you by becoming particularly angry at an argument, you must urge it with all the more zeal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No only will this make your opponent angry, but it will appear that you have put your finger on the weak side of his case, and your opponent is more open to attack on this point than you expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28 When the audience consists of individuals (or a person) who is not an expert on a subject, you make an invalid objection to your opponent who seems to be defeated in the eyes of the audience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This strategy is particularly effective if your objection makes your opponent look ridiculous or if the audience laughs.&lt;br&gt;
If your opponent must make a long, winded and complicated explanation to correct you, the audience will not be disposed to listen to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29 If you find that you are being beaten, you can create a diversion–that is, you can suddenly begin to talk of something else, as though it had a bearing on the matter in dispute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This may be done without presumption if the diversion has some general bearing on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 Make an appeal to authority rather than reason.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If your opponent respects an authority or an expert, quote that authority to further your case.&lt;br&gt;
If needed, quote what the authority said in some other sense or circumstance.&lt;br&gt;
Authorities that your opponent fails to understand are those which he generally admires the most.&lt;br&gt;
You may also, should it be necessary, not only twist your authorities, but actually falsify them, or quote something that you have entirely invented yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31 If you know that you have no reply to the arguments that your opponent advances, you by a fine stroke of irony declare yourself to be an incompetent judge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: “What you say passes my poor powers of comprehension; it may well be all very true, but I can’t understand it, and I refrain from any expression of opinion on it.”&lt;br&gt;
In this way you insinuate to the audience, with whom you are in good repute, that what your opponent says is nonsense.&lt;br&gt;
This technique may be used only when you are quite sure that the audience thinks much better of you than your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 A quick way of getting rid of an opponent’s assertion, or of throwing suspicion on it, is by putting it into some odious category.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: You can say, “That is fascism” or “Atheism” or “Superstition.”&lt;br&gt;
In making an objection of this kind you take for granted&lt;br&gt;
1)That the assertion or question is identical with, or at least contained in, the category cited;&lt;br&gt;
and&lt;br&gt;
2)The system referred to has been entirely refuted by the current audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33 You admit your opponent’s premises but deny the conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: “That’s all very well in theory, but it won’t work in practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34 When you state a question or an argument, and your opponent gives you no direct answer, or evades it with a counter question, or tries to change the subject, it is sure sign you have touched a weak spot, sometimes without intending to do so.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have, as it were, reduced your opponent to silence.&lt;br&gt;
You must, therefore, urge the point all the more, and not let your opponent evade it, even when you do not know where the weakness that you have hit upon really lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35 Instead of working on an opponent’s intellect or the rigor of his arguments, work on his motive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you success in making your opponent’s opinion, should it prove true, seem distinctly prejudicial to his own interest, he will drop it immediately.&lt;br&gt;
Example: A clergyman is defending some philosophical dogma.&lt;br&gt;
You show him that his proposition contradicts a fundamental doctrine of his church.&lt;br&gt;
He will abandon the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 You may also puzzle and bewilder your opponent by mere bombast.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If your opponent is weak or does not wish to appear as if he has no idea what your are talking about, you can easily impose upon him some argument that sounds very deep or learned, or that sounds indisputable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37 Should your opponent be in the right but, luckily for you, choose a faulty proof, you can easily refute it and then claim that you have refuted the whole position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is the way in which bad advocates lose good cases.&lt;br&gt;
If no accurate proof occurs to your opponent, you have won the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38 Become personal, insulting and rude as soon as you perceive that your opponent has the upper hand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In becoming personal you leave the subject altogether, and turn your attack on the person by remarks of an offensive and spiteful character.&lt;br&gt;
This is a very popular technique, because it takes so little skill to put it into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

There were sparkles in the air.  Tiny flickering rainbow-sparkling air sequins were all around my head.  At first I blinked, thinking my eyes were playing tricks.  But it was real.  Every cubic inch of the cold air around me had tiny floating ice crystals in it. Gently drifting almost-invisible nano-snowflakes, falling from a clear blue sky, sparkling like tiny prisms — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet — in the bright winter sun.  Finland didn&amp;#39;t want me to leave, and was showing off new forms of beauty. I had never seen precipitation of this kind before.  I hate to admit it, since it can only encourage the millions of people who will insist this is connected to some sort of profound insight about language and thought, but… it was a kind of snow I didn&amp;#39;t have a word for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that the comments box below will now start filling up with awed comments about the wonders of lexical variety and the opening of our mind to new snow concepts through new snow words and the usual yadda yadda blah blah — the stuff that I and others have tried to warn people against in so many &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1081"&gt;previous Language Log posts&lt;/a&gt;.  As I said recently in &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1087"&gt;The lexical measure of your life&lt;/a&gt;, you just can't stop people thinking that the words you possess determine the concepts you can access.  Even though the counterevidence is right up there in the opening paragraph of this post: I had no word for the phenomenon, yet I could describe it to you perfectly well without resorting to Finnish or an Eskimoan language.  So why do people continue to treat no-word-for-it prattle (and the many-words-for-it blather) as fascinating and deep?  I have no idea. It is a strange form of linguistic dopiness that I have no word for in my language.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

NYT 1/31/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Scholarly feuds seldom end amicably, and nearly 35 years after President Richard M. Nixon resigned, a dispute involving his Watergate tapes would seem to be no exception. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A handful of historians and authors maintain that the most authoritative transcripts of those recordings include significant omissions and misrepresentations that could influence interpretations of the cover-up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;At the center of the quarrel is “Abuse of Power: The New Nixon Tapes,” a 1997 collection of transcripts edited by Stanley I. Kutler, a pre-eminent historian of the Watergate era, that has become the standard reference. Mr. Kutler has been a hero to many people because of a lawsuit he brought with the nonprofit group Public Citizen that led to the release of 201 hours of recordings related to unethical or illegal activity in the Nixon White House. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;But longtime critics of his transcripts say Mr. Kutler deliberately edited the tapes in ways that painted a more benign portrait of a central figure in the drama, the conspirator-turned-star-witness, John W. Dean III, the White House counsel who told Nixon that Watergate had become a “cancer” on his presidency. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;To Mr. Kutler’s scholarly critics, though, the most serious failing is that excerpts from two separate conversations that took place on March 16 — one made during a face-to-face meeting in the morning, and a second over the telephone in the evening — were reversed in order and presented as part of one continuous meeting. Most of the evening conversation between Mr. Dean and Nixon was eliminated, as were any references to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(That should be &lt;a href="http://www.law.wisc.edu/profiles/index.php?iEmployeeID=159"&gt;Dr. Kutler&lt;/a&gt;, by the way.) Apparently in this case, the transcriptional inaccuracies make a significant difference in the interpretation of events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“If you look back at the conversations that Stanley didn't include what you see is Nixon and Dean closely involved in a joint obstruction of justice,” said Frederick J. Graboske, who was the supervising archivist in charge of processing the Nixon tapes at the National Archives. (Mr. Dean pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and served four months, most of which was spent working with Watergate prosecutors.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm used to seeing journalists playing fast and loose with alleged transcriptions, including (for example) &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=886"&gt;editing a video&lt;/a&gt; so that the apparent answer to a question consists of two segments originally produced in the opposite order and in answer to two different questions, separated by four other question-answer pairs. That was ABC News — but the New York Times, in violation of its own code of ethics, often presents &amp;quot;quotations&amp;quot; that are a combination of cut-and-paste and outright invention (see, for example, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002427.html"&gt;'Approximate' quotations can undermine readers' trust in the Times&lt;/a&gt;", 8/27/2005; or "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002395.html"&gt;This time it matters&lt;/a&gt;", 8/13/2005). I wonder whether historians are generally aware of how unreliable the quotations in newspapers and even the video clips on television can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some historians are certainly concerned about the Nixon tapes case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“In the history profession, you never change the original evidence; Dr. Kutler has changed the original evidence,” said Mr. Graboske, who learned of the disparities six months ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“I spent 12 years listening to the tapes,” he said, contending that no one could mistake the evening and morning recordings as being part of the same conversation. “I don’t know why he did it, but what he did was deliberate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;He added: “I did work with Stanley. I’m sorry that it has come to this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others find the errors to be expected and excusable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Yet Ken Hughes, a senior fellow at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center for Public Affairs, who has studied the tapes since 2000 as part of the Presidential Digital Recordings project, said the attacks on Mr. Kutler were “misguided.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“I was very critical of errors in the transcripts and I thought he had left out some important conversations,” Mr. Hughes said of Mr. Kutler’s book, “but they are entirely honest and predictable mistakes that anyone who would try to make a transcript from extremely difficult tapes could make.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's also Dr. Kutler's line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Mr. Kutler scoffed at the accusations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“Are you aware under what conditions I worked in 1996?” he said by telephone from Mexico. “It’s only because of my lawsuit that you or anybody else can pick up a tape. In those days, I could not leave the archives with that material. I used state-of-the-lost-art equipment. I brought in a team of court reporters to help me with the first drafts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to what I&amp;#39;ve heard over the years from journalists in defense of their transcription/quotation practices — they&amp;#39;re working under difficult conditions to bring us information that we wouldn&amp;#39;t otherwise have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“I am responsible for whatever was transcribed,” said Mr. Kutler, recently a plaintiff in a lawsuit to compel former Vice President Dick Cheney to preserve his records. “Did I make any mistakes? Of course. Did I ever make a deliberate mistake, did I ever deliberately transform a negative into a positive?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“Please, I’m a trained historian. I don’t work that way.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is really what he said, it seems to be unresponsive, since the claim is not that he turned a negative into a positive, but that he combined fragments of two conversations, "reversed in order and presented as part of one continuous meeting", and omitted or edited other relevant conversations, in such a way as to present John Dean in a better light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have no confidence that the NYT story reported Mr. Kutler&amp;#39;s remarks accurately…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233578033620"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1095">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0e7c83b883b65de2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Phonetics and phonology"/><title type="html">If you're uneducated you say it right</title><published>2009-02-02T12:18:14Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T12:18:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1095" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The most famous of all Finnish composers is surely Sibelius. His Latin name is that of his originally Swedish-speaking family, though he was born in Finland when it was a Grand Duchy within Russia, and his parents educated him in a Finnish-language school. In Latin (and in Swedish) the name Sibelius would have stress on the second syllable: &lt;i&gt;Si.&lt;b&gt;bé&lt;/b&gt;.li.us&lt;/i&gt;.  But in Finnish there is an invariant rule that all words are stressed on the first syllable.  So how on earth do the Finns say the name of this celebrated composer and Finnish nationalist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple enough, and raises an interesting point. If you are a completely uneducated monolingual Finnish speaker, you would say &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sí&lt;/b&gt;.pe.li.us&lt;/i&gt;.  (I wrote &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, not &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;, because Finnish doesn't really have &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; at all in names.)  But if you are an educated person and a European sophisticate, you will break the Finnish rule and say &lt;i&gt;Si.&lt;b&gt;bé&lt;/b&gt;.li.us&lt;/i&gt;, just like a Swede or a Roman.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see a complete pulling apart of the usual prescriptivist assumptions.  It is standardly alleged to be ignorant and lazy people who break the rules and corrupt the language with foreign borrowings and speak it badly.  Educated people, it is assumed, know the rules and speak correctly.  However, in this domain it is the ignorant people who say it &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;, if we take the usual Finnish stress rule to define what is right for Finnish (and I don&amp;#39;t see what else we can assume).  Educated cosmopolitans say the name of this great Finn in a clearly un-Finnish way — and pick up kudos for mangling it in that way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same with other aspects of the phonology.  For example, Finnish doesn't allow a two-consonant cluster at the beginning of a word, so (as Sally Thomason recently pointed out to me) the word for "stalagmite" is &lt;i&gt;talakmiti&lt;/i&gt;, pronounced &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;tá&lt;/b&gt;.lak.mi.ti&lt;/i&gt;; but if you are a Euro-sophisticated geology Ph.D. you will say &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;stá&lt;/b&gt;.lag.mi.ti&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shouldn't be too surprising: English speakers who don't know any French say "vinn blonk" and "restront" and "jeaner" and "notra dayme" while Euro-sophisticated English speakers attempt pronunciations a lot closer to the French &lt;i&gt;vin blanc&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;restaurant&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;genre&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/i&gt;.  The sophisticates deliberately anglicize less. And gain prestige by corrupting English with Frenchisms.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to pronunciation, it's clearly the ordinary untutored folk who learn the rules more deeply and follow them more accurately. Yet in grammar, for no apparent reason, it is typically assumed that the ordinary folk have no idea how to deploy their language correctly. Doesn't seem quite right, does it?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Everything we've read or heard about this time period has been less than, if I may say so, upbeat, with phrases like "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071102091148.htm"&gt;Adolescence And Autism: A Difficult, But Not Hopeless Combination&lt;/a&gt;" and &lt;a href="http://www.autism.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=426&amp;amp;a=4990"&gt;Asperger syndrome in adolescence: living with the ups, the downs and things in between&lt;/a&gt; pretty much the norm. Regardless of whether or not one is talking about autism, both "adolescence" and "middle school" are two words that seem to evoke more of a shudder or a "thank God that's over" (or, "oh my God, please do not even mention that to me!," depending somewhat on the age of the child in question).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, much of 2009 has been devoted to conferring with Charlie's teacher and various therapists, doctors, and school personnel about problems and programs, and what we can do, and what we have done, and what doesn't seem to be helping, and what can we still do---the full-out effort that's been part of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/so_what_is_autism_advocacy"&gt;advocating&lt;/a&gt; for Charlie throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another part of that effort has been time with Charlie, doing things together and, especially, going places together. Something about being on the move always seems to appeal to Charlie and, this weekend, we went into New York city twice, so Charlie more than got his share of rides on the &lt;a href="http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/path/html/"&gt;PATH&lt;/a&gt; train (which takes us from Jersey City to Manhattan), on the subway (the D and the 1), and (a special treat as we are inclined to hoof it), a taxi. Plus, as it's not possible to park anywhere near &lt;a href="http://journalsquarejc.com/"&gt;Journal Square&lt;/a&gt;, we leave the black car at my office and walk the 3/4 of a mile down Kennedy Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday we walked around Columbus Circle and ate takeout in Jim's office; Saturday we had a belated &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_year_of_the_earth_ox"&gt;Chinese New Year's&lt;/a&gt; celebration with dinner in (surprise surprise) Chinatown. (Though we had to wait for almost 30 minutes wedged in between the cash register and some diners whose Peking duck looked extremely delicious; Charlie admired the food and stood patiently, with waiters hoisting platters of steamed fish and winter melon soup over their heads and ours.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going out into the world has always been a centerpiece of Jim's and my advocacy for Charlie, as it's something we do &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; Charlie. Going out into public places is often cited as challenging for families with children on the spectrum (there are indeed &lt;a href="http://www.difflearn.com/product/The_Child_with_Autism_Goes_to_Florida/parenting_family_needs"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.difflearn.com/product/The_Child_with_Autism_Goes_to_Town/parenting_family_needs"&gt;this topic&lt;/a&gt;). As I wrote in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/about/primer?section=primer2"&gt;my primer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a parent may have figured out what kind of teaching and therapies their child needs at home and in school, there's still the rest of the world to deal with. Grocery stores, shopping malls, libraries, houses of worship, movie theaters, restaurants: Overwhelmed by anything from sensory overload -- noise, smells, sights -- it may be all that an autistic child can do to keep his head down and get through the labyrinthine aisles of the modern American supermarket. Just in the past year, two instances of autistic children being excluded from public settings -- a church in Minnesota and an airplane getting ready to take off -- highlighted these difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no limit, or should be no limit, to where an autistic child can go. It may be necessary to gradually introduce a child to a new setting and teaching methods and books are available to help a child with this. Regardless, when out in public with a child who others perceive to be "misbehaving," a parent learns a form of advocacy, as they learn to ignore stares or angry looks, respond to rude comments in a reasonable and thoughtful manner, and discover that they too are marked as "different."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For parents of autistic kids, advocacy doesn't have to mean something big and splashy that gets heard about in a national forum. Just going out can be an act of activism. Doing so says to the world that there are autistic persons here, and maybe they act a little (or a lot) "different," but there's a place on earth for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie and I go to the grocery store every week and he shops, carries around his shopping basket, endures my explanations about why something he wants is out of stock, waits in line, and helps to carry out the groceries. He's not big on malls (guess that makes him like &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/business/01mall.html?em"&gt;more and more Americans&lt;/a&gt;) or clothes shopping. One reason we like &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/why_working_out_works_out"&gt;taking Charlie to the YMCA&lt;/a&gt;---even though swim time in the pool remains limited on weekday nights---is that, when we're there, we're among people in our town and in our community. Most of the people at the front desk recognize Charlie as do the pool supervisors (who were lifeguards when we started going there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Charlie is older, his being "different" is much more quickly noted than when he was little. Since he's entered puberty, he's had more bouts of anxiety than ever, especially when things don't happen as expected and when there's loud/harsh/shrill noises or voices.  His love of going out and being out and about is as strong as ever and we're determined to keep going out---to keep doing our small effort of activism. For me, advocacy needs to be more than about autism---advocacy must be &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;

I completed a B.S. in Chemistry with Honors there in 1984 and then I stayed on to do obtain my M.D. in 1988. I look back very fondly on those eight years spent in Ann Arbor, as several of my longtime friendships were forged or solidified during those years. Consequently, I still care about the place. Indeed, I even once tried to see if I could get a position in the Department of Surgery there a few years back, but unfortunately the “fit” just wasn’t there at the time. That’s why it distresses me when I see my alma mater suffer from a self-inflicted wound, almost as much as the plight of the Michigan Wolverines bothers me, given that never before in my life (at least not since I was old enough to pay attention), have the Wolverines sucked so badly and so hard. Given that level of football futility, though, I consider it even more important that my alma mater not provide any more ammunition to those who would enjoy making fun of it. It doesn’t matter to me that I never went to law school at Michigan; it’s all part of the same campus to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the embarrassment comes in the form of an &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=217"&gt;article in the &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by a person who has previously been a subject of posts by both Dr. Novella and me. I’m referring to &lt;a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, whom we have both–correctly, I believe–labeled as being, if not &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;fully anti-vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, at least a prominent and major &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;apologist for the anti-vaccine movement&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, because he is the pediatrician taking care of Jenny McCarthy’s son Evan, he has gained even greater prominence in the antivaccine movement than ever, to the point where he gave a speech last summer to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=139"&gt;antivaccine “Green Our Vaccines” march on Washington&lt;/a&gt; and where he is regularly called up by TV producers to give a false “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=319"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt;” whenever a discussion of vaccines and/or autism comes up. He also wrote the foreword to Jenny McCarthy’s latest paean to autism quackery and attack on vaccines as the cause of autism in which he blithely repeated some of the worst distortions of the antivaccine movement. Unfortunately, Dr. Gordon lacks the intestinal fortitude to stop  the piteous denials any time he is called out for his parroting of antivaccine pseudsocience and to embrace his inner antivaccinationist. Then, at least, we wouldn’t be treated to the spectacle of his simultaneously claiming he is “pro-safe vaccine, not anti-vaccine” while at the same time saying he “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;doesn’t give a lot of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;” and admitting that parents have actually &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bookclub/2008/10/finally_science_pushes_back_ag.php#comment-1135651"&gt;had to persuade him to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; “reluctantly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what was the topic of the Michigan Law Review article that Dr. Gordon was apparently asked to pen? It’s actually an interesting question from a legal, political and civil rights standpoint, specifically: Whether or not parents should be held legally liable for refusing to vaccinate their children. Not surprisingly, Dr. Gordon took the “no” position. Unfortunately, as we’ve come to expect of Dr. Gordon, he uses a number of highly dubious arguments. However, more interesting to me, having had a nearly four year history sparring online with him off and on, was the seemingly “kinder and gentler” antivaccine stance that he took in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s take a look at the debate. The symposium published in &lt;em&gt;First Impressions&lt;/em&gt; (the online companion to the &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt;) was entitled &lt;a href="http://www.michiganlawreview.org/firstimpressions/vol107/vaccination.pdf"&gt;Liability for Exercising Personal Belief Exemptions from Vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and it contained the following articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of fascinating issues raised here. Although it’s obvious that universal vaccination is a public health policy good, given that the higher percentage of vaccinated children, the greater the herd immunity, there is always the nagging question of how far the state should go to mandate vaccination in a free society; i.e., how much coercion is acceptable to bring about maximal levels of vaccination? In other words, what is the proper balance between the needs of society as a whole and the rights of the individual? The next interesting legal and moral question is whether parents who refuse to vaccinate should be held liable for injuries to other children if their unvaccinated child passes on an infectious disease. Personally, I tend to believe that it is entirely reasonable to require vaccination as a precondition for school or day care and that exemptions should be primarily medical in nature. I grudgingly allow that the freedom of religion guaranteed in the First Amendment probably requires religious exemptions (although I do not understand why religion should be given such a privileged place in society that it can endanger public health), I am far less convinced that philosophical exemptions should be mandated. I realize many may disagree with this position, but I would hope that our disagreements would be based on (1) the best science regarding the benefits and risks of vaccination and (2) honest beliefs regarding the proper balance between public health concerns and individual liberty. Clearly, this is an area of debate. I also tend to believe that if parents refuse to vaccinate their child and that child passes an infectious disease to another child, then those parents should be potentially legally liable. Indeed, &lt;a href="http://www.michiganlawreview.org/firstimpressions/vol107/diekema.htm"&gt;Douglas Diekema argues this position very well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Dr. Gordon does not meet at least condition #1 above. He does not base his arguments on the best science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Change of Story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed when I read &lt;a href="http://www.michiganlawreview.org/firstimpressions/vol107/gordon.htm"&gt;Dr. Gordon’s article&lt;/a&gt; is that this is a very different Dr. Gordon than I’m used to seeing. Gone are the claims that vaccines cause autism. His most noticeable new trait is that gone are his usual assertions that vaccines cause autism. Indeed, Dr. Gordon didn’t even mention mercury or vaccines as a potential cause of autism once in his entire article! If I believed in miracles, I would write to the Pope and demand that the Church investigate this &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt; article as being every bit the equal of a divine healing at Lourdes, given Dr. Jay’s history! In order to emphasize the amazing change in Dr. Gordon’s demeanor towards vaccines, let’s take a little trip down memory lane, shall we? Let’s see what Dr. Gordon &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; thinks about vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Vaccines can cause autism.” (from the Foreword to &lt;em&gt;Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds&lt;/em&gt; by Jenny McCarthy.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Yes, most vaccines have much less mercury, but wait until the evidence against aluminum in vaccines becomes common knowledge. The body of research regarding aluminum’s harm to human cells already contains hundreds of articles.” (from the Foreword to &lt;em&gt;Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds&lt;/em&gt; by Jenny McCarthy.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We can only guess what harm we might be causing to babies with the huge overdoses of aluminum.” (from the Foreword to &lt;em&gt;Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds&lt;/em&gt; by Jenny McCarthy.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The official position of the American Academy of Pediatrics may be the same as my personal position, but they are far too involved with the pharmaceutical industry to actually do anything but pay lip service to an open discussion. The CDC and the AAP are filled with doctors whose research, speaking engagements, and travel are often funded by the manufacturers of vaccines. Many of these same doctors are paid consultants, and some later go to work full-time for the pharmaceutical industry.”  (from the Foreword to &lt;em&gt;Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds&lt;/em&gt; by Jenny McCarthy.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We doctors need to stop deceiving our patients into thinking that immunizations are ‘free.’ Every medical intervention costs the body something, and we have a legal and moral obligation to tell parents.” (from the Foreword to &lt;em&gt;Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds&lt;/em&gt; by Jenny McCarthy.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I think the immune system, like every other system of the body, matures slowly, and that it can better tolerate viral infection at older ages and better tolerate one virus at a time. The other thing is that vaccines all contain other ingredients. They contain aluminum, they contain tiny bits of formalin [an aqueous solution of formaldahyde]. So I recommend waiting as long as parents are comfortable, and vaccinating very, very slowly.” (&lt;a href="http://www.cookiemag.com/entertainment/2008/07/vaccine_experts?currentPage=2"&gt;Interview with &lt;em&gt;Cookie Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I don’t give a lot of vaccines.” (from &lt;a href="http://www.thelittleseed.com/blog/?m=200807"&gt;An Open Letter on Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, deconstructed by &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;Steve Novella on SBM&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In 1980 I abandoned the recommended vaccine schedule. I received dozens and dozens of phone calls from moms and dads reporting that their child had received shots a couple of days ago and they were acting “a little different.” They couldn’t quite put their finger on it but their child was just not acting quite the same as before I gave the shots. They’d ask if this was okay…was it normal? Initially, as I was trained to do, I replied ‘yes.’ After dozens and dozens and dozens of phone calls, I decided that I had better listen to these moms a lot more.” (from &lt;a href="http://www.thelittleseed.com/blog/?m=200807"&gt;An Open Letter on Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, deconstructed by &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;Steve Novella on SBM&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I gave a half dozen vaccines today. I gave some reluctantly but respected parents’ wishes to vaccinate.” (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bookclub/2008/10/finally_science_pushes_back_ag.php#comment-1135651"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I think that the public health benefits to vaccinating are grossly overstated. I think that if we spent as much time telling people to breastfeed or to quit eating cheese and ice cream, we’d save more lives than we save with the polio vaccine.” (&lt;a href="http://www.cookiemag.com/entertainment/2008/07/vaccine_experts?currentPage=2"&gt;Interview with &lt;em&gt;Cookie Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Jenny McCarthy’s book, for which Dr. Gordon wrote the Foreword, was published in September 2008. In fact, none of these are old quotes by Dr. Gordon. Also note that Dr. Gordon has been palling around with some of the most rabid antivaccinationists out there and has become much in demand as a speaker on the antivaccine circuit and a guest on TV shows. That’s because it’s clear that Dr. Gordon believes vaccines do great harm, and he’s good for the “vaccine skeptic” viewpoint. He believes that vaccines are chock full of nasty “toxins” and that they cause autism. He long ago abandoned the conventional vaccination schedule and now is a “&lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=106"&gt;brave maverick doctor&lt;/a&gt;” who goes his own way. No meekly following along with the herd of pediatricians in thrall to big pharma-controlled whims of the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.aap.org/"&gt;AAP&lt;/a&gt;, he! No reliance on large epidemiological studies showing no link between either mercury in vaccines and autism or vaccines themselves and autism!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does he say about vaccination for this article for the &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt;? As I said before, we see a “kinder, gentler” Dr. Gordon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over many years, seeing thousands of children, my point of view about childhood vaccines has changed. I believe that parents have the right to decide when and how their children receive vaccinations and also have the right to decline any or all vaccines. Like many medical interventions, vaccines have risks and benefits, and parents may elect nonvaccination as the better choice for an individual child. The societal ramifications are significant and should certainly be a part of any discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, this is nothing different from what Dr. Gordon’s been saying all along, albeit couched in less inflammatory language and cleverly framed as an issue of individual freedom. What has changed is that Dr. Gordon now admits that societal ramifications are important and that they should be part of any discussion. Quite frankly, in all my years sparring with him, I do not recall his ever admitting that societal ramifications mattered one whit. Perhaps this is the beginning of a change in Dr. Gordon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When children or babies who have been in contact with other children (or adults) contract most illnesses, there is no feasible way to know from whom they got the disease. Whether one is talking about a routine winter viral illness, chickenpox, or whooping cough, the contagion could have come from a child with overt disease signs and symptoms, an asymptomatic carrier, or another, perhaps mutual, contact. Vaccines are not 100% effective, so that even a fully vaccinated child can contract an illness or carry that illness and give it to another child. Blaming a specific individual—let alone suing one—because your child gets sick has no credible medical basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=217"&gt;Autism News Beat&lt;/a&gt; points out, this is easily demonstrably false. He used the example of the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5708a3.htm"&gt;recent San Diego outbreak of measles&lt;/a&gt;, where it was quite feasible to trace the outbreak to a single unimmunized seven-year-old who caught the disease while on vacation in Switzerland. In fact, it was possible even to determine with a high degree of probability when and where this child infected other children with his particular strain of measles. Apparently the disciplines of molecular diagnostics and forensics are too new for Dr. Gordon to be aware of them. But it’s even worse than that. He seems completely oblivious that such techniques are applied to outbreaks all the time to identify the strains of bacteria or virus that are responsible for an outbreak. It’s done all the time in the case of outbreaks of food contamination: The specific strain of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; is routinely traced back to the manufacturer all the way back through the chain of distribution, starting at the product purchased and following the infection back to through the chain of distribution to the manufacturer. The concept is the same for tracing the source of an outbreak. It beggars the imagination that Dr. Gordon could be so oblivious to these simple facts. Of course, he’s more interested in demonizing vaccines than in being scientifically accurate. Same as it ever was. He’s just become subtler about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many valid reasons to support vaccination, but they don’t support removing the right to refuse vaccinations. There are also situations—medical and personal—which justify waiving all or some childhood vaccines, but these are not good reasons to abandon vaccines altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go again, Dr. Jay, with the false dilemma. No, it is not a matter of either abandoning vaccinations altogether versus total support. It’s not a choice between supporting vaccination or abandoning vaccines altogether. But, again, Dr. Gordon’s false dilemma is even more false than that. It doesn’t require abandoning vaccination altogether to endanger public health. Just having the vaccination rate drop below the rate necessary for herd immunity (90% in most cases) will do. At that point, outbreaks become increasingly more likely, as our &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/thanks_andrew_wakefield.php"&gt;British friends have discovered&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, that’s the reasons measles is now &lt;a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18919"&gt;endemic again in the U.K.&lt;/a&gt; after having been declared eradicated a mere 15 years ago. It was the antivaccine movement spurred on by the dubious “findings” of the “research” of Andrew Wakefield that scared U.K. parents into not vaccinating, with MMR uptake rates falling below 80% in some areas. The results were predictable, and they came true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gordon also goes on to pull out the false equivalency argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents who vaccinate their children base their decisions on the advice they receive from their pediatricians and the other knowledge they have gathered. Parents who choose to waive vaccinations do so for similarly valid reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very clever, Dr. Jay. Unfortunately, Dr. Jay neglects to mention that there are antivaccine groups out there dedicated to feeding an unrelenting stream of propaganda based on dubious or no science demonizing vaccines to parents, aided and abetted by certain pediatricians. I do like the not-so-subtle implications that Dr. Gordon’s advice based on his own easily fooled personal clinical observations, is the equivalent of science-based recommendations about vaccinations. I’ll give him a hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Gordon’s not finished yet with the false dilemmas yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adverse outcomes can occur from both vaccination and nonvaccination. Vaccines work very well at creating immunity to illnesses, so there are very few situations that would likely lead to transmission of an illness from an unvaccinated child to a vaccinated child. The obvious exceptions would be infants too young to have received a full complement of shots and immuno-compromised children. Parents must protect these two groups of children by keeping them away from too many other children. Period. Newborns and young babies are at risk any time they are in public. We can only vaccinate against a very small minority of contagious illnesses; it is unwise to bring your newborn into preschool when you pick up your toddler, and equally risky to attend older children’s birthday parties with this baby. Further, parents of children taking high dose steroids for asthma or receiving immunosuppressive medicine for other diseases are strongly cautioned by their doctors to avoid the potential dangers I have described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am highly gratified that Dr. Gordon has finally–finally!–admitted the efficacy of vaccination in preventing infectious disease and that unvaccinated (or undervaccinated) children should be kept away from the unvaccinated, I reluctantly have to point out that the vaccinated can be infected by the unvaccinated. The reason, of course, is that no vaccine is 100% effective, as much as we would wish that it was. Indeed, if vaccines were 100% effective, then herd immunity wouldn’t be so important. Vaccinated children can be infected by the unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gordon goes on to question the efficacy of the influenza and varicella zoster (chickenpox) vaccines. Note how he chooses vaccines that are a bit more controversial and for which the evidence supporting universal vaccination is not quite as overwhelming as for other vaccines. The reason is transparent, at least to me. By going after the “weaker” vaccines in the vaccine schedule, Dr. Gordon hopes to convince readers that there is a similar level of doubt about the entire vaccine schedule, a level of doubt so high that it is not unreasonable for parents to refuse to vaccinate based on the beliefs that vaccines are not that efficacious in preventing disease and that they carry unacceptable risks. Everything in Dr. Gordon’s editorial is designed to cast the efficacy and risks of vaccines in the worst possible light. Then he plays the “victim” card, whining that parents who refuse to vaccinate have been unfairly “vilified”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of facts, doctors and others are trying to frighten people into vaccinating or not vaccinating. That fear includes the notions that unvaccinated children pose a great threat to others and that parents of these children are not being responsible. In fact, these parents are choosing what they consider to be the safest course of action for their children and pose very little, if any, danger to other children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this particulary ironic, given that Dr. Gordon and the mother of one of his patients, Jenny McCarthy, have been two of the most prominent of those frightening people into not vaccinating their children. Dr. Gordon appears oblivious to any responsibility he might bear for appearing on TV shows arguing that vaccines cause autism or credulously repeating the exaggeration and misinformation spread by Jenny McCarthy, J.B. Handley, and the rest of the antivaccine movement about formaldehyde, aluminum, and other allegedly horrible “toxins” in vaccines that are not toxic at the levels present in vaccines. He himself has joined in spreading fear–fear of vaccines–by demonizing vaccines every opportunity he gets, including this law review article. Indeed, he takes it to a level I haven’t seen before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some medical interventions are not controversial, and some prompt only mild controversy. For example, if a child has acute lymphocytic leukemia, the cure rate with conventional medical care approaches ninety percent, and very few doctors or parents will argue against the standard treatments offered in spite of their known complications and adverse reactions. But vaccines are presently controversial, and purported truths about safety and efficacy are challenged daily by lay people and physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Just wow. Did Dr. Gordon actually just compare vaccines to chemotherapy for ALL? I believe he just did, even though any level of risk from vaccines is many orders of magnitude below those that chemotherapy poses. He also falsely labels vaccines as “controversial.” They are not, at least not among science-based physicians. The “controversy,” such as it is, is in reality what is commonly termed a “&lt;a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2008/04/manufactroversy/"&gt;manufactroversy&lt;/a&gt;,” in other words, a controversy manufactured where none existed before, at least among scientists. Dr. Gordon is desperate to paint the manufactroversy about vaccines as a real scientific controversy. Of course, he’s a bit hamstrung in that he seems unable or unwilling in this particular venue to let his freak flag fly and come right out and say that he believes vaccines cause autism, neurodevelopmental disorders, and a variety of immune disorders, such as asthma, as he has in other venues. What he does do is to point out the “CYA” language in the package inserts of vaccines and try to “jazz it up” as evidence that vaccines are very, very dangerous. He then returns to his favorite technique in this article, the false dichotomy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of side effects from adverse reactions to vaccines, in a Physicians’ Desk Reference “warning” section, given out of context, would probably frighten many parents out of vaccinating at all. There are thirty or more items on that list. Similarly, the list of symptoms and complications of the illnesses against which we vaccinate could scare parents into giving every shot available as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians and other physicians use the latter option on a daily basis.I share my colleagues’ disdain for scare tactics from the “antivaccine” camp, but I object equally to doctors using fear and misinformation to try to convince parents (and legislators) that vaccines are risk free. Both sides are distorting the truth for their own purposes. Childhood illnesses are part of the first decade of life; immunity is acquired, and the consequences are almost always minor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that’s why the “harmless” measles is the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide, killing around &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs286/en/index.html"&gt;200,000 children a year&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. Of course, it was much worse before mass vaccination programs. Ten years ago, measles killed around 900,000 children. And why has the mortality fallen so much. The reason is mass vaccination programs spearheaded by WHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My irony meter also just about exploded at Dr. Gordon’s “disdain” for the scare tactics from the antivaccine camp (note his use of quotation marks!) given that he himself has engaged in many of the exact same scare tactics of the antivaccine fringe, be they &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_to_the_stars.php"&gt;the “formaldehyde” gambit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9"&gt;the “toxins” gambit&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=14"&gt;fear mongering about mercury&lt;/a&gt;. The hypocrisy and use of the logical fallacy of the false dichotomy are astounding, even by Dr. Gordon’s usual standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for the “kinder, gentler” Dr. Jay, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very, very disappointed in the &lt;a href="http://www.michiganlawreview.org/about/"&gt;editorial staff of the &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including Editor-in-Chief Adrienne Fowler, and Managing Editor Stefan Atkinson, for having fallen for Dr. Gordon’s portrayal of himself as some sort of expert on issues related to vaccination, be they medical or legal. He is an expert on neither immunology, vaccination, nor the law. As an alumnus of the University of Michigan, albeit not the Law School, I’m very unhappy to see such a self-inflicted black eye. The reason is simple, and I’m going to use a saying that I have permission to steal blatantly from a couple of online acquaintances: Relying on Dr. Jay Gordon for legal acumen and advice is akin to appointing Judge Judy to the Supreme Court. It’s bad enough that the line between news and entertainment has all but disappeared. There are two exceptions, of course. Judge Judy is actually a retired judge; Dr. Gordon has no experience in the legal profession. In addition, Judge Judy, while chaff entertainment, does not have a reputation for being spectacularly wrong so often. Dr. Gordon, as shown above, does. Apparently the editors were blinded by the glare of his celebrity associations. I can’t really think of any other reason why they would have chosen him as an “expert” to write an editorial as part of this online symposium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why I, as a disheartened alumnus of the University of Michigan, urge any other fellow alumni of U. of M., or anyone concerned with medical and legal accuracy and the application of science-based medicine to the issue of mandatory vaccination, to write to Ms. Fowler (&lt;a href="mailto:aefowler@umich.edu"&gt;aefowler@umich.edu&lt;/a&gt;) and Mr. Atkinson (&lt;a href="mailto:stefanat@umich.edu"&gt;stefanat@umich.edu&lt;/a&gt;) to voice a strong complaint over their having published the misinformation and exaggerations of a pediatrician known to be an apologist for the antivaccine movement. The issue of legal liability for parents who refuse to vaccinate is a contentious and fascinating issue that is ill-served by the self-serving and misinformed posturing of someone like Dr. Gordon. Indeed, reading all the articles in this rather interesting issue, it is clear to me that the debate is actually far more informative without Dr. Gordon’s contribution, such as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you do write to the &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt;, please feel free to &lt;a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/contact.asp" rel="nofollow"&gt;cc: a copy to Dr. Jay himself&lt;/a&gt;. Tell him Dr. Gorski said hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was introduced on a radio interview recently as being “internationally hated by atheists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what do I attribute this great honor? Obviously, to my dumb banana video. It spread my name like soft and tasteless butter all over the world. And so I have this unique and wonderful blog that is frequented by atheists. I never thought that I would some day thank God for that stupid video, but I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he doesn’t understand is that it isn’t “internationally hated by atheists.” On the contrary, every time I rewatch that video I actually give it 5 stars. People who actually understand science and despise creationism LOVE Ray’s little banana video because it illustrates the collosal stupidity of creationism far better than even YouTube user Thunderf00t’s great “Why People Laugh At Creationists” video series. I have to think that that video single-handedly made Ray and Kirk Cameron embarrassments even to the larger creationist movement. I really can’t imagine that Casey Luskin or Michael Behe are too happy about this video floating around. While they’re idiots in their own right, next to Comfort and Cameron they come off as geniuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen even people who aren’t very knowledgeable about science stumble upon the video and actually recommending it to me because it made them laugh their asses off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no, Ray. We don’t hate the video. The video actually makes our point for us better than we ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as if it were even necessary, here’s a video that debunk’s arguably the stupidest creationist argument ever:&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s the exchange, beginning with President Fogel’s response to Dawkins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Professor Dawkins,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one who has been deeply instructed by your work and who applauds your scientific leadership, I was honored to find a personal email from you in my inbox, but very sorry indeed that the occasion was the decision to invite Ben Stein to be a Commencement speaker and honorary degree recipient. Although we have recently learned that Mr. Stein will be unable to receive the honorary degree here or to serve as Commencement speaker, please know that it was our expectation that his remarks would address the global economic crisis and that he would speak from his widely acknowledged area of expertise on the economy. We regret that he will be unable to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With thanks again for writing, with admiration, and with every good wish–Daniel Mark Fogel, President, The University of Vermont&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s Dawkins’ response to that response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear President Fogel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much indeed for your extremely gracious letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot disguise my gladness that Ben Stein will not be going to Vermont. Thank you very much for letting me know. I wish you, and your great university all good fortune. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my very best wishes, and thanks again for your letter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn’t there, of course, and I don’t get invited to these goofy events anyway, but I did get a copy of Wells’ powerpoint presentation from an attendee. It’s titled “DNA Does Not Control Embryo Development” — shall we look at it together? It’s really a hoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/wells1.jpeg" alt="wells1.jpeg" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Wells has been exposed to a little bit of knowledge, just enough for him to regurgitate a few common phrases that are current in the developmental biology literature, and to pretend that he is profound and revolutionary. Nothing could be further from the truth — his title comes straight out of mainstream evo-devo. It’s actually rather funny, since there is a tiny bit of truth in what he says, but what’s true isn’t original with him, and it certainly doesn’t have the implications he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He starts with a few quotes to show that some scientists tend to have both a naive view of development, and tend to simplify a bit when speaking in public. Here’s James Watson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that the instructions for how the egg develops into an adult are written in the linear sequence of bases along the DNA of the germ cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Ken Miller:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our genome is an “amazing script, carrying within it all of the instructions for building a human being.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Francis Collins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recipe for building the animal body is controlled by remarkably few genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woo-hoo. These are all good scientists who are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; developmental biologists, and who are guilty of the dreadful sin of over-simplification. It’s entirely true, however, that there is a tendency to reduce the role of the genes to an excessively narrow view of “control”, and it’s an attitude that many modern biologists would like to see broadened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells missed a trick, though. There’s an even better source for this idea, in Richard Lewontin’s excellent little book, &lt;em&gt;The Triple Helix: Gene, Organism, and Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674006771/pharyngula-20" rel="external "&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;amp;bfpid=0674006771&amp;amp;amp;bfmtype=book" rel="external "&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0674006771&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" rel="external "&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;amp;isbn=0674006771" rel="external "&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most eminent molecular biologists, Sydney Brenner, speaking before a group of colleagues, claimed that if he had the complete sequence of DNA of an organism and a large enough computer then he could compute the organism. The symbolic irony of this remark is that it was made in the opening address of a meeting commemorating the 100&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of Darwin’s death. A similar spirit motivates the claim by yet another major figure in molecular biology, Walter Gilbert, that when we have the complete sequence of the human genome “we will know what it means to be human.” Just as the metaphor of development implies a rigid internal predetermination of the organism by its genes, so the language used to describe the biochemistry of the genes themselves implies an internal self-sufficiency of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the book is very good, and continues along the same lines to point out the interdependency of genes, cytoplasm, and environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, but wait — Wells can’t use that. If his point is that he and his creationist ilk are clever iconoclasts, it does no good to reveal that there are huge numbers of biologists, including evolutionary biologists, who have been arguing that the metaphor of control is invalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, it’s silly for an IDist to be complaining about metaphor. The primary foundation of their rationalizations is an extended and inappropriate metaphor, that you can call molecules “machines” and pretend that that means they were built by designers in little factories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells has a grander plan than to rebuke a few molecular biologists for sloppy language, though. Here’s the key point in his talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/wells2.jpeg" alt="wells2.jpeg" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the “logic”? If some people think DNA controls development, and if those same people accept evolution, than by showing that DNA does not control development, then evolution must be false. It’s Wells’ familiar game of throwing dirt in random directions and hoping it will stick on a few biologists, so he can claim the whole field is wrong. It’s a rather absurd premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll be interesting to see how he plans to claim this erroneous metaphor is central to “Darwinism”, since Darwin did not know anything DNA or genes, and didn’t have this metaphor at all. One solution, of course, is to just skip over the first 60 or 70 years of evolutionary biology and jump to the neo-Darwinian synthesis, when genes were incorporated into the theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/wells3.jpeg" alt="wells3.jpeg" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, OK. It’s a summary of the synthesis that doesn’t mention Fisher and Wright and population genetics, Dobzhansky on genetics and speciation, Mayr and biogeography, Simpson and paleontology. It’s a bit cartoonish, especially since the first two points are purely Darwinian and precede the synthesis, and the fourth was also worked out prior to the synthesis by people like Morgan and Muller. And the third point…hey, wait a minute. Where’d that come from? That isn’t part of the neo-Darwinian synthesis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes (DNA) carry all the essential hereditary information, and a “genetic program” controls embryo development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells just tossed that in. We know that is not true, and we’ve known it for a long, long time. I mean, Wells is supposed to be a developmental biologist — he must know about, to name one example, the work of EG Conklin on ascidians around 1900, in which he mapped out the distribution of cytoplasmic determinants in the egg. The synthesis said almost &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about development, and here’s Wells trying to pull a fast one and tell you that not only was development a key underpinning of the theory, but that a false metaphor was specifically part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t. He’s making stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shall we see some more made-up stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/wells4.jpeg" alt="wells4.jpeg" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heh. First day of class, first lecture in my developmental biology course, all I talk about is &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=dbio.section.547" rel="external "&gt;genomic equivalence&lt;/a&gt;. It’s very basic stuff: the cells in your body all have the same genes, but different cellular phenotypes. That’s the cool stuff in development, thinking about the way cell fates switch under regulatory control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t call it a “paradox”, though. Why would I? It’s like saying that the existence of “if” statements in computer science is a paradox! Conditional expression of subsets of genes is central to development — it’s hard to imagine differentiation occurring without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another weird one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/wells5.jpeg" alt="wells5.jpeg" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a complete misrepresentation of the Klotz paper — it says no such thing. Here’s what the paper is actually about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the DNA in the nucleus, cells also need many other components to function. One set of these extranuclear elements are various proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, an internal framework of tubular rods that run throughout the cell. In particular, there is a specific structure called the centrosome that is a kind of cytoskeletal organizing center — sort of like a seed crystal that acts as a starting point for growth. One special role for the centrosome is as an anchor point for the fibers upon which chromosomes shuttle about during cell division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sperm cells carry a centrosome as well as a nucleus. That centrosome appears to be important in triggering cell divisions. What Klotz and his coinvestigators did was take unfertilized frog eggs, prick them to trick them into responding as if sperm entry had occurred, and injected them with the centrosomic proteins. They demonstrated that the centrosomes were important for driving early cell divisions — they did not get complete frogs. Cell divisions eventually arrested, but some of the pseudo-fertilized eggs got as far as the tadpole stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do similar things with zebrafish. Sometimes you want embryos that have only the maternal genes, and the way you do this is to suppress a meiotic division (so that the egg will be diploid rather than haploid), and fertilize it with sperm that has been so thoroughly irradiated that its genetic material has been destroyed, and all it is doing is carrying a centrosome and some other activating factors into the egg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These experiments emphatically do not demonstrate that DNA does not matter — the cells have a full complement of maternal DNA. It does not demonstrate that the paternal centrosome is sufficient to generate a complete animal. This claim is complete bunk. Don’t just take my word for it: here’s the conclusion to the Klotz paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that the whole or part of the centrosome structure acts as a seed to start the centrosome duplication cycle in &lt;em&gt;Xenopus&lt;/em&gt; eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a more modest and far more appropriate interpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/wells6.jpeg" alt="wells6.jpeg" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool. Hox genes are always fun. Wells then gives an overview of the classification of genes by Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, who found that there were early maternal effect genes, gap genes that block out broad chunks of the anterior-posterior axis, segmentation genes that partition the embryo into repeating elements, segment polarity genes that assign identity within a segment, and then the Hox genes, which give the segments special identities in the body plan. And then, this is his conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/wells7.jpeg" alt="wells7.jpeg" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an old theme for Wells. Hox genes aren’t the very first genes turned on in the embryo, so they must not be that important; in his previous books, he’s tried to make a similar case that because Haeckel’s phylotypic stage (the pharyngula in chordates) isn’t the earliest stage, and that there is more variation between classes of organisms in the earlier stages, evolution is false. It doesn’t follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hox genes are activated &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; late in &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt; development. That’s still early, at 4-5 weeks of development in humans. There are many other genes that are expressed later still, and they are seriously dependent on an appropriate earlier pattern of Hox gene expression. Developmental processes build on prior processes; this isn’t surprising at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that flies have some positional information laid out before fertilization. This is also not a new revelation; I already mentioned the work of Conklin on ascidians, so we’ve known for over a century that many animals are mosaic, getting a headstart on spatial differentiation with a specific distribution of some informational molecules. This isn’t magic (AKA intelligent design), however — it’s generated by an asymmetrical arrangement of supporting cells in the ovary. Not all animals do this. One example: mammals! Our eggs don’t seem to have much, if any, spatial information initially, and all of the cells in the early blastula are mostly equivalent. Differences emerge progressively by interactions with each other and with neighboring tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next slide is amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/wells8.jpeg" alt="wells8.jpeg" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time I see Fred Nijhout, I’m going to have to let him know that he is being cited by creationists. I think he’ll find it funny. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That quote is from an excellent paper by Nijhout in which he takes the abuse of metaphors to task, and points out the flaws of the “control” and “program” models of the genome. Here’s the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In describing the flawless regularity of developmental processes and the correlation between changes at certain genetic loci and changes in morphology, biologists frequently employ two metaphors: that genes ‘control’ development, and that genomes embody ‘programs’ for development. Although these metaphors have an admirable sharpness and punch, they lead, when taken literally, to highly distorted pictures of developmental processes. A more balanced, and useful, view of the role of genes in development is that they act as suppliers of the material needs of development and, in some instances, as context-dependent catalysts of cellular changes, rather than as ‘controllers’ of developmental progress and direction. The consequences of adopting this alternative view of development are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-reading this paper, it looks like many of the correct ideas in Wells’ talk are lifted directly from it; the incorrect ones seem to be Wells’ own weird biased misinterpretation. What’s important, though, is that it actually invalidates Wells’ overall conclusion. He wants to claim that evolution is built partially on this premise of genetic “control”, yet here is a paper by a well-known evolutionary developmental biologist not only explaining that “control” is a poor metaphor, but discussing how evolutionary theory is made richer by a better and more accurate understanding of developmental processes! It’s as if Wells is ignoring everything Nijhout was writing &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; for a few statements that he could lift out of context and pretend that they are an attack on the foundation of evolutionary thought. (Yeah, I know. Big surprise.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s deal with Wells’ conclusion, finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/wells9.jpeg" alt="wells9.jpeg" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The floor plan of the embryo is in the form of spatial information that precedes DNA differentiation.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not always true. It’s only the case in some animals. It doesn’t matter, though, since maternal factors are also the product of evolution…and are also produced by maternal genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of this spatial information is carried by the centrosome and cortex.&lt;/strong&gt; This is true. It’s been recognized by biologists for a long, long time. Once again, the ID research program uncovers the obvious that real biologists have been discussing for a century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is evidence that both the centrosome and cortex are heritable independently of the DNA.&lt;/strong&gt; Well, sort of true. Also sort of wrong. He’s making the complement of the mistake he’s accusing biologists of making. Just as you can’t say all the hereditary information is confined to DNA, you also can’t say that it’s the domain of the centrosome or cortex. The centrosomal proteins are &lt;em&gt;gene products&lt;/em&gt;! What we’re really dealing with is a tangled web of interdependent processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So DNA does not determine all the essential characteristics of living things. It is necessary but not sufficient for embryo development.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Again with the obvious, Mr Wells! Look, vehicle. Look, road. Which one is in charge of the route you will take from point A to point B? You need both. And biologists, including evolutionary biologists, have been aware of this for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea that genetic programs control embryo development is not an inference from evidence, but a deduction from neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory.&lt;/strong&gt; Breathtaking nonsense. Neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory says nothing of the kind, especially since it says almost nothing about development at all. You can actually see classical evolutionary biology as only saying there is a measurable correlation between the hereditary material (whatever it is; it wouldn’t even have to be nuclear) and the phenotype. The causal mechanisms that translate genes into form and function is the domain of developmental biology, which most other biological disciplines have simply treated as an abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to know what Wells actually said at his conclusion. I have to infer from his slides that he’s making a strange argument that heredity is not the product of DNA, and therefore the evolutionary evidence from genes and molecules is invalid. I know, that sounds awesomely stupid and it’s hard to believe anyone could stand up in public and say it, but that’s the thrust of his presentation. Then again, Wells has been willing to say lots of stupid things in his books, so I shouldn’t be surprised that he’d do likewise in his lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

Evolution Weekend is part of the Clergy Letter Project; as I noted a couple of years ago on Panda’s Thumb, “The Clergy Letter Project is terribly important because it counters the view that evolution is inherently atheistic, and the signers of the document are the natural allies of us who want to promote good science education and keep all species of creationism out of the public schools and indeed out of the public agenda.”  Since that time, the Clergy Letter Project has expanded to include a Rabbi Letter and a Unitarian-Universalist Clergy Letter. The Project encourages clergy and other religious leaders to sponsor programs concerning evolution in their churches or synagogues during Evolution Weekend. What follows is an update on the 2009 Evolution Weekend, which I got from Michael Zimmerman of Butler University.  Evolution Weekend is 13 -15 February 2009, and Darwin’s sesquicentennial is 12 February 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolution Weekend Update&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to report that participation in Evolution Weekend has expanded significantly over last year.  This means that participation has increased every year that &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionweekend.org" rel="external "&gt;Evolution Weekend&lt;/a&gt; has been in existence!  As of today, 903 congregations from 14 countries have signed up to participate.  I know, however, that more of you are planning to participate but you haven’t yet signed up.  My problem is, I just don’t know who you are!  If you’re not yet listed on our &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionweekend.org" rel="external "&gt;Web page&lt;/a&gt;, please drop me a note so I can add you.  Stories about Evolution Weekend are beginning to appear in various media and on the Web so it would be nice to have as accurate a list as possible.  Please let me add you and your congregation if you’re planning to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
 
Press Release&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are participating in Evolution Weekend, you might want to use the &lt;a href="http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/pdf/press%20release%20-%20local.doc" rel="external "&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; I’ve drafted to announce the event.  All you need to do to use the release is fill in a bit of information about your congregation.  I hope that you find this helpful.  Please share any media coverage with me (&lt;a href="mailto:wMiajciRV9K;kBSRXNKBWuOyWtq4ZMj0ptqB"&gt;[Enable javascript to see this email address.]&lt;/a&gt;).  And, if you’re delivering a sermon for Evolution Weekend, please send me a copy so I can post it on our Web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
The UU Clergy Letter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
Our new Unitarian-Universalist Clergy Letter has now been posted on our &lt;a href="http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/Unitarian_Universalists/UnivUnitarianClergyLtr.htm" rel="external "&gt;Web site&lt;/a&gt;.  As of this morning, the Letter has garnered 130 signatures from Unitarian Universalist clergy members.  If you are such a clergy member and you haven’t yet signed the Letter, please drop me a note (&lt;a href="mailto:wMiajciRV9K;kBSRXNKBWuOyWtq4ZMj0ptqB"&gt;[Enable javascript to see this email address.]&lt;/a&gt;) and I’ll get you listed.  This Clergy Letter now joins our original Christian Clergy Letter, which has 11,815 signatures, and our Rabbi Letter, which has 432 signatures.  If you have friends or colleagues who haven’t yet signed one of our Letters but who might like to do so, please pass along information to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
 
Wish Charles Darwin a Happy Birthday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
Charles Darwin was born on 12 February 1809 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England.  In celebration of his 200&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday, Shropshire Tourism has created a &lt;a href="http://www.discoverdarwin.co.uk/happy-birthday/" rel="external "&gt;Web site&lt;/a&gt; that enables people from all over the world to wish him a happy birthday.  The map showing those birthday wishes is well worth looking at.  Additionally, there’s a great deal of useful information about Darwin on the Web page.  Look around and share your birthday wishes with the world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sign your congregation up or to sign any of the Clergy Letters, contact Professor Zimmerman at &lt;a href="mailto:wMiajciRV9K;kBSRXNKBWuOyWtq4ZMj0ptqB"&gt;[Enable javascript to see this email address.]&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, you may find articles, sermons, scientific consultants, and other resources &lt;a href="http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/rel_evol_sun.htm" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please limit comments to Evolution Weekend, Darwin’s bicentennial, and The Clergy Letter Project, and avoid discussion of theology or “the timeless truths of the Bible.”&lt;/p&gt;

Estimates of how much funding each school district will receive under the American Recovery and Reinvestment bill can be found on the &lt;a href="http://edlabor.house.gov/blog/2009/01/school-districts-will-benefit.shtml"&gt;EdLabor journal&lt;/a&gt;, from a document prepared by the Congressional Research Service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This document estimates what each school district in the country would receive under the bill’s program allocations (not including the $79 billion State Stabilization Fund) for Title I ($11 billion), IDEA ($13 billion), and K-12 School Modernization ($14 billion) over FYs 2009 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are estimates only based on available and current data and may not reflect exact allocations that school districts receive when these funds are actually allocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDF files with estimates for each town/district in each state are provided; as a commenter notes, higher levels of funding are given to districts with "larger concentrations of lower-income students."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.wrightslaw.com/blog/?p=144"&gt;Wrightslaw blog&lt;/a&gt; considers whether  the long-term consequences of the stimulus package positive or negative, and quotes these opinions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Education experts across the political spectrum wondered how school districts could spend so many new billions so fast, whether such an outpouring of dollars would lead to higher student achievement, and what might happen in two years when the stimulus money ends.” &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/education/28educ.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=education"&gt;(Stimulus Plan Would Provide Flood of Aid to Education&lt;/a&gt; by Sam Dillon, NYT, January 27, 2009)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.newamerica.net/"&gt;New America Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy institute that monitors education spending reports that the formula does not effectively allocate the most money to states with the greatest need. “Stimulus funding does not take into account districts with large special education and English language learner populations.  These districts with the socially and academically neediest students will benefit the most from the infusion of additional federal dollars.” Read &lt;a href="http://www.newamerica.net/blog/ed-money-watch/2009/first-look-stimulus-spending-9711"&gt;First Look at Stimulus Spending&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring in some areas has been frozen in my own school district and certainly extra funds will be welcome. But will the Stimulus Plan address the long-term needs of districts to fund special education under IDEA?&lt;/p&gt;

In part, this is because a lot more was known about variation in domesticated animals and plants than in natural species. However, it wasn't considered by everyone to be a good approach -- Wallace always thought Darwin's argument was weakened by relying so much on domestication as an analogy with natural processes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Some things I found interesting in this chapter:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Species are hard to define.  We talked in class about how there is no clear definition of species and how this causes problems in biology.  Well, Darwin recognized the difficulty very early (p.67).&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nor shall I here discuss the various definitions which have been given of the term species. No one definition has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Darwin begins to suggest that the variation within species (e.g., varieties) is the same stuff that turns into differences among species.  He introduces the term "incipient species" to indicate this.  However, not all incipient species will become species -- some may go exinct and some may not change further (p.76).&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hence I believe a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species; but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of by the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species necessarily attain the rank of species. They may whilst in this incipient state become extinct, or they may endure as varieties for very long periods."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Sometimes daughter species can co-exist with parental species -- it is not always a gradual change of one species into another.  In other words, Darwin recognizes cladogenesis (indeed, something compatible with punctuated equilibria) and not only anagenesis (p.76) .&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"If a variety were to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species, it would then rank as the species, and the species as the variety; or it might come to supplant and exterminate the parent species; or both might co-exist, and both rank as independent species."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Nevertheless, Darwin does not think that species are real. They are just convenient constructs (p.76).&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species, as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake."&lt;/blockquote&gt;UPDATE: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2009/02/myths_about_darwin.php"&gt;John Wilkins&lt;/a&gt; does not think that this and similar passages indicate that Darwin considered species as mere conveniences, only that he considered the distinction between varieties (which he called "incipient species") and species to be mainly arbitrary.  He may have a point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Darwin suggests that widespread, numerous species are likely to produce more daughter species (p.77).  This would seem to contradict later models of speciation involving geographic isolation, especially ones based on drift in small isolates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hence it is the most flourishing, or, as they may be called, the dominant species,—  those which range widely over the world, are the most diffused in their own country, and are the most numerous in individuals,—which oftenest produce well-marked varieties, or, as I consider them, incipient species."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;6) Darwin has compiled a series of data (he doesn't show them here) comparing genera that are diverse (lots of species) and those that are not, and argues that larger genera include species that themselves include more varieties.  He argues on this basis that dominant lineages will become more dominant, since these varieties are incipient species.  However, he also notes that this does not continue indefinitely because some previously dominant lineages disappear and some small genera can expand.&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/R8wZr4MJJfQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233526048757"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/stein_backs_out.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ffe2de6568cd759d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Stein backs out</title><published>2009-02-01T20:34:52Z</published><updated>2009-02-01T20:34:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/zZL7Lq5kT2c/stein_backs_out.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/stein_backs_out.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good news, all! &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/vermont_speaker_decision_comes.php#comment-1363971"&gt;Ben Stein has withdrawn from the UVM commencement&lt;/a&gt;. I think we can thank Richard Dawkins' clout for helping with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the letter from President Fogel. They asked Stein to speak as an authority on economics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Professor Dawkins,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As one who has been deeply instructed by your work and who applauds your scientific leadership, I was honored to find a personal email from you in my inbox, but very sorry indeed that the occasion was the decision to invite Ben Stein to be a Commencement speaker and honorary degree recipient. Although we have recently learned that Mr. Stein will be unable to receive the honorary degree here or to serve as Commencement speaker, please know that it was our expectation that his remarks would address the global economic crisis and that he would speak from his widely acknowledged area of expertise on the economy. We regret that he will be unable to do so.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With thanks again for writing, with admiration, and with every good wish--Daniel Mark Fogel, President, The University of Vermont
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And Dawkins' reply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear President Fogel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much indeed for your extremely gracious letter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I cannot disguise my gladness that Ben Stein will not be going to Vermont. Thank you very much for letting me know. I wish you, and your great university all good fortune. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With my very best wishes, and thanks again for your letter
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Yours sincerely
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Richard Dawkins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The department has moved to a new building, the crayfish lab is gone, I am out of science, so chances of following up on that study are very low. And what we did was too small even for a Least Publishable Unit, so, in order to have the scientific community aware of our results, I posted them (with agreement from my co-authors) on my blog. So, although I myself am unlikely to continue studying the relationship between the circadian system and the aggressive behavior in crayfish, I am hoping others will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a paper just came out on exactly this topic - &lt;a href="http://jbr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/24/1/64" title=""&gt;Circadian Regulation of Agonistic Behavior in Groups of Parthenogenetic Marbled Crayfish, &lt;i&gt;Procambarus sp.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Abud J. Farca Luna, Joaquin I. Hurtado-Zavala, Thomas Reischig and Ralf Heinrich from the Institute for Zoology, University of Gottingen, Germany: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Crustaceans have frequently been used to study the neuroethology of both agonistic behavior and circadian rhythms, but whether their highly stereotyped and quantifiable agonistic activity is controlled by circadian pacemakers has, so far, not been investigated. Isolated marbled crayfish (Procambarus spec.) displayed rhythmic locomotor activity under 12-h light:12-h darkness (LD12:12) and rhythmicity persisted after switching to constant darkness (DD) for 8 days, suggesting the presence of endogenous circadian pacemakers. Isogenetic females of parthenogenetic marbled crayfish displayed all behavioral elements known from agonistic interactions of previously studied decapod species including the formation of hierarchies. Groups of marbled crafish displayed high frequencies of agonistic encounters during the 1st hour of their cohabitation, but with the formation of hierarchies agonistic activities were subsequently reduced to low levels. Group agonistic activity was entrained to periods of exactly 24 h under LD12:12, and peaks of agonistic activity coincided with light-to-dark and dark-to-light transitions. After switching to DD, enhanced agonistic activity was dispersed over periods of 8-to 10-h duration that were centered around the times corresponding with light-to-dark transitions during the preceding 3 days in LD12:12. During 4 days under DD agonistic activity remained rhythmic with an average circadian period of 24.83 ± 1.22 h in all crayfish groups tested. Only the most dominant crayfish that participated in more than half of all agonistic encounters within the group revealed clear endogenous rhythmicity in their agonistic behavior, whereas subordinate individuals, depending on their social rank, initiated only between 19.4% and 0.03% of all encounters in constant darkness and displayed no statistically significant rhythmicity. The results indicate that both locomotion and agonistic social interactions are rhythmic behaviors of marbled crayfish that are controlled by light-entrained endogenous pacemakers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best way for me to explain what they did in this study is to do a head-to-head comparison between our study and their study - it is striking how the two are complementary! On one hand, there is no overlap in methods at all (so no instance of scooping for sure), yet on the other, both studies came up with similar results, thus strengthening each other's findings.  You may want to read my post for the introduction to the topic, as I explain there why studying aggression in crayfish is important and insightful, what was done to date, and what it all means, as well as the standard methodology in the field. So, let's see how the two studies are similar and how the two differ:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) We were sure we used the &lt;i&gt;Procambarus clarkii&lt;/i&gt; species. They are probably not exactly sure what species they had, so they denoted it as &lt;i&gt;Procambarus sp.&lt;/i&gt;, noting in the Discussion that it was certainly NOT the &lt;i&gt;Procambarus clarkii&lt;/i&gt;, which makes sense as our animals were wild-caught in the USA and theirs in Germany. As both studies got similar results, this indicates that this is not a single-species phenomenon, but can be generalizable at least to other crayfish, if not broader to other crustaceans, arhtropods or all invertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) We used only males in our study.  They used only females.  In crayfish, both sexes fight.   It is nice, thus, to note that other aspects of the behavior are similar between sexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) We used the term 'aggression'.  They use the term 'agonistic behavior', which is scientese for 'aggression', invented to erase any hints of anthropomorphism. Not a bad strategy, generally, as assumed aggression in some other species has been later shown to be something else (e.g., homosexual behavior), but in crayfish it is most certainly aggression: they meet, they display, they fight, and if there is no place to escape, one often kills the other - there is no 'loving' going on there, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) The sizes of animals were an order of magnitude different between the two studies. Their crayfish weighed around 1-2g while ours were 20-40g in body mass. This may be due to species differences, but is more likely due to age - they used juveniles while we used adults. Again, it is nice to see that results in different age groups are comparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) We did not measure general locomotor activity of our animals in isolation. We, with proper caveats, used aggressive behavior of paired animals as a proxy for general locomotor activity, and were straightforward about it - we measured aggressive behavior alone in a highly un-natural setup. As Page and Larimer (1972) have done these studies before, we did not feel the need to replicate those with our animals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study, however, did monitor gross locomotor activity of isolated crayfish. Their results, confirming what Page and Larimer found out, demonstrate once again that activity rhythms are a poor marker of the underlying circadian pacemaker (which is why Terry Page later focused on the rhythm of electrical activity of the eye, electroretinogram - ERR - in subsequent studies) in crayfish. Powerful statistics tease out rhythmicity in most individuals, but this is not &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/clock_tutorial_4_on_methodolog.php" title=""&gt;a rhythm I would use&lt;/a&gt; if I wanted to do more complex studies, e.g., &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/clock_tutorial_6_to_entrain_or.php" title=""&gt;analysis of entrainment&lt;/a&gt; to exotic LD cycles or to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/clock_tutorial_10_entrainment.php" title=""&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/clock_tutorial_11_phaseshiftin.php" title=""&gt;interpret&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/clock_tutorial_12_constructing.php" title=""&gt;Phase&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/clock_tutorial_13_using_the_ph.php" title=""&gt;Response&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/clock_tutorial_14_interpreting.php" title=""&gt;Curve&lt;/a&gt;. Just look at their representative example (and you know this is their best):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="crayfish image 1.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/crayfish%20image%201.JPG" width="285" height="448" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can barely make out the rhythm even in the light-dark cycle (white-gray portion of the actograph) and the rhythms in constant darkness (solid gray) are even less well defined - thus only statistical analysis (bottom) can discover rhythms in such records. The stats reveal a peak of activity in the early night and a smaller peak of activity at dawn, similarly to what Page and Larimer found in their study, and similar to what we saw during our experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) They used an arena of a much larger size than ours. We did it on purpose - we wanted to 'force' the animals to fight as much as possible by putting them in tight quarters where they cannot avoid each other, as we were interested in physiology and wanted it intensified so we could get clearly measurable (if exaggerated) results.  Their study is, thus, more ecologically relevant, but one always has to deal with pros and cons in such decisions: more realistic vs. more powerful. They chose realism, we chose power. Together, the two approaches reinforce and complement each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) As I explained in my old post - there are two methodological approaches in this line of research:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two standard experimental practices are used in the study of aggression in crustaceans. In one, two or more individuals are placed together in an aquarium and left there for a long period of time (days to weeks). After the initial aggressive encounters, the social status of an individual can be deduced from its control of resources, like food, shelter and mates.

&lt;p&gt;In the other paradigm, two individuals are allowed to fight for a brief period of time (less than an hour), after which they are isolated again and re-tested the next day at the same time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They used the first method.  We modified the second one (testing repeatedly, every 3 hours over 24 hours, instead of just once a day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they did was place 6 individuals in the aquarium, a couple of hours before lights-off, then monitor their aggressive behavior over several days. What they found, similar to us, is that the most intense fights resulting in a stable social hierarchy occur in the early portion of the night:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="crayfish image 2.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/crayfish%20image%202.JPG" width="448" height="320" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the social hierarchy is established on that first night, the levels of aggression drop significantly, and occasional bouts of fights happen at all times, with perhaps a slight increase at the times of light switches: both off and on. Released into constant darkness, the pattern continues, with the most dominant individual initiating aggressive encounters a little more often during light-transitions then between them.  The other five animals had no remaining rhythm of agonistic behavior: they just responded to attacks by the Numero Uno when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our study we tried to artificially elevate the levels of aggression by repeatedly re-isolating and re-meeting two animals at a time. And even with that protocol, we saw the most intense fights at early night, and most conclusive fights, i.e., those that resulted in stable social hierarchy, also occuring at early nights, while the activity at other time of the day or night were much lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) The goals of two studies differed as well, i.e., we asked somewhat different questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study was designed to provide some background answers that would tell us if a particular hypothesis is worth testing: winning a fight elevates serotonin in the nervous system; elevated serotonin correlated with the hightened aggression in subsequent fights, more likely leading to subsequent victories; crayfish signal dominance status to each other via urine; melatonin is a metabolic product of serotonin; melatonin is produced only during the night with a very sharp and high peak at the beginning of the night; if there is more serotonin in the nervous system, there should be more melatonin in the urine; perhaps melatonin may be the signature molecule in the urine indicating social status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to see if this line of thinking is worth pursuing, we needed to see, first, if the most aggressive bouts happen in the early night and if the most decisive fights (those that lead to stable hiararchy) happen in the early night.  This is what we found, indicating that our hypothesis is worth testing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They asked a different set of questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a circadian rhythm of locomotor activity? They found: Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Is there a circadian rhythm of aggression? They found: Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Do the patterns of general activity and aggressive activity correlate with each other? They found: Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Does the aggression rhythm persist in constant darkness conditions? They found: Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Do all individuals show circadian rhythm of aggression?  They found: No.  Only the most dominant individual does. The others just defend themselves when attacked.&lt;br&gt;
Is there social entrainment in crayfish, i.e., do they entrain their rhythms to each other in constant conditions? They found: No. All of them just keep following their own inherent circadian periods and drift apart after a while.&lt;br&gt;
Is there a pattern of temporal competitive exclusion, i.e., do submissive individuals shift their activity patterns so as not to have to meet The Badassest One?  They found: No. All of them just keep following their own inherent circadian periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a nice study overall, the first publication I know of that attempts to connect the literature on circadian rhythms in crayfish to the literature on aggressive behavior in crayfish.&lt;/p&gt;

Baker explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Salted&lt;/i&gt; is typically delivered by a third party as a way to get into someone else&amp;#39;s fight — person one insults person two, and person three informs person one that he or she has just been salted. It&amp;#39;s an exclamation point on someone else&amp;#39;s insult…. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				&lt;i&gt;Salted&lt;/i&gt;, in this usage, appears to be exclusive to the region, and its demographic reaches from late grammar school into high school. The etymology of &lt;i&gt;salted&lt;/i&gt;, however, is the subject of much debate. One camp says it's an abbreviation of &lt;i&gt;insulted&lt;/i&gt;, and the word is actually &amp;quot;sulted.&amp;quot; Others say it&amp;#39;s short for &lt;i&gt;assaulted&lt;/i&gt;. The third school, and the one that is most convinced that it&amp;#39;s right, says it simply comes from the idea of throwing salt into a wound. But when it is used, and how, is not up for debate; and in this case, the particular word may be new but the role it plays is not. Depending on where you grew up and when, you may have heard other terms perform similar duty: &amp;quot;Burned.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Busted.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Faced.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Dissed.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sauced.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes next should be utterly predictable to Language Log readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like the way &amp;quot;the Eskimos have all those words for snow,&amp;quot; one Boston Latin student said when I asked why we have so many terms for the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the popular notion of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1087"&gt;lexical abundance&lt;/a&gt; is alive and well at Boston Latin School, with the hardy snow-classifying Eskimos serving as the inevitable reference point. And it's handy that the student voiced this sentiment, sparing Baker the rhetorical dirty work of bringing in the obligatory snow-word trope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker&amp;#39;s overall point in the article isn&amp;#39;t really about the local abundance of available put-downs (since, as he acknowledges, such insults are &amp;quot;not exclusive to Boston&amp;quot;), but about the singularly Bostonian pungency of &lt;i&gt;salted&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;i&gt;salted&lt;/i&gt; is better because it's more cruel in that direct, remorseless way that children have. It is not, like its ancestors, meant to be antagonistic. It is final. There is no comeback. You've been salted. It stings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This at least provides an extra dimension to the usual argument of lexical richness, assessing not just quantity but also quality. For an insult-prone social group like Boston schoolchildren, it's helpful to have lots and lots of cruel put-downs at your disposal, but it's even better to have one especially caustic one. Baker, however, wants &lt;i&gt;salted &lt;/i&gt;to say much more about &amp;quot;this city, its people, and our wicked sense of humor.&amp;quot; Investing so much revelatory power in one particular word can make for a compelling magazine article, but it&amp;#39;s another form of pop-Whorfian reductionism nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233517632524"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/young_darwin_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8415b4a564b1853</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="History"/><title type="html">Young Darwin</title><published>2009-02-01T17:18:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-01T17:18:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/i66qt-X-TO4/young_darwin_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/young_darwin_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;NPR is getting with the program and are running weekly segments on evolution.

Our perception of objective moral values is on a par with our perception of the outer world with the five senses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if this parallelism between moral values and the outer world is true, then it means that the argument may be turned into something like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) If God does not exist, then an objective outer world does not exist.&lt;br&gt;2) An objective outer world does exist.&lt;br&gt;3) Therefore God exists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this second argument is used and it is proven not convincing, why should be the moral argument, which is a parallel argument, be convincing? Or, if you think this second argument is not convincing, why is it so?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dr. Craig responded by saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;On this basis you construct a parallel argument, which, if dubious, ought to make us think that the moral argument is also dubious. Now the parallel argument you construct is actually a sort of cosmological argument for God’s existence. In fact, I think it is a sound argument! It is obviously valid, and both the premises seem to me to be true. For the objective outer world obviously exists, and if God did not exist, then no world at all would exist, including an objective outer world! It’s not that if God did not exist, then the outer world would be merely a subjective illusion; rather it’s that there wouldn’t be anything at all!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first premise of your parallel argument threatens to beg the question and is not apt to appear more plausible than its negation to someone who is not already a theist. By contrast, as you know, the first premise of the moral argument is one that many atheists themselves believe and argue for. Thus, although the premises of your two arguments are parallel, the support for the premises is quite different.&lt;/blockquote&gt;What Craig said is that these two arguments are parallel but that the one for the existence of an outer world threatens to beg the question and that skeptics just wouldn't be apt to think it’s plausible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a skeptic I think there is more room for discussion here. Doesn’t the first premise in the moral argument "threaten" to beg the question in the same way? And can’t we reverse things and say that since the argument for the outer world isn’t plausible then neither is the moral argument?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think so. Any thoughts? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Online school is becoming more common; the article states, "Students taking classes entirely online almost doubled statewide from the 2006-2007 school year to 2007-2008, a jump from 2,544 students to 5,042 students."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm casually familiar with the concept of online schools for kids on the spectrum (and other kids too!) from my interactions with my local parent community.  &lt;a href="http://www.connectionsacademy.com/state/home.asp?schoolCode=orca"&gt;Oregon Connections Academy (ORCA)&lt;/a&gt; is the school of choice for quite a number of spectrumites in my part of the world.  For many of those kids (believing the parent's reports anyway ;-), it's made a world of positive difference.  And for many of the same reasons stated in the Minnesota article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I'm way too old to have had an opportunity like online schooling--computers didn't even show up in my school until I was nearly in high school, and those were used as part of math classes and little else.  It was nearly 5 years after my high school graduation that the Internet was born.  I can imagine though (incorporating some experiences I've had with online learning at the college level), and truly I would have thrived in such an environment (as opposed to my actual early schooling experiences which nearly resulted in institutionalization--"&lt;a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/There+but+for+the+grace+of+God"&gt;there but for the grace of God&lt;/a&gt; go I").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly neat-o is that the very model of online school itself may eliminate many of the disabilities that can get in the way learning for some people on the spectrum: removing the sensory stress of the classroom environment, enabling communication and social interaction at a slower pace where it can actually be processed and understood, providing structure for organization to bypass "executive functioning" issues, putting control for learning more into the student's own hands--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accommodations don't always need to be special and fancy.  Sometimes the world itself can naturally accommodate.  It's about finding the best possible match between a student and their learning environment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233511632096"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3855">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d4c52bde8ce8b199</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="clever advertising"/><category term="football"/><title type="html">Why It's Good to Get Your Commercial Banned From the Super Bowl</title><published>2009-02-01T17:16:58Z</published><updated>2009-02-01T17:16:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/uXutDUH0xiY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/are-superbowl-commercials-better-when-theyre-banned/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Not many people have a lot of money to throw around these days, so how is the recession affecting ad spending on the super-expensive Super Bowl?

You can say what you want, and everyone assumes you’re just some antisocial jerk in his basement. Doing it in real life can be… difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes have trouble in social situations because someone will say something that is perhaps not supported by reality, and I have wind up jumping right in. I don’t say they’re stupid or anything like that, but people identify with their ideas, so saying that an idea is wrong is basically saying &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are wrong, and maybe even implying they’re stupid (or, more likely, they wind up inferring it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a delicate thing, trying to change someone’s thinking. Do it too strongly and you violate &lt;a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/"&gt;Wil’s Rule&lt;/a&gt; (in his banner). Do it too weakly and you may feel you’re not true to your convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why &lt;a href="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2009/01/skeptic-etiquette.html"&gt;Allyson Beatrice’s post on Cocktail Party Physics about skeptical etiquette&lt;/a&gt; is so wonderful. It’s long, but well worth your time to read; it’s funny and true and may hit home. I have lots of friends I can call on their dumbosity, just as they do on mine, and we’ll laugh about it. But that’s not always true in every social situation… and it’s a minefield out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone who reads my blog is a self-identified skeptic, of course, and some folks may be skeptical about some things but not others. Still, I just bet you deal with friends/family/strangers who talk about astrology/homeopathy/antivax stuff. What do you do when that happens? The comments are open.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with a real axe to grind had to have been on the committee
that picked this old fraud". Layla Nasreddin, posting on
RichardDawkins.net, has found the probable answer to the identity of
that 'someone'. Ben Stein is an old pal of the President of the
University of Vermont, Daniel Fogel. One is bound to wonder, therefore,
whether the letters that many of us have been writing to Fogel will cut
any ice. If you have written to Fogel, therefore, it would be a good
idea to Forward your letter now to the entire Board of Trustees of the
University of Vermont, and the two administrators in charge of the
Trustees. Here's a handy list of three addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:trustees@uvm.edu"&gt;trustees@uvm.edu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="mailto:Corinne.Thompson@uvm.edu"&gt;Corinne.Thompson@uvm.edu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="mailto:estjohn@uvm.edu"&gt;estjohn@uvm.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is highly unlikely that you'll get UVM to rescind an invitation, but you can make them squirm a little bit so that they'll think twice before inviting old cronies who happen to be ignorant jerks to this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/vermont_speaker_decision_comes.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/RKXFfmcPbW8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233504606426"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_588.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/df25c0ec13572673</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-02-01T13:42:02Z</published><updated>2009-02-01T13:42:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Q9T-TtrMvdI/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_588.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_588.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_588.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_588.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Q9T-TtrMvdI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233504499430"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/should_i_go_or_sometimes_the_universe_la.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a5ff9039586f18d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Should I go to this "medical" conference?

&lt;p&gt;I travel a lot and I try to take advantage of the hotel's amenities where appropriate. As I'm not in the least bit picky about shampoo and conditioner, I will most often use what's provided. And I've been noticing a disturbing trend: soap makers want to cover me with food. Specifically, they want to fill my hair with fruit. Newsflash: I am not Carmen Miranda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen ginger, green tea, white tea, vanilla, almond, coconut, spearmint, peppermint, raspberry, parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. But today, I reached my limit. Today's choice: bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandas favor bamboo and Tiki lounges employ it effectively. I like bamboo as well, and once owned several delightful acres of it in Virginia. That said, bamboo has none of the qualities I want associated with my hair. It is stiff, brittle, and green. It also grows quickly, which may be seen to have some advantage, but honestly I'd prefer barber visits to be spread out as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233500941603"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/irreversible-does-not-mean-unstoppable/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/11d3325b2d209acb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Science"/><title type="html">Irreversible Does Not Mean Unstoppable</title><published>2009-02-01T14:50:34Z</published><updated>2009-02-01T14:50:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/irreversible-does-not-mean-unstoppable/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Susan Solomon, ozone hole luminary and Nobel Prize winning chair of IPCC, and her colleagues, have just published a paper entitled “&lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/01/28/0812721106.abstract"&gt;Irreversible climate change because of carbon dioxide emissions&lt;/a&gt;” in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  We at realclimate have been getting a lot of calls from journalists about this paper, and some of them seem to have gone all doomsday on us. Dennis Avery and Fred Singer &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/11/avery-and-singer-unstoppable-hot-air/"&gt;used the word Unstoppable&lt;/a&gt; as a battle flag a few years ago, over the argument that the observed warming is natural and therefore there is nothing that humanity can do to alter its course.  So in terms of its intended rhetorical association, Unstoppable = Burn Baby Burn.  But let’s not confuse Irreversible with Unstoppable.  One means no turning back, while the other means no slowing down.  They are very different words.  Despair not!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon et al point out that continued, unabated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions to the atmosphere would have climatic consequences that would persist for a thousand years, which they define operationally as “forever”, as in the sense of “Irreversible”.  It is not really news scientifically that atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration stays higher than natural for thousands of years after emission of new CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the carbon cycle from fossil fuels.  The atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration has a sharp peak toward the end of the fossil fuel era, then after humankind has gone carbon neutral (imagine!) the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration starts to subside, quickly at first but after a few centuries settling in a "long tail" which persists for hundreds of thousands of years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long tail was first predicted by a carbon cycle model in 1992 by Walker and Kasting.  My very first post on realclimate was called “&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/03/how-long-will-global-warming-last"&gt;How long will global warming last?&lt;/a&gt;”, all about the long tail.  Here's a &lt;a href="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/reprints/archer.2008.tail_implications.pdf"&gt;review paper&lt;/a&gt; from Climatic Change of carbon cycle models in the literature, which all show the long tail.  A number of us “long tailers” got together (electronically) to do a Long Tail Model Intercomparison Project, &lt;a href="http://www.climate.uvic.ca/LTMIP/"&gt;LTMIP&lt;/a&gt;, just like the big guys PMIP and OCMIP (preliminary results of LTMIP to be appearing soon in Annual Reviews of Earth and Planetary Sciences).  I even wrote you guys a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Long-Thaw-Changing-Climate-Essentials/dp/0691136548/"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual carbon-containing molecules from the fossil fuel spread out into the other carbon reservoirs in the fast parts of the carbon cycle, dissolving in the oceans and getting snapped up by photosynthetic land plants.  The spreading of the carbon is analogous to water poured into one part of a lake, it quickly spreads out into the rest of the lake, rather than remaining in a pile where you poured it, and the lake level rises a bit everywhere.  In the carbon cycle, translated out of this tortured analogy, the atmospheric carbon dioxide content rises along with the contents of the other carbon reservoirs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the airborne fraction of a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release is determined largely by the buffer chemistry of the ocean, and you can get a pretty good answer with a simple calculation based on a well-mixed ocean, ignoring all the complicated stuff like temperature differences, circulation, and biology.  The ocean decides that the airborne fraction of a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release, after it spreads out into the other fast parts of the carbon cycle, will be in the neighborhood of 10-30%.  The only long-term way to accelerate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; drawdown in the long tail would be to actively remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air, which I personally believe will ultimately be necessary.  But the buffering effect of the ocean would work against us here, releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to compensate for our efforts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the long tail, any climate impact from more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the air will be essentially irreversible.  Then the question is, what are the climate impacts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?  It gets warmer, that’s pretty clear, and sea level rises.  Sea level rise is a profound consequence of the long tail of global warming because the response in the past, over geologic time scales, is tens of meters per °C change in global mean temperature, about 100 times stronger than the IPCC forecast for 2100 (about 0.2 meters per °C).  The third impact which gains immortality from the long tail is precipitation.  Here the conventional story has been that climate models are not very consistent in the regional precipitation changes they predict in response to rising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Apparently this is changing with the AR4 suite of model runs, as Solomon et al demonstrated in their Figure 3.  Also, there is a consistent picture of drought impact with warming in some places, for example the American Southwest, both over the past few decades and in medieval time.  The specifics of a global warming drought forecast are beginning to come into focus.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the despair we heard in our interviewers’ questions arose from the observation in the paper that the temperature will continue to rise, even if CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are stopped today.  But you have to remember that the climate changes so far, both observed and committed to, are minor compared with the business-as-usual forecast for the end of the century.  It’s further emissions we need to worry about.   Climate change is like a ratchet, which we wind up by releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Once we turn the crank, there's no easy turning back to the natural climate.  But we can still decide to stop turning the crank, and the sooner the better.  &lt;/p&gt;

As an example, on p. 470 of his recently-released novel &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matter-Iain-M-Banks/dp/0316005371/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we learn that "Marain, the Culture's language, had a phoneme to denote upper case".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linguists would usually call a unit that denotes something a morpheme (or perhaps a word), not a phoneme, even if it was only one phoneme long. (In fact, we sometimes find meaningful units whose effect on pronunciation is just a single feature.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, it's odd to find a morpheme that signals something essentially in the realm of writing, like alphabetic case; and also to find that Marain still uses upper case in (some of) the same ways that English does.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some context may help to clarify why this passage puzzled me. Djan Seriy, an agent of Special Circumstances, is trying to get back to her home, the 8th level of the shellworld Sursamen, to deal with the death of her father. Traveling on the Morthanveld Great Ship &lt;em&gt;Inspiral, Coalescence, Ringdown&lt;/em&gt;, she visits the 303rd Aliens' Lounge, where she meets an attractive stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"And you," she said, remembering to be polite. "Where are you from? May I ask your Full Name?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"Astle-Chulinisa Klatsli LP Quike dam Uast."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"LP?" she said. "The letter L and P?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"The letters L and P," he confirmed, with a small nod and a mischievous smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"Do they stand for something?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"They do. But it's a secret."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;She looked at him doubtfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;He laughed, spread his arms. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m well traveled, Ms Seriy; a Wanderer. I am older than I look, I have met many people and given and shared and received many things. […] I am not the person I was when I took my Full Name, and I am not definable just by that any more. A nested mystery in the centre of my name is no more than I deserve. Trust me.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Dyan Seriy thought about this. He had called himself a Wanderer (they were talking Marain, the Culture's language; it had a phoneme to denote upper case).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, does this "phoneme" occur at the start of every sentence, and in the initial letters of proper names, as well as in certain words used as terms of art, like "Wanderer"? This passage suggests, not for the first time, that Banks is confused about the difference between a language and a writing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it might be that the Culture, along with its other advanced technologies, has finally achieved the goal of Enlightenment thinkers like John Wilkins, who tried to design "philosophical" languages with a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and letters, and in which the sequence of sounds or letters in each word would encode a sort of Dewey Decimal system of ontological classification. Over the past few centuries, we've learned why this is a bad idea from a semantic point of view (see Jorge Luis Borges' 1929 essay &lt;a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/wilkins.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Idioma Analítico de John Wilkins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a form of the counter-argument) and also from a phonetic point of view (see &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005437.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for some discussion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the Culture's biological manipulations of the human stock, including more-or-less eternal life and the ability to change size, shape and sex at will, have changed the characteristics that make "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005437.html"&gt;duality of patterning&lt;/a&gt;" a good linguistic idea. However, I've never seen any indication in Banks' works that he has this sort of thing in mind. Instead, I'm afraid that he just has some form of the usual naive ideas about the structure of language and the relations between speech and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klatsli Quike, to call the handsome stranger by his non-full name, turns out to be an avatoid of the &lt;em&gt;Liveware Problem&lt;/em&gt;, a modified Delta-class General Contact Unit. A bit later in the story, he communicates covertly with Djan Seriy by flashing patterns from a laser built into his retina,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;expressed in nonary Marain, the nine-part binary base of the Culture's language.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From explanations elsewhere in Banks&amp;#39; works, we know that &amp;quot;nonary&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the system&amp;#39;s coding is actually base nine, but rather that the symbols in the Marain alphabet (and presumably its phoneme inventory) can be represented as 3×3 bit patterns. The resulting set of 512 symbols is larger than alphabets (or phoneme inventories) typically are; it&amp;#39;s a plausible size for a syllabary — but it&amp;#39;s not at all clear, as far as I know, what the mapping to pronunciation is actually like, or what it means in that context to have &amp;quot;a phoneme to denote upper case&amp;quot;. Is one of the 512 symbols devoted to this? or one of the nine bits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks doesn't write "hard" science fiction, and the lack of (pseudo-)explanations for displacement and mind-reading and the like in his works doesn't bother me. The problem that I have with his linguistic inventions is not that they're mysterious, but rather that they're too specific in puzzlingly implausible ways.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233498450360"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5817">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4010d29475ecbd6e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Why do people laugh at creationists?

Mam nadzieję, że tam zaglądacie, bo inaczej omija Was sporo ciekawych rzeczy, czasami mniej, czasami bardziej poważnych. Nie wiem czy wiadomości z rynku wydawniczego są na tyle ważne żeby poświęcać im oddzielne posty na blogu (jeśli tak uważacie, dajcie znać), ale jest okazja żeby to zrobić. &lt;a href="http://piw.pl"&gt;Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy&lt;/a&gt; nie ma odrębnych stron dla poszczególnych zapowiadanych książek i &lt;a href="http://piw.pl/zapowiedzi.php"&gt;wrzuca je hurtowo w jedno miejsce&lt;/a&gt;, skąd znikają po ukazaniu się na rynku. Warto więc odnotować fakt, że 16 lutego w serii &lt;span&gt;Biblioteka Myśli Współczesnej&lt;/span&gt; ukaże się książka Jeremy'ego Stangrooma&lt;span&gt;"Co myślą naukowcy"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;Czy za pomocą elektroniki można poznać uczucia innych osób? Czy już niedługo będziemy mogli czytać w cudzych myślach? Czy będziemy używać wirusów do walki z bakteriami? Jak możemy zapobiec zdominowaniu ludzkości przez inteligentne maszyny? Czy Homo sapiens skazany jest na wymarcie?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;  Książka filozofa Jeremy’ego Stangrooma przynosi interesujący przegląd najdynamiczniej rozwijających się gałęzi wiedzy naukowej, informuje o pomysłach, ideach i eksperymentach, nad którymi obecnie pracują psychologowie, neurolodzy, genetycy, biolodzy ewolucyjni czy bakteriolodzy. Składa się z jedenastu wywiadów z wybitnymi przedstawicielami nauki. Są wśród nich słynny psycholog i językoznawca Steven Pinker, kontrowersyjny cybernetyk Kevin Warwick, socjobiolog Edward O. Wilson czy astrofizyk Martin Rees. Mówią oni o swojej pracy naukowej, najbardziej obiecujących kierunkach badań, przyszłości i granicach nauki oraz jej znaczeniu dla społeczeństwa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Pełną listę bohaterów książki i tematy przez nich poruszane można zobaczyć &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0415334276/ref=sib_dp_pt/278-7332865-0051850#reader-page"&gt;tutaj&lt;/a&gt;.

Lets unpack it and lay it out for examination.  One way to do that is by using the fundamental critical thinking skills that we should all have learned in school.  I think of them as the seven dwarves&lt;br&gt;- Who&lt;br&gt;- What&lt;br&gt;- Where&lt;br&gt;- When&lt;br&gt;- Why&lt;br&gt;- How&lt;br&gt;- How Much or Scope&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By applying the Seven Dwarves or Seven Critical Questions using a brainstorming technique, we have a nice easy to remember tool for unpacking and analyzing complicated concepts.  Since a rigorous application of them to this comment would take too much time, I've opted to just pick some common sense critical questions to get us started.  They are the following.  If any of you can think of any more, please contribute them in the comments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Who are you?   Who originated that information?&lt;br&gt;* What do you have to go on?  What are some precedents?&lt;br&gt;* Where did you get that information?  Where will or did it happen? &lt;br&gt;* When did you get that information? When was the origin of that information?&lt;br&gt;* Why do you say that? Why would that be true? Why should I care?&lt;br&gt;* How do you know?  Are you in a position to know?  How do you figure?  How does that follow?&lt;br&gt;* How Much, How often, what is the Scope, and to what degree?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and a couple of words that can be thought of as JUICY TIDBITS are&lt;br&gt;* Would and&lt;br&gt;* Should.&lt;br&gt;When you see these words, you should think "Fish in a barrel" or "Low Hanging Fruit" because they require support, and the data-driven debater can easily dismantle or support a "would" or a "should".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Position To Know And Agnosticism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now lets decompose the comment.&lt;br&gt;1. He will come down&lt;br&gt;2. and visit with you,&lt;br&gt;3. except you live your life&lt;br&gt;4. as though you don't want Him to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;1. He will come down &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really?  The commenter is in a position to know?&lt;br&gt;Lets rephrase that into a question.&lt;br&gt;Here are the seven dwarves applid to this claim but then I just pick some that I feel would do the job for brevity.&lt;br&gt;- Who will come down?&lt;br&gt;- What will come down?&lt;br&gt;- Where will he come down?&lt;br&gt;- When will he come down?&lt;br&gt;- Why will he come down? Is there some principle that would warrant it?&lt;br&gt;- How will he come down?&lt;br&gt;- How Much will He come down, to what degree, what is the scope or the upper and lower bounds of His Visit?  Will he permit me to video tape it at a Football Game or will it be too subtle for me to recognize?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will He come down?  Why would he come down?  Why should he come down?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When has he come down in the past that is not recorded in The Bible? Christianitiy is in some serious need of CROSS-CHECKING. How do you know?  Do you presume to know the mind of God?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This statement has some hidden dependencies.  &lt;br&gt;1a. It depends on the commenter being in a position to know what God will do and I know that can't be right with as many times as I get told that I can't predict or know or tell God what to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1b. It depends on God wanting to come down, and we know that no-one is in a position to know why God would want to come down because no-one knows the mind of God and being God he's free to change his mind anytime he likes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1c. It depends on there being a principle in place that would warrant God Coming down. This is the foundation for my rebuttal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;2. and visit with you, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;2a. It depends on the commenter being in a position to know and we know that he's not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2b. It depends on presuming that God would come down and that he would visit with me if he did come down and that I would recognize it if he did.  We can't say that he would come down, and we can't say that he would visit me if he did come down and we can't say I'd recognize a visit because we are not in a position to know any of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;3. except you live your life &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;3a. Again, the commenter is not in position to know.  I have a good job, and the respect of my peers.  My moral center is a reasonable one, with several facets, which include such things as "Utility", "Logic" and "The well being of others".  I know that my moral scheme and the Christians both have problems but over all they are compatible.  To say something like this is a Judgement based on lack of information.  I would love it if Jesus appeared to me right now so that I could turn this rebuttal into an endorsement for Jesus, but If I finish it, you'll know he didn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;4. as though you don't want Him to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;4a.  the commenter is not thinking this through.  &lt;br&gt;Protesters are protesting for change.  They protest for reasons such as they want some outcome that is being prevented by those in a position to bring it about.  I am a protester.  I want God to change his strategy to be more in line with how I think because as it is now it doesn't make sense to me and I don't get it and I don't think I ever will.  Its true that I thought I got it at one time, but I came to realize that considering there is such a concept as Luck or Chance, and there is a concept of God, it seemed to me that God had the same characteristics of Luck or Chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I think my understanding of God was a misinterpretation of Chance, and since there is nothing yet to refute that viewpoint, then I am on a one way trip to Spiritual Suicide.  God and all of you Christians reading this should think I'm committing spiritual suicide therefore so should the commenter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what is the principle that warrants a visit from God?&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://web4health.info/it/bipolar-depr-suic-resp.htm"&gt;How to Respond to Expressions of Suicidal Intent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a situation when someone expresses an intention to commit suicide, you should try not to get upset or embarrassed. Keep yourself calm and encourage the person to explain more in detail why and how he/she intends to commit suicide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;The principle is that Suicide is bad, those that want to commit suicide are not well, and the expression of suicidal tendencies warrants intervention appropriate to dispell it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is important enough for him to come down and intervene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;So the key point in this article is that I have noticed that in most cases where a Christian CAN use a Heuristic or a "pre-packaged" argument to rebut an atheist they WILL.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;And usually when you unpack it you can find where it does not syncoronize with what their values should be according to what the commonly accepted characteristics of a Christian are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this case, the commenter has alluded that my spiritual suicidal tendency is not important enough for God to come down and intervene.  The commenter might as well have said that ones suicidal tendencies are not important enough to warrant intervention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can only say, "non-sense" to that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Basketball, tennis, yoga, soccer, "fitness" (= calistethics) and now aerobics: Charlie and his classmates have been doing all of these sports in their Adapted Physical Education class. They have gym everyday at 8.30am (I wish they had it more than once a day, frankly----&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_couch_potatoes_here"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; and getting in motion have always had a restorative effect on Charlie). Charlie's teacher is hoping to get an exercise bike in his class soon and maybe even a treadmill----he's an active kid and sitting at a desk is not easy for him (plus, with Charlie having grown so much, the average middle-school desk might be feeling a bit on the smallish side).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, when we've taken Charlie to sports events specifically for kids with disabilities, the activities just have not seemed sufficiently physical and active for Charlie. He really needs to be physically engaged and to work up a sweat; then he gets happy and into it.  When Charlie was younger, there was a tendency for some teachers and therapists to shy away from getting him more active, almost as if there was the sense that because Charlie was delayed in meeting a number of his gross-motor "milestones," he was a bit "delicate," and it was best not to challenge him too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we all know what happens when expectation are low---so are results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Certainly I understand the need for "safety" first. Nonetheless, it's always seemed a bit puzzling to us, that Charlie might be considered "delicate" and "fragile." A &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/2/690"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the February &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/2/690"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; looks at an adapted sports program for high school students with disabilities and finds that these are, for the most part, "reasonably safe." Out of 210 students, "athletes with autism" had a higher rate of injuries (usually in the form of abrasions and contusions), as did those who have seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That finding raises eyebrows about safety; ultimately, though, I'm just very glad to know that such a study is being done, and that there are efforts underway not only to provide athletic activities for children with disabilities (and there should be for all ages, too), but also to find ways to adapt and accommodate and keep sports activities &lt;em&gt;active &lt;/em&gt;and not just to be about going through the motions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in the pool, Charlie is pretty much on his own and not just because he can swim, but because---he being somewhat more at ease and faster in water than on land---he can take care of himself, for the most part, amid the splashing of the other kids and all the potential hurly-burly of a swimming pool of children in January (with minimal recourse to the outdoors). A real workout works out well for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Yes, that's Charlie swimming in the ocean last summer----it's feeling like it's high time for summer to roll around soon around here!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233476064144"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/radio_reminder_46.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ac8a62d7ccb69f57</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Radio reminder</title><published>2009-02-01T06:27:51Z</published><updated>2009-02-01T06:27:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/OdmheTl7VTc/radio_reminder_46.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/radio_reminder_46.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;They must really be scraping the bottom of the barrel — at 9am Central, Sunday morning, &lt;a href="http://mnatheists.org/content/view/253/1/"&gt;Atheist talk radio&lt;/a&gt; interviews some strange guy named &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/"&gt;Bora Zivkovic&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;But according to the website &lt;a href="http://www.alternetdetox.com.au/shop/product_info.php?products_id=279"&gt;Alternet Detox&lt;/a&gt;, who are flogging detox foot patches, &lt;em&gt;“The sole of the feet, where acupuncture points are concentrated as a reflected area of the whole body, has a great influence on the circulation of the blood as to be called “a second heart”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;strong&gt;little pillows of woo&lt;/strong&gt; are allegedly from Korea, and clearly the people at Alternet Detox didn’t bother to translate the Chinglish (Koringlish??) that came with the product. Here’s an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sap Patch is originated from a folk remedy. Its spirit of trees absorbs accumulated wastes and toxic materials in the body as ointments in oriental medical science do, and radiates negative ion, promoting the circulation of the blood to make your body refreshed and light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human beings are destined to have waste-accumulated feet, which support the body. You can see that by daily experiences like stained socks at night and swollen feet when tired. Accumulated wastes in the body can lead to dropsical legs, fatigue, and even disharmony of the body when metabolism doesn’t work well. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then go on to contradict themselves by saying you must apply it to the sole of the foot for it to work…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to enhance the effect of Sap Patch, it is necessary to apply it on the sole of the feet regardless of symptoms…..Toxic matter often stagnates in the feet, and thus the sole of the foot is the best area to apply to experience the effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…but show this picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/foot-patches.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/foot-patches.jpeg" alt="" title="foot-patches" width="500" height="614"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After which, things just get a little confusing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is ideal to apply it every night until it doesn’t get wet, but, for those who have a serious symptom or took medicine for a long time in the past, SAP Patch tends to get wet continuously. Although the toxic matter is thought to be eliminated when Sap Patch doesn’t get wet, it is better to use Sap Patch once or twice a month even after it doesn’t get wet because toxic matter keep stagnating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, just ridiculous…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients: Tourmaline. This is natural ore produced in Brazil, which forms anion and improves blood circulation of human body by generating infrared rays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right…Infrared rays hey? Hmmm, sounds sciencey (read: bullshit) to me! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dunno, but if you can’t even be bothered to translate your product information correctly, do you really expect me to spend $22.85 on your credulous product? Sorry Alternet Detox, you’re just not trying hard enough. &lt;/p&gt;

First, there was a &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/hubs/boston" title=""&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; hub, then a &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/hubs/london" title=""&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; hub, and now a brand new &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/hubs/nyc" title=""&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; hub. Toronto and Berlin are itching to be the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/hubs/researchtriangle/people" title=""&gt;Research Triangle&lt;/a&gt; group is still pretty small. I think it's due to a different geography. Boston, London and NYC are huge cities with lots of people, including many scientists and bloggers. The areas outside of those cities - the 'countryside' - are really not that relevant to the sizes of those hubs - add a few people here or there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, North Carolina is a large state, in area and population, but there is no humongous city in it - all the scientists and bloggers are spread all over the state.  Why would people from Asheville, or Charlotte, Greensboro, Winston-Salem or Wilmington join the Triangle hub when they don't live there?  I think we should expand the Triangle list to include the entire state and rename the group 'North Carolina' people.  After all, no state has more bloggers on scienceblogs.com than NC, not even close, yet no NC city can come close to one of the Big Cities elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you are in NC, no matter where in it, please join the Triangle location and increase our numbers, so we can compete for a Hub in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/nature_network_hubs.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/TSLFZA4j-Ms" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233465041697"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/you_can_laugh_now.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/71faa4ea62dcaa54</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">You can laugh now....</title><published>2009-02-01T03:27:07Z</published><updated>2009-02-01T03:27:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/_hE0TZnRwU8/you_can_laugh_now.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/you_can_laugh_now.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;...but some people knew waaay back then that news will, one day, move from expensive paper to cheap internet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;TechCrunch surfaced this look at a story that ran back in 1981 that covered
how internet news would someday be delivered. At least watch the last 30 seconds. The reporter remarks it would take more than 2 hours to deliver the digital text needed to read the "online newspaper." She added the per minute (i think) charge was around $5 and comments about the difficulty the new approach would have when competing with the .20 cent daily.

I’d love to. I actually prepared extensively to deal with it, since it’s the argument he almost always trots out to debate for intelligent design, but — and this is a key point — Durston didn’t discuss this stuff at all! He brought out a few of the slides very late in the debate when there was no time for me to refute them, but otherwise, he was relying entirely on vague arguments about a first cause, accusations of corruption against atheists, and very silly biblical nonsense about Jesus. So this really isn’t about revisiting the debate at all — this is the stuff Durston sensibly avoided bringing up in a confrontation with somebody who’d be able to see through his smokescreen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWi9TMwPthE" rel="external "&gt;Durston’s argument, it’s on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. I notice the clowns on Uncommon Descent are crowing that this is a triumphant victory, but note again — Durston did not give this argument at our debate. In a chance to confront a biologist with his claims, Durston tucked his tail between his legs and ran away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with his formula for functional complexity. He took this from a paper by Hazen, Griffin, Carothers, and Szostack; I know Hazen and Szostak’s work quite well, and one thing you have to understand right away is that both are well-known for their work on the origins of life. They are not creationists by any means, and would probably be very surprised to see this paper being touted by a creationist as evidence that evolution is nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the formula that Durston cites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-XTcYrBpaaFzGKbuOBWlvLw-trans.png" alt="" width="180" height="17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t that look impressively sciencey? It’s a very simple equation, though, used to quantify the amount of what Szostak calls “functional information”,&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-y97XnnmB-dbDSfAtQ6LSvg-trans.png" alt="" width="38" height="15"&gt;. It’s being calculated with respect to a specific degree of a particular function, x. If we’re looking at a function x like catalyzing a phosphorylation reaction, for instance, we might want to know how likely a random protein would be at that job. The rest of the equation, then, is very straightforward — we just assess how many different protein sequences, &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-yX4lrjR-rMu4ZuWI0Fk7Zg-trans.png" alt="" width="48" height="15"&gt; meet the criterion of carrying out function x to some specified degree, and then we divide by the total number of possible protein sequences, N. N can easily be very large — if we ask how many possible protein sequences that are 10 amino acids long, with 20 different possible amino acids, the answer is 20&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, or 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;, a very big number. And it gets even bigger very rapidly if you use longer protein sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This big number can be misleading, though. We also want to know what fraction of all those sequences can carry out our function of interest, x, to some degree. This is the value of &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-yX4lrjR-rMu4ZuWI0Fk7Zg-trans.png" alt="" width="48" height="15"&gt;. In the trivial case, maybe catalyzing phosphorylation is incredibly easy, and &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; protein has a level of activity that meets our criterion. Then we’d say that 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; out of 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; proteins can do it, the sequence doesn’t matter, and any 10-amino acid protein you show me has no functional information relative to the function we’re measuring. On the other hand, if there was one and only one sequence that could carry out that catalysis, the functional information of our 10 amino acid sequence is at a maximum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce the metric a little more, Hazen takes the negative log base 2 of this number, which simplify specifies the number of bits necessary to specify the functional configuration of the system. In our example of any protein doing the job, the answer is &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-k4H6to0X7-jlIcpsGxGMZQ-trans.png" alt="" width="127" height="23"&gt;, or &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-0S-TOrVP2DYu9UFcBqzlBg-trans.png" alt="" width="66" height="17"&gt;, which is 0 — no information is required. If only one sequence works, the answer is &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-ed7tIlDEdTiY8rblN4wJ0w-trans.png" alt="" width="105" height="23"&gt;, which, if you plug that into your calculators, is a bit more than 43 bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very easy and cheesily fun to churn out big numbers with these kinds of calculations. For instance, here’s part of the first sentence of the Hazen paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex emergent systems, in which interactions among numerous components or agents produce patterns or behaviors not obtainable by individual components, are ubiquitous at every scale of the physical universe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you strip out the punctuation and spaces from that sentence, there are a total of 181 alphabetic characters there. How many possible arrangements of 26 letters in a sequence 181 characters long can there be? 26&lt;sup&gt;181&lt;/sup&gt;, or 1.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;. It’s huge! If we take the &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-fiTRn0iOiiOO5vu_XIhEpA-trans.png" alt="" width="45" height="17"&gt;, we just produce something more manageable: you could encode that one specific sentence in 851 bits. But it still means the same thing, that this is a very large and improbable number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the Hazen equation does, though, is include that important &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-yX4lrjR-rMu4ZuWI0Fk7Zg-trans.png" alt="" width="48" height="15"&gt; parameter. There is obviously more than one way to communicate the meaning of the sentence than just that one specific arrangement of letters. I rewrote Hazen’s sentence a little less elegantly (the hard part was writing it so it came out to be exactly 181 characters long) here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicated stuff that is built up by many smaller components interacting with each other to make novel arrangements, arrangements that cannot be seen in the single pieces, are common everywhere in the known universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many sentences like that are there? I don’t know, but I’m sure there are a lot; it’s also the case that we don’t even need to be grammatical or elegant to get the basic message across. This works, too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There xxxxxx arre l0ts of xxxx big thijngs xxx xxxxxxx xx made of xxxxxxx littler x thangs xx xxxxxx stuck togther xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hazen is making the point that all 3 of those 181 character sentences are functionally equivalent. To measure the functional complexity of the sequence, you need to at least estimate the number of functional variants and divide by the total number of possible arrangements of letters. This measurement is also only applicable in the context of a specific function, in this case getting across the message of the ubiquity of emergent complexity. This sentence fragment, for instance, would &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; satisfy the requirements of &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-yX4lrjR-rMu4ZuWI0Fk7Zg-trans.png" alt="" width="48" height="15"&gt;, but you know, it might just carry a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; functional message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep this in mind. Hazen’s formula is used to calculate the information content of a &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; function, not all possible functions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional information, which we illustrate with letter sequences, artificial life, and biopolymers, thus represents the probability that an arbitrary configuration of a system will achieve a specific function to a specified degree.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get it? I know, it’s a lot of background and a lot of numbers being thrown around, but this is a computational tool they are using in artificial life simulations. Basically, they are asking, if we make a random letter sequence, what is the probability that it will say something about patterns? Or, if they make a random peptide, what is the probability that it will catalyze a particular reaction they are measuring? Or, if they create a random program in an artificial life simulator like Avida, how likely is it that they’ll get something that can add two numbers together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to try to give you the details of Hazen’s results, since they’re largely tangential to my point here — they look at the distribution of solutions, for instance. But they do observe that in Avida, with an instruction set of 26 commands, and randomly generating 100-instruction programs, they find programs that carry out one logic or arithmetic function in about 1 in a thousand cases. There are about 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt; possible arrangements of 26 instructions taken 100 at a time; any one specific sequence has a &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-y97XnnmB-dbDSfAtQ6LSvg-trans.png" alt="" width="38" height="15"&gt; of 470 bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk Durston &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; the Hazen paper. He has cited it many times in the various debates recorded on the web. It’s wonderful because it’s a real scientific citation, it talks about measuring the functional complexity of things, and it’s got math — simple math, but it’s enough to wow an uninformed crowd. Just watch how he abuses this simple formula!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/01/durston1.jpeg" alt="durston1.jpeg" width="400" height="286"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-XTcYrBpaaFzGKbuOBWlvLw-trans.png" alt="" width="180" height="17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, 3 terms: &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-y97XnnmB-dbDSfAtQ6LSvg-trans.png" alt="" width="38" height="15"&gt;,  &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-yX4lrjR-rMu4ZuWI0Fk7Zg-trans.png" alt="" width="48" height="15"&gt;, and &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-xmkP6Eekpjq3yCpqLxjKHg-trans.png" alt="" width="15" height="15"&gt;. He misuses them all. We start with N, and here’s how he calculates it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/01/durston2.jpeg" alt="durston2.jpeg" width="400" height="290"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang on. N, as Hazen defines it, is the number of possible configurations of n possible elements. Durston doesn’t have a way to calculate that directly, so he invents a kind of proxy: an estimate of the total number of unique individuals that have ever existed. This is wrong. Here we have a simple metric that we could use, for instance, to calculate the number of different possible poker hands that can be dealt from a deck, and instead, Durston is trying to use the number of times a hand has been dealt. Right away, he’s deviated so far from the Hazen paper that his interpretations don’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might say that this is actually a change in our favor. It makes the number N much smaller than it should be, which means the probability of a specific result out of N possibilities is improved. But that’s not even how Durston uses it! Suddenly, he tells us that N is a limit on an evolutionary search (again, that’s not at all how Hazen is using it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the game he’s playing. Durston shows up with a deck of cards for a game of poker; he knows, and you know, that the odds of getting a specific sequence of cards in a 5-hand deal are really low (about 1 in 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;). Then he tells you he only has time to deal out 100 hands to you, and wants to know if you want to just give him the money he’d win right now, since with only 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; trials to test over 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; possibilities, you are going to fall far short of exhausting the search space, and are highly unlikely to find the one specific hand he has in mind…which is true. Of course, none of that has any bearing on how poker is played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, he’s basically abandoned the Hazen paper altogether — it was a veneer of scientific respectablity that he initially holds up in front of us, and then he ignores it to plug numbers he wants into the equation. Then he lowballs his irrelevant version of the number N, and redefines it to be a limit on the number of trials. Sneaky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the next parameter? &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-yX4lrjR-rMu4ZuWI0Fk7Zg-trans.png" alt="" width="48" height="15"&gt; is a rather important value in Hazen’s paper, defined as “the number of different configurations that achieves or exceeds the specified degree of function x”. One of the points in that work is that there are many different ways to accomplish function x, so this can be a fairly significant number. To continue our poker analogy, the goal of a hand is to beat the other hands — that’s our function x, to have a combination of cards that has a greater rarity than every other player’s hand. &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-yX4lrjR-rMu4ZuWI0Fk7Zg-trans.png" alt="" width="48" height="15"&gt; is actually rather large, since the average poker hand will beat half of all other poker hands (and need I add, every round of poker will have one hand that wins!). How does Durston handle &lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/images/eqn/eqn-yX4lrjR-rMu4ZuWI0Fk7Zg-trans.png" alt="" width="48" height="15"&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ignores it. He simply sets it to 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He slides right over this rather significant fact. The next thing we see is that he announces that 140 bits (which is the log base 2 of 10&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;) is the upper bound of information that can be generated by an evolutionary search, and suggests that anything above this magic number number is unreachable by evolution, and anything below it could be reached by random processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that means is that he only accepts one possible solution in an evolutionary lineage. He is estimating the probability that an organism will have precisely the genetic sequence it has, as derived from a purely random sequence, within a limited amount of trials. No incremental approach is allowed, and worse, it is the one and only sequence that is functionally relevant. The only way he imagines a sequence can be reached is by randomization, and all he considers is the conclusion. It really is a gussied-up version of the ‘747 in a junkyard’ argument that the old school creationists still use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, what we’re dealing with is a guy who drones on about basic mathematics and pretends that his conclusions have all the authority of fundamental math and physics behind them. He waves a paper or two around to claim the credibility of the scientific literature, and then ignores the content of that paper to willfully distort the parameters to reach his desired conclusion, in contradiction to the actual positions of the authors. And then he further ignores the actual explanations of evolutionary biology to use a hopelessly naive and fallacious model of his own invention to claim that evolution is false. He’s a pseudoscientific fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand he’s actually in a doctoral program in Canada. I hope that, before his thesis defense, a few competent people look over his thesis and check his interpretations of his sources. I just looked over the Hazen paper and compared it to what he’s claiming about it, and his version is completely bogus.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;d love to. I actually prepared extensively to deal with it, since it&amp;#39;s the argument he almost always trots out to debate for intelligent design, but — and this is a key point — Durston didn&amp;#39;t discuss this stuff at all! He brought out a few of the slides very late in the debate when there was no time for me to refute them, but otherwise, he was relying entirely on vague arguments about a first cause, accusations of corruption against atheists, and very silly biblical nonsense about Jesus. So this really isn&amp;#39;t about revisiting the debate at all — this is the stuff Durston sensibly avoided bringing up in a confrontation with somebody who&amp;#39;d be able to see through his smokescreen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWi9TMwPthE"&gt;Durston's argument, it's on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. I notice the clowns on Uncommon Descent are crowing that this is a triumphant victory, but note again — Durston did not give this argument at our debate. In a chance to confront a biologist with his claims, Durston tucked his tail between his legs and ran away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/durstons_devious_distortions.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/durstons_devious_distortions.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/7qmQbfDQJeQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233458186052"><id gr:original-id="http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/01/csarven-never-lost-an-email-w/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2a1f62c130c4035a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">@csarven never lost an email w…</title><published>2009-02-01T03:11:35Z</published><updated>2009-02-01T03:11:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/01/csarven-never-lost-an-email-w/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;@csarven never lost an email with !mutt &lt;img src="http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233457639232"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-9119972136632687819">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/faec81bf5ba6deaf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Genealogy" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">My New York Ancestors</title><published>2009-01-31T23:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-01T03:11:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/my-new-york-ancestors.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/9119972136632687819/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=9119972136632687819" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The January 24th issue of The New York Times has a article on what New york City must have looked like 400 years ago.

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know what you're thinking.  Give it a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, back at &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/"&gt;ScienceOnline'09&lt;/a&gt;, I was talking with &lt;a href="http://kidsndata.blogspot.com/"&gt;AcmeGirl&lt;/a&gt; about marking the 25th with some lovely Scottish food.  She was talking about haggis.  In the Free-Ride house, seeing as how we don't do meat, we don't do canonical haggis either.  (In 1997, in Scotland, I had a fabulous vegetarian haggis, but I doubt I could reproduce it in my own kitchen, at least on the first try.)  So I was thinking maybe tatties and neeps (potatoes and turnips).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the eve of January 25th, things were kind of wet and cold in our neck of the woods.  And, our garden had just yielded ...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/01/robert_burns_birthday_food_blo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/01/robert_burns_birthday_food_blo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/vfKOZTy-qT4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233450709991"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-3055902205842034934">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/188608fb322e46ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">UFC 94</title><published>2009-01-31T22:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-31T22:15:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/01/ufc-94.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">I've been on a bit of a blog-break for a couple of weeks, as you may or, more likely, have not noticed.  Tonight is UFC 94 with the main event of Georges St. Pierre and BJ (Baby Jay) Penn.  Lyoto "The Dragon" Machida is also fighting Thiago Silva, which should be way great as well.  Some people don't like Machida because they say he's "boring" - I say those people have no idea what they're talking about.  When Silva comes out tonight all full of chicken blood and gun-powder trying to KO Machida, he's going to get a face full of shin-bone and fist meat resulting in a whole lotta nappytime.  Mark my words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My third favorite fighter is also on the card - Jon Fitch.  He and his ultra-awesome opponent, Akihiro Gono, had the best moment ever at the weigh-in when Gono came out wearing spandex, zebra-striped shorts and a huge afro wig.  He then offered it to Fitch and this amazing photo was the result:&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/34748338@N00/3241199565/" title="Afro-Samurai Fitch!"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3465/3241199565_ea442f09db.jpg" width="500" height="358" alt="Fitch Goes Afro!"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Hat tip to the greatness that is &lt;a href="http://www.fightlinker.com"&gt;Fightlinker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.mmajunkie.com"&gt;MMAJunkie&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

&lt;p&gt;The very first blog carnival was conceived right here, in Chapel Hill, some four-five years ago or so. Since then, the idea took off and there are now &lt;a href="http://www.blogcarnival.com/" title=""&gt;thousands&lt;/a&gt; of blog carnivals, some generalist, some regional, but most are topical with topics ranging from food to sports to politics.  But, probably due to the funny name, new bloggers and observers are often baffled at the concept. I thought it would be a good idea to have a session that explains the concept of the carnival, specifically how the carnivals related to science, nature and medicine are somewhat different from other kinds of carnivals, and why they are Good For You.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there are two people who have spent a lot of time studying and writing about science-related carnivals. I am one of them (read &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/07/blog_carnivals_what_is_in_it_f.php" title=""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for the latest, as well as for the links to older material) but as an organizer I did not want to tie myself down with actually leading the session. The other one is &lt;a href="http://10000birds.com/" title=""&gt;Mike Bergin&lt;/a&gt;, so he was the obvious choice to invite to lead this session - &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Blog_carnivals/" title=""&gt;Blog carnivals: why you should participate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike has written probably the &lt;a href="http://10000birds.com/hostwiththemost.htm" title=""&gt;most comprehensive guide&lt;/a&gt; to blog carnivals ever - a must read if you intend to participate in, host or start a carnival. So, in his session, he delivered - a good explanation of what a carnival is, how to approach it as a new blogger (or an old blogger for that matter) and why carnivals are an important aspect of the blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Science_Blogs/" title=""&gt;Science-related carnivals&lt;/a&gt; are similar to popular science magazines, or, in some cases, even to lightly peer-reviewed journals. A well-maintained archive of a carnival is like a human-managed search engine on the topic: you can use it to start your search of a topic and how science blogosphere covered it at the moment it was hot news. This function will become more and more important in the future, as blogosphere becomes older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can go to Google or Technorati and search blogs for a topic, but what you'll get are millions of hits, most of them simple links or copy+paste jobs - useless waste of time. A carnival will contain the best examples of blog coverage of the topic and the included posts will often also contain links to other worthwhile coverage of the same topic - thus a good start for a smart, targeted search. Not to mention how much more fun it is to read stuff with a human touch and an editorial hand as compared to just using an automated, soulless application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But carnivals have several other functions.  And I was happy to see some of them mentioned in other sessions at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, many bloggers use carnivals for self-discipline in their blogging.  Yes, you post LOLcats and YouTube videos most of the time, but once every week or two you make yourself sit down and do some research and write a serious, carnival-worthy post, just so you can submit it to your favourite carnival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the existence of a particular carnival may make a blogger get outside of regular topics and explore something different. For instance, &lt;a href="http://ontheshouldersofgiants.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;The Giant's Shoulders&lt;/a&gt; has provoked many science bloggers to start digging into the history of science and writing posts about classical papers or historical concepts in science.  This was, I understand, stressed strongly in the 'History of Science' session that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One function of carnivals that many appreciate the most is the community building it enables. For intance, in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/the_structure_of_scientific_bl.php" title=""&gt;her analysis of the connectivity&lt;/a&gt; of science blogs, Christina Pikas discovered an unusually tight cluster of female scientist blogs. Several of those bloggers were present at the conference and, in a few sessions, all credited &lt;a href="http://scientiae-carnival.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Scientiae&lt;/a&gt; carnival as one of the key community-building tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could also see (and hear, oh did we ever!) that marine bloggers are also a tightly-knit community. In another session (on blogging networks, for instance) they mentioned that &lt;a href="http://carnivaloftheblue.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Carnival of the Blue&lt;/a&gt; is a key tool for building their community, discovering and introducing new marine biology bloggers, introducing each other and organizing events (even if it's The Invertebrate War - a wonderful community-building tool in itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://10000birds.com/iandthebird" title=""&gt;I And The Bird&lt;/a&gt; was mentioned as an important tool for building communities in the 'Nature blogging' session as well. A carnival similar to Scientiae but focused on minorities in science may come out of discussions at the conference as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, usually around Christmas when everyone is either busy or offline, some carnivals suffer gaps or start appearing dead - managing them takes work!  The discussions at the conference led to appeals to rescue some of those, with immediate results - &lt;a href="http://invertebrates.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Circus of the Spineless&lt;/a&gt; has a new manager and will re-start publishing on Monday. Likewise, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/tangledbank.php" title=""&gt;Tangled Bank&lt;/a&gt; (the carnival equivalent of &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;) is about to stage a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that Mike's session has informed new people about the importance of carnivals and spurred others to revive old or start new ones. &lt;/p&gt;

Interesting, then, to read the words "cost" and "autism" and "minimal" all in the same sentence, in a report about efforts to pass legislation for insurance coverage for autism in Oklahoma from &lt;a href="http://www.kswo.com/Global/story.asp?S=9764332"&gt;KSWO&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Oklahoma legislator says a study by a state group insurance board shows a proposed health insurance coverage mandate for autism would have little impact on costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durant state Senator Jay Paul Gumm said today the study by the Oklahoma State and Education Employees Group Insurance Board showed an impact to premiums of 1% or less and supports another study released last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gumm is author of an autism mandate bill, known as "&lt;a href="http://nickslawok.blogspot.com/"&gt;Nick's Law&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don't know how insurance premiums might be affected were Nick's Law to pass, I think it's important to note that services for individuals on the spectrum don't have to cost a proverbial fortune. On a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/everything_they_own_is_on_ebay"&gt;post about a family putting almost everything they owned on Ebay&lt;/a&gt; to pay for therapies for an autistic son, commenters noted that it's possible to do the &lt;a href="http://www.gfcfdiet.com"&gt;gluten-free casein-free diet&lt;/a&gt; fairly cheaply (for a time, my son was wild about anything wrapped in Vietnamese spring roll wrappers, which sell for very little at Asian food stores). My husband Jim and I were trained in ABA along with Charlie's first therapists and ABA helped us to teach him to ride a bike (really Jim's doing) without paying anyone (well, we have bought Charlie a couple of bikes over the years)---a little DIY spirit goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere around the US: A special needs health care clinic in &lt;a href="http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/298114/17/"&gt;Utah County is closing&lt;/a&gt; due to budget cuts, but in Charleston, South Carolina, last-minute donations have spared a &lt;a href="http://www.live5news.com/Global/story.asp?S=9763352&amp;amp;nav=menu1431_3"&gt;state-funded special needs center&lt;/a&gt; from closing yesterday, Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/43"&gt;Superbowl&lt;/a&gt; is tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I know, most of you probably don&amp;#39;t care. I know I don&amp;#39;t; tomorrow is a lab prep day for me, and I&amp;#39;ll be setting up fly stocks all afternoon. I don&amp;#39;t even know who is playing, and I don&amp;#39;t really care. Some of you might, and that&amp;#39;s all right — my father was a big football fan, although he couldn&amp;#39;t abide the Superbowl since, for all the hype, they were usually poor games — so if you choose to relax with friends and beer and watch the show, it is fine by me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's something I do find interesting, though. One of the petty annoyances of American sports is their ridiculous religiosity. There are always these showboating athletes who piously announce that their greatest triumphs are due to divine intervention (strangely, when they fumble, they don't afterwards shake their fists at the heavens and curse their gods). It's absurd that they believe their omnipotent deity is at all concerned about whether one team wins or another loses, but it's common background noise at these events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, though, I'm encountering media articles that are &lt;a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/28897707/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;critical&lt;/i&gt; of these god-wallopers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does God care who wins? There are few things regarding religion that approach consensus, but it's fair to say that most of us concur with FoxSports.com columnist Mark Kriegel, who recently wrote, "I refuse to believe that God --anyone's God -- has a rooting interest in the outcome of something as secular and perverse as a (football) game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's an editorial where the writer just wishes they'd &lt;a href="http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20090128/NEWS/901280140/1057/SPORTS0908?Title=Warner_s_God_talk_should_be_off_the_record"&gt;knock off the public god talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget the arrogance of that assumption for a moment -- God is with only me. There's something else. I assume some Pittsburgh Steelers are God-fearing men. They can't all be heathens. So whom does God root for in the Super Bowl, the Cardinals or the Steelers?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And with wars going on all over the world and starvation and an economic collapse, with so much to attend to, does God have leisure to root at all?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Do we believe in a shallow, superficial God? God the Sports Fan?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these critics are saying this because they're atheists who disbelieve this nonsense, don't get me wrong; they all seem to be saying that these superficial attributions all trivialize faith. But they are at least doing us the favor of pointing out that these are secular games, and they're a bit embarrassed at the silly piety. It's a step forward, at least. Next step, point and laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

I love it when people do creative things with Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;

Don’t. Understand. The. Argument.  Not even close.  Dualism of the Gaps means that if materialism cannot (yet) explain everything then dualism does not get to be the explanation by default.  It really is that simple.  For us to accept dualism you need to provide some evidence for dualism, and pointing out that not-dualism doesn’t yet explain everything is not evidence for dualism, it’s just evidence of our own lack of knowledge.  And as Novella pointed out, you can’t justify a positive claim with a &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having completely misunderstood the argument from ignorance fallacy that he relies on, Egnor’s next argument relies on another logical fallacy – the one that in my experience non-materialists always come back to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Novella responded recently to my post in which I clarified my views on the mind-brain problem. He accuses me of using a ‘Dualism of the Gaps’ argument. I’ve merely pointed out that the salient characteristics of the mind, such as intentionality, qualia, free will, incorrigibility, restricted access, continuity of self through time, and unity of consciousness (the ‘binding problem’) seem to be impossible to explain materialistically.  Materialistic explanations for subjective mental states are not impossible merely because we lack experiments or evidence. Materialistic explanations for the mind are impossible within the framework of materialism itself, &lt;strong&gt;because mental properties are not physical properties&lt;/strong&gt;.  [My bold.]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because mental properties are not physical properties?  &lt;strong&gt;Because?&lt;/strong&gt;  This is where he’s going wrong.  And I’m going to overkill this explanation in the hope that even Egnor might begin to understand.  (And apologies to those who already get this point, but I’m going to spell this one out in detail, so hopefully anyone can understand it.)  Here we go.  This is Egnor’s &lt;em&gt;conclusion: &lt;/em&gt;the mind is not caused by the physical brain, or (to put it another way) mental properties cannot be caused by material properties.  That’s his conclusion.  That’s what he wants us to accept – that mental properties are non-physical so dualism is necessary to explain the mental.  OK so far?  But he just said that materialistic explanations for the mind are impossible &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; mental properties are not physical properties.  The “because” means that what follows is his &lt;em&gt;premise&lt;/em&gt;.  And the premise that follows (“mental properties are not physical properties”) is the same as his conclusion. The premise being the same as the conclusion is the definition of &lt;a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/begging-the-question.html"&gt;circular reasoning&lt;/a&gt;. He has just assumed his conclusion, namely that mental properties are not physical.  But he does not know that mental properties are not physical.  He provides no evidence for this.  He just assumes it.  It’s a purely circular argument.  He does not and can not know that mental properties cannot arise from a physical brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next bit is just pure assertion - he just asserts as if it were fact, what he wants you to accept:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing about matter as understood in our current scientific paradigm invokes subjective mental experience. The essential qualities on the mind are immaterial. Invocation of immaterial causation that incorporates subjectivity seems necessary for a satisfactory explanation of the mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;#39;m sure that invocation of immaterial causation &amp;quot;seems necessary&amp;quot; to Egnor, but that doesn’t mean it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet we know nothing — nothing — about how subjective experience could arise from matter alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And we also know nothing — nothing — about how subjective experience could arise from &lt;em&gt;non-&lt;/em&gt;matter.  The difference is that at least we know that matter exists.  Where is Egnor’s evidence that his “immaterial causation” even exists, let alone is necessary to explain the mind?  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Novella is wrong to attribute the inference to dualism to an argument from ignorance. The exact opposite is true. The reason that immaterial causation is invoked to explain the mind is because we know so much about the mind and about the brain, and it’s evident to most people (that is, people who aren’t dogmatic materialists) that the mind isn’t material. It isn’t an argument from ignorance. It’s an argument from deep knowledge — deep knowledge of the mind and of the brain. The invocation of immaterial causation for aspects of mental states is the result of our deep knowledge of the difference between mind and matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the bit that Egnor doesn’t get – Dualism of the Gaps is an argument from ignorance fallacy because we know nothing about the non-materialistic explanation that Egnor wants us to accept by default.  It’s just a made up magic placeholder non-explanation that he thinks fits the gap of our current knowledge.  It’s totally fallacious reasoning.  On the other hand, the “&lt;em&gt;Materialism&lt;/em&gt; of the Gaps” argument that Egnor is trying to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; into a fallacy is not a fallacy because we know the material world exists. (Unless you’re an idealist or a solipsist.)  It is a fallacy to insist that your explanation must include some unknown entity that you just made up; it is not a fallacy merely to &lt;em&gt;exclude&lt;/em&gt; made up entities.  Ironically Egnor then writes about the “deep knowledge of the mind and of the brain” – and yet he provides no knowledge about where minds comes from.  None at all – just the undefined and un-measurable “immaterial” causation that Egnor thinks &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; necessary.&amp;quot;  But &amp;quot;seems necessary&amp;quot; is not the same as “deep knowledge.”  His “deep knowledge” is really a lack of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The materialist argument is essentially this: ‘materialism is the complete explanation for the mind, and if you ask questions, you’re a neuroscience denialist’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now Egnor presents the straw man materialist.  No, the materialist argument is that materialism is currently the best explanation for the mind, and we have no reason to invent magic “immaterial” explanations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It gets worse.  Egnor goes on to claim that materialism is in trouble in the scientific world, and to support this he (drum roll) invokes quantum mechanics:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics, in many of its interpretations, invokes an observer in order to collapse a waveform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;LOL – &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2007/10/woo-handbook.html"&gt;Woo Handbook&lt;/a&gt; #9.  Actually really only one interpretation, not “many of its interpretations.”  And even if the Copenhagen Interpretation is true and not just a metaphor to help scientists get their head around what is happening, it is well known that the “observer” could easily be just the equipment, not a human being.  The need for a conscious observer is completely unfalsifiable, which is why it is not part of the scientific theory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Egnor can’t resist closing references to some authority figures:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s notable that many of the leading neuroscientists — Sherrington, Penfield, Eccles, Libet — were dualists. Dualism of some sort is the most reasonable scientific framework to apply to the mind-brain problem, because, unlike dogmatic materialism, it just follows the evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personally I’d be very interested in following the evidence for dualism.  Unfortunately, Egnor didn’t provide any.  Not a shred.  Instead all we got was:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Misinterpretation of the Dualism of the Gaps argument &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Circular reasoning &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Argument from ignorance (Dualism of the Gaps ) &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Straw man &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Appeal to quantum mechanics &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Appeal to authority &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;

I hate that theology with a passion, but keep in mind I do not hate Calvinists themselves (kinda like, "love the sinner hate the sin").&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have written quite a bit about Calvinism on this Blog. You can read some of what I wrote as follows, in the order of their appearance:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/03/did-god-sovereignly-decree-what-im.html"&gt;Did God Sovereignly Decree What I'm Doing?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/03/question-for-calvinists.html"&gt;A Question for Calvinists.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/03/whats-likelihood-that-calvinists-are.html"&gt;What's the likelihood Calvinists are wrong?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/07/calvinism-explains-everythingand.html"&gt;Calvinism Explains Everything...and Nothing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/07/calvinist-dilemmathe-atheist-dilemma_12.html"&gt;The Calvinist Dilemma...the Atheist Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you only have time to read one of the above postings on Calvinism then read the fourth one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are so many things wrong with Calvinism it's hard to know where to start. Calvinist cannot show the Bible is historically true for one; that some of the claims in it occurred, or that they even make sense (like the Trinity, the creation of a first moment in time, the Incarnation, Atonement, personal survival after death, hell, etc), nor can they harmonize the mythical creation accounts with science, the Flood story with geology, the Exodus story with archaeology, the Roman census with birth narratives of Jesus, etc. Nor can Calvinists show that their particular interpretation of the canonized texts is preferable to the Arminian interpretation, all of which must be true for their theology to be true, plus much much more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calvinist theology goes against civility and love for one's neighbor (that is if the neighbor isn't another Calvinist or Christian). It calls upon them to hate people just as God hates people (i.e. unbelievers, "fags," adulterers, and so forth). It calls upon them to worship and love a God who eternally and sovereignly decrees many people to eternal torment for his own egomaniacal glory (i.e., they could not have chosen to believe if they had tried). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the bottom line for Calvinism is that if God has a secret behind-the-scenes will which no human being is privy too, then Calvinism commits the Calvinist to agnosticism. You see, it's not the Bible that tells the Calvinist what God wants them to believe or to do. No siree, Bob. The Bible is merely a divine aide to get believers to believe and do what God wants. God doesn't even need the Bible because he can equally get non-believers to believe and do what he wants. All that anyone believes or does is exactly what God wants them to believe and do. So no, it's not the Bible that tells the Calvinist what God really wants. God's &lt;strong&gt;secret will&lt;/strong&gt; is his real will. He really wants me to write these very words even though if we read the Bible he wants me to believe and to evangelize. But the truth is he wants me to do exactly what I am doing. I am doing God's will right now, his secret real will! Praise Jesus! Hallelujah! I cannot do differently if I try. I could not even desire to do differently even if I try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of this means that Calvinists cannot trust the Bible. That's right. They cannot trust that what the Bible tells them to believe or do is what God actually wants them to believe and to do. Calvinism leads to agnosticism, a complete and utter agnosticism about what pleases their God. Calvinism also makes God a liar, despite the fact that Bible says God does not lie. Why? Because he tells us one thing in the Bible and then behind the scenes secretly wants us to do otherwise. As far as God's real secretive will goes, the Calvinist doesn't even know whether or not God is actually pleased with nonbelievers. Wouldn't that be a surprise to Calvinists to find that the people God was secretively pleased with are people like me, and that it is they who will be cast into hell while I and other non-believers are brought into heaven? ;-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can any intelligent person accept this complete and utter nonsense? Calvinism is quite literally bullshit, and God wanted me to say this!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First posted 1/31/09&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-2308444933777640668?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, a long weekend starting today and lasting four days, you are supposed to use the above logo, link to the &lt;a href="http://xnerg.blogspot.com/2009/01/bad-days-are-here-again.html" title=""&gt;Blogroll Amnesty Day&lt;/a&gt; post and link to five blogs that have either smaller traffic or narrower reach than you, or at least are new and unknown to your readers. Then e-mail your permalink &lt;a href="mailto:%20skippybkroo@aol.com" title=""&gt;to skippy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's promote the new and smaller voices that you think should be known by a wider audience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could, of course, list 50 or 500, but I'll stick to the rules and, after agonizing for a long time, suggest these five blogs for you to check out:&lt;/p&gt;

(Note: this data is a little "squishy"--be sure to read the introductory text about how research was classified into these categories, including that a single study may classify into multiple categories).  Autism research in 2008 came up a whopping $118 million.  Why whopping?  Here's some relativity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the funding figures for some other developmental disabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$60 million for Attention Deficit Disorder&lt;br&gt;
$28 million for Cerebral Palsy&lt;br&gt;
$26 million for Fragile X Syndrome&lt;br&gt;
$17 million for Down Syndrome&lt;br&gt;
$ 9 million for Rett Syndrome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the funding figures for some major social issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$45 million for Violence Against Women&lt;br&gt;
$30 million for Child Abuse and Neglect&lt;br&gt;
$21 million for Teenage Pregnancy&lt;br&gt;
$13 million for Homelessness&lt;br&gt;
$ 4 million for Climate Change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the funding figures for some often fatal cancers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$96 million for Ovarian Cancer&lt;br&gt;
$89 million for Liver Cancer&lt;br&gt;
$69 million for Cervical Cancer&lt;br&gt;
$39 million for Childhood Leukemia&lt;br&gt;
$16 million for Uterine Cancer (which has &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6x_Cancer_Prevalence_How_Many_People_Have_Cancer.asp"&gt;a prevalence rate&lt;/a&gt; of nearly half the population of the state of Maine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just so there's no question here of my biases as I continue, I do autism-related research that could potentially be funded by the NIH.  On a purely greedy level, in terms of not starving to death, yes, funding for autism research is good.  Not only that, but I want more research that leads to change I care about, like a higher quality of life for people on the spectrum or a fair chance at employment (yes, NIH funding can go toward those topics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my biases got quite a reality check when I saw those figures--would I rather have research money spent on autism or on cancer?  Goodness, I don't even need to think, please, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; fund research on cancer!  People &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt; from that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To throw things into an even harsher perspective, take a read at Jim Sinclair's 1995 essay &lt;a href="http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/research.htm"&gt;Medical Research Funding?&lt;/a&gt; wherein he responds to a statement about cystic fibrosis having four times more grant funding from the NIH than autism, "Maybe cystic fibrosis research receives more funding than autism research because CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS A DEADLY DISEASE THAT MAKES PEOPLE SICK AND MISERABLE, AND THEN KILLS THEM!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perspective time?  Remember that 2008 autism figure of $118 million--13 years after Sinclair's essay, and it's only $90 million for cystic fibrosis.  Last year, instead of four times more, autism got $28 million more funding dollars than &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Genomics/gtesting/ACCE/FBR/CF/CFCliVal_21.htm#21"&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More money for autism research is so often the cry, but what are we &lt;em&gt;losing&lt;/em&gt; if we get more money for autism research?  What have we gained so far from all that autism research, how has it actually helped people?  Has it helped people?  Should autism really be as much of a research priority as it is?  What might be the long term price of the short term cry for "more funding for autism?"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233424952617"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-4526418965233524049">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30ac7b0d4789de30</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humour" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">An open letter to American universities and agencies.</title><published>2009-01-31T15:50:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-31T16:24:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/dDEdpG2TlKs/open-letter-to-american-universities.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=4526418965233524049" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/01/open-letter-to-american-universities.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Subject: An open letter to American universities and agencies&lt;br&gt;Jan. 31, 2009&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Sir or Madam,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are probably aware that Canadian researchers have long made do with comparatively small amounts of funding, particularly relative to colleagues in the United States, but that they have nevertheless been very productive (&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v430/n6997/full/430311a.html"&gt;Nature 430: 311-316&lt;/a&gt;).  To be sure, you are familiar with many of the current international projects of which Canada is a leader.  You may also have noticed that many Canadians have returned after working in the United States and elsewhere, and that prominent researchers from the United States and elsewhere have also opted to move to Canada to pursue their research interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You also are no doubt aware that the recent federal budget released by the minority government of Canada contains no new funding for Genome Canada and requires the three major funding councils (CIHR, NSERC, and SSHRC) to find savings of $87 million.  You may also be aware that this government has begun imposing "priority areas" for research support, the majority of which are short-term and applied in nature, and that they have decided to launch scholarships for a small number of students that are, in effect, significantly larger than the average starting grants for primary investigators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In contrast, your new President has chosen to make a major investment in scientific research as part of an economic stimulus package.  He clearly recognizes that scientific expertise and knowledge will be crucial for the long-term health of your citizens and your economic future.  In particular, it is likely that you will be expanding your efforts in important areas of cutting edge science, such as genomics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In light of this, we ask that you kindly refrain from recruiting our best scientists, who may soon become open to moving their programs to your fine nation.  As you can understand, we require these individuals to maintain Canada's scientific productivity and credibility, as well as to teach in our universities and to train our future generations of investigators.  We also ask, if you would be so kind, that you not take over major international initiatives in which Canada has heretofore assumed the leading role.  Finally, we ask for your patience as we struggle to live up to our commitments in joint research efforts with our colleagues in the USA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are deeply hopeful that this represents only a temporary setback, but we thank you in advance for your understanding during this difficult time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Canadian science&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/dDEdpG2TlKs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233424123192"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1090">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/16d7e5a9f17d7d0c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Punctuation"/><title type="html">Apostrophe catastrophe</title><published>2009-01-31T17:41:26Z</published><updated>2009-01-31T17:41:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1090" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Outrage reigns in Britain over the decision by the Birmingham city council to stop using apostrophes on its street signs; the AP story, by Meera Selva, is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gqHbKAdUMsPIUMaJT-CAi1lIvt-wD961MQP00"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highlights from this version (the story has been widely reported):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;England's second-largest city has decided to drop apostrophes from all its street signs, saying they're confusing and old-fashioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some purists are downright possessive about the punctuation mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that Birmingham officials have been taking a hammer to grammar for years, quietly dropping apostrophes from street signs since the 1950s. Through the decades, residents have frequently launched spirited campaigns to restore the missing punctuation to signs denoting such places as "St. Pauls Square" or "Acocks Green."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Councilor Martin Mullaney, who heads the city&amp;#39;s transport scrutiny committee, said he decided to act after yet another interminable debate into whether &amp;quot;Kings Heath,&amp;quot; a Birmingham suburb, should be rewritten with an apostrophe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected reaction came from "grammarians", who turn out to be the people from the &lt;a href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/"&gt;Plain English Campaign&lt;/a&gt; (about which we've written on many occasions, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=557"&gt;most recently&lt;/a&gt; in connection with &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But grammarians say apostrophes enrich the English language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are such sweet-looking things that play a crucial role in the English language," said Marie Clair of the Plain English Society, which campaigns for the use of simple English. "It's always worth taking the effort to understand them, instead of ignoring them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4401474/Apostrophe-now-backlash-begins.html"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;, another voice is heard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Richards, founder of the &lt;a href="http://www.apostrophe.fsnet.co.uk/"&gt;Apostrophe Protection Society&lt;/a&gt;, said: "All over Birmingham, and in other cities, teachers are trying to teach children correct grammar and punctuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now children will go around Birmingham and see utter chaos."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in the U.S., we've been managing without apostrophes on most street signs (and maps) for some time, and often without periods and commas as well. Does utter chaos surround us? Well, no; the system is that place names don't get apostrophes, while other expressions of possessive form do get them, and contractions get them as well. The AP story gets this wrong: the first sentence of the story ("On the streets of Birmingham, the queen's English is now the queens English") doesn't have a place name, and neither does the headline ("Its a catastrophe for the apostrophe in Britain", with a contraction). The head also suggests that the ban on apostrophes covers all of Britain, while in fact it's only Birmingham that's affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no particular stake in the choice between preserving the older system for the use of apostrophes (and so on) on signs and maps and adopting a sparer system of punctuation (omit needless marks!). I wouldn't even insist that punctuation practice must be consistent; apostrophied and apostrophe-less names could simply be seen as optional variants. &lt;/p&gt;

For that, I apologize. I realize a lot of you sent me links. For some reason, this week was an embarrassment of riches in terms of blogging material, and I didn't have time to get to it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, let me just say that I find it very ironic that this particular story came to light during the week of the 64th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. If the Pope is truly appointed by God to rule over the Roman Catholic Church, in this case God chose someone who has an exquisitely bad sense of timing. Actually, he appears to have chosen someone who has exquisitely bad sense. The reason: Pope Benedict XVI has decided to &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99878449"&gt;rehabilitate four excommunicated bishops&lt;/a&gt; by reinstating them. Given Benedict's conservative dogmatism, it's not surprising that all four of them were excommunicated had suffered that fate because they had formed a society to protest what they perceived as an increasingly liberal Church. In fact, it was Pope John Paul II, no liberal he, who excommunicated them, which should give you an indication of just how bad they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is surprising, even to me, is that one of them, Richard Williamson of Great Britain, is a blatant Holocaust denier. Indeed, he denied the Holocaust explicitly mere days before the revocation of his excommunication, and his rehabilitation has raised an &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99927330"&gt;uproar among both Jews and Catholics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pope Benedict XVI's decision to rehabilitate four excommunicated bishops -- including a Holocaust denier -- has caused dismay among Jewish leaders. But the move also has shocked many Roman Catholics, who fear it may point to a repudiation of the modernizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s.

&lt;p&gt;Just days before the pope revoked the excommunication of the four bishops, one of them, Richard Williamson, again denied the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The historical evidence is hugely against 6 million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler," he said in an interview that aired on Swedish television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When his interview began circulating on the Internet, the Vatican was quick to try to dampen the controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are lies, plain and simple. Check out this video for the full interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of classic Holocaust denier talking points here.

In a time when the US is injecting major new funds into science and technology, when Canada is now in a leadership position in many major initiatives following a reversal of the "brain drain", and when the future of the economy after the current challenges will clearly be based in large part on biotechnology, the Conservatives have decided to cut off the development of new research and to exert increased control on the science that does receive funding.  This administration is a disaster for Canadian science, and for all elements of society affected by science, from the economy to citizens' health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090129.wbudgetscience29/BNStory/National/"&gt;Budget erases funding for key science agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090130.wscience30/BNStory/National/"&gt;Nation's credibility on the line, scientists warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090131.wScience31/BNStory/National/"&gt;Nobel scientist criticizes Tories over funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090126.campusRESEARCH/BNStory/specialComment/"&gt;As U.S. emerges from dark age, Canada's scientific edge fades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090206.CMAJ06/TPStory/"&gt;Medical journal blasts budget's vision for science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Here is what's going on, folks.  The Conservative government is investing in infrastructure but is cutting off support for new initiatives by not supporting the equally important investment in people and operating costs.  They are requiring the three federal granting councils to cut $87 million from their already disproportionately small budgets (hint: I received considerably more from NSERC as a postdoc than as a primary investigator).  They are focusing support for students into a smaller number of insanely large scholarships ($50K/year, twice the average starting grant!).  They are imposing their own priority areas on funding programs, including mostly applied issues (e.g., forestry, automotive, fisheries) and destroying support for basic research.  And they have dissolved the national science advisor's office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're not upset about this, fellow Canadians, you will be when we lose our best and brightest and rapidly fall behind other countries in the new biotech economy.</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233419296638"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/todays_carnivals_328.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f9837d15e9d6d7bd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-01-31T14:24:19Z</published><updated>2009-01-31T14:24:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/gn4ZqThxfQA/todays_carnivals_328.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/todays_carnivals_328.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Berry Go Round #13 is up on &lt;a href="http://watchingtheworldwakeup.blogspot.com/2009/01/berry-go-round-13-winter-tough.html" title=""&gt;Watching the World Wake Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/todays_carnivals_328.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/gn4ZqThxfQA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233419213936"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5794">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88fd2fae2127125a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Psychology"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">The Long, Gay Road to Heterosexuality</title><published>2009-01-31T16:23:17Z</published><updated>2009-01-31T16:23:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5794" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You all remember Ted Haggard, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s the former chairman of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) and the former leader of the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. He was well known for having a hot-line to God and to various world leaders who worked to turn their respective countries into theocracies during their administrations; leaders like George W. Bush and Tony W. Blair. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/th.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/th.jpg" alt="th" width="188" height="248"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;He was featured prominently in a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO-g8FsmvGA"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; by noted biologist, Richard &lt;span&gt;Dawkins&lt;/span&gt;, called &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2epvSAGuLc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Root of All Evil?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For a long time, Haggard was one of the most prominent figures of religious conservatism in the U.S. (and you all know what a fun group those folks are).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.rinderpest.com/uploaded_images/th-773488.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And as you all no doubt know, he’s the &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; chairman of NAE and the &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; leader of the New Life Church because a male prostitute named Mike Jones came forward in 2006 alleging that Haggard had paid him for sex and that they sometimes used methamphetamine when they were together (told you they were fun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assertions received widespread news coverage and sparked charges of hypocrisy, because Haggard had roundly condemned homosexual sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Haggard and Jones — and by the way, each time I hear these names together in this context, I hang my head in grief that the incident sullied the names of two of Country music’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jones-Sings-Haggard-Kickin-Footlights/dp/B000HIVQ7Q"&gt;legendary icons&lt;/a&gt;, as well as degraded the wonderful services provided by prostitutes, male or otherwise — but Haggard and Jones would meet regularly for &lt;span&gt;meth&lt;/span&gt; parties and some wholesome man love. But in the end, the affair was enough of a disgrace to cost Ted his chair and his ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, shortly thereafter, Haggard disappeared from the public eye. He left Colorado Springs straight away and went to Denver where he endured three weeks of intensive counseling to rid himself of gay. (Oddly, there seemed to be less concern about ridding him of the meth abuse. Don’t know if I would prioritize things that way, but apparently to some Christians, gay sex is much worse than a drug problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, after the intensive three-week deprogramming course, word came down from on high that Ted Haggard was not gay anymore!!! (cue Hallelujah chorus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the four ministers who oversaw the &lt;span&gt;de&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;gayification&lt;/span&gt; camp Haggard attended, the Rev. Tim Ralph of Larkspur, told The Denver Post at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Ted] is completely heterosexual . . . That is something he discovered. It was the acting-out situations where things took place. It wasn’t a constant thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Ted discovered that he was completely heterosexual. It was only the “acting-out situations” where gay sex took place, and since he only acted out a few dozen times, he wasn’t gay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm . . . Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, Haggard transitioned into relative obscurity where he spent his days reading, rebuilding his life, and not being gay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But either celebrity is a bitch goddess that cannot be ignored or God the Father told him to come forward and tell his story, because Ted Haggard has resurfaced in recent weeks. Unable to stay out of the spotlight, he’s been all over the T.V. and the dub dub dubs. Larry King, Oprah, all the big programs and news sites are following Ted’s story again. There is even a documentary on HBO that chronicles his tribulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it now seems there’s more to Haggard’s battle against being gay than we initially knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past Thursday, he said it was “fundamentally true” that he engaged in homosexual &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/01/29/lkl.ted.haggard/index.html#cnnSTCVideo"&gt;activity with a 20-year-old&lt;/a&gt; male church volunteer in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident occured when the two men were in bed together. The volunteer, Grant Haas, said on CNN’s “Larry King Live”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pretty much asked me if it was OK if he masturbated in front of me or masturbated in the bed next to me. I told him no, it would make me really uncomfortable. But he grabbed a bottle of lotion and started masturbating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, Haggard also &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2009/01/30/lkl.haggard.sexual.pref.cnn"&gt;admitted to Larry King&lt;/a&gt; that he still has thoughts of other men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember, he’s not gay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And apparently, therapy is helping him figure out how not gay he is. Haggard says that one therapist described him as a “heterosexual with homosexual attachments”. That phrase clearly describes a straight man. The gayness is just an added feature. It’s an accessory that can he can put on or take off at any time, like a belt or a strap-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also says his current therapist describes him as “a heterosexual with complications”. Yeah. Ted Haggard is a a heterosexual with complications like a kangaroo is a giant mouse with a pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, Haggard says, even though he’s not gay, he has another year of therapy ahead of him. Hey, better safe than sorry, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says Haggard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I’m still deeply wounded and scarred and somewhat confused. I have thoughts [about men] from time to time, but not compelling thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I have to admit, I had no idea it worked this way. I had no idea that a man could want, seek out, and procure sex with another man on multiple occasions, and still not be gay. I never realizes that discovering what you do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; prefer is such a long, harrowing road. If &lt;span&gt;Haggard’s&lt;/span&gt; case is any indication, a man must be &lt;em&gt;thorough&lt;/em&gt; in confirming his dislike for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you live and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s good to see that Haggard is not gay after all this. I can only hope he’ll write a book; the definitive tome that will help others on that long, gay road that leads to heterosexual peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe he’ll call his book &lt;em&gt;Discovering You’re Not Gay: A Marathon, Not a Sprint&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233417434737"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-3709596858390885921">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c7ae414480df5b6f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="University" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Shame on The University of Vermont</title><published>2009-01-31T15:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-02T13:58:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/shame-on-university-of-vermont.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/3709596858390885921/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=3709596858390885921" title="8 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The University of Vermont will be awarding an honorary degree to Ben Stein, the man behind the movie Expelled.

Thus, a total of $107M has been invested in 2008-09; and a total of $106.5M will be invested in 2009-10, creating and maintaining over 2,350 HQP positions per year.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over the same period of time, Genome Canada has raised over $225M from other strategic partners in the private, public and philanthropic sectors to support genomics research in Canada.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since its inception in 2000, Genome Canada has provided operating funds to Canadian genomics researchers, while complementing other sources of funds for infrastructure coming from such agencies as Canada Foundation for Innovation, to allow them to be among world leaders in their respective fields such as human health, agriculture, environment, forestry, fisheries, new technology, and GE&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LS (ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social issues).&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genome Canada is confident that the Government of Canada and its other financial strategic partners will do everything possible over the coming years to secure additional funding to support new initiatives in genomics research in Canada while increasing Canada’s productivity, wealth and well-being of all Canadians.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a recent story in &lt;a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/genome-canada-nets-nil-09-federal-budget"&gt;GenomeWeb Daily News&lt;/a&gt;, President of Genome Canada Martin Godbout said,&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Genome Canada is not in the federal budget this year, and there's good reason for it," Godbout explained. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Genome Canada is not founding any infrastructure or equipment," explained Godbout, who described this year's federal budget as one focused on projects that will feed those objectives. "It is a decision that I respect," he told &lt;em&gt;GWDN&lt;/em&gt;. "It's hard everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conflicts with his earlier reaction (&lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2009/01/29/genome-funding.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090129.wbudgetscience29/BNStory/budget2009/home"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but it does bear noting that no current projects will be cut and that there is significant funding for infrastructure through other agencies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this does not allow new initiatives to be developed or productive ones to be expanded.  It's still very bad news in that regard.  More importantly, it is essential that the ministry realize that infrastructure alone can't do anything.  You also have to support people and research expenses if you desire results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/jwVs26VbiJ8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233414482800"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-680769478303849005">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ba8ecf8e688ef200</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The accurate language challenge, part III</title><published>2009-01-31T13:46:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-31T13:48:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/T3hnKwUmjHI/accurate-language-challenge-part-iii.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=680769478303849005" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/01/accurate-language-challenge-part-iii.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Here's one from the latest issue of The Scientist (emphasis added!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/2009/01/1/26/1/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/2009/01/1/26/1/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darwinian Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Two hundred years after the birth of Charles Darwin, scientists are exploring one of the central questions of evolution: &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;When organisms become more complex, by adopting the fittest traits for their environment&lt;/span&gt;, do those traits place constraints on further evolution?

&lt;p&gt;For global temperature time series we have GISTEMP, NCDC and HadCRUT. Each has worked hard to assimilate global temperature data into reliable and accurate indices of global temperature. The equivalent for alpine glaciers is the &lt;a href="http://www.geo.unizh.ch/wgms/"&gt;World Glacier Monitoring Service’s&lt;/a&gt; (WGMS) record of mass balance and terminus behavior. Beginning in 1986, WGMS began to maintain and publish the collection of information on ongoing glacier changes that had begun in 1960 with the Permanent Service on Fluctuations of glaciers. This program in the last 10 years has striven to acquire, publish and verify glacier terminus and mass balance measurement data from alpine glaciers the world over on a timely basis.  Spearheaded by Wlfried Haeberli with assistance from Isabelle Roer, Michael Zemp, Martin Hoelzle, at the University of Zurich, their efforts have resulted in the recent publication, &lt;a href="http://www.grid.unep.ch/glaciers/"&gt;“Global Glacier Changes: facts and figures&lt;/a&gt;” published jointly with UNEP. This publication summarizes the information collected and submitted by the national correspondents of WGMS portraying the global response of glaciers to climate change, as well as the regional response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health of an alpine glacier is typically determined by monitoring the behavior of the terminus and/or its mass balance.  Glacier mass balance is the difference between accumulation and ablation (melting and sublimation) and can be altered by climate change caused variations in temperature and snowfall. A glacier with a sustained negative balance is out of equilibrium and will retreat. A glacier with sustained positive balance is out of equilibrium, and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Glacier advance increases the area of a glacier at lower elevations where ablation is highest, offsetting the increase in accumulation. Glacier retreat results in the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher elevations are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion of the glacier reduces total ablation, increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If a glacier lacks a consistent accumulation it is in disequilibrium (non-steady state) with climate and will retreat away without a climate change toward cooler wetter conditions (&lt;a href="http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/hyp6132.pdf"&gt;Pelto, 2006&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.geo.unizh.ch/~fpaul/sgi/mi_en.pdf"&gt;Paul&lt;br&gt;
et al., 2007&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/ann_bal.jpg" width="50%" align="right" style="padding-left:5px"&gt; In terms of mass balance two charts indicate the mean annual balance of the WGMS reporting glaciers and the mean cumulative balance of reporting glaciers with more than 30-years of record and of all reporting glaciers.  The trends demonstrates why alpine glaciers are currently retreating, mass balances have been significantly and consistently negative.  Mass balance is reported in water equivalent thickness changes.  A loss of 0.9 m of water equivalent is the same as the loss of 1.0 m of glacier thickness, since ice is less dense than water.  The cumulative loss of the last 30 years is the equivalent of cutting a thick slice off of the average glacier. The trend is remarkably consistent from region to region.  The figure on the right is the annual glacier mass balance index from the WGMS (if this was business it would be bankrupt by now). The cumulative mass balance index, based on 30 glaciers with 30 years of record and for all glaciers is not appreciably different (the dashed line for subset of 30 reference glaciers, is because not all 30 glaciers have submitted final data for the last few years):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/cum_bal_total.jpg" width="90%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor is the graph much different for &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/05/glacier-mass-balance-equilibrium-or-disequilibrium-response/"&gt;North America Glaciers&lt;/a&gt; individually or collectively.  The next figure shows the cumulative annual balance of North American Glaciers reporting to the WGMS with at least 15 years of recor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/cum_bal_single.jpg" width="90%"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/terminus.jpg" align="right" width="50%" style="padding-left:5px"&gt;The second parameter reported by WGMS is terminus behavior.  The values are generally for glaciers examined annually (many additional glaciers are examined periodically).  The population has an over-emphasis on glaciers from the European Alps, but the overall global and regional records are very similar, with the exception of New Zealand. The number of advancing versus retreating glaciers in the diagram below from the WGMS shows a 2005 minimum in the percentage of advancing glaciers in Europe, Asia and North America and Europe.  In &lt;a href="http://assets.panda.org/downloads/himalayaglaciersreport2005.pdf"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081006130550.htm"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, there have been extensive terminus surveys illustrating long term retreat using satellite image and aerial photographic comparison over longer time spans. Those results indicate that 95% of the glaciers are retreating, but are not fully reflected in the annual terminus retreat data base of the WGMS. In 2005 there were 442 glaciers examined, 26 advancing, 18 stationary and 398 retreating - implying that "only" 90% are retreating.  In 2005, for the first time ever, no observed &lt;a href="http://glaciology.ethz.ch/messnetz/glacierlist.html"&gt;Swiss glaciers&lt;/a&gt; advanced. Of the 26 advancing glaciers, 15 were in New Zealand. Overall there has been a substantial volume loss of 11% of New Zealand glaciers from 1975-2005 &lt;a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/51DEB609-9C85-490B-A561-048485BA6989/0/akl2007_014_SNZ_GlacierFinal.pdf"&gt;Salinger et al&lt;/a&gt;. ,but the number of advancing glacier is still significant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That glaciers are shrinking in terms of volume (mass balance) and length (terminus behavior) is not news.  What is news is the development of a robust global index of glacier behavior.  As a submitter of data to WGMS, I can report that the scrutiny and level of detail requested of the submitted of data is increasing.  The degree of participation by glaciologic programs is also increasing.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Association of Atheists and Agnostics launched the first phase of the campaign in the country, with eight slogans that we want to display on buses in the city of São Paulo. The phrases explain what atheists think, and seek to launch a first step towards the recognition of skeptical people as full and worthy citizen, with its deserved place in society. One of the highlights is the phrase that calls for an effective secular state, which ATEA believes should be a priority for citizens of all beliefs and disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can check out what the 8 slogans are by clicking the link above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/01/30/atheist-bus-ads-in-italy-are-back-again/"&gt;And the bus ads in Italy are back as well&lt;/a&gt; - Atheists–we’re everywhere you want to be.The new ad reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;The Good News Is There Are Millions of Atheists In Italy; The Excellent News Is They Believe In Freedom Of Expression&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Last May, then 5-year-old &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/5-year-old-boy-voted-out-of-his-class/"&gt;Alex Barton&lt;/a&gt; was voted out of his Florida kindergarten class by his classmates. His teacher, Wendy Portillo, first let the students say what they did not like about Alex after which whether or not he could stay in the classroom was put to a "Survivor-style" vote. The incident sparked national, and international, attention and Portillo was &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/teacher-suspended-for-letting-students-vote-alex-barton-out-of-the-class/"&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; for a year without pay. The January 29th &lt;a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/jan/29/alex-barton-teachers-suspension-appeal-be-heard-mo/"&gt;TCPalm&lt;/a&gt; reports that, next Monday, Portillo will appeal her suspension at Fort Pierce City Hall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex’s mother, Melissa Barton, said she planned to attend the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(Portillo) should not be allowed to work with kids,” Barton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barton has said she thought Portillo should be fired for what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’s not the victim here, Alex is,” she said. “This is because of what she did to him. I trusted her to teach him and not abuse him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't help but agree with Melissa Barton and not only because I'm also the parent of a child on the autism spectrum and a teacher myself. It's one thing to address the individual issues of individual students, but having the rest of the class vote on, in essence, &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/excluded-on-keeping-the-faith/"&gt;excluding&lt;/a&gt; one of their classmates is inexcusable for any teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, students on the autism spectrum---individuals on the autism spectrum---have been excluded and even isolated simply because they're "different." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.900chml.com/Channels/Reg/NewsLocalGeneral/Story.aspx?ID=1056115"&gt;AM 900&lt;/a&gt; radio (Hamilton, Ontario) recently reported that the Salvation Army is planning to open a $2.2 million center for autistic adults in Hamilton next year, with construction to begin in the spring. Not much more is specified about what sort of facility this new center will be (residential? only for use in the day?) but it's good that what's being talked about are the needs of adults on the spectrum. Indeed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Byron Jacobs notes that services for adults with autism are currently limited or non-existent, leaving them isolated from the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that isolation, adrift and unmoored from the community one lives in---that's the fear behind the fear of having a child who's different, of being different. It's the fear that leads people to yearn to "fit in" and be "normal." As a parent, it can be painful to see your child excluded, or mocked, or &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/bullies_can_go_away"&gt;bullied&lt;/a&gt;, just because he is who he is. Why not, then, seek to make a child as "undifferent" as possible, so he or she won't stand out, can fit in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been "different." I'm third-generation Chinese-American and while I grew up in a place that's more "diverse" than most---the Bay Area in Northern California---history, in the form of the &lt;a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;amp;doc=47"&gt;Chinese Exclusion Act&lt;/a&gt; (1180-1943) and of the camps where the Japanese, including Japanese-Americans, were interned, was ever-present. In the 1940s, Yeh Yeh, my grandfather---his American name was Charlie Chew---bought a store from a Japanese man who needed to sell it quickly, as he'd been sent to the camps. That store, Tai Wah, was what enabled Yeh Yeh to send his five children to college and to live, indeed, the immigrant dream, as my dad likes to tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But what happened to the man who sold Yeh Yeh the store?" I once asked my dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a pause, he said, "We don't know." And then, after another pause, my dad said something about how the fear had never left his family or him if what if the same thing happened to the Chinese as happened to the Japanese?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were marked out and sent away, isolated from the community, just because we looked---acted---were different?&lt;/p&gt;

A few months ago &lt;a href="http://www.ltgov.bc.ca/ltgov/biography.htm"&gt;Steven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Point"&gt;Point&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, asserted that there is no word for "lying" in his language, Halkomelem. It appears, however, that he is mistaken: my sources say that in his language &lt;i&gt;smétnqən&lt;/i&gt; means "to lie, speak falsely" and that &lt;i&gt; q̓íq̓əl̓stéxʷ&lt;/i&gt; means "to lie, deceive".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier example of the same theme is due to no other than John Wayne, who in the classic western &lt;i&gt;Hondo&lt;/i&gt; asserts that &amp;quot;The Apaches have no word for &amp;#39;lie&amp;#39;.&amp;quot; That is sort of true: the Western Apache dictionary that I own lists not one but two different expressions for lying. There is a verb meaning specifically &amp;quot;to lie&amp;quot;, e.g.  ɬeíɬchoo &amp;quot;he lies&amp;quot;, as well as an expression meaning &amp;quot;to lie, deceive&amp;quot;, e.g. &lt;i&gt;bich'ii' nashch'aa&lt;/i&gt; "I lie to him".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may well be true that these cultures have a particularly negative view of lying, but tall tales about the lack of a word for it aren't a good way of making this point.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bill Poser</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233387176319"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2021">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0344b83fb731e26e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><category term="religion"/><category term="Islam"/><category term="Nintendo DS"/><title type="html">More Allah-friendly toys</title><published>2009-01-31T07:29:39Z</published><updated>2009-01-31T07:29:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/31/more-allah-friendly-toys/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I think I blogged about a woman who complained that her 4-year-old’s baby doll toy spoke the hidden pro-Islamic message:  “Islam is the light.” &lt;a href="http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/strange_news/offbeat_wthi_terrehaute_islam_is_the_light_nintendo_0126200921532177991"&gt;Now that same woman claims her 8-year-old daughter’s Nintendo DS videogame has the same message&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So either Muslim fundamentalists have taken a personal interest in this one woman’s children and sabotaged her children’s toys. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .or she’s just plain nuts. I’m going with the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

Okay, good. &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=468#more-468"&gt;I’m not the only one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, this is one hospital I will never, ever visit. Not because I’m afraid the scary ghosts will come out from under my bed and get me but because I’m terrified of being operated on by doctors who actually think an exorcist has magical powers to remove demons. I think Steve Novella says it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the possibility that perhaps you are dealing with a psychological and not paranormal phenomenon. Chances are it is witless belief that is driving these sightings, not the sightings that are driving people witless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has the National Broadcasting Corporation decided to abandon any pretense of rationality and reality? Reader and colleague Margaret Downey tells us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just watched [December 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;] a "how to sell your house in today's bad economy" segment on NBC's Today Show (in the 8:00 AM hour). The segment featured their "Real Estate Expert" Barbara Corcoran. She was asked questions by host David Gregory after a short film that highlighted "creative" ways people are trying to sell their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film showed people doing some creative advertising (no problem with that) and a man who held a sign on a street corner telling people about the apartment he was selling in the city. The other people they showed in the film clip advocated smudging, Feng Shui, house blessings, and exorcism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randi comments: This "smudging" woo-woo is the nonsense of wafting smoke over yourself and/or your possessions in order to "purify" them.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/some-plot-questions-for-gary-franchi/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/OVA1bKPA500/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary, can you give a date for when FEMA’s evil plan is supposed to be taking place? After all, nothing builds audience suspense better than a ticking clock. Like remember in Terminator 3 when Arnold said Skynet was going to launch the nukes and Judgment Day was only, like, 6 hours away. That was suspenseful. This whole FEMA camp/coffin plot stuff has been built up for years now. I’m starting to feel you’ve got JJ Abrams’ writing staff–great on building suspense but poor on the pay-off. You know, like you wait five years and you still don’t have a completely satisfying explanation for the giant smoke monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s taking FEMA so long anyway? Bush isn’t even in power anymore. You can’t just recast the villain suddenly in the middle of the story without leaving clues to foreshadow the villain switch. Mainstream audiences just will never buy it. Can you imagine how pissed audiences would be if halfway through The Dark Knight the writers dumped The Joker and suddenly Lucius Fox became the villain without anything up to that point hinting at the changing allegiances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then doesn’t your villain need some kind of motivation? Even 2-dimensional Bond villains have motives. Obama’s already arguably the most powerful man in the entire world. And since he’s the legal commander and chief he’s already got the entire United States following him. And the overwhelming majority of the country really like him too. So what would he hope to gain by throwing people in these FEMA camps or killing them and dumping them in these FEMA plastic coffins? That seems like it would serve no benefit and would only create more enemies for him. And if he’s working for the same shadow government that Bush was, then why are their policies so opposite? I mean Obama just spent much of his first week in office undoing a bunch of things that Bush did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And about these FEMA coffins, do you really expect mainstream audiences to believe that these plastic coffins designed to be employed in a secret plot would just be lying out in the open where anyone can see them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how sophisticated are these amazing NSA supercomputers your refer to anyway? Have you considered how many petaflops they’d require? This story is taking place in the present day, right? This isn’t a science fiction story, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how many guns do you think would actually be required for civilians to successfully overthrow the U.S. government in the 21st century? Seems like a lot. Do you have, like, some redeemable Darth Vader character who can bring this entire evil empire to an end in under two and a half by just throwing this evil Emperor Obama character down a big hole or something? Because otherwise, if audiences are going to believe the characters are going to actually overthrow the entire evil U.S. government and their evil FEMA goons with nothing but guns they purchased legally, this thing’s going to be, like, Lord of the Rings long, and I’m talking about the Extended Editions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how do the heroes in this story get their information? What’s their source? Do they have an inside man or something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you think mainstream audiences should believe that some nutty Rush Limbaugh-like radio host with no relevant background and some random dude like yourself who’s not even important enough to warrant his own Wikipedia page are among the only people in the entire world who can connect the correct dots and unravel the whole plot?  Audiences would only buy it if they had some specific quality that made them special. For instance, John Connor was trained his entire life to fight the machines. Luke Skywalker was the most powerful Jedi ever. What special knowledge and skills do Alex Jones and Gary Franchi bring that nobody else has?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few questions that came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=349"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we examined misrepresentations by the late National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) Director Stephen Straus and Margaret Chesney, written in 2006 as a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16857924?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstract"&gt;rebuttal &lt;/a&gt;to a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=16857923&amp;amp;link_type=PUBMED"&gt;critical article&lt;/a&gt; by Donald Marcus and Arthur Grollman in &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;magazine. Here, we continue. According to Straus and Chesney:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the establishment of NCCAM, there was no central source of CAM information. NCCAM brings evidence-based information on CAM to the public, practitioners, and researchers. NCCAM disseminates research findings and provides reliable information about commonly used CAM practices through numerous channels, including…its award-winning Web site… NCCAM’s communications program deals with a field that is controversial, that has many critics, and that reaches a public that wants reliable information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the establishment of the NCCAM, there was an excellent source of reliable information about “CAM”: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://quackwatch.org/"&gt;Quackwatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It continues to be the most comprehensive source of such information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCCAM itself does not provide “reliable information about commonly used ‘CAM’ practices.” Rather, it bends over backward—in some instances making categorically false statements—to portray absurd, dangerous, implausible, or disproved practices as safer and more promising than they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples follow, but first please consider an implicit yet abundant and compelling piece of evidence that has left several of us (&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://csicop.org/si/2003-09/alternative-medicine.html"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=36"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) scratching our heads since the NCCAM began: each year the Center bestows numerous grants for the purpose of teaching “CAM” (not “CAM research”) to health professionals or for “integrating CAM” into various programs, or for establishing “integrative medicine” centers. For examples, look &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/extramural/awards/2004/#education"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Isn’t this putting the cart before the horse? How can this be viewed as anything other than promoting “CAM”? Consider that Straus and Chesney also wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early years of NCCAM, there was a sense of urgency to scientifically assess a range of CAM therapies that had been in long use by the public in the absence of proof of safety or efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent 8 years, there has not been a burgeoning list of “CAM therapies” that have been proven safe and effective. The number of treatments that would qualify for that list, or for a comparable list before the creation of the NCCAM, if you’ll excuse the rudeness of reliable information, is…&lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, the NCCAM admits that the treatments that characterize its “CAM integration” projects have not been shown safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to a few explicit examples of unreliable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According to the Award-Winning NCCAM Website…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/chelation/chelationstudy.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn More About Chelation Therapy and the Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chelation with EDTA has been used to treat heavy metal poisoning such as lead. For this use, there is a low occurrence of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No: Intravenous Na2EDTA, the form used in the chelation trial, has never been approved to treat heavy metal poisoning such as lead, nor has it been studied in formal trials for that purpose. The form of EDTA that is so used, CaNa2EDTA, is considerably safer: it is usually given by the safer intramuscular route and in a safer location (a hospital), and it does not carry the risk of acute hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia due to Na2EDTA has killed several people, including 5-year old &lt;a href="http://hcrenewal.blogspot.com/2006/11/death-of-autistic-child-chelation.html"&gt;Abukar Tariq Nadama&lt;/a&gt;. The award-winning NCCAM Web site does not distinguish between the two drugs or mention death as a risk of the study drug, nor does the &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/tactconsentform_20030613.pdf"&gt;consent form&lt;/a&gt; for the trial itself. For a detailed critique of that consent form, a form that provides additional, highly &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;reliable information to those who would be subjects in the trial, look &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18596934#id603659"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;under &lt;em&gt;Comments on the TACT Consent Form&lt;/em&gt;. The risks of “chelation therapy,” known at the trial’s inception but not acknowledged by TACT investigators, are discussed in the same article under &lt;em&gt;The Risks for Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;EDTA Chelation and Supplements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in the first part of this series, the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy provides an overwhelming refutation to Straus and Chesney’s essay. Continuing in the category of Unreliable Information are categorically false statements, made by the trial’s Principal Investigator and accepted by the NCCAM, about previous studies and case reports of chelation for atherosclerosis. In the absence of those statements it would have been clear to any rational observer that there was no scientific basis for the TACT. For a comprehensive discussion, look &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18596934#id421256"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;under &lt;em&gt;III. State of the Evidence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the categories of Conflicts of Interests and corrupt Scientific Review Committees was the presence, on the NIH &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/redirect3.cgi?&amp;amp;&amp;amp;auth=0j53dE8CpNNVXYdkVenZ6Hydn5knfhTNWKZ-4TAJo&amp;amp;reftype=extlink&amp;amp;artid=2438277&amp;amp;article-id=2438277&amp;amp;iid=168078&amp;amp;issue-id=168078&amp;amp;jid=571&amp;amp;journal-id=571&amp;amp;FROM=Article%7CCitationRef&amp;amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI&amp;amp;rendering-type=normal&amp;amp;&amp;amp;http://www.circare.org/tact/nccamsepZAT1K02_20020104.pdf"&gt;Special Emphasis Panel &lt;/a&gt;that reviewed the original TACT application, of L. Terry Chappell: a chelationist who had been &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/redirect3.cgi?&amp;amp;&amp;amp;auth=0V3MDaWDtz_t5wC3TfjPbMUi47iGZbB-QzRK_DQUT&amp;amp;reftype=extlink&amp;amp;artid=2438277&amp;amp;article-id=2438277&amp;amp;iid=168078&amp;amp;issue-id=168078&amp;amp;jid=571&amp;amp;journal-id=571&amp;amp;FROM=Article%7CCitationRef&amp;amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI&amp;amp;rendering-type=normal&amp;amp;&amp;amp;http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_house_hearings&amp;amp;docid=f:59973.pdf"&gt;instrumental &lt;/a&gt;in convincing Rep. Dan Burton to bully the NIH into initiating a chelation trial, and who was nominated, by the very &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/redirect3.cgi?&amp;amp;&amp;amp;auth=0xCDY9q9sS7aCA9N43kncQGaAex_783qd3c4b7QB-&amp;amp;reftype=extlink&amp;amp;artid=2438277&amp;amp;article-id=2438277&amp;amp;iid=168078&amp;amp;issue-id=168078&amp;amp;jid=571&amp;amp;journal-id=571&amp;amp;FROM=Article%7CCitationRef&amp;amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI&amp;amp;rendering-type=normal&amp;amp;&amp;amp;http://www.circare.org/tact/tactprotocol_20010829.pdf"&gt;application &lt;/a&gt;that the NIH had asked him to judge, to be one of the “prominent experts” on the “TACT Liaison Committee to the ACAM.” Chappell would also become a TACT Investigator. For a thorough discussion of these points, look &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18596934#id603659"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;under &lt;em&gt;II.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Genesis of the TACT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another conflict of interest in the TACT is the apparent (i.e., &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/redirect3.cgi?&amp;amp;&amp;amp;auth=0x9puQgJMpU83nogiREpe8_3PpGuyjNCfB6MnfADF&amp;amp;reftype=pubmed&amp;amp;artid=2438277&amp;amp;article-id=2438277&amp;amp;iid=168078&amp;amp;issue-id=168078&amp;amp;jid=571&amp;amp;journal-id=571&amp;amp;FROM=Article%7CCitationRef&amp;amp;TO=Entrez%7CPubMed%7CRecord&amp;amp;rendering-type=normal&amp;amp;&amp;amp;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16053118"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;by himself) presence of Robert Nash, another conspicuous chelation proponent, on the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. Nash has &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060617064641/http://www.abct.info/2005-01-11-ABCMT-StandardOfCare1.doc"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt;, regarding chelation, that “established detoxification techniques…have been proven safe and effective over time…” He is hardly an unbiased or prudent choice for the Safety committee. For more discussion of this and related points, look &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18596934#id603659"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;under &lt;em&gt;Risks Ignored in the TACT Protocols&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also unreliable is the presumption that TACT investigators are competent to be investigators or to provide medical care for experimental subjects. Many (probably most) are not, as shown &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18596934#id421256"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;em&gt;Chelationists as Co-Investigators&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Will Subjects Receive Indicated Medical and Surgical Therapies?;&lt;/em&gt; and here: &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=132" rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;font color="#585d8b"&gt;The TACT is at least as Bad as We Predicted&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The “Gonzalez Regimen” for Cancer of the Pancreas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Gonzalez, who administered his regimen to subjects in the other NCCAM-sponsored trial that Drs. Marcus and Grollman selected for criticism (only to be ignored by Straus and Chesney), was also not competent to provide medical care for experimental subjects. Gonzalez’s incompetence, like that of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=247"&gt;ACAM &lt;/a&gt;members who represent the majority of TACT investigators, was known well before the trial began, as demonstrated &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=97"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gonzalez trial exemplifies another sort of unreliable information. As mentioned in the previous post, Straus and other operatives at the NCCAM must have known, since the fall of 2005, that the Columbia Data and Safety Monitoring Committee had “&lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/YR08/jun08a.pdf"&gt;recommended that the study be terminated&lt;/a&gt; due to predetermined stopping criteria” after only 62 of the planned 90 subjects had been enrolled, and that the study had been so terminated. As discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=298"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, this must have meant that the outcomes had been so bad that it would have unethical to continue the trial. The NCCAM website has offered no clarification. It &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/news/19972000/121599.htm"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the basis of promising pilot study data, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded a clinical trial comparing gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy to an alternative cancer treatment consisting of proteolytic enzyme therapy with nutritional support (known as the Gonzalez regimen) to treat patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The study is being conducted at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University and affiliated sites in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2005, Columbia University closed the study to new enrollment after the Data and Safety Monitoring Board unanimously agreed that sufficient numbers of subjects had been enrolled to permit the study to achieve the predetermined research endpoints. Patients already enrolled on the trial will continue to be followed until the study is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the data from all the patients in the study are complete, the investigators will analyze and report their findings. Final results are expected 2 years after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now I had not been aware that the NCCAM website had admitted even that much about the cessation of the Gonzalez trial. Nevertheless, the statement provides barely a hint of the reason for the trial’s early cessation or that it was highly unusual. Nor does it mention that the whole, sordid mess of the “Gonzalez trial” illustrates what’s wrong with the current “CAM” social experiment and with the NCCAM in particular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that between the phrase “closed to new enrollment” and the sentence “Patients already enrolled on the trial will continue to be followed…,” the statement is additionally misleading. Readers might presume that subjects already enrolled in the trial were to continue to receive the “Gonzalez regimen.” I suspect, however, a very different implication: that the trial investigators merely intended to gather data from those subjects until they died, i.e., “until the study [was] complete.” We also read, again, the misleading claim of “promising pilot study data,” previously refuted &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=78"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=92"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, we must wonder what has happened to those “final results.” Surely enough time has passed for them to be reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Cancer Institute (NCI), by the way, gives no indication that the Gonzalez trial was stopped before its planned enrollment was complete; it merely &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/search/viewclinicaltrials.aspx?version=healthprofessional&amp;amp;cdrid=67012"&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;the trial’s “status” as “closed,” but continues to report the “expected enrollment” as “90.” Similarly, ClinicalTrials.gov &lt;a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00003851"&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt; that “This study is ongoing, but not recruiting participants,” and “Estimated enrollment: 90.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Unreliable Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/"&gt;Questions and Answers About Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the information about homeopathy on the NCCAM website is misleading. Much of it is plainly wrong. This can be demonstrated by comparing it to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=%22Homeopathy+and+Evidence-Based+Medicine%3A+Back+to+the+Future%22"&gt;series &lt;/a&gt;on homeopathy with which I began my tenure as a blogger on SBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/naturopathy/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Introduction to Naturopathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturopathic physicians are educated and trained in a 4-year, graduate-level program at one of the four U.S. naturopathic medical schools accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education. Admission requirements include a bachelor’s degree and standard premedical courses. The study program includes basic sciences, naturopathic therapies and techniques, diagnostic techniques and tests, specialty courses, clinical sciences, and clinical training…Some therapies used in naturopathy have the potential to be harmful if not used properly or under the direction of a trained practitioner…Naturopathic physicians are trained to know that herbs and some dietary supplements can potentially interact with drugs, and to avoid those combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, no: “naturopathic physicians” are neither ethically nor scientifically competent to prescribe herbs and “dietary supplements,” as shown &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=151"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Nor are they competent to practice primary care medicine, which is their claim, as shown in the rest of that series and in its numerous references, including &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/465994"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=15208545"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, the NCCAM regularly includes several “naturopathic physicians” on its advisory council, and regularly grants funds for naturopathic “research” boondoggles, including purported demonstrations of the paranormal fantasies of psychokinesis and remote viewing, as documented &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/2003-09/alternative-medicine.html"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/acu-osteo.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acupuncture for Osteoarthritis of the Knee Study Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark study has shown that acupuncture provides pain relief and improves function for people with osteoarthritis of the knee and serves as an effective complement to standard care. The study, the largest Phase III clinical trial of acupuncture for knee osteoarthritis, was funded by NCCAM and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the “&lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/141/12/901.pdf"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt;,” published in 2004, suggested trivial differences between “true acupuncture” and “sham acupuncture.” The differences were most prudently explained by expectation, as demonstrated in the report itself: subjects’ believing that they were in the “true acupuncture” group was more predictive of a favorable outcome than was their actual group assignment. The trial was subsequently disconfirmed by another, much &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/145/1/12.pdf"&gt;larger trial&lt;/a&gt;, reported in 2006 in the same journal. As &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=233"&gt;previously mentioned&lt;/a&gt; by Steve Novella, a 2007 &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/146/12/868"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of acupuncture for osteoarthritis of the knee, which included the “landmark study” among the nine that it analyzed, and was co-authored by the first author of that study, concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sham-controlled trials show clinically irrelevant&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;short-term benefits of acupuncture for treating knee osteoarthritis.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Waiting list–controlled trials suggest clinically relevant&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;benefits, some of which may be due to placebo or expectation&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accompanying Editors’ Notes concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;use of different types of comparisons (sham acupuncture vs.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;interventions in which the participant knew whether they [sic] were&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;receiving acupuncture) explains the variability in the conclusions&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;of published trials about the effectiveness of acupuncture for&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;treating knee osteo-arthritis. Placebo or expectation effects&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;probably account for the observed benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, acupuncture for osteoarthritis of the knee does exactly as prior probability predicts: it comforts people who believe in it. If people want to use it, let them, but let’s stop wasting taxpayers’ money on frivolous trials. None of the relevant literature, other than the “landmark study,” is mentioned on the NCCAM website. Could the reason be that subsequent findings have rendered the 2004 study no longer “landmark”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first author of the “landmark study” was Brian Berman, the Director of the University of Maryland &lt;a href="http://www.compmed.umm.edu/integrative/default.asp"&gt;Center for Integrative Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the &lt;a href="http://www.compmed.umm.edu/cochrane_staff.asp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cochrane CAM Field&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (previously discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=42"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Remember that name, because he will be discussed in the next part of this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/echinacea/"&gt;Echinacea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…&lt;/strong&gt;two NCCAM-funded studies did not find a benefit from echinacea, either as &lt;em&gt;Echinacea purpurea&lt;/em&gt; fresh-pressed juice for treating colds in children, or as an unrefined mixture of &lt;em&gt;Echinacea angustifolia&lt;/em&gt; root and &lt;em&gt;Echinacea purpurea&lt;/em&gt; root and herb in adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In [the adult] study, the researchers found that none of the three preparations of &lt;em&gt;E. angustifolia&lt;/em&gt; at the 900 mg per day dose had significant effects on whether volunteers became infected with the cold virus or on the severity or duration of symptoms among those who developed colds. However, critics of this study believe the dose of &lt;em&gt;E. angustifolia&lt;/em&gt; used was too low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[In the pediatric study], the researchers found that between those receiving echinacea and those receiving placebo at the onset of symptoms there was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No difference in the duration of upper respiratory infection symptoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No difference in the overall severity of symptoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No difference in the number of days of fever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No difference in parents’ assessment of severity of infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No overall difference in side effects (adverse events); however, children taking echinacea were more likely to develop rashes than those taking placebo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that the “results do not support the use of echinacea for treatment of upper respiratory infections in children 2 to 11 years old.” In addition, the researchers recommend more studies to look at other echinacea preparations or different doses or dosing schedules to determine if there is any possible role for echinacea in treating colds in children. They also suggest further research to determine whether echinacea has any role in preventing colds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCCAM will continue to support research on Echinacea. A number of preclinical, Phase I, and Phase II studies of Echinacea products are currently under way. This research is being done both because of the public health burden of the common cold and the public’s widespread use of this natural product. A recent survey of complementary and alternative medicine use by adults in the United States found that, among those who reported using natural products, Echinacea was the most commonly used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of echinacea, the NCCAM’s bluff has been called: the Center sponsored two trials of this popular “herbal remedy,” each of which was, predictably, negative. Yet our NIH-based source of reliable information on implausible medical claims can’t seem to take “no” for an answer. It should be obvious that there are enough “other echinacea preparations or different doses or dosing schedules” to keep grant recipients busy for a long, long time. In the meantime, has there been any diminution in echinacea hype by either &lt;a href="http://blog.wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/podpress_trac/web/247/0/Cold_flu_11-14-07.mp3"&gt;sellers &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href="http://206.188.28.100/search?site=my_collection&amp;amp;client=my_collection&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=my_collection&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;q=echinacea"&gt;“integrative medicine” experts&lt;/a&gt; since the two trials were reported? It doesn’t seem so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/gait/"&gt;Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a primary, or original, study that investigated whether glucosamine and/or chondroitin could treat the &lt;strong&gt;pain&lt;/strong&gt; of knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an ancillary, or additional, study that investigated whether the dietary supplements could diminish the &lt;strong&gt;structural damage&lt;/strong&gt; of knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results…showed that the popular dietary supplement combination of glucosamine plus chondroitin sulfate did not provide significant relief from osteoarthritis pain among all participants. However, a smaller [too small to be interpretable–KA] subgroup of study participants with moderate-to-severe pain showed significant relief with the combined supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancillary study results…showed that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, together or alone, appeared to fare no better than placebo in slowing loss of cartilage in knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This $12.5 million, 4-year study, involving more than 1500 subjects, was the best trial that the NCCAM has funded. It showed, beyond any reasonable doubt, that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are ineffective for treating osteoarthritis of the knee. You might expect that the NCCAM, in the spirit of providing reliable information to the public that paid for the trial, would happily inform its benefactors that the matter has finally been put to rest, and that they no longer need waste their money on glucosamine/chondroitin pills. You’d be wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While these results are of interest, we cannot draw definitive conclusions about the utility of glucosamine or chondroitin in reducing joint space width loss, in part because the placebo group fared better than anticipated based on prior research results,” &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2008/092908.htm"&gt;said Josephine P. Briggs&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), one of the study’s funders. “The results of the study provide interesting insights for future research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/gait/qa.htm#info"&gt;Consumer Information and Next Steps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Should people with osteoarthritis use glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with osteoarthritis should work with their health care provider to develop a comprehensive plan for managing their arthritis pain: eat right, exercise, lose excess weight, and use proven pain medications. If people have moderate-to-severe pain, they should talk with their health care provider about whether glucosamine plus chondroitin sulfate is an appropriate treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Can U.S. consumers get the glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate products used in GAIT?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identical products may not be commercially available…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another bluff called. Why is the NCCAM so reluctant to tell it like it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More from Straus and Chesney:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We fully support the &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/IOM/camcommittee.html"&gt;Institute of Medicine’s &lt;/a&gt;recommendation that the same principles and standards of evidence apply to all treatments, whether labeled as conventional medicine or CAM. We believe that we have succeeded in establishing a research enterprise that will achieve this standard. While challenges remain, we are confident that knowledge gained from NCCAM-supported studies will continue to inform the public, health-care providers, and policy-makers about how and when evidence-based CAM therapies should be used and effectively integrated into conventional medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: the 3 trials just discussed ought to inform the public, health-care providers, and policy-makers. It ought to inform them that there is no justification for integrating acupuncture or glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate for osteoarthritis of the knee, or echinacea for colds, into conventional medical care—exactly as prior probability had predicted. The NCCAM’s sympathetic language regarding these claims, even in the wake of its own, disconfirming trials, is characteristic of all such expositions presented by “CAM” proponents, including those associated with “CAM” or “integrative medicine” programs in medical schools. Maybe there are considerations involved other than scientific evidence. Ya think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) the combination measles‐mumps‐rubella vaccine causes autism by damaging the intestinal lining, which allows the entrance of encephalopathic proteins;&lt;br&gt;
(2) thimerosal, an ethylmercury‐containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system;&lt;br&gt;
(3) the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is by Jeffrey S. Gerber and &lt;a href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/immun/offit.shtml"&gt;Paul A. Offit&lt;/a&gt;, Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. You can read the &lt;a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476"&gt;whole study&lt;/a&gt; online or download a PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the question is often raised, "why not just do a study of vaccinated children vs. unvaccinated children and compare rates of autism," here is the authors' statement on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No studies have compared the incidence of autism in vaccinated, unvaccinated, or alternatively vaccinated children (i.e., schedules that spread out vaccines, avoid combination vaccines, or include only select vaccines). &lt;em&gt;These studies would be difficult to perform because of the likely differences among these 3 groups in health care seeking behavior and the ethics of experimentally studying children who have not received vaccines [my emphasis]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Offit states in a &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-01/idso-vaa013009.php"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Parents should realize that a choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice. It's just a choice to take a different, and far more serious, risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And "getting autism" is not what's being risked.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233367640840"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-8144610414454616836">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e1d68c5bc4a8e07e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Philosophy" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Anthropology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Sick Sad People" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Guest Post: "Bad Arguments Against Religion"</title><published>2009-01-30T20:40:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T20:40:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/01/guest-post-bad-arguments-against.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">Last week, my girlfriend (okay, my &lt;i&gt;fiancee&lt;/i&gt;; she's bugged me enough about not changing my reference in the last six months, but the word "fiancee" just seems too weird) attended a lecture at Purdue sponsored by Campus Crusades for Christ titled "Bad Arguments Against Religion." It was being given by some apologist douche called &lt;a href="http://www.str.org/site/PageServer?pagename=GregsInfoPage"&gt;Greg Koukl&lt;/a&gt; who runs an organization called "&lt;a href="http://www.str.org/"&gt;Stand to Reason&lt;/a&gt;," dedicated to promulgating the same old lame but rational-sounding arguments for Jesus and Christianity. "Stand to Reason" is to rationality what "Creation Science" is to science. The dog still has four legs, Mr. Koukl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I saw this event up on many blackboards last week and wanted to go. Kind of. Except someone needed to do the grocery shopping. And I'm sick of religious bloviating. I've reached this point where I detest thoughtful Christianity more than knee-jerk Christianity, because it is, to use a dated pop-culture reference, just lipstick on a pig. It tends to believe, however, that a thorough application of lipstick has turned it into a supermodel. The Fiancee was definitely going, though, so I asked her to put together a guest post for the blog here. Below are her compiled notes with her post-lecture thoughts in italics. My thoughts on what she wrote are in blockquotes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Bad Arguments Against Religion”. Or: “How Many Strawmen Can We Prop Up?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's the thing. I'm not going to take apart his arguments bit by bit. That's more your guys' thing than mine. I'm a life sciences major. Ask for a detailed pathway of water reabsorption in a nephron, and I'm your girl. Ask for the difference between an ontological and phenomenological argument, and I'll tell you to blow me. So, I'll leave the ripping to you guys. I'll just copy the notes that I took verbatim and let you draw your own conclusions from them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To set the scene, when we walked in there was a douchey guy playing elevator music on an acoustic guitar. At first I thought the guest speaker was actually enough of a pompous ass to have an opening act, but then I was told that it was actually the president of Campus Crusades for Christ just being a... Well, a pompous ass, actually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Christ, I hate douchey acoustic guitar acts. "To get you in the mood for Jesus, I'm going to play a little Jack Johnson." Fuck you, tool. Jason Mraz is performing at Purdue in a couple of weeks and I've just decided I might protest his concert on the grounds that his music is shit. &lt;/blockquote&gt;There were about a dozen of our campus non-theist club members there, in what we jokingly (and loudly) referred to as the Row of Heathens. We were there to hear the other side of things, but also to see if our prediction would come true of it just being another round of theist strawman bowling. “Line 'em up boys, and I'll knock 'em down!” And there was promise of drowning our pain in alcohol afterward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greg Koukl walks out on stage. He's a Lollipop Guild welcoming committee-looking kind of guy. He's got a smug grin on his face and does the requisite joke: “Oh em gee, it's COLD in Indiana!” Which was funny when Joel McHale did it two weeks ago and it was 18 below outside. Only it was 40 degrees that day, so the joke fell flat. The lights begin to dim, and I mutter: “Countdown to booze starts now.” And here is where my notes begin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: An asterisk and text in italics indicates a thought or personal observation that I made and wrote down. Regular text is something the speaker said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Post-911 world. “New atheists”: hostile, attacking Christians. Dawkins, Hitchens, etc.&lt;br&gt;Books being released in response to the “attacks” defending “truth” about God based on “scientific evidence”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, lots of scientific evidence. Apparently not once did he reference any of this evidence. On the upside, since his entire strategy was defending religion against "bad" arguments, it shows that we've got them on the defensive&lt;/blockquote&gt;Openly admits he wants to “put a rock in the shoe of the nonbelievers in the audience” to annoy them just enough to come to Jesus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;*If Jesus went around putting things in peoples' shoes, I'm pretty sure there wouldn't be as many Christians today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"And yea," spake Jesus, "shouldst thou find those that doubt the truth of the LORD your GOD, thou ought put a small pebble in their sandals, that they become greatly annoyed, for that is the way to Me."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Claim made by atheists: No scientific evidence for a soul.&lt;br&gt;- Compares to a lawyer trying to prove someone having a motive or proving guilt/innocence in terms of tangibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;* I'm not sure why he threw this in there. At the very beginning of the lecture he stated that he would provide three bad arguments against religion, but this wasn't one of the three. He also brought it up again when he closed the lecture. This leads me to believe that he's got a personal hard on for this particular topic, and even though it wasn't the intended focus of his lecture, he still couldn't resist throwing it in there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This one confused me, so I asked her what exactly the hell he was talking about. Apparently the analogy is that we don't have scientific evidence for motive in a trial, but we still believe it exists, therefore the soul also exists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My first reaction was "He's exactly right! Motive is an abstract concept that exists only in our heads, and the soul exists in the exact same way! I'm so glad he proved my point for me!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thinking about it more later, I realized that, far as I can see, he's tying himself implicitly to one of two claims, neither of which I think he would actually willingly profess. The first is the above idea that "the soul" like "motive" is purely an abstract, that it doesn't exist in any &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; sense, but is only an idea in our heads. The second is fairly hardcore Platonism. If he wants to say that this analogy shows that the soul &lt;i&gt;exists in reality&lt;/i&gt; as more than an abstract concept, then he has to say that a murderer's motive actually &lt;i&gt;exists in reality&lt;/i&gt;, that is, that it isn't simply a concept or a thought, but a &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt; that we can find through argumentation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know he won't claim the first because it's a materialist idea. The second he &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; claim, but even among philosophers there are precious few real, honest-to-God Platonists anymore. The idea that an abstract has a real existence in this realm or some other metaphysical realm is just kind of silly. Of course, that part "in terms of tangibility" might belie this idea; he might really think that motive is a real thing in the same way he thinks the soul is a real thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, his analogy, apart from accidentally committing him to things he probably doesn't believe, is internally flawed. He completely misunderstands the intent of legal argumentation. "Proving" motive is not an ontological exercise. The prosecutor arguing that Jimbo Slapwood's recently-purchased life insurance policy on his ailing and psychologically abusive mother constitutes a motive for her murder is not making an ontological claim. He's making a &lt;i&gt;rhetorical&lt;/i&gt; claim. He isn't trying to prove the existence of this thing called "motive," he's trying to &lt;i&gt;convince the jury&lt;/i&gt; that Mr. Slapwood had a reason to kill his mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may seem like a subtle difference, but it's important, because Greg Koukl is arguing that proving the soul through rhetoric is like proving motive through rhetoric, except that nobody ever proves the physical existence of motive through rhetoric. They only convince juries that there was a certain type of relationship between two or more people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, and much more importantly, he &lt;i&gt;completely ignores the role of physical evidence in a court proceeding&lt;/i&gt;. The jury is not convinced one way or the other by sheer bombacity and the clarity of pure, abstract reasoning. Physical evidence is used to back up each side's version of events. This is true when trying to prove motive: the prosecutor does not create an abstract syllogism that ends with "Therefore, Mr. Slapwood had a motivation to kill his mother;" rather, he looks at the relationship between the accused and the victim. Is there any way he might benefit from her death? Any reason his life would be easier without her? Did anyone ever hear him say "I wish my mother was dead?" or "If my mom dies, I get a massive insurance payout?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are all things that can be (and must be) demonstrated through evidence. Tape-recorded conversations. Eyewitness accounts. Insurance documents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Koukl says that proving the soul is like demonstrating guilt or innocence is when he really misses the boat. Proving guilt (you never actually prove innocence in America, at least; that's the null hypothesis) is tied explicitly and necessarily to the systematic collection and presentation of reliable evidence. More and more, as science improves our ability to tie criminals to their crimes, it is &lt;i&gt;physical&lt;/i&gt; evidence that is important. No prosecutor is arguing in a vacuum as are theologians. They are relying upon their evidence (and some good rhetorical skills) to demonstrate to the jury that Mr. Slapwood's gun, covered in his fingerprints, fired the bullet that killed his mother, and the neighbor saw it happen through an open window, and that the most likely explanation for these observed facts is that Mr. Slapwood did, in fact, murder his mother with a gun. Unlike a Christian apologist arguing against science, he is not simply attempting to poke holes in a well-evidenced idea; he is presenting positive evidence for his own claim which will stand or fall on its own merits (all other things being equal, of course).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a final note, no prosecutor is attempting to prove guilt in any &lt;i&gt;tangible&lt;/i&gt; way. There is no tangibility to "guilt;" the prosecutor is trying to convince the jury "Mr. Slapwood murdered his mother." They are making a statement about physical reality, not trying to prove the physical existence of an abstract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This completely upside-down understanding of the legal system, the extreme importance of evidence therein, and the role of argumentation in a legal proceeding leads me to believe that Koukl is either a &lt;i&gt;complete&lt;/i&gt; idiot or he is being intentionally obtuse and dishonest. Given the rest of this presentation (you'll see what I mean), I believe it to be the latter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;1.) Atheists claim that there is no truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Straw Man Number 1. Perhaps &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; postmodernism-inclined atheists posit this, but your average run-of-the-mill heathen says nothing of the sort. In fact, saying "There is no God" is making a statement of truth, even if it's provisional and isn't dogmatic, 100% eternal, capital-T "Truth." Most of us believe that claims can be true or false the same as anyone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, he might be dishonestly harping on a minor semantic note, that many science-minded atheists aren't interested in "Truth," &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;, but rather replicable evidence and observable facts, but that's a distinction that most people don't usually make unless they're being technical. Moreover, most average atheists probably don't think that way anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So either he's attempting to paint provisional acceptance of evidence as a rejection of the concept of truth, which is bound to go over everyone's heads anyway, or he's again just being dishonest. There is a third option, though: he could be doing the first thing dishonestly. He could be speaking about science's rejection of capital-T "Truth" in favor of provisional acceptance of evidence &lt;i&gt;with the full knowledge that it will go over the heads of much of his audience&lt;/i&gt;, who will instead get the message that atheists are all truth-denying postmodern relativist nihilists or something. Basically he would be intentionally equivocating a very technical use of the word "truth" and the general colloquial use so, if confronted, he could claim he was speaking technically, but otherwise leave the audience to assume he was speaking colloquially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, as always, he could just be an idiot.&lt;/blockquote&gt;- Moral relativism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Ahh, the idea that moral relativism is all we have without God. As if humans cannot lay down their own black-and-white sets of rules without a divine lawgiver. I don't see what makes his set more "objective" and "absolute" than ours. Is it just because they're metaphysically binding? (The answer is yes, as you'll see in a minute).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;- Compares to a person working in smog claiming to need a smoke break. Meaning to state that there is no truth is to try and claim a different truth, thus contradicting the original statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What in the bloody hell does this have to do with smoking in a smoggy environment? Why are apologists so terrible at creating analogies? Moreover, as I said above, &lt;i&gt;most atheists do not claim that there is no truth, at least not in the colloquial sense he's using&lt;/i&gt;. At this point he's basically just lying. His cute little truism about the truth-value of the statement "there is no truth" proves nothing whatsoever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;* Never heard any atheist worth his salt try and claim moral relativism as proof against God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Usually, moral relativism is claimed as a fallacious argument from consequences against atheism &lt;i&gt;by theists&lt;/i&gt;. I've never in my life heard an atheist say "There is no objective morality, therefore there is no God." Does he even know his own side's arguments?&lt;/blockquote&gt;2.) Atheists claim that if there is evil, God cannot exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, the problem of evil is still a problem. Screaming "free will!" does not get you out of jail free.&lt;/blockquote&gt;- Kept attacking relativism for some reason, even though it was no longer relevant.&lt;br&gt;- Compared evil to brussel sprouts, as if distasteful things = evil in atheists' eyes. I don't like brussel sprouts, therefore the presence of brussel sprouts in the world proves that there is no God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm so sick of shitty analogies I might vomit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;- Kept claiming most atheists are moral relativists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Where's your stats, Greg?&lt;/blockquote&gt;- Created analogy: What is a good bowler or a bad bowler? How do we know? Terminology only had meaning if there is a standard to compared bowling to: i.e. points, score. Where did the standard come from? Can't be culture, because morality transcends culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Umm...What? Certain ideas may be present in &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; cultures, i.e. mutually beneficial reciprocation or prohibitions against murder of members of the in-group, but in general, specific ideas of morality vary greatly between cultures, especially when you look at ideas from Christian morality. Views on premarital sex, for example, a big one for Christians, vary greatly from culture to culture across space and time. Some cultures think that it's a moral imperative &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; have premarital sex, like &lt;a href="http://www.janesoceania.com/png_trobriands/index.htm"&gt;the Trobriand Islanders&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise with homosexuality, extramarital sex, and so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Aztecs thought it was okay to light people on fire and cut out their hearts. That's really quite immoral when you think about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are only a few shards of morality that are somewhat universal cross-culturally: a prohibition of murder against members of the in-group (though what constitutes murder differs from culture to culture; is it murder to kill a disabled infant? An unfaithful wife? A neighbor who stole from your crop?), a prohibition against theft from members of the in-group (though, again, what we might see as theft might be acceptable in a different cultural context, i.e. medieval troops requiring serfs to feed and house them), a general promotion of reciprocation among members of the in-group, and (perhaps most telling) the idea that none of these rules apply to people who are not in the in-group. Enslavement of people you place outside the in-group is often okay, as is murder (the people the Aztecs sacrificed were often not themselves Aztecs, though sometimes they were), plunder (paging Senor Cortez), and so forth. Slavery, something we consider hugely immoral, was the norm for quite a long time among many cultures. Hell, rape, one of our most vile acts, isn't necessarily prohibited by many cultures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This type of moral layout is more or less what you'd expect to see if we evolved into social animals and broke into more or less independent tribes, bands, or groups; reciprocity and disinclination toward behavior like murder promotes individual survival because it means people are more likely to help you when you need it and less likely to kill you out of revenge for a slight. The out-group hostility makes sense from an evolutionary perspective; since an individual is not around those people constantly, it is less important that his innate moral behaviors take them into account, and besides that, he has his own group to back him up in a conflict. He is in less immediate personal danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The divine command explanation for morality would be expected to produce what Koukl &lt;i&gt;claims&lt;/i&gt; exists even though it clearly does not: homogeneous moral structures universally across cultures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, this is a drastic oversimplification, but it's far better than Koukl's ignorant blather wherein he completely ignores evolutionary psychology and cultural anthropology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And you know what? It's not even necessary that morality evolved biologically for some aspects to be sort of universal. All that's necessary is that those aspects are useful for smooth social interaction, so they were adopted more-or-less independently by multiple cultures across time. And you know what? They are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Can't be evolution, because if morals come from chance why bother obeying them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Feet couldn't have evolved, either, because if they came from chance, why bother walking on them? I hate to be overly glib, but that's all this piece of rank ignorance deserves. It's one of those things that's not even wrong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;* The false dichotomy that he created here of either moral relativism or God is so simple a three-year-old could point it out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But not, apparently, an apologist with two master's degrees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;3.) Atheists say science has disproved religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;* Here I have written: “No, no, no! No one says that!”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; said quite often is that if your deity interacts with the natural world noticeably, than science can study it. Since science has seen neither hide nor hair of your deity, he probably isn't here, or at least isn't doing the things you say he is doing. As Victor Stenger titled his book (which I still must read), God is a failed hypothesis. He has no explanatory power and science has, for 400 years, continuously disproved religious explanations in favor of natural ones, and not once has God shown up, anywhere, from archaeology to zoology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;- No one who understands science would ever try to measure the supernatural, nonphysical, or other worldly with a method that deals with physical, testable concepts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;* You're right!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; right. Scientists don't attempt to measure anything supernatural or nonphysical because it, by definition, cannot be be measured. But he's straw-manning again here and, I must note, &lt;i&gt;misrepresenting his own beliefs&lt;/i&gt;. The God of the Bible is forever meddling in physical reality, creating miracles and defying known scientific law. He should, therefore, have real, testable, observable physical effects. The Christian God is not a deistic clockmaker deity. He does not exist wholly outside of the universe in some magical supernatural realm that does not and cannot interact with our own. He's a meddler, and he's said time and time again to manifest &lt;i&gt;in reality&lt;/i&gt;, and if he manifests in reality, we can observe him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To turn his quote against him, nobody who understands science would claim it is something more than the systematic, controlled observation of the natural world, or that there are certain things that occur in the natural world that, because of their metaphysical content, cannot be observed or studied. Hell, some of the things are &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt;. A very dead guy comes back to life. Angels climb ladders down from heaven. Seas part. Pillars of fire scream down from the sky and speak to people. These are things that science would easily be able to study, and they're supposed to be the kinds of things that God does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smaller miracles are claimed every day by Christians across the globe. Is Koukl saying that those people are liars who don't understand that God is a supernatural being who doesn't interact with the physical world? Or is he saying that such interactions do happen but cannot be studied by science because their origin is something magically outside of the physical world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, is he lying about his own faith, or is he just being lame and using special pleading?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you know what? That's all completely immaterial. What's more important is that moving God outside of reality into the metaphysical and supernatural doesn't help his argument at all. It's a side-step into a pile of dog poo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope someday people will stop thinking that placing their evidence-free sacred cow outside of reality, whatever the hell that means, &lt;i&gt;is not a good argument&lt;/i&gt;. When you define God into immateriality, you define him into irrelevance, and essentially into nonexistence. Since we have no reason to believe that anything &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; exist in that way, and your definition of "supernatural" is ambiguous at best, you're not doing yourself any favors to say "Well, God's there, but he's just outside of reality." How, then, do you know anything about him, least of all that he exists at all? It's the dragon in the garage. It's the &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/09/appeal-to-metaphysics.html"&gt;appeal to metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;He ends with: “People are persuaded by these bad arguments because it's what they want to believe.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Not true. People are not persuaded by these arguments because nobody ever makes these arguments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;* Irony meter: asplode.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Seconded.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Q&amp;amp; A section:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have more evidence for Jesus than for any other historical figure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;* Upon hearing this, completely outside of my control or intent, my head somehow slammed itself into my notebook with so much force that the loud smacking noise reverberated throughout the theater. When I looked up, everyone, including the guest speaker, were staring at me. Oops.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Really? A handful of contradictory evangelical texts of dubious origin, a forged mention in the writings of Josephus, and a bunch of oblique mentions of early Christians and the "Christus" that they worshipped constitute better evidence for Jesus than the surviving writings of Aristotle (to pound it in: &lt;i&gt;shit he wrote himself&lt;/i&gt;) do for Aristotle?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have more for Jesus than we do for Mohamed, whose personal writings have been passed down to us, whose existence is unambiguous in contemporary accounts, and whose actions &lt;i&gt;while he was alive&lt;/i&gt; had wide-ranging influence and caused many, many scholars and historians to write about him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That meager sampling of Christ-lore is better than the photographs of Abraham Lincoln, not to mention the thousands of contemporary accounts and official records of his life, presidency and death?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To claim we have better accounts for Jesus than any other figure in history is so absurd that it almost implies that we cannot know anything useful about the past, as the thousands of figures that we do clearly know &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; more about are somehow more doubtful than an itinerant Jewish preacher whose &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; we don't even have right. The claim that there are fewer reliable records for the existence of Ghengis Khan,  Napoleon, or Tokugawa Ieyasu than there are for Jesus is not only a slap in the face to historians, archaeologists, and philologists everywhere, it implies a sort of total skepticism about historical records, except where they directly confirm Christian beliefs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Evolution has no morality. It gives us the illusion of morality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;* Huh?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To this I add the question "What the fuck's the difference?" The only possible difference between morality and the "illusion of morality" is a metaphysical one. A system of rules for civil social behavior is what it is regardless whether it came from a giant dude in the sky, a parliament, or general evolutionary inclinations selected for because they tend to increase your ability to live long enough to reproduce. Here he's placing religious morality on a metaphysical pedestal, claiming that it is somehow qualitatively better than any secular ethics because of its claimed source. This is just plain silly; apart from contriving a pretend distinction between two identical things, it yet again appeals to metaphysics as if that was somehow useful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claiming that evolved morality is only an "illusion" compared to divinely commanded morality, that two identical things are crucially different because of their source, is like eating some cake you really, really like, and then deciding that you didn't like it after all once you found out it was cooked by a Neo-Nazi. The tastiness of the cake was not illusory. It really was delicious. Saying that you only &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; it was delicious does not make sense. (That's a relevant analogy, Greg; now it's your turn).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cake is cake, Mr. Koukl, and ethics are ethics. You can argue that your ethics are better than other systems so long as you define your metric, but you cannot claim that one system is "illusory morality" based on a wholly contrived metaphysical distinction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Completely ignored a person's challenge that he created a false dichotomy with regards to relativism and morality. Responded with: “Well, there may be other explanations for why we can recognize right and wrong, I just don't think they're as good as God.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It was apparently a member of Purdue's philosophy faculty who asked this. Makes me almost proud of the ol' department. Almost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His response here shows that he is, at least in some sense, a stupid fucker. He didn't attempt to defend his supposition, against criticism in the least. He just retreated to an epistemologically nebulous "Well, maybe, but..." I wish someone had slammed him, saying that divine morality is nothing more than his own subjective preference, and thus he, by his own lights, is no better than an atheist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, I don't believe for a second that he does think there might be better explanations. It was just a fallback response when confronted with criticism from someone to whom he was obviously not prepared to respond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, I'm partially glad I went grocery shopping that night and partially sad that I wasn't there to call him out on some of his blatant falsehoods, rank dishonesty, and general ignorance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for putting all this together, woman. I hope it was worth it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-8144610414454616836?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233367640839"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-3609381703680068075">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0638ee7339c52aac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blog Carnivals" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The 104th Skeptics Circle</title><published>2009-01-29T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/01/104th-skeptics-circle.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">The &lt;a href="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/2009/01/28/104th-skeptics-circle-the-skepticism-review-and-education-program-edition/"&gt;104th meeting of the Skeptics Circle&lt;/a&gt; has been posted at &lt;a href="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/"&gt;Space City Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmpr/?Page=News&amp;amp;storyID=13522"&gt;Ben Stein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very sorry, seniors at that otherwise fine university. You're going to have a hack wingnut with a history of incompetence at economics, politics, and science standing up and giving you advice. I don't know what the administrators at your school were thinking; this is a man with no qualifications other than a droning monotone and a stint on a game show. It's an expression of profound disrespect to the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m really sorry for the biology department at UVM — it&amp;#39;s a real slap in the face for the university to drag in this disgrace who has been a figurehead for a movement that is trying to replace science with superstition; a demagogue who accuses modern biology of being a destructive force responsible for the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really baffled by this decision. It's not just that they must have been desperate for a speaker, but that someone with a real axe to grind had to have been on the committee that picked this old fraud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/university_of_vermont_makes_an.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/3NKCNMmS-Kg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233365279598"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/randolph_nesse_on_darwinian_me.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/21220b37b74e5233</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><title type="html">Randolph Nesse on Darwinian Medicine (video)</title><published>2009-01-30T23:48:51Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T23:48:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/vYMu9eQhyT4/randolph_nesse_on_darwinian_me.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/randolph_nesse_on_darwinian_me.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/5CljP6z51OM%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/randolph_nesse_on_darwinian_me.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/vYMu9eQhyT4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233365279598"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_117.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8a4c18343cd506b3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS ONE</title><published>2009-01-30T23:45:56Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T23:45:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/0ddC1-RJFQM/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_117.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_117.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=2&amp;amp;day=2&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;14 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004336" title=""&gt;Forest Structure and Roe Deer Abundance Predict Tick-Borne Encephalitis Risk in Italy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Western Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus often causes devastating or lethal disease. In Europe, the number of human TBE cases has increased dramatically over the last decade, risk areas are expanding and new foci are being discovered every year. The early localisation of new TBE foci and the identification of the main risk factors associated with disease emergence represent a priority for the public health community. Although a number of socio-economic parameters have been suggested to explain TBE upsurges in eastern Europe, the principal driving factors in relatively stable western European countries have not been identified. In this paper, we analyse the correlation between the upsurge of TBE in 17 alpine provinces in northern Italy from 1992 to 2006 with climatic variables, forest structure (as a proxy for small mammal reservoir host abundance), and abundance of the principal large vertebrate tick host (roe deer), using datasets available for the last 40 years. No significant differences between the pattern of changes in climatic variables in provinces where TBE has emerged compared to provinces were no clinical TBE cases have been observed to date. Instead, the best model for explaining the increase in TBE incidence in humans in this area include changes in forest structure, in particular the ratio of coppice to high stand forest, and the density of roe deer. Substantial changes in vegetation structure that improve habitat suitability for the main TBE reservoir hosts (small mammals), as well as an increase in roe deer abundance due to changes in land and wildlife management practices, are likely to be among the most crucial factors affecting the circulation potential of Western TBE virus and, consequently, the risk of TBE emergence in humans in western Europe. We believe our approach will be useful in predicting TBE risk on a wider scale.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004321" title=""&gt;The Effect of Transposable Element Insertions on Gene Expression Evolution in Rodents&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many genomes contain a substantial number of transposable elements (TEs), a few of which are known to be involved in regulating gene expression. However, recent observations suggest that TEs may have played a very important role in the evolution of gene expression because many conserved non-genic sequences, some of which are know to be involved in gene regulation, resemble TEs. Here we investigate whether new TE insertions affect gene expression profiles by testing whether gene expression divergence between mouse and rat is correlated to the numbers of new transposable elements inserted near genes. We show that expression divergence is significantly correlated to the number of new LTR and SINE elements, but not to the numbers of LINEs. We also show that expression divergence is not significantly correlated to the numbers of ancestral TEs in most cases, which suggests that the correlations between expression divergence and the numbers of new TEs are causal in nature. We quantify the effect and estimate that TE insertion has accounted for ~20% (95% confidence interval: 12% to 26%) of all expression profile divergence in rodents. We conclude that TE insertions may have had a major impact on the evolution of gene expression levels in rodents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004312" title=""&gt;Nitric Oxide Administration Using an Oxygen Hood: A Pilot Trial&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have shown earlier that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) administered by oxygen hood reduces pulmonary hypertension in an animal model (J Perinatol 2002; 22:50-6). Our objective in this study was to determine feasibility of iNO by oxygen hood in neonates with elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients (A-aDO2). Masked randomized controlled pilot trial. Inclusion criteria were: gestation≥34 weeks, age&amp;lt;7 days, with post-ductal arterial line, and A-aDO2 400-600. Infants were randomized to study gas (iNO 20 ppm or equivalent O2 flow) for 1 hr which was then weaned over the next 4 hours. Primary outcome was PaO2 one hour post-randomization. Four infants each were randomized to iNO or O2 (controls). Two of the four infants given iNO had an increase in PaO2 of &amp;gt;100 torr, while oxygenation was unchanged in the controls. Methemoglobinemia and other adverse effects were not noted in any infant. Environmental levels of NO and NO2 were minimal (&amp;lt;1 ppm) at &amp;gt;0.3 m from the hood. Administration of iNO by oxygen hood is feasible. Larger randomized controlled trials are required to measure the efficacy and determine an appropriate target population for this technique.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004340" title=""&gt;On the Evolution of the Standard Genetic Code: Vestiges of Critical Scale Invariance from the RNA World in Current Prokaryote Genomes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Herein two genetic codes from which the primeval RNA code could have originated the standard genetic code (SGC) are derived. One of them, called extended RNA code type I, consists of all codons of the type RNY (purine-any base-pyrimidine) plus codons obtained by considering the RNA code but in the second (NYR type) and third (YRN type) reading frames. The extended RNA code type II, comprises all codons of the type RNY plus codons that arise from transversions of the RNA code in the first (YNY type) and third (RNR) nucleotide bases. In order to test if putative nucleotide sequences in the RNA World and in both extended RNA codes, share the same scaling and statistical properties to those encountered in current prokaryotes, we used the genomes of four Eubacteria and three Archaeas. For each prokaryote, we obtained their respective genomes obeying the RNA code or the extended RNA codes types I and II. In each case, we estimated the scaling properties of triplet sequences via a renormalization group approach, and we calculated the frequency distributions of distances for each codon. Remarkably, the scaling properties of the distance series of some codons from the RNA code and most codons from both extended RNA codes turned out to be identical or very close to the scaling properties of codons of the SGC. To test for the robustness of these results, we show, via computer simulation experiments, that random mutations of current genomes, at the rates of 10−10 per site per year during three billions of years, were not enough for destroying the observed patterns. Therefore, we conclude that most current prokaryotes may still contain relics of the primeval RNA World and that both extended RNA codes may well represent two plausible evolutionary paths between the RNA code and the current SGC.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004337" title=""&gt;Confusion and Conflict in Assessing the Physical Activity Status of Middle-Aged Men&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;hysical activity (including exercise) is prescribed for health and there are various recommendations that can be used to gauge physical activity status. The objective of the current study was to determine whether twelve commonly-used physical activity recommendations similarly classified middle-aged men as sufficiently active for general health. We examined the commonality in the classification of physical activity status between twelve variations of physical activity recommendations for general health in ninety men aged 45-64 years. Physical activity was assessed using synchronised accelerometry and heart rate. Using different guidelines but the same raw data, the proportion of men defined as active ranged from to 11% to 98% for individual recommendations (median 73%, IQR 30% to 87%). There was very poor absolute agreement between the recommendations, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (A,1) of 0.24 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.34). Only 8% of men met all 12 recommendations and would therefore be unanimously classified as active and only one man failed to meet every recommendation and would therefore be unanimously classified as not sufficiently active. The wide variability in physical activity classification was explained by ostensibly subtle differences between the 12 recommendations for thresholds related to activity volume (time or energy), distribution (e.g., number of days of the week), moderate intensity cut-point (e.g., 3 vs. 4 metabolic equivalents or METs), and duration (including bout length). Physical activity status varies enormously depending on the physical activity recommendation that is applied and even ostensibly small differences have a major impact. Approximately nine out of every ten men in the present study could be variably described as either active or not sufficiently active. Either the effective dose or prescription that underlies each physical activity recommendation is different or each recommendation is seeking the same prescriptive outcome but with variable success.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minna is a woman in the advanced stages of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Gehrig%27s_disease"&gt;ALS&lt;/a&gt; who also has an Asperger's diagnosis.  She had been denied the nursing care she needs to survive because of complaints about her interpersonal communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that a number of people, including bloggers, activists, and quite possibly &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; shouted loud about the unethical nature of this neglect, and it's reported that Minna's services will be reinstated on Monday 2 February!  I'll be (happily!) closing the action to petition on Minna's behalf next week.  If you do choose to take the action still, please customize the letter to thank the recipients for restoring Minna's services but also urging them to make sure such a thing never happens again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This success means we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make a difference.  &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) the combination measles‐mumps‐rubella vaccine causes autism by damaging the intestinal lining, which allows the entrance of encephalopathic proteins;&lt;br&gt;
(2) thimerosal, an ethylmercury‐containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system;&lt;br&gt;
(3) the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is by Jeffrey S. Gerber and &lt;a href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/immun/offit.shtml"&gt;Paul A. Offit&lt;/a&gt;, Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. You can read the &lt;a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476"&gt;whole study&lt;/a&gt; online or download a PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the question is often raised, "why not just do a study of vaccinated children vs. unvaccinated children and compare rates of autism," here is the authors' statement on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No studies have compared the incidence of autism in vaccinated, unvaccinated, or alternatively vaccinated children (i.e., schedules that spread out vaccines, avoid combination vaccines, or include only select vaccines). &lt;em&gt;These studies would be difficult to perform because of the likely differences among these 3 groups in health care seeking behavior and the ethics of experimentally studying children who have not received vaccines [my emphasis]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Offit states in a &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-01/idso-vaa013009.php"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Parents should realize that a choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice. It's just a choice to take a different, and far more serious, risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And "getting autism" is not what's being risked.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233355547514"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-488262047686109051.post-6250141958404466486">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fce2ffe540ba3d17</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Teh Internets are growing...</title><published>2009-01-30T13:28:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T13:28:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/teh-internets-are-growing.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (teekblog)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">consider, evaluate, act</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233355149484"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2012">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8a3ddff3f8a3e6ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Conspiracy Theories"/><category term="UFOs/aliens"/><category term="9/11"/><category term="9/11 Truth"/><category term="UFO"/><category term="Jimmy Carter"/><category term="Infowars"/><category term="Paul Joseph Watson"/><title type="html">Exposing the 9/11 Conspiracy spin machine</title><published>2009-01-30T22:37:50Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T22:37:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/exposing-the-911-conspiracy-spin-machine/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infowars.com/former-president-jimmy-carter-supports-call-for-new-911-investigation/"&gt;Here &lt;/a&gt;is the latest from the one news source that makes Fox News look objective, Infowars. &lt;a href="http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vd3d3LmluZm93YXJzLmNvbS9mb3JtZXItcHJlc2lkZW50LWppbW15LWNhcnRlci1zdXBwb3J0cy1jYWxsLWZvci1uZXctOTExLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24v"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes a video of 9/11 conspiracy theorists doing what they always do, videotaping themselves while they harass some celebrity, in this case Former President Jimmy Carter, at a book signing and then framing their getting kicked out of the bookstore as further proof their beliefs that were allowed to stand or fall on their own merits in the public sphere (and in this case fell like a rock) is being silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/exposing-the-911-conspiracy-spin-machine/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/gO2UGVp--ak/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now they’re no longer asking if particular celebrities think “9/11 was an inside job.” No, I suspect they’ve been burned too many times on that one.&lt;br&gt;
So taking a page from the creationist Wedge Document, they’ve decided to spin it into something far more reasonable sounding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I was just wondering if you’d support the victims’ family members that want a new investigation into 9/11.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Who doesn’t want to support the victims’ families?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when Carter casually said, sure that he’d support “the victims’ family members that want a new investigation into 9/11″, Paul Joseph Watson decided to add him to the list of celebrities that support his cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s only one problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/oct/25/usa.uselections2004"&gt;Forme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/oct/25/usa.uselections2004"&gt;r Presi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/oct/25/usa.uselections2004"&gt;dent Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/oct/25/usa.uselections2004"&gt; Carte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/oct/25/usa.uselections2004"&gt;r doesn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/oct/25/usa.uselections2004"&gt;‘t suppo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/oct/25/usa.uselections2004"&gt;rt his cause&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vd3d3Lmd1YXJkaWFuLmNvLnVrL3dvcmxkLzIwMDQvb2N0LzI1L3VzYS51c2VsZWN0aW9uczIwMDQ="&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think the basic reason is that our country suffered, in 9/11, a terrible and shocking attack … and George Bush has been adroit at exploiting that attack, and he has elevated himself, in the consciousness of many Americans, to a heroic commander-in-chief, fighting a global threat against America,” Carter says.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This isn’t the first time the often good-natured Jimmy Carter has had his words exploited and twisted by fringe movements promoting an agenda. For many years, UFO nuts have touted Carter as someone who’s admitted to seeing a UFO himself.&lt;br&gt;
The implication was that Carter believed like they did that the unidentified flying object was from outer space, a misconception that Carter didn’t even know was being perpetuated and was very clear in correcting when he was &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=105"&gt;a guest on The Skeptics Guide To The Universe podcast. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;King Crimson, "Providence"&lt;/b&gt;: An instrumental jam from one of the best
  Progressive Rock albums ever - King Crimson's "Red".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marillion, "Half Empty Jam"&lt;/b&gt;: An absolute knockout of a track off of 
  Marillion's latest. Like pretty much everything on this two-CD set, it's 
  wonderful. This is some of the best work Marillion has ever done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phillip Glass, "Unaware of Its Taboos"&lt;/b&gt;: a scene from one of Phil Glass's operas, "Les Enfants Terribles". It's got a very typical Glass sound; perhaps a bit more sparse than most of his recent work, but you couldn't mistake it for anything but Glass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;IQ, "Breathtaker"&lt;/b&gt;: IQ is one of the best neo-progressive bands out
  there. This is a track off of their successful attempt to produce a
  "Lamb Lays Down on Broadway" style epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Olivier Messiaen, "Quartet for the End of Time: II. Vocalise, Pour L'ange Qui Annonce La Fin Du Temps"&lt;/b&gt;: As past readers of my random 10s know, I just recently discovered Messiaen, after stupidly avoiding his music for far too long. The Quartet that this comes from is an amazing piece of work. Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; listen to it alone in the dark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Van Der Graff Generator, "The Undercover Man"&lt;/b&gt;: Why didn't anyone tell me about this? It turns out that the great pioneers of Progressive Rock, "Van Der Graaf Generator" got back together a couple of years ago. They've released one live album and two new studio disks! This is off of the live. And even after 30 years away,
they've still got it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Tangent, "Lost in London"&lt;/b&gt;: The Tangent is something I've been listening too lately. Take 2 parts Flower Kings, 2 parts Van Der Graff Generator,
a few parts of Andy Tillison's unique inspiration, and just a hint of (of all things) Burt Bacharach(!), and mix. The result is a truly amazing but mostly unknown
neo-progressive band.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sonic Youth, "Electricity"&lt;/b&gt;: Very topical SY; noisy jangly guitars,
	strange tonalities. As usual, it works wonderfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mogwai, "Auto Rock"&lt;/b&gt;: My favorite track by Mogwai; it's sort of 
  a poster-child for everything that I like about them. Simple at its core, but
  assembled into something complex and multi-layered. There's so much to this,
  and yet it's built around a basic theme that's about 10 notes long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Flower Kings, "The Truth Will Set You Free"&lt;/b&gt;: the track that hooked my on the Flower Kings. It just happens that the first FK album I bought was "Unfold the Future", and this is the first track from that album. This single song is 31 minutes long, full of the kinds of textures and transitions that I love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

But Rebecca is demanding we all work overtime this week, so if she asks, you just saw an Indian girl running through here, stack of papers in arm, yelling into her cell phone for someone to have that report on her desk by 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Friday, so it’s cute animal day. And it’s Friday, so it’s time for a sex question. And it’s Friday, and I’m sick as a paraplegic leper in a prayer tent. And it’s Friday, so I’ve been drunk for the last 87 hours. And it’s Friday, so animals+sex+sick+probably drunk = the perfect recipe for… what else? Bestiality!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Nudists-Keep-Their-Hankies/dp/0061134074"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do Nudists Keep Their Hankies?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Mitchell Symons. It’s a book of questions you either never asked or never wondered about sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the topics brought up in the book is the question of bestiality and whether it’s moral. My knee jerk reaction has always been, &lt;em&gt;of course it’s immoral&lt;/em&gt;! But I never thought about it more than that. I really don’t want to think about it more than that.  But is it just me being puritanical and refusing to be sympathetic to someone else’s preference? Or is it really wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think? Is it wrong to get tight and shiny with an animal? Is it just weird and gross? Or is it totally fun and I’m just a prude?&lt;br&gt;

The earliest example of this trope that I can think of is in Michel de Montaigne's 1580 essay "&lt;a href="http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/montaigne/montaigne-essays--2.html"&gt;Of Cannibals&lt;/a&gt;". This is one of the founding documents of the "noble savage" tradition, and presents the alleged lack of certain words for certain bad things as evidence of the essential goodness of humanity in the state of nature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;These nations then seem to me to be so far barbarous, as having received but very little form and fashion from art and human invention, and consequently to be not much remote from their original simplicity. The laws of nature, however, govern them still, not as yet much vitiated with any mixture of ours: but 'tis in such purity, that I am sometimes troubled we were not sooner acquainted with these people, and that they were not discovered in those better times, when there were men much more able to judge of them than we are. I am sorry that Lycurgus and Plato had no knowledge of them: for to my apprehension, what we now see in those nations, does not only surpass all the pictures with which the poets have adorned the golden age, and all their inventions in feigning a happy state of man, but, moreover, the fancy and even the wish and desire of philosophy itself; so native and so pure a simplicity, as we by experience see to be in them, could never enter into their imagination, nor could they ever believe that human society could have been maintained with so little artifice and human patchwork. I should tell Plato, that it is a nation wherein there is no manner of traffic, no knowledge of letters, no science of numbers, no name of magistrate or political superiority; no use of service, riches or poverty, no contracts, no successions, no dividends, no properties, no employments, but those of leisure, no respect of kindred, but common, no clothing, no agriculture, no metal, no use of corn or wine; &lt;strong&gt;the very words that signify lying, treachery, dissimulation, avarice, envy, detraction, pardon, never heard of&lt;/strong&gt;. How much would he find his imaginary republic short of his perfection?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be curious to know whether it's now possible to determine which New World language (or language-family) the "cannibal" that Montaigne interviewed in Rouen in 1562 spoke, so that the truth of his assertions about the lack (for example) of a word for lying could be checked. [Update: it was &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1088#comment-20881"&gt;Tupinambá&lt;/a&gt;.] I'd lay my money against him, if there were any chance to settle the bet one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In later works, it's more common (I think) for alleged lexical impoverishment to be seen as a Bad Thing. At a minimum, it's a sign of (not particularly noble) social primitiveness. Thus Philalethes, "The Distinction between Man and Animals", &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HFEGAAAAQAAJ"&gt;The Anthropologicial Review&lt;/a&gt;, August 1864.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Nor, again, does the possession of a &lt;em&gt;power of abstraction&lt;/em&gt;, as Locke supposed, furnish any generic difference between man and brute. In the first place, there are many savage tribes among whom the power of abstraction can be barely said to exist at all, or only in the feeblest measure. The Iroquois have no generic word for &amp;quot;good;&amp;quot; the Mohicans no verb for &amp;quot;I love;&amp;quot; the Chinese no word for &amp;quot;brother;&amp;quot; the Malay no word for &amp;quot;tree&amp;quot; or for &amp;quot;colour;&amp;quot; the Australians no word for &amp;quot;bird;&amp;quot; the Esquimaux no word for &amp;quot;fishing;&amp;quot; though each of these language has a host of specific words for each separate kind of tree, bird, fish, &amp;amp;c.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It&amp;#39;s interesting to see the Chinese called a &amp;quot;savage tribe&amp;quot;.) I don&amp;#39;t know these languages, but as usual, I&amp;#39;d bet money against the claims, and expect to come out ahead. Of course, in some cases a core English word may be somewhat more abstract than the corresponding words in another language, just as the opposite is sometimes also true — but I&amp;#39;d plan to win money on the hypothesis that Philalethes is blowing smoke, and hasn&amp;#39;t even bothered to cherry-pick examples that are valid instances of his contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that languages differ somewhat in the generality of their semantic categories can be spun in several different ways — if your terminology is more specific than mine, perhaps this is because you&amp;#39;re not yet advanced enough to see the crucial generalization; on the other hand, if it&amp;#39;s more general, perhaps this is because you haven&amp;#39;t yet learned to make the needed distinctions. This &amp;quot;heads I win, tails you lose&amp;quot; approach is featured in all its ironic glory by Herbert Spencer in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=S3vdAAAAIAAJ"&gt;The Principles of Sociology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 1893. On p. 354 we learn that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… in the languages of inferior races the advances in generalization and abstraction are so slight that, while there are words for particular kinds of trees, there is no word for tree, and that, as among the Damaras, while each reach of a river has its special title, there is noene for the river as a whole, much less a word for river; or if, still better, we consider the fact that the Cherokees have thirteen verbs to express washing different parts of the body and different things, but no word for washing, dissociation from the part or thing washed; we shall see that social life must have passed through sundry stages, with their accompanying steps in linguistic progress, before the conception of a name became possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, in the preceding paragraph Spencer makes the opposite complaint about the linguistic inadequacies of inferior races, namely that they are unable to see the world accurately because they have not yet learned to make fine enough distinctions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&amp;quot;the colours green, black, and brown are habitually confounded in common Arabic parlance&amp;quot; … The Kamschadales have &amp;quot;but one term for the sun and moon&amp;quot; …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the all-time champion "no words for X" memes, at least in terms of durability and frequency, was documented by Ian Hancock ("Duty and beauty, possession and truth: lexical impoverishment as control", in Thomas Alan Acton and Gary Mundy, eds., &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=h9H1Cb_4nTcC"&gt;Romani Culture and Gypsy Identity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). I'll quote at length from his explanation, which includes quotations from Virginia Woolf, Erich von Stroheim, and Piers Anthony:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A number of authors have claimed that, because of our character as a people, Roma lack certain virtues, and that this is reflected in the Romani language which cannot even express them. Those which have been discussed by different writers include duty, possession, truth, beautiful, read, write, time, danger, warmth and quiet. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Over a century ago, Adriano Colocci first introduced a notion which has since because a part of gypsilorist folk wisdom. In his extensive discussion of the Romani people in his 421-page book, The Gypsies, he maintained that Roma:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&amp;quot;…have no more conception of property than of duty; &amp;#39;I have&amp;#39; is as foreign to them as &amp;#39;I ought&amp;#39;&amp;quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Citing Colocci as his source, Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso (1918:41) elaborated upon the statement in his widely-used book […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"The word &lt;em&gt;ought &lt;/em&gt;does not exist in the Gypsy language. The verb &lt;em&gt;to have&lt;/em&gt; is almost forgotten by the European Gypsies, and is unknown to the Gypsies of Asia"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In 1928, Konrad Becovici […] repeated this notion […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&amp;quot;I am attempting to unravel the story of a people whose vocabulary lacks two words — &amp;#39;duty&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;possession&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[…] This was then picked up … shortly afterwards by Erich von Stroheim (1935:12) …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"The Gypsy mind is timeless. The Gypsy tongue has no words to signify duty or possession, qualities that are like roots, holding civilized people fast in the soil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Fifteen years later the anonymous author of an article in &lt;em&gt;Coronet Magazine&lt;/em&gt; plagiarised and reworded the same statement:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"Even today, there are two important English words for which the Gypsy vocabulary has no known equivalent, and for which the Gypsy people have never exhibited any desire or need. One of them is the word 'duty', the other is 'possession'".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In a 1962 reissue of Leland's &lt;em&gt;Gypsy Sorcery and Fortune Telling&lt;/em&gt;, Margery Silver wrote […]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&amp;quot;[In Germany], where they had been chronically subjected to the most relentless and brutal oppression of their European experience since their first appearance in 1417, five hundred thousand &amp;#39;sons of Egypt&amp;#39; — whose vocabulary a recent writer has described as &amp;#39;lacking two words: duty and posession&amp;#39; — died in the Nazi ovens beside six million sons of jacob, whose history has founded on just those concepts, duty to God and possession of his law&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Five years after that, […] the statement turns up again in an article by Marie Wyn Clarke […]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"A young Gypsy wife said, 'There is no word in our language for "duty" or "possession", but I'm afraid there will be soon'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In her introduction to the 1983 edition of Bercovici's &lt;em&gt;Gypsies: Their life, lore and legends&lt;/em&gt;, Elizabeth Congdon Kovanen repeats this yet again …:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&amp;quot;The Gypsy vocabulary lacks the words &amp;#39;duty&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;possession&amp;#39;. This reflects their unwillingness to settle down, live in houses, obey the law, educate their children, be emplyed by others — and helps to explain their almost universal persecution.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The eighth repetition fo this strange idea is found in a novel by Piers Anthony (1988), &lt;em&gt;Being a Green Mother&lt;/em&gt;. […] The author describes someone&amp;#39;s attempt to learn Romani, who:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"discovered that the Gypsy language had no words for what in her own were rendered as 'duty' and 'possession.' This was because these concepts were foreign to the Gypsy nature."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The most recent … is found in Roger Moreau&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Rom&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"One thing the Romani &lt;em&gt;chib&lt;/em&gt; never acquired, though, was a future tense. Maybe this was a reflection of their attitude to life? … Neither is there a verb &amp;#39;to have&amp;#39; or a word for &amp;#39;possession&amp;#39; in Romanes, which I suppose makes sense if you don&amp;#39;t happen to own anything&amp;quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;…[O]ther words which Romani has been said not to have include: &lt;em&gt;truth, beautiful, read, write, time, danger, warmth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;quiet&lt;/em&gt;. The first was maintained by Jim Phelan, author of several books about Romanichals in which he describes his intimate life with British Travellers and in which he claims to ahve been "long ago admitted to the brotherhood". In his book &lt;em&gt;Wagon Wheels&lt;/em&gt; (1951) he says:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"There is no word for 'truth' in the romani (sic) language. There is the crux of the matter."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The concept 'beautiful' is denied in the language in Virginia Woolf's novel &lt;em&gt;Orlando&lt;/em&gt; (1956):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"One evening, when they were all sitting around the camp fire and the sunset was blazing over the Thessalian hills, Orlando exclaimed, 'How good to eat!' The gipsies have no word for 'beautiful'. This is the nearest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The latest claim to a lack of certain basic human responses or skills is found in Isabel Fonseca's &lt;em&gt;Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and their Journey&lt;/em&gt; (1995) wehre she maintain that there are no words in Romani for 'read' and 'write'. Elsewhere ni the same book she states that there are no words for 'time', 'danger', 'warmth' and 'quiet' either because these are foreign concepts for Roma. Even before the book reached the bookstores, reviewers were accepting and repeating these false assumptions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&amp;quot;[The Gypsy&amp;#39;s] is a world … where there are no words for &amp;#39;time&amp;#39; (for for &amp;#39;danger&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;warmth&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;quiet&amp;#39;) .. where no day is different from any other&amp;quot; (Kobak 1995:14)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Like Bayle St. John, who saw lexical &lt;em&gt;thefts&lt;/em&gt; as a more appropriate label than lexical &lt;em&gt;adoptions&lt;/em&gt; in his discussion of the non-native element in the Romani vocabulary, none of the above writers sufficiently overcame their stereotypical preconceptions of Gypsies or of what they &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; of the language, to ask a Gypsy himself whether these words existed or even to consult a Romani dictionary, of which dozens exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the whole hundred years of lexico-cultural speculation is nonsense, due to the simple fact that the assertions about the Romani vocabulary are completely false. As Hancock explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For a people who were enslaved in the Romanian principalities for five and a half centures, a people whose lives were an interminable succession of duties and obligations, and for whom possession were a precious thing, it should not be surprising that there are in fact many words for these two concepts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe they haven&amp;#39;t yet achieved the appropriate level of generalization? Except of course for the cases where they&amp;#39;ve failed to make an adequate number of critical distinctions…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233343720815"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3859">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f757eb9db831012</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="gender relations"/><category term="internet madness"/><category term="women"/><title type="html">A Menstrual Site for Men</title><published>2009-01-30T19:14:02Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T19:14:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/0XS9dDy5X7M/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/a-menstrual-site-for-men/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">That's how PMSBuddy.com pitches itself.

&lt;p&gt;"Darwin and Beyond: How Evolution Is Evolving"&lt;br&gt;
February 12, 2009&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:30 pm - 7:30 pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk Overview: Charles Darwin launched the modern science of evolution, but he hardly had the last word. In fact, today scientists are discovering that evolution works in ways Darwin himself could not have imagined. In my talk I will celebrate Darwin's achievements by looking at the newest discoveries about evolution, from the emergence of life to the dawn of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join us for a Darwin Day presentation by Carl Zimmer.  Mr. Zimmer is well known for his popular science writing, particularly his work on evolution.  He has published several books including Soul Made Flesh, a history of the brain, Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea, At the Water's Edge, a book about major transitions in the history of life, The Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human Origins; and his latest book Microcosm: E. coli and the New Science of Life.  Mr. Zimmer contributes to the New York Times, National Geographic, Discover, Scientific American, Science, and Popular Science.  He also maintains an award winning blog &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/" title=""&gt;The Loom&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location:&lt;br&gt;
North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences&lt;br&gt;
11 W. Jones St.&lt;br&gt;
Raleigh, NC 27601-1029&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More info to come.  I'll try to grab Carl and take him to some cool local undisclosed location for a beer.  I'll have more when the time gets closer and we have something planned....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/darwin_day_talk_by_carl_zimmer.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/st9Ab_nXs94" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233342467272"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/30/et-rock-hunting-at-the-bottom-of-the-world/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/574767ff3cbd6473</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">E.T. rock hunting at the bottom of the world</title><published>2009-01-30T19:00:18Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T19:00:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/30/et-rock-hunting-at-the-bottom-of-the-world/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am in Pasadena getting ready for &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/21/explore-cosmic-limits-with-me/"&gt;the ultracool astronomy panel tonight&lt;/a&gt;, so today will be light blogging from me.

The story is riveting, and as an added bonus they describe what Shackleton’s team was doing on that same date exactly 100 years earlier. Shackleton’s story of Antarctic exploration is, very seriously, one of the greatest human adventures &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;, and this will give you a small taste of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233341206971"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-7764774490193130574">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/047099b629c73e1c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="My World" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Whatever Happened to Common Sense?</title><published>2009-01-30T17:29:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T18:45:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/whatever-happened-to-common-sense.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/7764774490193130574/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=7764774490193130574" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Steve Mirsky, writing in Scientific American, tells a story that we can all relate to [The Unkempt Results of Post-9/11 Airport Security Rules].&lt;br&gt;Lewis Carroll’s Alice would have had trouble distinguishing reality from Wonderland had she been with me on the Sunday after Thanksgiving as I watched a TSA officer confiscate my father’s aftershave at the airport in Burlington, Vt.

I was on my best behavior for the first ten minutes or so (I think), and then at some point Marc used the word “shit,” at which point I figured that meant I could use my normal, carny trash vocabulary. This morning, I see that last night’s show is the only one on the front page with a bright red “profanity” label. Sorry, Marc!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you’d like to hear Marc and I discuss religion, magic, juggling, conspiracy theories, global warming, Oprah, and anti-vaccinationists with a small amount of profanity, you can listen now &lt;a href="http://www.talkradioone.com/2009/01/29/next-marc-germain-live-thursday-8pm-pacific11pm-eastern/"&gt;by clicking here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COMMENT O’ THE WEEK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition this week was seriously stiff, and I don’t necessarily mean that in a sexy way – though runner-up The 327th Male certainly did turn us all on with &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5542&amp;amp;cpage=3#comment-48297"&gt;this puntastic comment&lt;/a&gt;. ThickMcRunfast also gets a runner-up for &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5682&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-49226"&gt;this spam parody&lt;/a&gt; (mostly for naming the goat “Jingles”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that was, sadly, not enough to compete with &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5692&amp;amp;cpage=3#comment-49179"&gt;this entry from Eliza&lt;/a&gt; in Elyse’s recent Afternoon Inquisition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.surpluscats.net/"&gt;Eliza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.surpluscats.net/"&gt;&lt;img style="border:medium none;float:left;margin-right:10px;display:inline" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/778c6f3eafc4ebb6da288876fceaa749?rating=X&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;// Jan 26, 2009 at 3:54 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elyse, you are not alone in the minimal Star Wars experience department. In every multi-roommate housing situation I’ve been in, there’s been one fanatical Star Wars guy who is completely outraged by my misspent youth. From this experience, my expert opinion is that you should not watch any of them so that you can continue to shock and stun everyone and be a source of deep frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite bomb to drop on an unsuspecting group: “Which one is C-Beepio?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: “When does Wil Wheaton show up?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-Beepio! I mostly love this because I often do a similar thing, even though I AM familiar with Star Wars (and Star Trek): I just call the Millennium Falcon “The Enterprise” and vice versa, always with amusing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So congrats, Eliza! Your prize is the chance to purchase anything you’d like – with your own money – from &lt;a href="http://www.charliesplayhouse.com/"&gt;Charlie’s Playhouse&lt;/a&gt;! That’s right, I’m turning this into a plug, thanks to a well-timed e-mail from company prez Kate, who informed me that if any of you go there and purchase something and say you heard about the site via Skepchick, I get a FREE T-SHIRT! In the spirit of the COTW, the first free t-shirt I get from this deal will in fact go to Eliza. Yes that’s right – this might actually turn into a COTW with a real, physical prize. Hooray!

This derogatory media is immediately reminiscent of the &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/provocative-harsh-upsetting-the-ransom-notes-ad-campaign/"&gt;ransom notes campaign&lt;/a&gt; from NYU in 2007, when children with a variety of disabilities  &lt;a href="http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=21"&gt;were portrayed as having been "kidnapped"&lt;/a&gt; by their disability. Swift, united action by twenty two disability rights organizations, the autistic community (including some of you reading this now), and lead by the &lt;a href="http://change.org/autisticadvocacy"&gt;Autistic Self Advocacy Network&lt;/a&gt;, resulted in the offensive campaign being &lt;a href="http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=23"&gt;pulled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were victorious with NYU, our work is still on going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to unite and take action again against harmful mischaracterization of autism, disability, and children with disabilities in the media.  Here are two immediate ways you can make a difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The Autistic Self Advocacy Network has started an action alert and petition to the Fundraising Standards Board, Hilary Armstrong (British Parliament) and Gary Day (Action for Children) that can be found &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/autisticadvocacy/actions/view/action_for_children_offensive_ad_campaign_alert"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Special note to non-US users--we&amp;#39;re aware of the issue with international access and should have that corrected soon.  Until then you can still send the letter by following these instructions 1) Select &amp;quot;AL&amp;quot; from states list, 2) enter your actual country and county in the &amp;quot;City &amp;amp; State&amp;quot; box, 3) enter only the first 5 characters of your post code for the zip code)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Make a complaint directly to the &lt;a href="http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/about/"&gt;Advertising Standards Committee&lt;/a&gt;, here's a link to &lt;a href="http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/how_to_complain/complaints_form/"&gt;the form&lt;/a&gt; for that.  For tips on what to say to ASA, plus to let everyone know you've contacted ASA, use the action alert &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/tell_asa_no_more_monstrous_messages"&gt;Tell ASA No More Monstrous Messages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on the Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://the-newrepublic.blogspot.com/2009/01/autistic-monster-dan-cured.html"&gt;The New Republic&lt;/a&gt; has a fantastic (I dare say better written than mine) blog post with a considerable amount of additional information.  Head over to there to learn more about the situation and how you can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Tony Attwood has &lt;a href="http://the-newrepublic.blogspot.com/2009/01/attwood-speaks-monster-ad-slammed.html"&gt;made a statement&lt;/a&gt; against this unethical campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Facebook junkies, join the group &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=47154931157#/group.php?gid=47154931157"&gt;Let's stop "Action for Children" demonising autistic children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Younger offspring:&lt;/b&gt; Lots of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Free-Ride:&lt;/b&gt; Like what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Younger offspring:&lt;/b&gt; We learned about rocks and minerals.  Rocks are made out of minerals, and some rocks have more than one kind of mineral in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Free-Ride:&lt;/b&gt; So, what's a mineral?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Younger offspring:&lt;/b&gt; Umm ... I think quartz is a mineral.  They can cut it in the shape of jewels.  And also marble.  But I think granite has more than one mineral in it.  And we talked about how different rocks are formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Free-Ride:&lt;/b&gt; Oh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Younger offspring:&lt;/b&gt; There are some rocks that form from the lava when volcanos erupt.  We got to look at some pumice and see all the bubbles that were in the lava when it got hard to make the rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Free-Ride:&lt;/b&gt; I know another kind of rock mad by volcanos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Younger offspring:&lt;/b&gt; What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Free-Ride:&lt;/b&gt; It's called obsidian.  It's really smooth and glassy, so I'm guessing that the lava that hardens to make obsidian has hardly any air bubbles at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Younger offspring:&lt;/b&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Free-Ride:&lt;/b&gt; So, do you know anything about earthquakes?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/01/friday_sprog_blogging_whats_sh.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/01/friday_sprog_blogging_whats_sh.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/cdEuBLw1Pd8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233336369365"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5786">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ec0c7383a02ec6d6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="bbc news"/><category term="gordon brown"/><category term="news fart"/><category term="ringtones"/><title type="html">News Fart</title><published>2009-01-30T16:29:02Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T16:29:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5786" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4af58566587f868164f2085bcbfe08d8&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;News Fart is an expression I just invented. It means “a totally unnecessary piece of hot air which stinks up your public news page but can’t simply be ignored”.  You know the type, they’re always about talking parrots or celebrity divorces. You resist clicking the headline all day because you know it’s crap, but after you’ve read every piece of ‘real’ news on the site, you find yourself clicking on the damn thing  anyway, like the moment you can’t hold your breath any longer and have to take a lungful. Unless it’s my own fart which of course smell of baby rainbows and peaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I was trapped in a guff-filled elevator with this humdinger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime Minister interrupted by own mobile - but what ringtone does he have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the BBC News homepage, that headline was accompanied by a pic of Gordon Brown, and no further information to confirm that the story was as utterly vaccuous and newsless as it appeared. I tried to ignore it. I’ve looked at the BBC News homepage about six times today, and every time, I tried to ignore it. But it wafted. It floated. It most definitely blew, and after having a conversation in my head several times in which I confirmed that I don’t give a flying monkey’s purple ass what ring tone my country’s leader has, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/business/2009/davos/7860310.stm"&gt;I clicked the damn thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINE. Now I know. I’ve smelt the fart of newsless news. I know that Gordon Brown has that awful NEENER NEENER, NEENER NEENER, NEENER NEENER, NEE Nokia ringtone that everyone hates. That’s appropriate, everyone hates Brown, too. But come on, BBC, please. Stop stinking up my news page with the fetid aftermath of last night’s curry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>tkingdoll</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233336360211"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/teapots_seem_to_infuriate_them.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a586e6b23d2932ba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Teapots seem to infuriate them almost as much as buses</title><published>2009-01-30T16:37:09Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T16:37:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/CUzi2gjGzUU/teapots_seem_to_infuriate_them.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/teapots_seem_to_infuriate_them.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've been seeing an amazing amount of press given to something as simple as atheist signs on public transport, and here's another thing that makes the apologists for religion tear their hair out: Russell's teapot. They don't get it. They read the idea with dumb incomprehension, and when they do try to explain it, they just expose their own silly misinterpretations. Case in point, &lt;a href="http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/01/the_teapot_analogy.php"&gt;Ross Douthat&lt;/a&gt;, who puts a goofy gloss on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analogy - like its modern descendant, the Flying Spaghetti Monster - makes a great deal of sense if you believe that the idea of God is an absurdity dreamed up by crafty clerics in darkest antiquity and subsequently imposed on the human mind by force and fear, and that it only survives for want of brave souls willing to note how inherently absurd the whole thing is. As you might expect, I see the genesis of religion rather differently: An intuitive belief in some sort of presiding Agent seems to be an extremely common, albeit hardly universal, feature of human nature; this intuition has intersected, historically, with an enormous amount of subjective religious experience; and this intersection (along with, yes, the force of custom and tradition) has produced and sustained the religious traditions that seem to Richard Dawkins and company like so much teapot-worship. The story of our civilization, in particular, is a story in which an extremely large circle of non-insane human beings have perceived themselves to be experiencing an interaction with a being who seems recognizable as the Judeo-Christian God (here I do feel comfortable using the term), rather than merely being taught about Him in Sunday School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.strangedoctrines.com/2009/01/ross-douthats-universal-counteranalogizer.html"&gt;Michael Drake has his own pithy reply&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shorter Ross Douthat: Comparing belief in God to belief in the Celestial Teapot is absurd, because it's like comparing a belief only some people know is absurd to a belief everyone knows is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have my own version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shorter Ross Douthat: If enough of us imagine it, it must be real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was about 10 years old, I went to see a late-night horror movie (&lt;i&gt;Die, Monster, Die&lt;/i&gt; with Boris Karloff, if you must know; it had face-melty mutants produced by a weird meteorite kept in an old mansion), and afterwards my uncle drove me home in his old 50's era Ford with the big bench seats high up off the floorboards. I vividly recall a terrible dread that there was &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;, a horrible monster, hiding under the seat, and if I let my legs dangle down, it was going to rip my feet off. I &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; there wasn&amp;#39;t — the seats weren&amp;#39;t that high that Boris Karloff could fit under them — but my perfectly normal, non-insane mysterious agency perception was simply set tinglingly high by a few hours of jump-and-twitch at a monster movie, and I was imagining supernatural beings where there weren&amp;#39;t any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look. I was ten years old, high on Coca-Cola and jujubes, and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; could figure that out. How old is Ross Douthat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you actually read Dawkins, or any of us other critics of religion, you will discover that we do not think the majority of humanity is insane, and we also don't believe religion was cobbled up by a shadowy cabal of power-mad priests. Douthat &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; has it: we know that human beings readily imagine agency even where there is none, and that it is extremely easy to feel a sensation of the existence of unseen entities, especially when you've been primed by an exercise in the imagination, whether it is a horror story or preacher in his pulpit.  However, we do &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; have agency sensors, we have agency &lt;i&gt;interpreters&lt;/i&gt;. Imagining a boogey man or a god is perfectly normal, but it does not make them real. Taking your boogey man and wrapping him up in layers and layers of ritual and tradition and over-reaching apologetics does not make him any more real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's our message. It's time to look under the car seat, gang, and see there's nothing there. And don't you feel silly, spending millennia going on and on about the all-powerful beastie, and finding it's nothing but cobwebs and darkness and your own hyperactive imagination?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Russell's Teapot, I have to add a little fillip to that tiny porcelain entity. As it goes trundling in its circuit about the sun, I must imagine that there is painted on its side a little sign: "There probably is no teapot. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life." It definitely won't make it any more real, but it will infuriate those who believe the manifestations of imagination must have some objective reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/teapots_seem_to_infuriate_them.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/CUzi2gjGzUU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233335861632"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25805659.post-138142197091348995">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8ef5f984ad50d928</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="What Doctors Don't Tell You" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="acupuncture" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="WDDTY" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Traditional Chinese Medicine" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Tong Ren and the Magic Magnetic Hammer of Healing</title><published>2009-01-30T16:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T16:15:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/01/tong-ren-and-magic-magnetic-hammer-of.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Le Canard Noir)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/rss.xml</id><title type="html">the quackometer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233335188887"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3845">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/47d7ed140d94055d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="financial crisis"/><category term="games"/><category term="Guitar Hero"/><title type="html">Treasury Hero</title><published>2009-01-30T19:24:32Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T19:24:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/epA-wOZMVnA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/treasury-hero/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The details are tedious and inscrutable.

More people get it! &lt;a href="http://www.readthewriting.com/readers/death-from-the-skies-by-dr-phil-plait/"&gt;Read the Writing&lt;/a&gt; has a great review of &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapters are brief, to the point, and for the most part endlessly entertaining. Plait’s casual style that you may have seen in his YouTube clips from Bad Astronomy flows well onto the page. The book is written for the layperson, so the science and physics is down to Earth and relayed in the simplest terms so that even a basic grounding in high school science should help you breeze through the explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a little bit disturbing, it’s not really too frightening. Most of the events described, while happening every day in the universe, have a very low chance of befalling the planet in our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, that feels good. You’d think I’d get tired of all these positive reviews of people who love the book and tell others to read it, but as it turns out, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So heed their reviews! Look over there on the right, in the sidebar, with the big orange and red picture of the book. See those links? You know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it makes a great Valentine’s Day present.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233332185176"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1922280837159844111">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d19685d959fb242c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">When Rationalism Trumps Superstition</title><published>2009-01-30T16:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T16:18:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/blog-post.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/1922280837159844111/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=1922280837159844111" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Or maybe not ....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Hat Tip: Canadian Cynic]</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233331759432"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_587.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/165ec8b5d6ba61e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-01-30T13:04:40Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T13:04:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/wQEuA17-6bc/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_587.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_587.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_587.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_587.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/wQEuA17-6bc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233331598031"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3825">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1b0fdbc2bdbe5e31</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Economics"/><category term="economists"/><title type="html">Economist Angus Deaton's Vision for Development Economics</title><published>2009-01-30T17:54:40Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T17:54:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/VUnFaYCcUhU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/economist-angus-deatons-vision-for-development-economics/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">For the more academically inclined among you, Princeton economist Angus Deaton offers his appraisal of the state of development economics.

The January 27th &lt;a href="http://www.poststar.com/articles/2009/01/27/news/local/14192327.txt"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; is about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hard_hard_questions_residential_placement"&gt;residential placements&lt;/a&gt; for adults on the autism spectrum and also, in one case, for a 12 year old. Joey Hunsinger has been living at St. Colman's, a residential school in Watervliet, ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joey lives at St. Colman's the majority of the time but comes home to Queensbury about every other weekend and for all major holiday breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As tough as it was to make that decision, I knew it was the most selfless thing I could do to send him there," Hunsinger said. "I'll never be 100 percent accustomed to him not being with me every day. Even though it was the right thing, and he's adjusted, you're not supposed to send your 12-year-old away."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunsinger struggled most with the decision when Joey would utter, "No St. Colmans, Mom. Home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don't know how I would take hearing my son say those words. We need to focus on community services and create supports and residences for individuals with disabilities in the community, so that institutions and segregated placements are not seen as "options."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/nj_de-institutionalization_bill_a3625_change_amp_hope_for_the_future"&gt;NJ De-Institutionalization Bill A3625&lt;/a&gt; was introduced earlier this month; it's a call to close five of New Jersey's seven state developmental centers within five years and use funds now spent on them for community housing instead. This is the &lt;a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2008/Bills/A4000/3625_I1.HTM"&gt;bill text&lt;/a&gt; and you can go &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/autisticadvocacy/actions/view/support_a3625_and_community_living_for_new_jerseyans_with_developmental_disabilities"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to this &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/autisticadvocacy/actions/view/support_a3625_and_community_living_for_new_jerseyans_with_developmental_disabilities"&gt;action alert&lt;/a&gt;, to send a letter supporting A3625 directly to NJ state legislators (unfortunately, only New Jersey residents can send this letter).  Needless to say, A3625 strikes very close to home for me----let's work to keep our loved ones in the community and home, with us, among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A3265 was sponsored by Assemblyman Louis Greenwald, who speaks in this video.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest change to American tv since the advent of color back in the stone age I think.&lt;br&gt;
In 2005, Congress mandated that the analog over-the-air signals that tv has been broadcast in since its inception would be switched over to all digital on February 17th 2009. In other words, in less than a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this being done? Not because digital is cool and analog isn’t…well, not the only reason.&lt;br&gt;
Digital TV or DTV as it’s called, has many benefits like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better picture- A much sharper image plus no more ghosted images or noise. Of course if you have the proper set, you will now be able to receive Hi-def programming over the air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More channels and programs available due to multicasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last aspect is generally less well known. Digital tv allows multicasting which permits the availability of sub-channels. This would mean that your old channel 5 could also offer 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 etc. These sub-channels could include a standard-definition program, a hi-def version, local news, weather, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

This is only part of the picture though (so to speak). The spectrum that frees up after the switch will be available for mobile computing and interoperable emergency-response networks. The need for the latter was greatly highlighted in the &lt;a href="http://gop.gov/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1.111&amp;amp;p_p_id=56_INSTANCE_2Y0o&amp;amp;p_p_action=0&amp;amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;amp;p_p_col_id=column-3&amp;amp;p_p_col_pos=0&amp;amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;amp;_56_INSTANCE_2Y0o_groupId=1&amp;amp;_56_INSTANCE_2Y0o_articleId=S_328_111&amp;amp;_56_INSTANCE_2Y0o_version=1.0"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; from 9/11 commission…remember that? They recommended more radio spectrum for first responders to disasters because police and firefighters had such trouble communicating with each other and with rescue helicopters that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government’s been trying to make people aware of this switch. The main effort seems to be allocating a ton of money so that each family can get vouchers to defray most of the cost. The problem is that this money ran out and there’s a few million people on a voucher waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has many politicians and consumer advocates concerned:&lt;br&gt;
Joel Kelsey of Consumers Union &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-digital28-2009jan28,0,4241362.story"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
“Consumers throughout America . . . will lose access to essential news and information” if the deadline isn’t extended,. “Even if they tried to act six weeks early, they couldn’t, because the coupon program melted down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Obama is concerned as well, He’s been pushing hard to delay the whole transition for another 4 months until June 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A delay seemed like a forgone conclusion when the Senate passed the “delay” bill unanimously last Monday the 26th. A surprise came on January 28th when the House of Representatives actually failed the 2 thirds majority required. The latest news now is that  the House made some tweaks and the bill just passed the Senate again. Next week it seems damn likely the House will approve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish they would just leave well enough alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/65-million-us-homes-unready-for-digital-tv-transition/"&gt;Nielson&lt;/a&gt;, only 5.7 percent of American households aren’t ready for the change. That’s only going to drop lower in the next few weeks. There’s always going to be people that love the sound of dead-lines as they go swooshing by. If they’re clueless about the change now after all the publicity, they’ll probably be the same way in 4 months. Also, everyone seems to think that the 5.7 percent are older technology-challenged people. In fact, the Nielson survey shows that under 35 yr olds are more likely than over 55 yr olds to lack converter boxes or new tvs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s a worst case scenario? They wake on February 18th, see static on their tv, drive to best-buy to purchase a converter and they’re home and hooked up in under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A delay is also not fair to the companies that have been preparing for this for years and years. Wireless companies have spent billions to use the about to-be-available airwaves. It’s expensive for broadcasters to maintain and use analog and digital equipment. Don’t forget that lives may even be saved the sooner the emergency workers can take possession of their slice of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a provision in the bill allowing broadcasters to make the switch whenever they want. They wouldn’t even have to wait until mid-June. I wouldn’t wait if I had expensive analog machinery running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, those of you blissfully unaware of the impending digital conversion; if you wake up on February 18th or June 13th to a static-filled version  of “The Wheel of Fortune”, don’t freak out. Wait a few minutes before you frantically call your technically savvy son-in-law or grandfather. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the static on your tv which was partly created by the big bang 13.7 billion years ago. It may be another 50 years before you see it again when we switch over to holographic tv or maybe smelli-vision&lt;/p&gt;

The reason is bizarre: administrators at the school have harrassed and violated the civil rights of a young woman named Brandi Blackbear because — and I&amp;#39;m a bit ashamed to admit this can go on in my country — &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion/schools/16295prs20001026.html"&gt;they accused her of witchcraft&lt;/a&gt;. They say she used a magic spell to make one of her teachers sick. In retaliation, she has been subjected to searches and public humiliation, and the school has banned the wearing of non-Christian paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure this is the 21st century, not the 17th. You would have a tough time noticing it if you relied on religious attitudes to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article mentions that they'd like to see the school show some evidence that Blackbear actually hexed anyone. This is not a good idea. From their track record so far, the Oklahoma school administrators might think the appropriate way to do that is to call in a witchfinder and throw Blackbear into a pond, or search her for witchmarks with a large needle. And if those don't work, there are always thumbscrews and the rack. They'll get a confession eventually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/going_back_to_our_puritan_root.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/SoB150eentk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233326443167"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/01/30/all-work-and-no-play/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e92319d08be90b91</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Travel"/><title type="html">All work and no play…</title><published>2009-01-30T14:35:14Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T14:35:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/01/30/all-work-and-no-play/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, during our &lt;a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~rbean/Aspen/AspenCosmo.html"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt;’s afternoon break, I finally hustled up to &lt;a href="http://gorp.away.com/gorp/activity/skiing/features/extreme_classics7.htm"&gt;Aspen Highlands Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. This involved taking two lifts, and then a snowcat, and then a 45 minute hike along the ridge, ending at over 12,000 feet elevation. The bowl is steep. Very, very steep. Up to 48 degrees steep (measured down from horizontal). For some perspective, if you were to point your snowboard straight down the mountain for 3 seconds, you’d find yourself going 50 miles per hour [exercise for the reader]. Well, at least that would be true if the mountain was covered in a sheet of (perfectly frictionless) ice. Fortunately, it wasn’t.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/bowl.jpg" title="dan at aspen highlands bowl"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/bowl.jpg" alt="dan at aspen highlands bowl" width="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When you’re at the top, you need to peer over the edge to see the terrain. For the record, I’m afraid of heights. Standing on a ridge in the freezing cold, with a brisk wind blowing, with a thousand foot steep vertical drop on both sides, should not be a pleasant experience. The whole Freudian death wish thing should kick in pretty hard. But something about all that fluffy powder magically transforms imminent death into the perfect playground. Dropping into the bowl was heavenly. The whole place was virtually deserted. Waist-deep powder in places. With a wonderful runout through the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hours later I was back in the conference room, learning more about the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/11/25/somethings-in-the-air/"&gt;latest results&lt;/a&gt; on dark matter detection. A good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Aaron Sheldon brings up a good point in the comments. I’m a big fan of helmets on the slopes. For me it’s a no-brainer, as it were. Plus, helmets keep your ears toasty warm. Also, especially if you’re going out-of-bounds, pack appropriate avalanche gear (a beacon, a probe, a shovel, etc.). It’s dangerous out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2009/01/sepsis_is_not_caused_by_infection/011_OctavioBastos.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="011_OctavioBastos.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I come across something so bizarre, so utterly wrong, that my mind reels in confusion and amazement, not to mention horror, that anyone can actually think or write something something like it. In fact, for a moment I considered offering up this one bit of horrifically inspired craziness up as an installment of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt;, but I decided against it. The reason, I'm afraid, is the same reason that I've considered some bits of woo previously for this "honor" but then ultimately declined and covered them as normal posts, dripping with my usual brand of Respectful and not-so-Respectful Insolence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember &lt;a href="http://articlesofhealth.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Robert O. Young&lt;/a&gt;--excuse me Dr. Robert O. Young or Robert O. Young, Ph.D., D.Sc., both titles that he seems to be especially enamored with? You don't? Perhaps you remember that he is the guy who thinks that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_acid_base_or_woo_2.php"&gt;all disease is due to excess acid&lt;/a&gt; (due to diet, of course!), that cancer is a "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/01/a_horrifying_breast_cancer_testimonial_f.php"&gt;liquid acid&lt;/a&gt;," and that viruses are &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/viruses_are_molecular_acids.php"&gt;"molecular acids&lt;/a&gt;," among other complete and total woo. His one-size-fits-all treatment for all disease follows logically from his central thesis, namely that the treatment for all disease is to "alkalinize" the blood through diet and various other means. I say "logical" not because Young is right but because his conclusion does logically flow from his premise. Of course, his premise is utterly wrong, which makes his conclusions wrong. In fact, the pH of the blood is very important for cellular function and health; so not suprisingly, the body has evolved numerous homeostatic mechanisms to keep the pH pretty rigidly controlled between around 7.35 and 7.45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it's very hard to change the blood pH very much. The body is very good at compensating. Moreover, there are relatively few indications for alkalinizing the blood, which, when it's indicated, doctors usually do with sodium bicarbonate. A couple of the indications for alkalization include certain types of kidney stones and occasionally &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; severe acidosis, but in general there isn't much reason to try to mess with the blood's pH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't tell that to Robert O. Young, though. And especially don't tell him that the acidosis from sepsis is caused by the body's reaction to massive infection. He apparently won't believe you, and he's willing to abuse the memory of Mariana Bridi da Costa, the  Brazilian model who recently died of massive sepsis, whose story made the news mainly because doctors amputated her hands and feet in a last ditch effort to control the sepsis. To Young, Bridi da Costa died not of massive bacterial infection, &lt;a href="http://articlesofhealth.blogspot.com/2009/01/sepsis-or-systemic-acidosis-takes-life.html"&gt;rather of the consequences of too much acid&lt;/a&gt; brought on by bad lifestyle choices and, yes, intravenous antibiotics. First, let's review what actually happened:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/sepsis_is_not_caused_by_infection.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/sepsis_is_not_caused_by_infection.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/8JwkmsYpczo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233325236413"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/etzel_cardena_professor_of_par.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/12603d80a48da3e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Etzel Cardeña, Professor of Parapsychology at Lund</title><published>2009-01-30T13:20:42Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T13:20:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/viMNJPUMfrU/etzel_cardena_professor_of_par.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/etzel_cardena_professor_of_par.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/01/etzel_cardena_professor_of_par/etzelcardena.jpg" width="221" height="133" alt="etzelcardena.jpg"&gt;I entered into organised skepticism because of anti-science tendencies in academe. Though a member of the &lt;a href="http://www.vof.se/"&gt;Swedish Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; since 1997 and co-editor of the society's journal since 2002, I've never been much of a skeptical activist outside academic archaeology. I've written articles and a few letters of protest. But I've visited no spirit mediums, gone to no New Age fairs, crashed no fundie revivals. I have engaged with Teh Woo only in the manner of a sniper. In fact, I hardly ever meet any true believers apart from my New Age mom. But last night I had two such encounters: first one that was planned, polite and academic in tone. Then one that was unexpected, hostile and decidedly low-brow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not knowing really what to expect, it was with some trepidation I went to hear &lt;a href="http://www1.psychology.lu.se/Personal/e_cardena/"&gt;Professor Etzel Cardeña's&lt;/a&gt; lecture to the Swedish Society for Parapsychological Research. Cardeña is the first Thorsen Professor of Parapsychology and Hypnology at the University of Lund. Poul Thorsen was a Danish margarine tycoon who was interested in hypnosis and published a book on how to use it to have your way with women. The controversial endowment that bears his name spent four decades in limbo after Thorsen's death, until finally Lund accepted it in 2003 -- on one condition. They tacked the words "and Hypnology" onto the Chair's title, much to the true believers' chagrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parapsychology is unique among the sciences in that no-one has been able to prove that the discipline's object of study, "psi", exists. While other sciences investigate the properties of their objects, parapsychological research tends to aim at demonstrating its object's existence -- so far unsuccessfully. Hypnology, on the other hand, investigates sleep and sleep-like mental states such as hypnosis. When the Thorsen Chair was announced, skeptics hoped that Cardeña would concentrate his efforts on the latter subject, which was what he had been doing before that date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, Cardeña spoke to an audience of about 35 people. The man who introduced him remarked that this was an unusally large gathering for the Society for Parapsychological Research, and us non-members were asked to raise our hands and be counted. We could become members as part of our entry fee if we wanted. Compared to the audience at a typical lecture event organised by the Swedish Skeptics, this one was markedly smaller, markedly older, and had a markedly more even gender ratio, though men dominated here too. Everyone was nice and quiet. As we waited for the talk to begin, I overheard an old guy behind me telling his none too enthusiastic friend about the Swedish Skeptics in appreciative tones, about how having thousands of members and a growing membership gives us a certain financial oomph, as evidenced e.g. by the Enlightener of the Year Prize of $3100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etzel Cardeña is a shortish, lively and likeable Mexican who honoured his audience by wearing a dark three-piece suit. I could see that his shirt collar caused the poor man some discomfort. He reminded me of Martin Sheen as the President in &lt;i&gt;West Wing&lt;/i&gt;. Heroically, Cardeña gave his talk not in his native Spanish, nor much in his fluent English, but almost entirely in his recently acquired and decidedly patchy Swedish. But I could understand him well enough. He spoke for an hour and a half about "The relationship between anomalous states of conscience and parapsychology". Most of the talk concerned his research into hypnosis, with psi entering only at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned four main things about Etzel Cardeña's beliefs. He thinks that:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypnosis is real, in the sense that Cardeña believes himself able to place susceptible subjects in an anomalous mental state through suggestion, and they do not make up the experiences they describe to him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psi, paranormal mental capabilities, is real and distict from hypnosis. Indeed, much of Cardeña's research in Lund aims at studying the relationship between the two.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world is not just physical matter. I asked Cardeña specifically about this after his talk, and he explained that though he is definitely not a philosophical materialist, he hesitates to call himself a dualist, preferring to speak of a "oneness".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mind, hypnosis and psi should be studied with scientific methods and test protocols: Cardeña notably uses EEG, questionnaires and statistics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these four core beliefs, at least two are extreme minority positions among the world's scientists. I'll leave it up to the Dear Reader to identify which one is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Cardeña's mode of thought, one may ponder the fact that he called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James"&gt;William James&lt;/a&gt; his hero and ended his talk with a quotation from Alan Gauld to the effect that mesmerism is underrated. (I kid you not!) In my opinion, Cardeña is using Thorsen's money to study the relationship between a certain fantasy-prone personality type and thin air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horror fans may also like to know that Etzel Cardeña has adapted and performed Edgar Allan &lt;a href="http://www.descargacultura.unam.mx/app1#fragment-9"&gt;Poe as radio theatre&lt;/a&gt; in Spanish and published it on the web!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Cardeña's talk, somebody in Scania called my cell phone once and my home phone twice. Then, just as I got home at about 21:40, the persistent Scanian called my cell again and I answered. It turned out to be an irate Christian fellow who greatly admires professor of medicine Lennart Möller and his absolutely batty brand of Biblical pseudo-archaeology. Ostensibly, the caller wanted to learn about my opposition to Möller (which I have published in &lt;a href="http://www.vof.se/folkvett/20042bibelfantasier-fran-medicinprofessor"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Folkvett&lt;/i&gt; 2004:2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/i&gt; 28:6 (2004). But he hadn't read anything I had written, and the conversation soon turned into him ranting "Who do you think you are with yer fancy university degree, you haven't even been to the sites Möller writes about, you aren't even a Biblical archaeologist, Möller is a DNA researcher you know, I might just read something you wrote and say it's all blah blah blah". The caller pointed out that he had been able to build a small hydroelectric dam and save a lot of money &lt;i&gt;despite the skepticism of his neighbours&lt;/i&gt;. And then he rattled off a long list of Christian Swedish celebrities, suggesting that this list in itself was an argument for the truth of his religion. The list ended, a bit confusingly I must say, with a woman whose name is known because she's spent decades in a US jail for her participation in a murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool thing about this is that either Lennart Möller himself is telling shocked rural congregations on his lecture tours about my satanic criticism of his pious attempts at Biblical archaeology, or there's a rumour about me among his fans. Luckily, most of them seem to be a bit more restrained than the guy I talked to last night, beacuse this is the first time anybody's contacted me about Möller. To my knowledge, he hasn't responded in print to my arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

There are no credibly documented cases of anyone being injured or killed by a ghost. Besides - they are supposed to be immaterial, so how could they harm you? They might make you a bit chilly, or give you a severe case of the willies, but that’s it. I suppose they could frighten a weak-hearted person to death, in which case all we have to fear is fear itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why, then, are people so terrified of ghosts. I admit I have never seen one, so I cannot honestly brag about how I would react, but I think I would be more fascinated than anything else. My primary thought would probably be - where’s my camera?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, then, are staff at Derby’s new Royal Hospital so frightened? According to &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2189230.ece"&gt;news reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been dozens of sightings over recent weeks and  people are scared witless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So scared, in fact, that the hospital administration is bringing in an exorcist to take care of the problem. Senior manager Debbie Butler said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking it seriously as the last thing I want is staff  feeling uneasy at work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve spoken to the Trust’s chaplain and she is  going to arrange for someone from the cathedral to exorcise the department.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about this as an alternative, Debbie - investigate the phenomenon scientifically. Consider the possibility that perhaps you are dealing with a psychological and not paranormal phenomenon. Chances are it is witless belief that is driving these sightings, not the sightings that are driving people witless. You can take your employees seriously, but address what is likely actually going on - a community scare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/2000-05/delusions.html"&gt;Robert Bartholomew &lt;/a&gt;and others have described mass delusions and community hysteria. Belief and fear is contagious, and when the community is frightened we tend to feel anxious ourselves. This is like a herd running from a predator, even though only one or a few members actually saw it - it’s better to just run along with the herd to be on the safe side. So it is no surprise that we tend to respond to fear infecting our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how about a bit of public counseling and reassurance. Despite the fact that this hospital is supposed to be the “most haunted place in the UK” I bet a small number of employees are making most of the sightings. I also bet that despite the numerous alleged opportunities to document the apparitions, there is in fact no compelling evidence. I couldn’t find any online, and none of the news reports I saw included one - just artists conceptions and pictures of Linda Blair from The Exorcist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sad that a professional and scientific institution has the opportunity to deal with this situation as professionals and scientists or as gullible asses, and they have chosen the latter. Rather than calling in an exorcist and the local ghost-hunting boob, they should have called in a skeptic. Skeptics have actually thought about such phenomena from a reality-based perspective and have developed a relevant knowledge-base that can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a theme that intrigues ordinary folk; it almost mesmerises them.  It is clear that nothing Language Log can do will ever discredit the twin notions that (1) lexical abundance correlates with conceptual or environmental or perceptual richness, and (2) that lexical thrift betokens a poorer and meaner experiential world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don't just believe these things, they &lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt; these beliefs. Brand new allusions to them show up in print several times a week.  Just yesterday, for example, Language Log reader Laura Kalin pointed out to me a &lt;a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/01/25/64949.html"&gt;report on the &lt;i&gt;Al-Arabiya&lt;/i&gt; website&lt;/a&gt; that snow had fallen on a mountain in a northern part of the United Arab Emirates, and sure enough (you can see it coming!) the snowfall was said to be so rare "that a lifelong resident of the area said the local dialect does not even have a word for 'snow'."  Think about that.  How did the resident say this?  As Ben Zimmer has &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1081#comment-20722"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, the Arabic word &lt;i&gt;thalj&lt;/i&gt; would do just fine, and the local resident would almost certainly have used that when explaining the point; but in that case, what is the content of the claim that the northern UAE dialects of Arabic do not have a word for snow?  Why wouldn't &lt;i&gt;thalj&lt;/i&gt; count as their word for snow, just as &lt;i&gt;Allah&lt;/i&gt; would (I presume) count as their word for Allah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on the same day, I came to page 39 of Martin Cruz Smith's novel &lt;i&gt;December 6&lt;/i&gt; (my airplane reading on the current trip to Holland and Finland), in a passage describing a disastrous fire caused by some paper on a room heater in a paper-and-tatami-mat dwelling in a poor neighbourhood of pre-war Tokyo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;The way Eskimos had words for different kinds of snow, the Japanese had words for fire: deliberate, accidental, initial flame, approaching blaze, invading, spreading, overwhelming fire.&lt;/font&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way printers love their words for different kinds of font, the way a schoolboy loves his pie (and so presumably he has many words for it), the general reading public loves the idea that your lexicon measures your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"I actually have a pseudo linguistics question for you about the title of the Manchu emperor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor was surprised by this use of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;He added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The next day, my sister from Seattle, who was visiting us in Swarthmore after attending the inauguration in DC, happened to complain about this very usage of "actually" among our nieces and nephews and their friends (when they are expressing an opinion).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, these two senses of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are worth distinguishing. And this is not just my opinion — I&amp;#39;m relying on the analysis in Uta Lenk&amp;#39;s 1998 dissertation, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9OkoNXcZuN8C"&gt;Marking Discourse Coherence: Functions of Discourse Markers in Spoken English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenk starts by distinguishing "propositional" uses of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which contribute something to the content of the proposition being expressed, from "discourse marker" uses, which instead serve to indicate the relationship of the utterance to the surrounding discourse. In the conversational corpora that she examined, she found that about half of the instances of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; were propositional and half were discourse markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lenk's analysis, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has a number of different propositional senses: "to indicate that a situation exists or happened, or to emphasize that it is true or correct"; as a way to indicate surprise; and simply as an intensifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She identifies three different "discourse marker" uses: with objections; as an opinion marker; and to introduce a topic shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For marking objections, she quotes Tognini-Bonelli (1993) that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;is probably the most common device available to a speaker who wishes to make his/her own perspective stand out with respect to the general, and more common, consensus-based view, or to other preceding textual claims or events. Because of this, the use of &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; is also a very common way of implicitly acknowledging what has gone on before, that is paying lip-service either to another participant's contribution or to one's own stated position before going on to contradict it or correct it in some way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as an opinion marker, Lenk notes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;When looking at the conversations, it turns out that &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; is used not only when somebody is expressing an opinion "that had not been expected in a polite way", but in situations where people express personal opinions in general. Thus &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; does not necessarily mark the fact that an unexpected opinion is being expressed politely, but rather that now some personal opinion is being expressed at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she motivates the "topic shift" function of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with an example that is rather like Victor's:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The third discourse marker function of &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; is located on a higher structural level in the discourse than the other two are, and signals the introduction of a new topic into the conversation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The function of &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; as a marker of topic shift of change is clearly recognizable in instances where it appears initially in the turn of a person who had not been speaking before and whose contribution introduces a new topic or shifts the old topic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She quotes an example from her corpus where "speaker B uses &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; in the very early phase of a telephone conversation even prior to self-identification". In somewhat simplified typography, her transcription of this conversation is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A: hello&lt;br&gt;
B: Charlie&lt;br&gt;
A: yes&lt;br&gt;
B: actually it's me&lt;br&gt;
A: hello Karen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;All three discourse marker functions [opinion, contradiction, new topic] can be taken to have a common core meaning of 'stating something in an unexpected way, manner or position'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The common core function of actually as a discourse marker presumably stems from the etymology of the word, which is a derivation from the word actual with the meaning &amp;#39;existing in act or fact; real&amp;#39; (SOED 23). This would make the meaning of the discourse marker a signal that upgrades the following opinion  — be it a mere statement or a full-blown contradiction — into a &amp;#39;fact of reality&amp;#39;. As a marker of topic shift, actually marks the upcoming topic as &amp;#39;more real, more acute, more relevant than the prior topic&amp;#39; in the speaker&amp;#39;s mind at that particular moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on Lenk's analysis, Victor's correspondent was using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to (redundantly) mark a new topic and indeed a new conversation; and Victor's sister is also correct that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is often used to mark the expression of an opinion; but these two things, though related through their common historical relation to the concept of "existing in act or fact", are not quite the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the topic and expressing an opinion at the same time, let me note that Lenk's dissertation, published in 1998 by Gunter Narr Verlag, is actually now &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marking-Discourse-Coherence-Functions-performance/dp/3823349384/"&gt;out of print&lt;/a&gt; and not easy to find — abebooks.com says &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re sorry, no results were found&amp;quot;, for example. Isn&amp;#39;t it past time for our field to abandon the increasingly empty gesture of publishing excellent works in ways that leave them orphaned within a decade, and instead to deposit digital copies in web-accessible archives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, let me know that the term &lt;em&gt;discourse marker&lt;/em&gt; was introduced into the field by none other than frequent LL poster Arnold Zwicky ("&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/info/414146"&gt;Clitics and particles&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Language&lt;/em&gt; 61(2): 283-305, 1985):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;5. DISCOURSE MARKERS IN ENGLISH (AND IN GENERAL). Within the great collection of things that have been labeled 'particles', we find at least one grammatically significant class of items, in English and in languages generally. These have been variously termed 'discourse particles' and 'interjections'; here I will call them 'discourse markers'.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; On the grounds of distribution, prosody, and meaning, discourse markers can be seen to form a class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; My use of the term &amp;#39;discourse particles&amp;#39; (following Schourup 1983) in earlier versions of this article — which is, after all, designed to demonstrate that there is no unified class comprising the things that have been called &amp;#39;particles&amp;#39; — was perhaps infelicitous. I have now opted for terminology that entirely avoids &amp;#39;particle&amp;#39; as (any part of) a technical expression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, in that paper Arnold used "discourse marker" for things like "(certain instances of)&lt;em&gt; well, hey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;okay, oh, yes, like, y'know, no, uh, now, say, why, look, listen,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt;", rather than for discourse-related adverbials like &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;; but the field has decided it's useful to extend the term on the grounds of meaning rather than restricting it on the basis of distribution and prosody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-finally, I can't resist quoting a nice use of phrase-final &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as an intensifier, from a Roz Chast cartoon illustrating "The Berlitz Guide to Parent-Teacher Conferences":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was &lt;a href="http://www.chinapage.com/newyear.html"&gt;Chinese New Year&lt;/a&gt;. It's the &lt;a href="http://www.chinesezodiac.com/ox.php"&gt;Year of the Ox&lt;/a&gt;, 4706: The &lt;a href="http://www.chinesezodiac.com/signs.php"&gt;Chinese zodiac&lt;/a&gt; is made up of twelve animals and further divided into the five elements of wood, earth, water, fire and metal. And soothsayers in Shanghai (if you can believe what &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1873700,00.html"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; magazine says) aren't predicting a bull market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's ox is an earth ox. That may sound innocuous enough, but according to one astrological interpretation, financial markets are in dire need of a spark from the fire element to set stocks blazing. For other fortune tellers, the worry is absence of metal, an element with which they make a simple astrological connection to money. A metal year, they say, brings plenty of gold. An earth year buries all that lucre under piles of dirt. All in all, a buffalo wallowing in mud doesn't exactly portend a get-up-and-go kind of year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous Year of the Ox was in 1997, which is the year my son Charlie was born in. The &lt;a href="http://www.chinesezodiac.com/ox.php"&gt;qualities&lt;/a&gt; associated with being born in an ox year---including "dependability, strength and determination"; a "keen eye for detail"; a preference to work alone---do seem to be characteristic of Charlie. Further, he's a "fire ox" who has "short fuses and tend[s] to react impulsively instead of considering the opinion of others." And it could also be said that Charlie possesses these ox-ish---bovine?---traits two times over, as his birthday is in May, making him a Taurus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are rather fanciful musings, I'll admit. Read about the Chinese astrological signs and it's not too hard to see traits of oneself in whatever animal is associated with one's year of birth. Things being as they are in the world lately, I'm kind of inclined to agree with those Shanghai soothsayers about the cloudy future ahead of us in this Earth Ox year----so much for the "modern," "rational," "Western" side of me. Call it &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/cognitive-deficits-and-magical-thinking/"&gt;magical thinking&lt;/a&gt;----there's a comfort in the non-, even the anti-, rational, modern, scientific---stemming, perhaps, from a kind of defiance in adhering not to science but to what people &lt;em&gt;believe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like this underruns why the claim that vaccines or something in vaccines can be linked to autism persists in the face of &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=466#more-466"&gt;increasing evidence refuting a link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/new_study_on_vaccine_safety"&gt;Discussions on this topic&lt;/a&gt; often seem to end up going back and forth and forth and back and, in the end, it's not science so much that is up for "debate" (among scientists, there is &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/false-controversy-autism-and-vaccines/"&gt;no debate, or controversy&lt;/a&gt;, about vaccines and autism). More of these exchanges are likely: An impending decision from the &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/"&gt;United States Court of Federal Claims&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/"&gt;National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt; (NVICP) could set a precedent about the MMR vaccine as "causing" autism. As reported in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2009/01/29/news/local_state/153812.txt"&gt;Times-News&lt;/a&gt; (Idaho), the court is ruling this week on three cases in which it's claimed that the MMR vaccine "contributed" to a child's autism. If these cases or even one of them prevail, "....more people could become eligible for monetary compensation from the government," or could, indeed, try to become eligible for such monetary compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm often not very sure what all the back and forth contributes to actually helping individuals on the spectrum in their daily lives. Yesterday, Thursday was one of those days when I had to have a number of exchanges with Charlie's teacher, the school nurse, Charlie's case manager, and a behavior consultant, all of which have added up to us putting our heads together to think of solutions, of things we can try and do to help Charlie keep learning and be all that he can be, and to keep an eye on what the future holds for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which end: I'm in the midst of filling out the &lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=x33lcx4bxbMZ6Bwm55ApOQ_3d_3d"&gt;New Jersey Adults with Autism Task Force Informational Survey&lt;/a&gt;. This Task Force was created through legislation signed into law in 2007 by Governor Jon S. Corzine to "develop a comprehensive and actionable plan for meeting the various needs of adults with autism living in the State of New Jersey." I've been in contact with other parents about the survey and it's necessary, too, to have as many adults on the spectrum filling it out. (You do have to be a Jerseyan, or be the parent/guardian of someone in Jersey, to fill out the survey---please spread the word if you know anyone!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/25/BACR15GICJ.DTL&amp;amp;hw=chinese+new+year&amp;amp;sn=007&amp;amp;sc=655"&gt;Year of the Ox &lt;/a&gt;has gotten off to a rather muddy start for us so I sometimes wish just lighting a string of firecrackers would be the answer to scaring away any bad influences. But even more I know that there's no quick fix, &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/no-magic-pill-for-autism-on-risperdal-and-the-importance-of-autism-education/"&gt;no magic pill&lt;/a&gt;, but the kind of hard work and patient study that someone with "dependability, strength and determination" can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fossil of a lizard-like New Zealand reptile has been identified by a team of scientists from UCL (University College London), University of Adelaide, and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The fossil, dating back 18 million years, has triggered fresh arguments over whether the continent was fully submerged some 25 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those who are counting that would be 17,994,000 and 24,994,000 years before the existence of the whole universe, according to Young Earth Creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

You’d think that, wouldn’t you? Only a monster could be against it. . .&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/01/29/who-would-oppose-an-anti-bullying-event/"&gt;or Conservative Christians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad Dacus&lt;/strong&gt;, president of the Pacific Justice Institute (PJI) has this to say of the event:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;… it is a way of indoctrinating children so that they will support the homosexual agenda after they become adults… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re promoting, all the way down to the first-grade level, children to read and be exposed to books and material that is pro-homosexual — and it’s all under the guise of opposing name-calling,” he contends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um no, you don’t seem to have understood correctly. It’s called “No Name-Calling Week” not “Fuck Your Own Sex Week.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOW DARE YOU TRY AND TEACH MY KID TO FIND A CIVIL CONFLICT RESOLUTION TO DISAGREEMENTS?!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, am I the only one whose curious what kind of “justice” the Pacific Justice Institute actually endorses? Is it all eye-for-an-eye with them or just the classic stoning to death for even the slightest indiscretion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This letter appeared &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article5613750.ece"&gt;in the Times&lt;/a&gt; on Friday 30 January, 2009.  It was prompted by the &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=885"&gt;news from the University of Salford&lt;/a&gt;, but its main purpose was to try to point out to the Department of Health that you can’t hope to regulate alternative treatments in any sensible way while continuing to push under the carpet the crucial question of which ones work and which don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" width="95%"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sir
&lt;p&gt;We would like to congratulate the vice-chancellor of the University of Salford, Professor Michael Harloe for his principled decision to drop “all the University’s programmes associated with complementary medicine within the School of Community, Health Sciences &amp;amp; Social Care”. This includes their “Homeopathy in Practice” degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also encouraging that the University of Central Lancashire recently closed its BSc in Homeopathy to new students, and announced a review of all its activities in alternative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although universities are now taking sensible actions, government policy in the area of regulation of alternative medicine is in urgent need of revision. In May 2008 the Steering Group chaired by Professor Pittilo recommended to the Department of Health that entry into acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine should “normally be through a bachelor degree with honours”. But, in the same month, new regulations on Unfair Trading came into effect. One of the 31 commercial practices which are in all circumstances considered unfair is “falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illnesses, dysfunction or malformations”. One part of government seeks to endorse unproven and disproved treatments, at the same time as another part makes them illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this chaotic situation is simple. The Department of Health, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), have consistently failed to grasp the nettle of deciding which treatments work and which don’t. That is the first thing you want to know about any treatment. Vice-chancellors seem now to be asking the question, and the government should do so too. The ideal mechanism already exists.  The question should be referred to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). That was recommended by a House of Lords report in 2000, and it was recommended again by the Smallwood report (commissioned by the Prince of Wales) in 2005. Now it should be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Actually, the Times removed the qualifications of the signatories, but left the titles!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier, longer, version of the letter tried to preempt the obvious criticism  by including, as the second paragraph, this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It makes no sense to offer Bachelor of Science degrees in subjects that have no scientific basis.  Not only is homeopathy scientifically absurd, but also the best quality clinical trials show that it is not distinguishable from placebo. From the point of view of the patient, there is nothing wrong with placebo effects. Conventional drugs benefit from them too. There is everything wrong with surrounding the placebo effect with mystical mumbo-jumbo and awarding degrees in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universities drop degree courses in alternative medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same issue, there was a related article by  the &lt;em&gt;Times’&lt;/em&gt; education editor, Alexandra Frean: &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article5614896.ece"&gt;Universities drop degree courses in alternative medicine&lt;/a&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Universities are increasingly turning their backs on homoeopathy and complementary medicine amid opposition from the scientific community to “pseudo-science” degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Salford has stopped offering undergraduate degrees in the subjects, and the University of Westminster announced yesterday that it plans to strengthen the “science base” content of its courses after an internal review which examined their scientific credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both universities are following the lead of the University of Central Lancashire, which last year stopped recruiting new students to its undergraduate degree in homoeopathic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions by Salford and Westminster open a new chapter in the fierce debate about the place of awarding of Bachelor of Science degrees in subjects that are not science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article ends thus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other universities are more robust in their defence of their courses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Appleyard, principal lecturer in acupuncture at London South Bank University, said that acupuncture should be studied for the very reason that it was not well understood from the standpoint of Western scientific medicine. Acupuncture had been used by a significant proportion of the world’s population for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Recent large-scale clinical trials such Haake and meta-analysis from reputable institutions such as The Cochrane Collaboration, have shown that there is evidence to support the therapeutic benefits of acupuncture treatment for back pain and migraine,” he said.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uhuh, it seems that Ian Appleyard has been reading the misleading BBC report on the recent trials.  In fact &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=945"&gt;they show precisely the opposite of what he claims&lt;/a&gt;.  The fact that advocates of alternative medicine can misinterpret the evidence so badly is, I guess, at the heart of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="wmin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s happening at the University of Westminster?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westminster has regularly been labelled as the  &lt;a title="Times Higher Education" href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=401581&amp;amp;c=1"&gt;University that has more quackery  courses&lt;/a&gt; than any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also the only university for which we have much idea about what is taught.  The university, like all others, has tried to keep secret what they teach.  That itself shows that they aren’t very proud of it.  But a surprising amount has leaked out from Westminster, nonetheless. The set of “vibrational medicine” slides, including &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;“Amethysts emit high Yin energy”&lt;/a&gt;, have caused much hilarity.  The Westminster “miasmatic” examination question gets some laughs too, after it was &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=19"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The set of homeopathic &lt;em&gt;materia medica&lt;/em&gt; notes that have come into my possession are pretty good too (coming on line soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently it emerged that the University of Westminster had followed the example of the &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=252"&gt;University of Central Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; (UCLAN), and set up a review of its activities in alternative medicine.  But unlike UCLAN it was kept secret, and as far as one can tell, it asked for no input from critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the outcome of this review turned up in my mail recently. Click the picture to read the whole letter from the Vice-Chancellor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/petts-cam-audit-120109.pdf"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/petts-letter-wmin.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="244"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the outcome, so far, is rather disappointing.  Here are some quotations from this letter, with my comments interleaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Audit was Chaired by Professor Alan Jago and carried out its review using a comprehensive evidence base”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Jago is a pro- vice chancellor, and formerly from Westminster’s School of Architecture and the Built Environment, so no specialist knowledge there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The panel made a number of recommendations to me as a result of their Audit.  Many of these recommendations concern the University’s processes for review and validation of courses and these will be passed to the Pro Vice Chancellor responsible for Quality to consider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uhuh, sounds like box-ticking again When will universities learn that validation procedures are, on the whole, &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=259"&gt;not worth the paper they are written on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The overarching aim of these actions then is to strengthen and make more explicit the ’scientific’ nature of the Integrated Health undergraduate degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do this we will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthen learning outcomes particularly in discipline and clinical modules to reflect the science outcomes embedded in the courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revise course specific regulations to explicitly identify that the core health sciences modules have to be passed to complete a degree of the BSc Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthen the final year project offer to provide more scientific projects through working with Biosciences staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthen the scientific/academic qualifications of staff through development&lt;br&gt;
of existing staff and appointments where they become available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to me to be whistling in the wind. Remember, we are talking about “bachelor of science” degrees  in things like homeopathy and naturotherapy.  These are things that are not science at all. In fact  &lt;a title="Reprint from Nature" href="http://dcscience.net/colquhoun-nature-07.pdf"&gt;they are antiscience&lt;/a&gt; to their core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were successful in raising the increasing the scientific level of the staff, many of the subjects they are meant to be teaching would vanish in a puff of smoke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the responses of the Westminster staff to earlier enquiries (&lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=84"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,  and  &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=83"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) showed little sign of scientific thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wonder what Westminster’s admirable biomedical scientists think about taking on homeopathy students for projects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am certain that this work will place   Complementary therapies courses in an extremely strong position to meet the external challenges of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry to say, Professor Petts, that the scientific community is not likely to share your certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Peter Fisher is on record as saying that there is not enough science in homeopathy to justifiy offering a BSc degree in it (&lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=19#movie"&gt;watch the movie&lt;/a&gt;).  He is the Queen’s Homeopathic Physician, and Clinical Director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital   But Westminster still seems to know better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems, so far, that Westminster has missed a chance to change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/strong&gt; published a &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=405293"&gt;pretty pathetic report&lt;/a&gt; on the Westminster audit.  They did ask me for comments but then failed to publish most of them.  I suppose a magazine like that is so dependent on advertising that they can’t afford to upset the authorities.  Nevertheless, do they really have to be quite so bland?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear that the internal audit has made everyone at the University of &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Woominster&lt;/span&gt; Westminster more nervous and that staff and students have been advised not to share teaching material with people outside the university.  Having &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=227#slides"&gt;seen some of them,&lt;/a&gt; I’m not surprised they are ashamed of them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">DC&amp;#39;s Improbable Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233292871431"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2003">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a2cd77ee92bc054e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="England"/><category term="science"/><category term="UK"/><title type="html">UK campaign to promote public understanding of science</title><published>2009-01-30T05:08:09Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T05:08:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/uk-campaign-to-promote-public-understanding-of-science/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7854121.stm"&gt;UK government touts science for all &lt;/a&gt;- A new campaign being launched in the UK is designed to change public attitudes towards science. They hope to end the perception of science as being too elitist after a recent study showed that that’s how most people think of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far in this country Obama seems to be really actively supporting science but I would love to see him launch a similar campaign to demistify science and take steps towards improving the public understanding of science.&lt;/p&gt;

The best thing that individuals could do to help fight problem was believed at the time to be recycling. And to this day most people are confident that recycling is beneficial to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/4365681/Recycling-could-be-adding-to-global-warming.html"&gt;But is it really?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Jones suggested that an “urgent” review of Labour’s policy on recycling was needed to make sure the collection, transportation and processing of recyclable material was not causing a net increase in greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones is a former director of the waste firm Biffa and now an adviser to environment ministers. And he thinks kerbside recycling collections is “stupid” in some areas because they mixed together different materials, rendering them useless for recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested that much of the country’s waste should simply be burnt to generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It might be that the global warming impact of putting material through an incinerator five miles down the road is actually less than recycling it 3,000 miles away,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000263" title=""&gt;Microblogging the ISMB: A New Approach to Conference Reporting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) has become an important communication hub for bioinformaticians, and the core element of the Conference--presentations of peer-reviewed papers--is now only one of many activities. Presentation of timely journal publications (the Highlights sessions), Special Sessions organized by experts in the respective fields, Tutorials, and Special Interest Group meetings should attract attendees who might otherwise prefer smaller, more focused meetings. In addition to these formal activities, an important aspect is the informal communication between participants. This year, about 1,600 participants attended the meeting in the conference center under the CN Tower in Toronto. ISMB 2008 also left a footprint on the Web, via a Web service named FriendFeed (http://friendfeed.com/), to capture highlights from the Conference in near real time. FriendFeed allows users to share items, either directly or by importing their latest content from any Web site that generates an RSS feed, leading to a continuous stream of information around which communities build (Figure 1). In addition, and of most relevance to ISMB, FriendFeed acts as a microblogging platform: Users post short, typically single-sentence messages which generate conversations in the ensuing comment threads. Microblogging, best exemplified by the Twitter service (http://twitter.com/), is popular in the IT/tech sector, but little used by life scientists. It may be thought of as the fusion of instant messaging and traditional blogs: Anyone can follow or join a conversation, and conversations are archived. We recommend an article by Cameron Neylon entitled FriendFeed for Scientists: What, Why, and How? (&lt;a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/06/12/friendfeed-for-scientists-what-why-and-how/" title=""&gt;http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/06/12/friendfeed-for-scientists-what-why-and-how/&lt;/a&gt;) for an introduction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1000267" title=""&gt;The Sicker Sex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Arguments about the weaker sex notwithstanding, there is no contest about the identity of the sicker sex--it is males, almost every time. Everyone knows that old age homes have more widows than widowers, but the disparity extends far beyond the elderly. Fewer women than men died in the 1917-1918 influenza epidemic; the differential mortality was not related to World War I, as originally thought, but was global and widespread among ages. Kruger and Nesse [1] compared men's and women's mortality rates for 11 causes of death in men and women from 20 countries, including accidents and homicide as well as infectious and non-infectious diseases, and found that men virtually always die earlier. They concluded, "Being male is now the single largest demographic risk factor for early mortality in developed countries". Furthermore, in many free-living mammals, males are more likely than females to harbor parasites or to suffer more intensely from their effects. During the mid-20th century, a virtual cottage industry developed in which investigators experimentally infested laboratory rodents with parasites and documented any resulting sex differences in the prevalence or intensity of the infection that developed [2]. Males usually developed higher parasitemia, with castration removing the sex difference. The persistence of these patterns in the laboratory suggests that the sex difference is not merely due to differences in exposure to parasites, with males and females behaving differently in the field and hence incurring different risks of infection, but to an inherent sex difference in vulnerability.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And check out the first of &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browseVolume.action" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE Collections&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pone.c01.i01" title=""&gt;Stress-Induced Depression and Comorbidities: From Bench to Bedside&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This collection of articles represents the output of a group of international research institutions (informally referred to as EUMOOD) who collaborated around the causal link between stress exposure and depression vulnerability.

&lt;p&gt;Within the collection, preclinical and clinical research papers present an integrated experimental effort, employing a variety of methods and concepts from different disciplines such as biological psychiatry, neuroscience, and neuroendocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editorial oversight, and coordination of the peer-review, was provided by Bernhard Baune, PLoS ONE Section Editor for Neuroscience and Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question, and the statement by teachers, about "the real world" is ironic to me as it shows little understanding of exactly what goes on in "the real world" for people with disabilities.  The fact is, disability accommodations &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a major part of "the real world" for all of us who have aged out of primary education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying, communicating about, and advocating for accommodations is part of the "real world" skill set that people with disabilities use often in our daily lives.  We need to get our needs met in higher education, or in employment, or in the activities of daily living, or in the community, or wherever our futures take us.  The need for accommodations doesn't magically end at high school graduation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provisioning of accommodations by employers, administrators, professors, and business owners is part of the "real world," both ethically and legally. In the US, there are &lt;a href="http://www.ada.gov/"&gt;laws&lt;/a&gt; that demand that those who live in "the real world" accommodate people with disabilities.  Any public education teacher (who also is a part of "the real world") who refuses to give reasonable accommodation to students with disabilities is in some questionable waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After answering the question with a sort of stunned, "but--but disability accommodations are totally part of the real world" (and elaborating as written above), I tried to think of more answers (because my problem solving brain is always seeking maximum amount of solutions).  But frankly I could think of no additional responses that could be any more clear than that one.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233275849580"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=2868">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c453ecefb583d138</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Ask an Entomologist"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="Science"/><category term="genitalia"/><category term="phalloblaster"/><category term="taxonomy"/><title type="html">Insect Genitalia: an Entomological Obsession</title><published>2009-01-30T00:32:39Z</published><updated>2009-01-30T00:32:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/insect-genitalia-an-entomological-obsession/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned before how much I enjoy some of the &lt;a title="small carnivore enema" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/small-carnivore-enema/"&gt;randomness&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a title="How to ship feces?" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/03/18/why-i-love-being-a-biologist/"&gt;shows up in my Inbox&lt;/a&gt; because I’m an entomologist. Today’s example:&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trekman/2749724683/in/pool-823762@N23"&gt;&lt;img title="bug pron" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3232/2749724683_ae50b47e62_m.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="158"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Subject: Genetalia vials&lt;br&gt;
I have been using small genitalia vials (10mm x 4mm) that I purchased from BioQuip. They say they are no longer made and they only have them in 15mm x 5mm …Can anyone steer me toward a good supplier for glass vials?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t an entomologist, or living with one, you may not understand the entomological obsession with genitalia.*  There are &lt;strong&gt;lots&lt;/strong&gt; of very similar looking insects. (There’s whole groups of moths commonly known as “LBJs”.  They aren’t named after the president–LBJ stands for “little brown jobs.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the only way to tell similar looking insects apart is to look at the naughty bits.  Because species are defined by reproductive isolation, similar looking outsides may hide radically different-looking innards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for about the last 100 years, entomologists have been &lt;a title="some of the literature; not as titilating as you might think" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=aedeagus&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=ws"&gt;hunched over insect nether parts&lt;/a&gt;, trying to figure out what species they were looking at.  Since there is …..&lt;em&gt;shrinkage&lt;/em&gt;….after death, the squidgy bits are commonly removed from specimens and stored in in tiny vials full of preservative.  Hence: the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of insect genitalia is so important, all sorts of devices have been invented and devised for just that purpose.  I could swear that I had covered the &lt;strong&gt;phalloblaster&lt;/strong&gt; at the Bug Blog before, but apparently not. Because of the…&lt;em&gt;shrinkage&lt;/em&gt;…it can be difficult to get the male genitalia to expand enough to see important details. Some clever Aussies invented a device to…err.&lt;a href="http://www.csiro.au/promos/ozadvances/Series1Insect.html"&gt; Apply pressure in the proper spot&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Phalloblaster inflates the genitalia with a stream of pressurised alcohol to create the same shape as when the insect was alive.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The alcohol dehydrates and hardens the structure, so that once the process is over the genetalia remain inflated rather like miniature balloons. It makes them easier to study.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this device is properly called the &lt;a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/tnah/1998/00000032/00000003/art00001?crawler=true"&gt;vesica everter&lt;/a&gt;.  But who the hell would call it that when you can say PHALLOBLASTER?  (You can visit this page and see a post-mortem &lt;a href="http://www.csiro.au/promos/ozadvances/Series1InsectMov.html"&gt;insect “erection” in action&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to look at more photos of bug dongs studied using the Phalloblaster, you can check out this article on &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/1999/06/07/28196.htm?site=science&amp;amp;topic=latest"&gt;bumpy beetle penises&lt;/a&gt;.  BTW, the proper name for an insect intromittent organ is an &lt;a title="No, there is not a picture." href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/163840"&gt;aedeagus&lt;/a&gt;.  I thought you would want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;br&gt;
*I keep telling you, it’s perfectly &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; that I’m obsessed with sex. It’s all part of science!&lt;/p&gt;

Adama Smitha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zamiłowanie Wildsteina do pseudoekspertów zdaje się jest dość duże, gdyż niczym mantrę powtarza, że 30,000 naukowców z USA podpisało się pod tzw. petycją oregońską:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;W rzeczywistości także naukowcy sprzeciwiają się ideologicznej hipotezie na temat globalnego ocieplenia. Negującą ją petycję oregońską podpisało do dzisiaj sporo ponad 30 tys. naukowców ze Stanów Zjednoczonych.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Wystarczyło mi 5 minut z Google żeby dowiedzieć się, że Wildstein dużo ryzykuje pokładając swoje sceptyczne nadzieje w tej liście. &lt;span&gt;"(...) sporo ponad 30 tys. naukowców ze Stanów Zjednoczonych"&lt;/span&gt; to spora przesada bo mowa o 31,072 podpisach. Liczba klimatologów, którzy podpisali się pod tym dokumentem &lt;a href="http://www.petitionproject.org/gwdatabase/GWPP/Qualifications_Of_Signers.html"&gt;wynosi&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;span&gt;40&lt;/span&gt; (słownie czterdzieści). Trudno o inny wynik skoro petycja ma charakter polityczny (apel o nie podpisywanie Protokołu z Kioto), a towarzyszące jej materiały dodatkowe o charakterze empirycznym roją się od &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/10/oregon-institute-of-science-and-malarkey/"&gt;błędów i przeinaczeń&lt;/a&gt;.

W pełni popieram takie obawy. Nie rozumiem jednak czemu zamiast skupić się na tych właśnie wypaczeniach politycznych Wildstein atakuje samą naukę. Bo tak łatwiej?

The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/education/28educ.html?ref=education"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; notes that this would "amount to the largest increase in federal aid since Washington began to spend significantly on education after World War II." The January 27th &lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/01/27/20stimstate.h28.html?tmp=61794692"&gt;EdWeek&lt;/a&gt; notes that these "record increases" are being viewed warily by some congressional Republicans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... it would be tough to scale back the record increases in the bill for programs, including special education and Title I aid for underprivileged children, after the economic outlook brightens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being someone who believes that &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt;IDEA&lt;/a&gt; must be fully funded, I find this kind of thinking about special education, as something to "scale back" in good economic times, unfortunate, but not unexpected and ultimately short-sighted. There's always a need for more when it comes to special education: Our school district is fairly well-endowed (though still facing some significant budget cuts); there are 60, 70, more children on the autism spectrum and one occupational therapist for all of them. I guess it's even a luxury that we have an OT who only works with kids on the spectrum; certainly, she is overworked and in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he's not yet 12, my son's already started "pre-pre-vocational training" (and he often seems to prefer doing these things rather than sitting at his desk). There's so much that he can learn and can do, if given the chance; if taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's an opportunity that shouldn't be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

To help keep SGU operating, they charge a small amount for those uncut episodes, but it’s only three bucks. &lt;/p&gt;

(I wrote about the case &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/10/what_ever_happened_to_luk_van.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/10/why_do_scientists_lie_more_rem.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making stuff up in one's communications with other scientists, whether in manuscripts submitted for publication, grant applications, scientific presentation, or even personal communications, is a very bad thing.  It undermines the knowledge-building project in which the community of science is engaged.  As an institution serious about its role in this knowledge-building enterprise, MIT did well to identify Van Parijs as a bad actor, to take him out of play, and to correct the scientific record impacted by Van Parijs's lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT wasn't the only institution with a horse in this race, though.  Given that many of Van Parijs's misrepresentations occurred in work supported by federal grants, or in application for federal grant money, the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI), an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, launched a thorough investigation of the case.  As reported in the &lt;a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-1453.htm"&gt;Federal Register&lt;/a&gt;, ORI has now taken final action in the Van Parijs case: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/01/office_of_research_integrity_t.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/01/office_of_research_integrity_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/GuNwMINjPcI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233261052534"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5729">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8b51ceec1674179</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="Stuff You'll Like"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 1.29</title><published>2009-01-29T20:00:58Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T20:00:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5729" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not the smartest or the most industrious guy in the world, which makes me wonder why I’m often compelled to try to solve various problems that spring up in my everyday life. I’m sure somewhere deep inside, I’d much rather be looking at porn, or eating cheese, or doing anything besides toiling over a problem. Yet present me with a dilemma of some sort, and I’m on it like glitter on a teen vampire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the problems come in many forms; a personnel management issue at work, a logistical problem with a social gathering, a mechanical/computer issue, or even a crossword puzzle or logic problem on the web. Anything of the sort can draw me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not suggesting I’m great at solving things, but sometimes I find myself unable to easily walk away from a problem or puzzle, even when it looks as though there is no solution, and even when others have long since given up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do you fall on the “I-Must-Solve-This-Or-I-Will-Never-Be-Happy-Again” scale? What complex problem are you most proud to say you solved? Have you ever just given up on a problem?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Updike  (1932-2009)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Updike"&gt;John Updike&lt;/a&gt;, one of the great American writers, died on Tuesday. The &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Variance&lt;/em&gt; bloggers might seem to write incessantly, but they had nothing on him.  Updike produced 26 novels, 9 poetry collections, and, it seemed, a short story in the New Yorker every other week.  There was no aspect of culture that he did not know.  Yesterday, I saw him celebrated on the sports page of the &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/28/SPCA15I7DV.DTL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for his classic on Ted Williams’ last at bat, “Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu”.  We scientists should also acknowledge our gratitude and send our friends out to read his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every particle physicist knows Updike’s poem “&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2005/07/28/cosmic-gall/"&gt;Cosmic Gall&lt;/a&gt;,” the number one popularization of neutrinos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At night, they enter at Nepal&lt;br&gt;
and pierce the lover and his lass&lt;br&gt;
From underneath the bed …
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers of &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Variance&lt;/em&gt; will find much more interesting his 1986 novel &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rogers-Version-John-Updike/dp/0449912183/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roger’s Version&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In Chapter One, the scruffy fundamentalist computer science graduate student Dale Kohler  walks into the office of the comfortably middle-aged Harvard professor of divinity Roger Lambert and shatters his  worldview by explaining that new discoveries in physics and cosmology require intelligent design.  The characters in the story that follows personify all points of view in the science versus religion debate, until — but I shouldn’t ruin the surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.issuemanagement.net/michaelportrait.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/john-updike209_copy41273.jpg" width="150" alt="John Updike"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  People who are serious about literature claim that these works have merely intellectual interest.  If you are in that group, there are also Updike novels that will move you with the depth of his empathy.  His masterwork is the set of four Rabbit Angstrom novels, a thousand pages in all, one novel every ten years from 1960 to 1990.  The greatest moments of Harry “Rabbit”  Angstrom’s life came in high school, when he was a star basketball player in his small town in  upstate Pennsylvania.  When the first novel opens, that part of his  life is already over.  He has an uninspiring job, a tiny apartment, and a  baby who dies in the first few pages.  Harry has no introspection. The glow that surrounded him on the basketball court brings him women, and, one after another, they push him into all varieties of trouble. Harry’s wife Janice is tougher and recognizes that the two  are stronger together than apart, but she cannot control his whims.    In &lt;em&gt;Rabbit, Run,&lt;/em&gt; he wanders in and out of his new marriage and an affair with  a girl from the town. In &lt;em&gt;Rabbit, Redux,&lt;/em&gt; he takes in a runaway teen and her drug habit. In &lt;em&gt;Rabbit is Rich&lt;/em&gt;, he inherits his father-in-law’s Toyota dealership and samples the country-club life.  In &lt;em&gt;Rabbit at Rest&lt;/em&gt;, he tries to retire to Florida, but the bad choices of the past three books — and one astonishing new one — follow him.   Harry also seduces his readers.  We stay one step ahead of him in anticipating the next catastrophe, but we also watch through his eyes the panorama of America in Updike’s era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is too heavy to carry, you could pick up the short, early novel  &lt;em&gt;The Centaur&lt;/em&gt;.  A father, a high school science teacher, sacrifices himself for his son.  It is a brief story, told with great pathos. But also, magically, just under the surface, the story unfolds as a Greek myth, and, in the end, the father, Updike’s father, ascends to the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not be true for those who blog, but those who put pen to paper will always be with us.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

You can get it &lt;a href="http://www.aomin.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[What I wonder is if White is sharing the money earned from selling the debate with Ehrman. Far too often believers cut the skeptics they debate out from the proceeds of such things].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James White wasn't bad either. He too was knowledgeable. I can certainly see White's perspective, one that I shared with him for years. I'm sure believers will come away having their beliefs reinforced, which is what apologists like him attempt to do, so in that respect he did his job well. It's a job I could no longer do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ehrman was talking about the facts of what we know. We know there are as many differences in the manuscripts as there are words in the New Testament texts. White didn't disagree with him on the facts. His main point was that the differences didn't matter. Ehrman's point was that the differences do matter, some of them actually change the meaning of whole book (i.e. the meaning of Hebrews). While the topic was not about Ehrman's view of inspiration his question was that if God inspired the texts then why didn't God also preserve the original texts? In his book on this topic he said it looks like a human endeavor and I agree. This is something former contributor DagoodS &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/05/feel-free-to-copy-me.html"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the disputes between Ehrman and White had to do with the period of time before we find any manuscripts of the New Testament. They both acknowledged that between manuscripts there were many more variants in the earlier periods than in the later periods. From the 2nd century to the 4th century there were many more variants between texts than there were between the 4th century and the 9th century, for instance. Ehrman's argument is that since this is so then we have every reason to think there were even greater variants before we find our first manuscript copies. Among the earliest untrained and sometimes illiterate scribes we would expect even greater manuscript variants. Based on this trend Ehrman argued we just don't know what the original manuscripts said. James White argued instead that if indeed the earliest copies of the originals contained greater variants, then despite the trend we should see even greater variants among the actual manuscripts we have than we find in them. But we don't, he argued. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think Ehrman answered White's counter-argument elsewhere when he spoke of the probability that an original text could be copied and never used to copy from again. In this scenario a 2nd generation copy was copied just a few times over but the 3rd generation copy was copied extensively from then on. So even though we may not have as wide a number of variants as we might expect among the earliest manuscripts we actually have if this trend extended to the earliest scibes, it says nothing to counter the trend going back in time. The fact is that the evidence strongly suggests there would've been more variants between the earliest manuscripts the farther back in time we go. It's just that we only have copies of copies of copies to go on and these copies may be all that survived. One can only wonder what the original texts said, Ehrman argues. We just don't know. I agree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only if Christians actually try to appreciate Ehrman’s points and try to understand them rather than be defensive will they be able to think about the New Testament transmission and how it affects what they believe. It should cause them to re-evaluate their faith. But Christians will always be able to say that James White stood in the gap. He's knowledgeable and so he must know what he's talking about. Shame really. White has an agenda. He's trying to explain away the facts. He stops short of the best explanation of the data because he's blinded by faith. And this is supposed to represent scholarship? Hardly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;*  Did you know that close to one percent of the population meet the characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Did you know that most people with ASD do not get the necessary support because of lack of ASD knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Did you know that the business community realises a growing need for specialists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Did you know that people with ASD are natural born specialists?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.specialisterne.dk/html/english/specialisterne/specialisterne_mission.html"&gt;company's mission&lt;/a&gt; continues to say, "SPECIALISTERNE uses the characteristics of autism in a positive way to provide valuable services for the corporate sector on market terms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And SPECIALISTERNE seems to not just be "saying" this mission but "doing" it as well: 75% of its 50+ employees are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder.  And wait, there's more!  SPECIALISTERNE isn't just "doing" but &lt;em&gt;succeeding&lt;/em&gt; and even attracting recent attention by &lt;a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5869.html"&gt;Harvard Business school&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.specialisterne.dk/html/english/news/arkiv/2008/news_2008_0002.html"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A business model that takes a strength-based perspective while still providing the necessary supports for success is a fresh and exciting idea amidst the stale failure of social services and the rottenness of relentless deficit-based rhetoric.  Along with &lt;a href="http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/article635048.ece"&gt;AspIT&lt;/a&gt;, the Danish seem to be coming up with some very interesting innovations for employment (as well as a refreshingly rational attitude).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to see the business model expanded into areas besides IT: there are plenty of ASD "Specialists" in other disciplines eager for competitive work they adore. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233252396844"><id gr:original-id="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=647">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/05df785383df152e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Computers"/><title type="html">iTunes: Crime Against Humanity</title><published>2009-01-29T16:28:07Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T16:28:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/2009/01/29/itunes-crime-against-humanity/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I installed iTunes, because someone I know is doing pretty well with an app and I wanted to check out the app store, and wow. I mean, just wow. Next time I hear someone tell me about how Apple has such great design sense and makes products that just work, I’m just going to respond with &amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had this painful of an experience with software before. I’m pretty sure that using this software for 10 minutes constitutes a violation of the Geneva Conventions. I have a quad core machine on an 8 mbps internet connection, yet I click app store and count off over 20 seconds before it loads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, when it finally does, I get this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mattmaroon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image3.png"&gt;&lt;img title="image" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px" height="392" alt="image" src="http://mattmaroon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image3-thumb.png" width="644" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(click to enlarge)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the instant migraine subsided, I decided to try it out as, you know, a media player. I’ve used it before (though that was a couple versions ago) to load iPods. That was exceptionally brutal, because I had a Nano, and iTunes just wasn’t built to sync collections to devices that don’t have enough storage capacity, it was built to sell your grandma a few songs and put them on the player. But I’d never used it to just play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I still haven’t, because for some reason, it decided it needed to convert most of my files (which are in FLAC or WMA lossless, because I started encoding music long before there was an iTunes) to AAC, pretty much rendering the program unusable, and the rest of my OS nearly so. I had to kill it with Task Manager, but I’m ordering a silver stake off of Amazon just in case this unholy beast comes back from the dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I’m just more of an old school Winamp type guy. I don’t need my player to do a bunch of fancy organizing for me, that’s why I have folders. I don’t want it to convert them all to some other format for no apparent reason (which would take days for me) especially when I already have the codecs installed. I thought I disliked the latest version of Windows Media Player, but after iTunes I’m thinking about marrying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/29/nasa-faked-a-shuttle-image/"&gt;my last blog post&lt;/a&gt; was obviously tongue-in-cheek (though I expect some wacko website will quote it like it’s real, even saying it came from a real astronomer and everything!), but at its core it’s correct; the image was faked. My arguments are basically sound; the bright Earth, interior lights, and internal reflections would make it impossible to see stars out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the deal with the picture then? I did something no conspiracy theorist ever actually does: &lt;em&gt;I asked someone who might actually know what’s going on&lt;/em&gt;. I sent an email to the gallery curator for the NASA pictures (the email is at the bottom of the images page), and got a nice reply back from Mary Wilkerson, the Still Imagery Repository Supervisor. Basically, the cockpit had been redesigned on the Shuttle, and they wanted a promo shot of the new configuration. It made its premier flight on STS-101, so they wanted to get a slick shot of it. They composited in the Earth and stars to make the picture spacier-looking. Incidentally, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:STSCPanel.jpg"&gt;the image is also on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, with a caption that does note it was composited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the image &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; faked, and probably should be labeled that way, but there’s no harm and no foul. Obviously, there’s no evil or malicious intent here…&lt;/p&gt;

That may change.

"We're devastated."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time in nine years, Genome Canada, a non-profit non-governmental funding organization, was not mentioned in the federal budget and saw its annual cash injection from Ottawa - $140-million last year - disappear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While research leaders have applauded the Conservatives' plan to spend billions on construction and fixing old buildings on university campuses, they are mystified that the money to operate these facilities seems to be shrinking - particularly when U.S. President Barack Obama plans to double research funds in the U.S. over the next decade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When President Obama comes to Canada, we can show him some nice labs with no one in them," said Dr. Godbout, who compared the situation to supplying planes but no pilots or ground crews.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Godbout said he spent the day fielding calls from worried scientists and making calls to research funding partners in the United States and Europe saying that Canada would have to withdraw from a few key international projects - including some that were to be Canadian-led. Among them, he said, is the worldwide effort to sequence the genomes of 50 different types of cancer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not just big science.  The Conservatives also plan to chop $87.2 million from the federal granting agencies in the next three years.  They say this will not affect the amount provided to individual researchers, but their trend of focusing on (their own) 'priority areas' could very well mean that basic research will be gutted in the same manner as big science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is bad news.

It has long been a favorite scientific topic of mine anyway, so it’s a good enough excuse to focus on evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strongest lines of evidence for the fact that life on earth arose through evolution is the fossil record. I do not think this is the strongest line of evidence, not because it is weak but because the genetic evidence is so remarkably strong. Statistically speaking, the genetic evidence speaks to common descent through branching speciation of all life on earth to such a degree that it approaches certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the fossil evidence is also impressive, and much more visceral - walking into a museum full of gigantic fossil dinosaurs (or at least their casts) has a coolness factor with which a string of base pairs cannot compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists, of course, deny the implications of the fossil evidence. At the extreme end are some young-earth creationists who claim that Satan put the fossils there to test our faith. That unfalsifiable notion is not worth further comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The less extreme evolution-deniers simply fail to grasp the history of science and the methods by which we test scientific theories. When Darwin published The Origin of Species in 1859 the fossil record was extremely sparse. Geologists had discovered enough fossils to see that different geological layers tended to contain different assortments of fossil species. This is what led originally to the notion that life has changed through geological time.   Fossils lead to the evolution hypothesis even before Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the fossil record that Darwin had access to was more gaps than anything else - provocative specimens scattered about the history of life without any patterns yet emerging, like a vast jigsaw puzzle with only a few pieces present, and with no picture as a guide to where the pieces went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory of evolution made a very strong prediction, one that could potential falsify evolutionary theory completely. Evolution depends upon common descent - that all life is related through a series of branching events. Evolution therefore predicts that as we discover more fossils (more pieces to the puzzle) the picture that will emerge will be one of branching descent. Evolution requires this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branching descent has two main components - morphology and temporal sequence. The sequence of fossils should show morphological relationships in a branching pattern. One branch will have a set of morphological features that define the branch, and within that branch species will emerge with variations on those features. Occasionally a branch may give rise to a significant morphological change leading to a new branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, evolution predicts that as we lay out fossil species morphologically they will fit into a branching pattern of relatedness. We will not see, however, random morphological features without a clear pattern. We will not see impossible hybrids, or entirely new complex structures arising without plausible antecedents, or the same specific derived characteristics in unrelated lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the morphological branching pattern must simultaneously exist in a proper temporal sequence in the fossil record. Ancestors must come before descendants. We won’t find horses amid Cambrian fossils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time these two related predictions of evolution have been validated spectacularly, and increasingly. The more fossils we find, the better they fit into a morphological and temporal sequence compatible with evolution.  Gaps are slowly filled, and we find generally what we expect to find. We have not found the equivalent of a horse in Cambrian strata. The fossil record has created thousands of opportunities to falsify evolution, and evolution has survived every one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists desperately try to deny the undeniable significance of the fossil record by various tactics, all logically dubious.  One tactic is to focus on a snap-shot of the fossil record as it exists today, ignoring the progress of discovery over time. At any moment in history there will be gaps in the fossil record. Creationists point out those gaps as if they call into question evolution. But when those gaps are filled, they just move on to other gaps or just point to the smaller gaps remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will also focus on the noise in the fossil record. A tiny percentage of living individuals will eventually be fossilized and discovered. Therefore the fossil record is a very low-res picture of the history of life. It is easy, therefore, to point to apparent discrepancies at below the resolution of the fossil record as if it calls into question the bigger picture that the fossil record can paint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proper scientific assessment of the fossil record, however, in terms of whether or not is supports evolutionary theory and common descent, is to look at how it is changing over time. What we see is that the more fossils we find the better the resulting picture matches predictions from evolutionary theory.  If evolution were not true, then we would predict the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note - I am not talking about predicting what species evolved into what. The specific course of evolution is not something that is predictable, and evolutionary theory is not dependent upon any specific history of life. That is entirely a separate question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/2009/1/26/dinosaur-fossils.html"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published by researchers at the University of Bath and London’s Natural History Museum provides more evidence for the success of evolutionary theory in predicting the pattern of the fossil record. They conducted a systematic survey of fossil dinosaurs. Evolutionary theory predicts that a morphological pattern and a temporal pattern of dinosaur fossils should overlap, and this is exactly what the researchers found. This adds statistical rigor to what was already apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers added that the tightness of overlap is dependent upon two things: the correctness of evolutionary theory, and the completeness of the fossil record. Therefore this study strongly suggests that not only is evolutionary theory correct, but at present we have a pretty complete picture of dinosaur evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s cool. It’s also not surprising. Hunting dinosaur fossils has been a priority for paleontologists for over a century. And, dinosaur fossils are generally big. I assume this makes them easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a bit sad in that the evidence implies there are no major groups of dinosaurs in the mix waiting to be discovered. We have the big picture of dinosaur evolution pretty well sketched out. There are probably still many individual species waiting to be discovered, but not major groups. I suppose there can still be side branches that were regionally isolated, but if so then we do not have any individual specimens from these groups that do not fit into the bigger picture we already have. If there are any missing groups, they are completely missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Darwin was alive and publishing his theory of evolution, we had only a smattering of dinosaur fossils. Now, 150 years later, we have a fairly complete picture of a temporal and morphological sequence of branching dinosaur evolution. Scientific theories are judged primarily on how well they make predictions about future discoveries. By that criterion Mr. Darwin’s theory is a resounding success.&lt;/p&gt;

I love this city, for all sorts of reasons.  Intelligent and interesting academic friends; big, beautiful public buildings in brilliant white and yellow; the views across the harbor (hardly any of the sea is frozen today, so the big car ferries are moving with no trouble and the icebreakers are mainly up north); the comfort of the &lt;a href="http://www.hotelarthur.fi/index.php?lang=eng&amp;amp;area=4&amp;amp;id=yhteystiedot"&gt;Hotel Arthur&lt;/a&gt;; but above all (for yes, this is Language Log, not Baltic Tourism Log) &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000820.html"&gt;the coolest language in the world&lt;/a&gt;.  Finnish seems wonderful to me.  Delicious. Speaking the little bits of it that I can manage, or even just reading out signs, actually gives me a tingling feeling on the tongue. (&lt;i&gt;Yliopistokirjakauppa&lt;/i&gt;: it tastes like iced champagne.)  And I learned a tiny bit more about Finnish pronunciation within minutes of arrival.  I thanked the taxi driver by saying &lt;i&gt;kiitos&lt;/i&gt; ("Thank you") as I got out, carefully making the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; twice as long as the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;, which is what I thought was correct.  But I clearly heard my friend Hanna, who had kindly come to the airport to meet me, say to the driver what sounded to my ear more like &lt;i&gt;kitos&lt;/i&gt;.  As soon as we got inside the hotel I asked her, what's up?  Why was her first-syllable vowel shorter than mine?  And like a solid linguist she was able to answer me instantly and authoritatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is, said Hanna, that the phonetic length ratio for long vowels and short vowels is not 2 to 1.  It&amp;#39;s about 1.5 to 1 (she has a colleague who has studied this).  If you make the vowel fully twice the length of a short one, it sounds like there is ironic intent. (Oh, tha-a-a-ank you so much, you jerk!)  I had been making my long vowels a bit too long. I hope the taxi driver didn&amp;#39;t pick up any unintended sarcasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finnish, it seems (and I am trusting Hanna's report here), actually has three vowel lengths: standard length (1 timing unit), long (1.5 units), and expressively lengthened (2 or more units).  The way to say &lt;i&gt;kiitos&lt;/i&gt; correctly — and I rehearsed this in my head — is to imagine five very short but equally spaced timing units for the word, with the &lt;i&gt;kii&lt;/i&gt; part taking three of them: &lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#FFCCAA" align="center"&gt;k  i  i&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#AACCFF" align="center"&gt;t  o  s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#FFCCAA" align="center"&gt;  1 2 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#AACCFF" align="center"&gt;4 5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning I gave my plenary lecture ("The Strange Case of English Linguistic Prescriptivism") to the conference of the LANGNET national graduate program in language studies. Of course I gave it in English (I am not competent to do otherwise).  But when I concluded it, I thanked the audience without irony: "Kiitos", I said, fairly swiftly, but making sure the &lt;i&gt;-os&lt;/i&gt; took just about two-thirds as long as the &lt;i&gt;kii-&lt;/i&gt; part.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Well, Austin area skeptics have responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new group will meet for the first time tonight (Thursday, Jan 29, 2009) at 6:00pm at the &lt;a title="http://www.waterlooicehouse.com/" href="http://www.waterlooicehouse.com/"&gt;Waterloo Ice House&lt;/a&gt; located on 38th St. and Lamar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations are high for the Austin Area Skeptics to be a formidable skeptics group. Austin is one of the premier cities in the U.S., filled with free thinkers, scientists, politicians, musicians, and all manner of avant-garde culture, and hopefully the group will be able to draw people from all of those backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So be sure to venture out tonight for the inaugural gathering of the Austin Area Skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233241413050"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/29/nasa-faked-a-shuttle-image/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f5ce08f0bdf1e0f7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><title type="html">NASA FAKED A SHUTTLE IMAGE!!!!!</title><published>2009-01-29T14:30:07Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T14:30:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/29/nasa-faked-a-shuttle-image/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;BABloggee &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/reader/shared/04101151925939460804"&gt;parkylondon&lt;/a&gt; alerted me to &lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-101/html/jsc2000e10522.html"&gt;this NASA image of the Space Shuttle Atlantis’s cockpit&lt;/a&gt;, taken in March 2000 during mission STS-101.

A SPACE SHUTTLE-sized rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3232936836/sizes/l/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3345/3232936836_b7ff367693.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASA, j’accuse! [Click to embiggen]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have to think twice. I knew right then and there, &lt;em&gt;NASA was hosting a faked image on their own servers&lt;/em&gt;. There was &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; this was a simple snapshot of the Shuttle’s interior! All my years as an image analyst, coupled with my long battle-hardened abilities with conspiracies and fakery, told me I was on to something big here. Very big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are there stars in the picture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;First, the cabin lights were on. That means the photo would use a SHORT exposure time and a SMALL aperture, otherwise the bright interior would be overexposed. But there’s no way you could see stars in a photo under those circumstances!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;Second, those interior lights would reflect inside those windows, again drowning out any outside sources. Whenever you see astronauts taking pictures out the windows, they are always RIGHT UP next to the windows, not a few feet away. Why? &lt;em&gt;Because otherwise the reflections block the view&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;Third, and worst, the Earth hangs fat and bright right smack dab in the center of the viewports! The bright Earth could not possibly be exposed correctly and have the photo still show stars in the windows. The Earth is THOUSANDS of times brighter than the stars. Even the Moon would look dull and dim if the Earth were exposed correctly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s only one explanation: &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone at NASA faked the photo!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; They added in stars later, for what nefarious purposes only the Top Brass at NASA must know. Was this mission faked in some way? Was the whole Shuttle project faked? Does NASA even exist? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="orange"&gt;Have &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; ever even seen NASA?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I wondered if maybe I was making too much of this. If I was really breaking new ground here like Galileo or Einstein did, then I had to be careful. A paradigm shift this big could rate a NOBEL! Maybe this was just a mistake, and the caption of the picture would say something about it. It would give some innocent reason why NASA would add stars to a photograph… but here is the complete caption &lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-101/html/jsc2000e10522.html"&gt;on the NASA page for this image&lt;/a&gt;. Read it and see the deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;JSC2000-E-10522 (March 2000) — Eleven new full-color, flat-panel display screens in the Shuttle cockpit replace 32 gauges and electromechanical displays and four cathode-ray tube displays. The new “glass cockpit” is 75 pounds lighter and uses less power than before, and its color displays provide easier pilot recognition of key functions. The new cockpit is expected to be installed on all shuttles in the NASA fleet by 2002, and it sets the stage for the next cockpit improvement planned to fly by 2005: a “smart cockpit” that reduces the pilot’s workload during critical periods. During STS-101 Atlantis will fly as the most updated shuttle ever, with more than 100 new modifications incorporated during a ten-month period in 1998 at Boeing’s Palmdale, Ca., Shuttle factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing. Not a word as to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;WHY NASA WOULD HAVE FAKED THIS IMAGE!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Our tax dollars paid for this picture! Hundreds of billions of dollars of American citizens’ money has been sent to NASA, and really what do we have to show for it? NASA’s promises, and a bunch of pictures. And this one is CLEARLY faked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My course of action is clear. &lt;font size="+1" color="red"&gt;I am demanding NASA shut down the Shuttle program&lt;/font&gt;. We cannot let this type of trickery stand. Now, realistically, they cannot simply turn off the whole program. I can be magnanimous. So I will give them some time… let’s say a year. No, a year and a half. I’ll give them, say, eight more flights, but then I want the Shuttle Transport System shut down for once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;font color="red" size="+1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I demand it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA, I await your call.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233241006980"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/transforming_learning_through.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/413ceff932d722d3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Education"/><title type="html">Transforming Learning Through Computational Thinking</title><published>2009-01-29T14:32:11Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T14:32:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/MDXnJdpR_nY/transforming_learning_through.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/transforming_learning_through.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://sconc.org/" title=""&gt;SCONC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Can we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I ask this question is because yet another large meta-analysis has been released that is entirely consistent with the hypothesis that acupuncture is a placebo. Because I've written about so many of these sorts of studies over the last year or two that I really had a hard time mustering up the will to write about one more. But I got in pretty late last night and therefore knew I could handle this in a reasonably expeditious fashion. Besides, it is a fairly interesting study as far as methodology. Also, I've been on a roll writing about antivaccine nonsense, but it's taken a toll. My&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_first_of_i_hope_many_very_bad_days_f.php"&gt; foray into the Mothering.com discussion forums&lt;/a&gt; resulted in a real assault on my neurons, so much so that, while I had considered taking on the not-so-dynamic duo, two crappy tastes that taste crappy together, otherwise known as David Kirby and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/autism-vaccines-and-the-c_b_161395.html"&gt;in the pages of The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;. Truly, just when I think HuffPo can't go any lower, damn if it doesn't prove me wrong. In any case, I thought it ill advisable to subject myself to more of Kirby and RFK, Jr. so soon on the heels of Mothering.com waves of burning mommy stupid. Better to take on this study, because it's yet another piece of evidence that backs up what I've come to accept after having actually read that acupuncture literature: That acupuncture is nothing more than a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's take a bit more of a look at the study. Entitled A&lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/338/jan27_2/a3115"&gt;cupuncture treatment for pain: systematic review of randomised clinical trials with acupuncture, placebo acupuncture, and no acupuncture groups&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the BMJ two days ago and was performed by Madsen et al at the Nordic Cochrane Center, meaning it's a Cochrane review. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/can_we_finally_just_say_that_acupuncture.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/can_we_finally_just_say_that_acupuncture.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/aCDfDGNgJQ4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233236473199"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1082">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/237fea592a8287d9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="The academic scene"/><title type="html">Counting linguistics job ads and dissertations</title><published>2009-01-29T12:58:18Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T12:58:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1082" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Heidi and I both posted recently about the job market in linguistics (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1067"&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1076"&gt;her collaborative post with Shannon Bischoff&lt;/a&gt;). There was some discussion in the comments about whether the numbers were truly comparable and whether we should base conclusions on just one year of data. This post attempts to make amends, as it were, by setting Linguist List job data from the last five years alongside the Proquest dissertation data that Shannon collected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/linglist-jobs-barplot1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/linglist-jobs-barplot1.jpg" alt="Counts of job ads and dissertations, 2004-2008" title="Click to enlarge" width="400" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For syntax, phonology, and semantics, the  disparity between the number of  dissertations and the number of jobs is somewhat troubling, but we should not read it as an indication that these fields are hopeless to get into. Rather, it suggests that such students would do well to combine their work with experimental or computational research, to put themselves in the running for a wider range of jobs. This interdisciplinary approach is likely to produce stronger research too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the leftmost three fields, the disparity runs in the opposite direction, making them look like paradise for new graduates. This could be misleading, though. If Proquest encourages more specific categorization for these very general fields, then that could drastically affect the counts we have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The orange and blue bars are close for a number of fields. My take on this: those fields don't have enough researchers. Increased competition might do them good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Field&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that’s going to become a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just today, &lt;a href="http://www.bioarts.com/index.htm"&gt;BioArts International&lt;/a&gt; announced that they delivered the world’s first commercially cloned dog.  The puppy is a Labrador named Lancey and was cloned for Florida residents Edgar and Nina Otto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BioArts’ press release states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BioArts International is a biotech company focused on unique, untapped markets in the global companion animal, stem cell and human genomics industries. The Best Friends Again programis a collaboration between BioArts and the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in South Korea, home to the best and most experienced dog cloning team in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lancey is a clone of the Ottos’ former dog Sir Lancelot who died in January 2008. Sir Lancelot’s DNA was stored and, using the cloning patents developed at the Roslin Institute for the cloning of Dolly the sheep, Lancey was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BioArts has been granted the sole, worldwide license for the cloning of dogs, cats and endangered species. The license was granted by Start Licensing, Inc. and applies to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell_nuclear_transfer"&gt;somatic cell nuclear transfer(SCNT)&lt;/a&gt; cloning patents developed at the Roslin Institute for the cloning of Dolly the sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by far not the first instance of a cloned dog.  But it is the first instance of a commercially cloned one and could usher in a whole new market for pet lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if they could only clone the dog’s mind too, instead of having a dog that just looks like your old dog, you could pretty much get your old dog back.  No need to teach the old tricks, the rules, and most importantly, no need for “house training”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mike Lacelle</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233225881678"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33112888.post-4335943340319260451">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4d102745c38cf745</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Tim Michin's Storm - About your inner skeptical rage.</title><published>2009-01-29T07:56:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T07:56:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skeptobot.com/2009/01/tim-michins-storm-about-your-inner.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.skeptobot.com/" type="html">Just leaving the house, but noticed from Tim Minchin's twitter stream that he's put 'Storm' up.

Memorizing the endings of the middle/passive voice of verbs or of the third declension (masculine/feminine and neuter) isn't easy, but when it's time for the test, the answers are clear and simple and certain: &lt;em&gt;is, i, em, e, es, um, ibus, es, ibus&lt;/em&gt;. When it's time for a translation test, the squirming commences: There are rules for translating from one language into another, but when faced with an actual sentence-- Ἓν οἶδα ὅτι οὐδὲν οἶδα---the rules don't seem to apply, and sometimes need to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My students crave certainty and even more when so much of the talk is of layoffs and financial crisis, when some of them are not at all certain if they'll be able to finish the semester, much less get their degree, because they've borrowed as much as they can.  No less do parents &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/the-search-for-certainty-or-why-were-going-to-the-dentist-at-315pm/"&gt;desire certainty&lt;/a&gt; about, and even seek control of, their children's health; their children's futures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quest for certainty is apparent in the search for a biomarker for autism spectrum disorders. Autism is currently diagnosed in children through observation of a child's behavior, play skills, communication, and there is no biological test that says "this is autism."  Were there such biomarkers, diagnosis would be precise and certain, and parents might have a very clear sense of what medical and other treatments to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is why there's been a bit of attention cast on reports of a &lt;a href="http://www.spectroscopynow.com/coi/cda/detail.cda?id=20169&amp;amp;type=Feature&amp;amp;chId=9&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;saliva test for detecting autism&lt;/a&gt; being developed by researchers in Italy; a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr8004088"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; has been published in the &lt;a href="http://pubs.acs.org/journal/jprobs?cookieSet=1"&gt;Journal of Proteome Research&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the January 15th &lt;a href="http://www.spectroscopynow.com/coi/cda/detail.cda?id=20169&amp;amp;type=Feature&amp;amp;chId=9&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;Spectroscopy Now&lt;/a&gt; on the study, which is entitled &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr8004088"&gt;Hypo-Phosphorylation of Salivary Peptidome as a Clue to the Molecular Pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;.....the Italian researchers compared proteins found in the saliva of 27 children with ASD to those in a control group without a diagnosis of ASD. They used reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) to separate the proteins found in the samples and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to identify the components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that at least one of four protein fragments, the salivary peptides statherin, histatin 1 and acidic proline-rich proteins, in 19 of the children from the ASD group had significantly lower levels of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is a key biochemical process that activates proteins. "Phosphorylation of salivary peptides involves a Golgi casein kinase [enzyme] common to many organs and tissues, CNS included, whose expression seems to be synchronized during foetal development," the researchers explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that 10 of the children with normal or borderline development also presented "hypo-phosphorylated" salivary peptides. This, the researchers suggest, may indicate that the anomaly could relate mainly to the behavioural aspects of ASD rather than overall mental and physical development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Italian results suggest that these abnormal proteins might be indicative of anomalies in the timing of phosphorylation of proteins involved in the development of the central nervous system in early infancy that are thought to be involved in ASD. However, the reduced phosphorylation might also be associated with other pathological conditions rather than ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the "analysis of salivary phospho-peptides might help to discriminate a considerable subgroup of ASD patients," the summary of the study on &lt;a href="http://www.spectroscopynow.com/coi/cda/detail.cda?id=20169&amp;amp;type=Feature&amp;amp;chId=9&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;Spectroscopy Now&lt;/a&gt; reiterates that it's not clear if further clinical testing will reveal if these findings "might relate to ASD if at all." Only 27 participants---a "limited number"---were tested. A January 28th assessment of the "autism saliva test" on &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/autism-saliva-test.html"&gt;ScienceBase&lt;/a&gt; includes an interview with lead researcher Massimo Castagnola of the &lt;a href="http://www.unicatt.it/"&gt;Università Cattolica&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, hypo-phosphorylation of salivary peptides is not necessarily indicative of ASD, as I mention in my &lt;a href="http://www.spectroscopynow.com/coi/cda/detail.cda?id=20169&amp;amp;type=Feature&amp;amp;chId=9&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;SpecNOW&lt;/a&gt; article. Only 18 out of 27 had this characteristic of their salivary peptides. But, hypo-phosphorylation might be present because of another medical problem that may have neurological and/or multifactorial origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Diagnosis of ASD is complex, and ASD is almost certainly a multi-factorial disease,” Castagnola adds, “It would be important to have an early biochemical marker, able to discriminate between different groups of ASD patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, &lt;em&gt;no practical therapeutic consequences of the Italian research at the moment [my emphasis]&lt;/em&gt;. “If future research provides further information, we hope that salivary analysis could be useful in order to address a subgroup of ASD patientssalivary analysis could be useful in order to address a subgroup of ASD patients toward specific therapies,” Castagnola says. “In principle, the non-invasiveness of the test should allow its wide use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, again, "no therapy that could be applied" after an individual took a potential "autism saliva test"----the function of the test (which, again, is a hypothetical test) would be to show that an individual was on the autism spectrum, and that is all. Certainty of a sort, but the bigger questions of "what to do" remain. And much as we all might wish for certainty, all of this is perhaps a reminder that the effort of trying to figure out what to do, and making mistakes and following leads that don't go anywhere---that this journey may well lead us to an answer, hanging blurrily out there in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why have some of our genes evolved rapidly? It is widely believed that Darwinian natural selection is responsible, but research led by a group at Uppsala University, suggests that a separate neutral (nonadaptive) process has made a significant contribution to human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found fast evolving human genes by comparing our genome with those of other primates and found patterns that suggested processes other than natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, their evidence suggests that a separate process known as BGC (biased gene conversion) has speeded up the rate of evolution in certain genes. This process increases the rate at which certain mutations spread through a population, regardless of whether they are beneficial or harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research not only increases our understanding of human evolution, but also suggests that many techniques used by evolutionary biologists to detect selection may be flawed,” says Matthew Webster of the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology at Uppsala University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BGC is thought to be strongest in regions of high recombination, and can cause harmful mutations can spread through populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results lead to the provocative hypothesis that, rather than being the result of Darwinian selection for new adaptations, many of the genetic changes leading to human-specific characters may be the result of the fixation of harmful mutations. This contrasts the traditional Darwinistic view that they are the result of natural selection in favour of adaptive mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course creationists are no doubt already spinning this story to suggest this in some way vindicates their evolution denial when clearly it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As technology has played a bigger role in our lives, our skills in critical thinking and analysis have declined, while our visual skills have improved, according to research by Patricia Greenfield, UCLA distinguished professor of psychology and director of the Children’s Digital Media Center, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thinking is that it would be the opposite for obvious reasons. With more technology, people have more access to information than they used to, and I’d expect that that would translate into stronger critical thinking skills for many. I definitely found that the internet made me more of a critical thinker, but I guess that might just be me. Still, I’m skeptical of this study.&lt;/p&gt;

Those books range from liberal Christian to batshit insane Christian books. So to clear up any confusion, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/01/28/christian-book-store-puts-warning-labels-on-christian-books/"&gt;LifeWay now has a label&lt;/a&gt; on certain books stating “&lt;a href="http://www.lifewaystores.com/lwstore/rwdiscernment.asp"&gt;Read With Discernment&lt;/a&gt;“:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we recognize that almost every title requires some measure of discernment, certain titles should clearly be read with &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;extra&lt;/span&gt; discernment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want you to know that the authors of books marked &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read with Discernment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; may have espoused thoughts, ideas, or concepts that could be considered inconsistent with historical evangelical theology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently some of the books that have been flagged are books by Christian authors that don’t seem to care about the whole gay thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there’s no “Read with Discernment” label on The Bible. No, no, the last thing any Christian authority wants is for people to apply critical thinking to that book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of barrowing too much content from Friendly Atheist’s blog where I got this story from, here’s what 2 Christian bloggers had to say about this bizarre blacklisting of books:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Clawson&lt;/strong&gt;, a Christian, &lt;a href="http://julieclawson.com/2009/01/27/reading-with-discernment/"&gt;says it well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… I’m disturbed by the unspoken implication that the other books sold at their website don’t need as much discernment while reading. Apparently, if something agrees with historical evangelical theology then it gets a pass on reading with a critical eye. We only need to be discerning about those that are discerning about historical evangelical theology since such opinions are only valuable to those those who engage them “strictly for critical study and research.”…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Christian blogger &lt;a href="http://www.mendingshift.com/2009/01/09/warning-read-with-discernment/"&gt;also points out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony is that [LifeWay] will take your money while they sell you — &lt;em&gt;what they consider to be&lt;/em&gt; — theological trash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It says all the right things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the local NBC affiliate in Charleston, South Carolina interviewed &lt;a href="http://secular.org/"&gt;Secular Coalition for America&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;strong&gt;Herb Silverman&lt;/strong&gt; yesterday (though not about SCA). &lt;a href="http://www.counton2.com/cbd/news/local/article/atheist_billboard/19692/fragment-1"&gt;Here’s the clip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in related news, the Atheist Foundation of Australia (AFA–not to be confused with our AFA, the Christian hate group, the American Family Association) is &lt;a href="http://ozatheist.wordpress.com/2009/01/28/jesus-is-the-answer/"&gt;on the lookout for religious adverts&lt;/a&gt;; particularly on buses, billboards, or other media managed by &lt;a href="http://www.apnoutdoor.com.au/"&gt;APN&lt;/a&gt; because the AFA was planning on conducting an Atheist Bus Campaign similar to the ones in the UK, USA and Spain until APN refused to carry the adverts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the AFA find any evidence of APN carrying religious advertising then this can be used as evidence in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that in between administering grants, some personnel at the NSF have been watching porn.  A lot of porn.  While at the office.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/18070.html"&gt;Politico reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one particularly egregious case, the report says one NSF “senior official” was discovered to have spent as much as 20 percent of his working hours over a two-year interval “viewing sexually explicit images and engaging in sexually explicit online ‘chats’ with various women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Senator Grassley is threatening to hold up the NSF’s share of the stimulus package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grassley’s office has asked the foundation to turn over all “specific reports of investigations, audit reports, evaluations and information supporting the examination of the NSF network drive” by Thursday in an effort to “ensure that NSF properly fulfills its mission to strengthen scientific and engineering research, and makes responsible use of the public funding provided for these research disciplines.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The semiannual report raises real questions about how the National Science Foundation manages its resources, and Congress ought to demand a full accounting before it gives the agency another $3 billion in the stimulus bill,” Grassley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure this is comedy gold, but, I can’t seem to get past “Ick” and “Ugh”.&lt;/p&gt;

I wonder why they never mention &lt;a href="http://orato.com/lifestyles/2009/01/02/trapped-mormon-gulag?page=1"&gt;The Utah Boys Camp&lt;/a&gt;, a concentration camp for boys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is about my personal experiences at a place called The Utah Boys Ranch, which models itself as a “tough-love” prep-school, but while I was there, I witnessed some unbelievable atrocities. It is a Mormon-funded and staffed facility, and religious indoctrination is a fundamental aspect of the school. There was sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, suicide, staff corruption, and escape. A major Utah political figure, Senator Chris Buttars was the executive director while I was there.

And yet now I come across &lt;a href="http://ncronline3.org/drupal/?q=node/2945"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; from last month about them excommunicating a man, Maryknoll Fr. Roy Bourgeois, for. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .refusing to disavow his belief that God calls women to the priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THAT MONSTER! So what else does this demonic beast believe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women have such gifts, such compassion, such wisdom, which we need if the church is to be vibrant,” Bourgeois said. He believes it’s unconscionable for the hierarchy to reject their call, especially when churches are being closed and the number of priests is constantly shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that’s going too far! As every Catholic knows, the only good woman is a woman being burned at the stake. . .and Mary Magdeline because she put out for god.&lt;/p&gt;

Who hasn't heard it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arrogance is just one of their repellent qualities, of course. They are also ungenerous, cold, lonely, untrustworthy, amoral, and aggressive. You shouldn't leave them around children. When I spoke last week to a group called &lt;a href="http://www.seattleatheists.org/"&gt;Seattle Atheists&lt;/a&gt;, the organizer positioned me far from the door, and I speculated aloud about whether I should be worried for my safety, given what we know about atheist ethics.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the most common accusation hurled against atheists is that they are insufferably arrogant. In my experience, this accusation is rarely about a specific encounter: &lt;em&gt;I was talking with Joan, my atheist neighbor down the street last week and do you know how I was treated by that insufferable witch?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, it is more like a mantra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Seattle, there's a chain of hamburger joints called Dick's. People who find themselves on the topic of hamburgers will say, "Dick's is great" almost as an opener, before they move on to the details of the conversation. Amazingly, I've heard this even from folks who have never eaten there. Dick's is great. Atheists are arrogant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;The unflinching tones adopted by &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GIZG4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=exchrisnetenc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0015GIZG4"&gt;The Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=exchrisnetenc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B0015GIZG4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;&lt;br&gt; are not more harsh or critical than what we accept routinely in academic debate or civic life. It is the subject matter that is the issue.&lt;/span&gt;The accusation provides cover for those who want dismiss thinkers like Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, or Christopher Hitchens. I've often marveled that anyone could read &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Faith-Religion-Terror-Future/dp/0393327655/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1233003447&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Harris' manifesto&lt;/a&gt;--written as graduate student's post-9-11 cry of anguish, or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/God-Not-Great-Religion-Everything/dp/0771041438/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1233003488&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Hitchens' litany&lt;/a&gt; of social corrosion and atrocity in the names of gods, or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/God-Delusion-Richard-Dawkins/dp/0618918248/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1233003531&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Dawkins' urgent appeal&lt;/a&gt; to evidence and reason, or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Spell-Religion-Natural-Phenomenon/dp/0143038338/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1233003994&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Dennett's nerdy analysis&lt;/a&gt; of human information processing, and find themselves reacting above all to perceived arrogance. Images of people jumping from fiery buildings. Mutilated genitals. Radically cool glimpses of our mental circuitry - and the dominant reaction is &lt;em&gt;disgust about arrogance&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interestingly, the accusation also provides cover for those who agree with the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyUz2XLp1E"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. Young non-theists writing even for edgy places like &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/atheism_pr.html"&gt;Wired Magazine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/do-unto-others/Content?oid=999785"&gt;The Stranger&lt;/a&gt; go to some lengths to say &lt;em&gt;I'm not like those atheist guys. We all can agree to loathe them. Mind you, they do make a decent point or two&lt;/em&gt; . . . . The ugly atheist stereotype is so strong, that people feel like they need to distance from atheism's iconic figures if they want a shot at being heard--or perhaps, even, liking themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what's underneath the stereotype? For years, as a practicing psychologist, it was my job to listen for the feelings and needs behind the tone, and I think a host of feelings and yearnings are obscured by the "arrogance" label. Below are some of the emotions I hear in the writings and conversations of self-identified atheists, and some my imperfect hypotheses about where they come from:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobody self-labels as an atheist in our culture unless he or she is "out" for a reason. It's like looking white in Alabama and making a point to tell people about your black father. Freethinkers who adopt the label publicly have decided for one reason or another to take the heat, and they are not necessarily representative of the broad range of freethinkers who may choose other labels or none at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For some people, being out as an atheist is personality driven or developmental. (All of us know natural born contrarians; many of us experiment with identities on the way to adulthood.) For some it is political. For some it comes from a deep conviction that we must find some way to change the public conversation about what is good and what is real and how to live in community with each other. All self-labeled atheists are braced, steeled against the stereotype, but they have varied reasons for looking society in the eye and saying, This is who I am. What they have in common is a sense of determination and the willingness to pay a price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frustration&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Theism gets a pass on the rules of reason and evidence that normally guide our social discourse. In a boardroom or a laboratory, we don't get to say, "I just know in my heart that this product is going to sell," or "This drug works even though the experiment didn't come out that way."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cartoonist Wiley Miller captured atheist frustration perfectly in a recent Non Sequitur entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.gocomics.com/nonsequitur/2009/01/11"&gt;The Invention of Ideology&lt;/a&gt;:"&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;One caveman stands in the rain.&lt;br&gt;Another behind him under shelter comments, "Um, why you standing in the rain?"&lt;br&gt;"It not raining"&lt;br&gt;"Yes it is."&lt;br&gt;"No it not."&lt;br&gt;"Huh? Water fall from sky. That rain."&lt;br&gt;"That your opinion."&lt;br&gt;"Not opinion. Fact. See? Raindrops."&lt;br&gt;"Don't need to look. Already know it not rain."&lt;br&gt;"If it not rain, then why you wet and me dry?"&lt;br&gt;(Pause) "Define 'wet' . . . "&lt;br&gt;"Oww . . . Brain hurt!"&lt;/blockquote&gt; What does frustration sound like? When it doesn't sound like brain pain, it sounds impatient,sharp and distancing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incredulity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believers look at the dogmas of religions other than their own and see them as silly, and yet find their own perfectly reasonable. Atheists, except for those few with formal training in the psychology of belief, find it incredible, almost unbelievable that the faithful don't perceive some higher order parallel between their religion and others--and run the numbers, so to speak. Of course that's not how ideology works, and per cognitive scientist Pascal Boyer, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Religion-Explained-Pascal-Boyer/dp/0465006965/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1233031992&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt; rationality is like Swiss Cheese&lt;/a&gt; for all of us. But if you buy the Enlightenment view of man as a rational being, it's easy to get sucked in and expect rationality and then be incredulous when you simply can't get smart people to bind themselves to the obligations of logic and evidence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offense&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It feels obnoxious to have people assume that you have no moral core, that you rejected Christianity because you wanted to sin without guilt, or that you are damaged goods, the object of pity. Fundamentalist Christians, when they have given up on conversion, treat non-believers as agents of evil who reject God, like Lucifer did, out of willful defiance. Modernist Christians express benign sympathy -- and look for early childhood wounding (in particular at the hands of fundamentalists that left the scarred freethinker unable to enjoy the wonder and joy of faith. Both fundamentalists and modernists often assume that freethinkers miss out on wonder, joy and a sense of transcendent meaning. Atheists take offense, even when these assumptions are couched kindly and are well intended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resentment&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Atheists, along with the rest of America, listened to a presidential inauguration in which the preachers, combined, got almost as much talk time as the president. They help their kids figure out what to do with the anti-communist, "under God" line in the Pledge of Allegiance(Go along with it? Stand silently? Substitute "under magic"? How about "under Canada?"). They pay their bills with "In God we trust." They listen to born-again testimonials as a part of public high school graduation ceremonies and reunions. They do twelve years of training and then twelve hours of surgery and then read in the paper that a child was saved miraculously by prayer. Sometimes they get mad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;On websites like exChristian.net, doubters often lurk for months or even years before they finally confess their loss of faith. Because apostasy is so taboo, they struggle over how to tell their children, or spouses or parents or congregations--especially the fallen ministers. They wrestle with guilt and fear, just like their religions say they should. They deal with rejection, even shunning. Some of them come out at tremendous personal cost. See "&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/valerie-tarico/when-leaving-jesus-means-_b_92442.html"&gt;When Leaving Jesus means Losing Your Family&lt;/a&gt;." Although this doesn't apply to all freethinkers, for those who are in the process of losing their religion, the pain is real. And pain has an edge. Try selling anything, including dogma, to a woman with a migraine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Not all atheist pain about religion is personal. Many nontheists feel anguished by the sexual abuse that is enabled by religious hierarchy, by women shrouded in black and girls barred from schools, by the implements of inquisition that lie in museums, by ongoing Christian witch burnings in Africa and India, or by those images of people leaping from windows. Even less dramatic suffering can be hard to witness- children who fear eternal torture, teens who attempt suicide because they are gay and so condemned, women who submit to their own abuse or the abuse of their children because God hates divorce. To the extent that we experience empathy, these events are can feel unbearable,  the more so because they seem so unnecessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral Indignation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atheist morality is rooted in notions of universal ethical principles, either philosophical or biological, and often centered on compassion and equity. Since the point of atheist morality is to serve wellbeing, suffering caused by religion often triggers not only horror but moral outrage. Each believer sees his or her religion as a positive moral force in a corrupt world. Most think that morality comes straight from their god.  Because of this, believers  fail to recognize when atheist outrage is morally rooted. They don't understand that atheists frequently see religion as a force that pushes otherwise decent people to have &lt;em&gt;immoral &lt;/em&gt;priorities. When, for example, the religious oppose vaccinations, or contraception, or they come to care more about gay marriage than hunger, an atheist is likely to perceive that religion undermines morality. When theism sanctifies terrorism or honor killings, atheists are apalled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love and Longing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;What folks like Sam Harris and Bill Maher are saying, as loudly as they know how, is that they love  this imperfect world, and they fear for it.  They long to see that which they cherish most: natural beauty, global community, human rights, and the fruits of scientific discovery handed down to their children and ours.  But they believe wholeheartedly in the power of religion to destroy that which they hold dear. Why? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Need we even ask?  Think about the Twin Towers, the Taliban, the Religious Right's yearning for Armageddon, the geometric progression of our global population curve and the Church's opposition to family planning as a moral responsibility. Think about the trajectory of human religious history - what has happened in the past when unquestioned ideologies controlled government and military. Think abstractly about a social/economic/international policy approach that is unaccountable to data, one that sees doubt as weakness, agreement among insiders as proof, and change as bad. Think concretely about suitcase nukes in the hands of Pentecostals or Wahabis who believe that a deity is speaking directly through their impulses and intuitions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prophets of the godless are crying out that 21st century technologies guided by Bronze Age priorities may bring about a scale of suffering that our ancestors could  describe only as hell. You might not agree with them, but to understand their in-your-face stridency as anything more complex than arrogance, you have hear the depth of their urgency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have you ever had a dream in which, no matter how hard you try no-one can hear you? Many freethinkers feel like that whenever they try to talk about their journey of discovery. &lt;br&gt;"Hey," say former fundies. "Guess what I found out. The Bible contradicts itself. Do you want to see where?"&lt;br&gt;"I never meant to end up godless," say former moderates. "Do you want to hear how it happened?"&lt;br&gt;"'A theory' isn't something we dream up afterhours," say biologists. "Can we tell you what a scientific theory is to us?"&lt;br&gt;"We think we've figured out how those out-of-body experiences and bright lights work - at a neurological level," say neuroscientists. "Care to know?"&lt;br&gt;"Religion may increase compassion toward insiders at the expense of outsiders," say sociologists. "Are you interested in finding out?"&lt;br&gt;"What if we can no longer afford beliefs without evidentiary basis?" ask the bell ringers. "What if unaccountable belief inevitably produces some that are dangerous?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not the fundamentalists they are hoping to engage. It is moderate, decent people of faith--the majority of the human race. But are moderate believers open to such questions? Many outsiders think not, and people who feel hopeless about being heard either go silent or get loud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, let's come back to arrogance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes. Atheists are susceptible. They think they have it right. (So do we all.) And yes, those nonbelievers who underestimate the power of viral ideologies and transcendent experiences tend to think that belief must be an IQ thing, meaning a lack thereof. And yes, dismay, pain, outrage, incredulity and desperation all make people tactless, sometimes aggressively so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I don't think any of these is why frank talk from atheists so consistently triggers accusations of arrogance. The unflinching tones adopted by the Four Horsemen are not more harsh or critical than what we accept routinely in academic debate or civic life. It is the subject matter that is the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would argue that atheist talk about religion seems particularly harsh because it violates unspoken norms about how we should approach religion in our relationships and conversations. Here are some of those rules:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's plain old mean to shake the faith that gives another person comfort and community, so don't do it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you doubt, keep it to yourself. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice don't-ask-don't tell about unbelief. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be respectful of other people--respecting people means respecting their beliefs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If someone tries to convert you, be polite because they only mean well. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember that faith is good and even a brittle, misguided faith is better than none at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outspoken atheists break all of these rules. They do and say things that are verboten. They insert their evidences and opinions where these are clearly unwelcome. Is this the height of self-importance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently I interviewed former Pentecostal minister Rich Lyons about his journey out of Christianity. We found ourselves laughing about the velvet arrogance of our former beliefs: that we, among all humans knew for sure what was real; that we knew what the Bible writers actually meant; that our instincts, hunches and emotions were the voice of God; that we were designated messengers for the power that created the galaxies and DNA code -- and that He just happened to have an oh-so-human psyche, like ours. What other hubris could compare, really?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe it is time for all of us glass-house dwellers, theists and freethinkers alike,  to move beyond conversations about arrogance and onto much needed conversations about &lt;a href="http://www.wisdomcommons.org/virtues/152-universal-ethics"&gt;substance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valerie Tarico is the author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1411691253?tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1411691253&amp;amp;adid=0KGBA918455D8ZQ63RQC&amp;amp;"&gt;The Dark Side&lt;/a&gt;, and the founder of &lt;a href="http://www.WisdomCommons.org"&gt;www.WisdomCommons.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Goprairie mentioned what she would do if she were God.  Then Russ contributed what he would do as God.  I thought the interaction was brilliant so I'd like to feature it and request responses from everyone meaning all categories from Believers to Non-Believers, Buddhists to Zoroastrians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are the relevant comments.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lee Randolph said...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would do things according to my values and principles which are...&lt;br&gt;* scrap it all and start over otherwise, knowing full well that I made the parameters, that unless I want to start over I have to work within the parameters and get down to a level that the human can comprehend&lt;br&gt;* to nurture&lt;br&gt;* to follow sound principles of communication, because humans demonstrate every day that their behavior can be changed in a variety of ways by a variety of stimuli, none of them having the potential force of a God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; goprairie said...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) if you were god, would you reveal yourself? to me this is a big duh. what would the harm be? for god to make him/herself obvious to us would sure stop a lot of arguing and fighting and killing. if i were god as i usually hear god defined, i would want to make myself known and stop that kind of crap. like if my kids came home and didn't know if i was here and were about to do something wrong, i would cough to make myself known and prevent their bad behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) god used to have personal relationships with people. sure, but now we call those personal relationships forms of mental illness. that he 'appears' so differently to people is reason to beleive it is a product of the person's own mind. i know a man who today believes he is a 'prophet' but oddly, the stuff god says thru him is the widely accepted views of a white male 60-something conservative. if god were really appearing to my friend, would there not be some thing that he would disagree with my friend about and that my friend would find challenging and shocking? yet oddly, each prophesy he 'hears' is spot on with what he knows and believes. dead giveaway to me that it is his own brain playing tricks on him, that he is then trying to pass off on us as the word of god. i am pretty sure if god revealed him/herself to me, there would be some surprises!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; Russ said...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;goprairie,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Great comment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Question for you: If you were a god, how would you treat the children you created?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me, like you, goprairie, I would make sure that, at least occasionally, they knew I was there. That's one mark of a loving father. I most certainly would not single out one of them to be nonsensically chatted up out of an incendiary shrubbery, and then, in a monumental display of omniscient stupidity actually expect that everyone concerned and impacted would get the message. Fact is, I would counsel my children that they would do well to simply ignore any and all claims made by each and every forthright forsythia, sincere salvia, ardent arborvitae, and profoundly philosophical philadelphus. Plants are notorious liars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I wrote them a book, say three thousand years ago, I would have told them useful things, remembering that, I am, after all, modeling a loving father. Let's say, that although I am omniscient, omnipotent, and whatever other omni's I want to be, I decided not to disclose too much all at once. While I could have kept nuclear bombs and microelectronics in reserve - they would have been really difficult to implement given the technology of the time - I still could have given them much useful information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remembering that I actually do love my children, that is, I love every single one of them, in my book I would not pit them against one another by calling some of them my "chosen people." I would not claim to love my sons and daughters while continually demonstrating that I see my daughters as second rate chattel. I would show them a constancy in love that would allow them go to sleep each night assured that their loving father would never intentionally harm any one of them. If I did indeed have the power to destroy my children, being a loving father, I would make sure they were never aware of that awful terrifying thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My book for my children would contain lots of good tips: wash your hands; pork is healthy food, just cook it well; slavery is out, period(don't want to interfere with someone's freewill, now, do we?); health problems are caused by germs or a person's own failing body - not demons or witches - so the proper response to someone's illness is empathy, caring, and compassion, not burning them, torturing them, or chaining them to a wall; here's a simple recipe for soap, and here's how you use it; the earth is not the center of the universe and it is much closer to correct to say that the Earth goes around the Sun; here's how to make a printing press; you are related to every living thing on the planet; enjoy sex; avoid violent conflict as far as possible; don't kill those who disagree with you; and, the world is more comprehensible when you approach it systematically through science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the introduction I would point out that this material is the best stuff I had available to me, and that as they learn better ways to do things they should update the book with that new data. Being a loving father know-it-all, I would permit updates that were a closer reflection of reality than were the book's current contents and I would disallow those ideas that went too far afield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm guessing I could get all I want to say to them into a 100 page trade paperback in 12 point type, including indexes and appendices (Hey, it's some handy tips from a loving father, not Encyclopedia Britannica). Then, being omnipotent and all, I would drop one copy into the lap of every person on the planet each of whom would be able to read it in their native tongue regardless of age, literate or not(all that omni has to be put to work somehow). Periodic updates would be similarly dispersed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, goprairie, if you were a god, how would you treat the children you created?&lt;br&gt;1:33 PM, January 28, 2009&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;goprairie said...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;russ - not sure what you are asking, but i will toss a couple things out - &lt;br&gt;i have never tried to write a book for them with all my knowledge, cuz i am here for them. i don't hide in a closet but let it be known that if they have a question or issue or idea, we can talk and we have for their whole lives talked about what is current with them and what they need to know now. i make myself known and available.&lt;br&gt;if i had written them a book 3K years ago and i had put errors in it, like to hate gay people, i would certainly write them a note now saying hey, i was wrong on that one or hey, i changed my mind or hey, you are misinterpreting that one.&lt;br&gt;that god does such a poor job of this brings his/her existence into question. anything that tries to make excuses for god not being present to us is making more problems. it is more likely there is not god and when i look, i find alternate answers that make more sense for every single thing ever attributed to god.&lt;br&gt;9:58 PM, January 28, 2009&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Since there’s about a foot and a half of snow on the ground right now, it’s kinda hard to imagine when I’ll actually even &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the ground again, much less dig a hole in it.&lt;img title="corn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/2626002193_7ff9646570_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hope springs eternal, and since it looks like the house is not going to be sold for a while, I’m going to barge ahead and plant my garden as if I’ll be here to eat it all. *  I do have a tendency to dream big and &lt;a title="take my zucchini. Please." href="http://flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/949659793/in/set-72157600571598984/"&gt;overplant&lt;/a&gt;, but hey, it’s all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am totally in love with &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/1143142358/in/set-72157600571598984/"&gt;Big Mama tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, but I just don’t have a long enough summer for them. I get a huge crop right at the beginning of September, when I’m gnawing my fingernails about a early frost.  I’m still dithering about what tomatoes to grow this year–most of my past experiments with heirlooms have been…&lt;a title="freakish tomatoes." href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/08/14/an-experiment-with-spam-and-tomatoes/"&gt;odd&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ll definitely grow Fresh Salsa variety tomatoes, but what else I’m just not sure.  Probably good old Roma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very frustrated at the number of pollen-free sunflower varieties offered this year.  &lt;strong&gt;Will no one think of the insects?! &lt;/strong&gt; Seriously. Pollenless flowers??  That’s like the crust-less bread you can buy for picky kids.&lt;br&gt;
Sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s being planted this year–some old, and some new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snap Pea: Cascadia&lt;br&gt;
Pumpkin:  Spirit Hybrid&lt;br&gt;
Spinach:  Correnta&lt;br&gt;
Winter Squash: Cornell’s Bush Delicata&lt;br&gt;
Pole Bean: Blue Lake FM1 Organic&lt;br&gt;
Corn: Early Sunglow&lt;br&gt;
Hot pepper: Ancho&lt;br&gt;
Green/sweet Pepper: Red Delicious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you going to plant this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Because, you know, I will be here. &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/01/10/news-i-really-didnt-need/"&gt;Forever, apparently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Okay, this is the third time since I started this blog in July that &lt;em&gt;Parade Magazine&lt;/em&gt; has actually promoted sCAM medicine. To get a real sense of how shoddy “Dr”. Mark Liponis’ arguments for sCAM medicine are, here are his opening 2 paragraphs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as many as 62 percent of Americans use some form of alternative medicine. But few of these treatments are covered by the average medical-insurance plan. The NIH estimates that Americans spend between $36 billion and $47 billion out of pocket each year on alternative therapies such as acupuncture or meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, do they really work? With government funding, science is expanding its study of alternative and complementary treatments. Some, but not all, are showing positive results. And many of the most successful methods involve “mind-body therapies”—techniques that use the power of the mind to help heal the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He starts off light with a little ad populum fallacy. It doesn’t seem to occur to him that millions of dollars are spent each year on the same water that you can get for free from your tap. And hey, millions of Americans buy cigarettes, so that MUST mean it’s good for you! Give me a break! In that case, Doc, I’ve got some magic beans I’d like to sell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he’s flat-out dishonest about the results of the research. Every carefully designed study has shown that even sham acupuncture (as in acupuncture where the needles aren’t put in the right places) worked better than the real thing, while only poorly designed studies have suggested acupuncture is in any way beneficial. It seems that the better the study, the smaller the perceived benefit. Why might that be? Simple. Acupuncture doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, take &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/health/090120-acupuncture-placebo.html"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; from just a few days ago.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve known that Nancy Cartwright was a high-level OT in $cientology for some time now but apparently she actually &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocall"&gt;robocalls&lt;/a&gt; people in the Hollywood area about Scientology events, where she evidently performs the “audits”. She does these calls in the voice of Bart Simpson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the video on the site linked above is no longer active due to a copyright violation, I’ll just present this video, which also addresses how Cartwright is an even bigger $cientologist than Tom Cruise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/28/voice-of-bart-simpson-robo-calls-for-cientology/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/gPnwvZQai9c/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s given $10 million to $cientology, more than Tom Cruise, Kristie Alley, John Travolta and Kelly Preston combined. I rather like this quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s gonna be a blast, man! (&lt;em&gt;Bart laugh&lt;/em&gt;)” before asking us to call and confirm our attendance. It’s as if we’d heard Bugs Bunny making a speech for Hamas (”Poisonally, Doc, I prefer jihad”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Experienced&lt;/span&gt; a Skeptic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The Skeptic" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/the-skeptic.gif?w=150&amp;amp;h=216" alt="The Skeptic" width="150" height="216"&gt;I recently assumed the role of &lt;strong&gt;Editor&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Skeptic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where can I subscribe?” You immediately ask!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure5.ozhosting.com/skeptics/shop/skeptic.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You can subscribe here!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I immediately reply, adding, “Look out for us in newsagencies, newstands and bookstores soon…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll further add that over the coming months we’ll have an updated magazine; a slick, sexily skeptical design, new columns, new features and new authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a busy Skepbitch, so until I can get back to my regular routine of  scathing skeptical commentary, here’s a sneak peak of  the next &lt;strong&gt;Around the Traps&lt;/strong&gt;, a local skeptical news column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(N.b. The photo of the children peering into a van displaying a model of Noah’s Ark is particularly vile…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn On, Tune In, Nod Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia missed the bus to advertise a Sunday sleep-in, but unfortunately, we didn’t miss the &lt;a href="http://creationontheweb.com/content/view/4196"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation Bus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://creationontheweb.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creationontheweb.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation Ministries International&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sponsor this travelling band of &lt;strong&gt;Creationists&lt;/strong&gt; who have performed outreach to 100,000 people over the past fifteen years.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The Creation Bus drives nonsense non-science to regional, rural and outback communities, the areas that need education the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missionary Peter Sparrow teaches Creationism and his own distorted and misinformed view of evolutionary theory. He Says, “Sadly, so many aboriginal folk have accepted the lie of human evolution, still believing today the idea that they are somehow less evolved or more primitive than the rest of the population. I have seen tears resulting from the realization that we really are all one race, descended from Adam and Eve, and thus all related and all equally made in the image of God our Creator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These missionaries should know better; Peter is a Science teacher with a degree in biology and his wife Cathy is a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/creation-bus.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="//creationontheweb.com/content/view/4196" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/creation-bus.jpg?w=322&amp;amp;h=200" alt="creation-bus" width="322" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creation Bus is known as “Myrtle the Turtle”, and boasts the number plate “DAYS 06”. The bus is painted in a psychedelic motif, “Each of the colours of the stripes represents a day in the Creation week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;White: day 1, light.&lt;br&gt;
Blue: day 2, water and sky.&lt;br&gt;
Green: day 3, plants.&lt;br&gt;
Yellow: day 4, sun, moon and stars.&lt;br&gt;
Brown: day 5, living creatures.&lt;br&gt;
Red: day 6, man (‘one blood’).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magical Ministry Tour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s yet another Creationist bus ministering a lack of science to remote regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation Ministries International&lt;/strong&gt; is also sponsoring the &lt;a href="http://creationontheweb.com/content/view/4209"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ark Van Ministry Tour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Rod “The Ark Man” Walsh is a “long-time Noah’s Ark modeller and expert” who is currently on tour to “share the gospel” and expound his beliefs about the Biblical story of Noah’s Ark and the Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="//creationontheweb.com/content/view/5103" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/ark-van-ministry.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=225" alt="The Ark Van" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a travelling exhibit of Ark models built “to scale” that conform to “the general biblical principles most creationists adhere to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ark Van visits schools and churches in rural Australia and overseas, as Walsh answers audience questions such as, “How big was the Ark and how did all the animals fit? Where did all the water come from? Where did all the water go? And how could the world have been populated in just 4,500 years since the Flood?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walsh’s mission is to “help people understand how real the Ark was.” With a background in insurance he obviously takes “Acts of God” too literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We're discussing it online and will be meeting to talk about it every week or two.  I'm posting below what I posted in our discussion forum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 1 - Variation Under Domestication&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Darwin spends a lot of time discussing the fact that domestic breeds vary. This may seem pretty obvious to us, but it was an important set up for the idea that variation is common. Remember-- no variation, no selection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also goes to pains to convince readers that domestic breeds (e.g., of pigeons) were all descended from a common ancestor. Again, this may seem obvious to us, but as he notes (p. 50), almost all breeders assumed that each breed was descended from a different wild ancestor. So, he is using these examples to establish common descent and branching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Several important ideas already appear in the chapter:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1) Although he didn't know how heredity works he knew it is crucial for his mechanism (p.33).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any variation which is not inherited is not important for us."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) Differences between modern organisms may be so great that it is difficult to imagine that they share common ancestors -- he used the example of pigeons, which would be classified as different species if a taxonomist didn't know they were domestic breeds because they look so different (p.44). And yet, all the information indicates that they are descended from the same ancestor species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not believe that any ornithologist would place he English carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the same genus".&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3) Selection is the main mechanism of change. Not crossing, not effects of environment, and so on (p.66).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Over all these causes of Change I am convinced that the accumulative action of Selection, whether applied methodically and more quickly, or unconsciously and more slowly, but more efficiently, is by far the predominant Power."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4) Selection is about the accumulation over many generations of almost imperceptibly slight changes (p.52-53). The emergence of breeds is gradual, probably too much to notice as it is occurring (p.62).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases, we know that this has not been their history. The key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to make for himself useful breeds."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language, can hardly be said to have had a definite origin. A man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them, and the improved individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood. But as yet they will hardly have a distinct name, and from being only slightly valued, their history will be disregarded. When further improved by the same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely, and will get recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible changes."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5) Selection is known to occur, at least with breeding (p.52, p.55).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6) Most changes are ignored (neutral) or detrimental, but some are noticed and selected (p.61).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however slight, in one's own possession. Nor must the value which would formerly be set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be judged of by the value which would now be set on them, after several breeds have once fairly been established. Many slight differences might, and indeed do now, arise amongst pigeons, which are rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection of each breed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;7) Selection doesn't require conscious effort. It can be unconscious (p.56).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"...a kind of Selection, which may be called Unconscious, and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more important. Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;8) Large populations are best for selection (p.63).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"But as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept; and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the individuals of any species are scanty, all the individuals, whatever their quality may be, will generally be allowed to breed, and this will effectually prevent selection."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;9) If breeds are going to diverge, they must not interbreed (i.e., what we would now say means blocking gene flow) (p.64).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"In the case of animals with separate sexes, facility in preventing crosses is an important element of success in the formation of new races,—at least, in a country which is already stocked with other races. In this respect enclosure of the land plays a part.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling habits, cannot be matched, and, although so much valued by women and children, we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up; such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country, often from islands."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/Ze3LDyHofUc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233206975743"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-62081924">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/36b4e87fae2a266c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution / Intelligent Design" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Michael Egnor" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><title type="html">Egnor Accepts His Woo</title><published>2009-01-29T05:24:24Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T05:24:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/01/egnor-accepts-his-woo.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/01/egnor-accepts-his-woo.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/"&gt;Orac&lt;/a&gt; I just learned that creationist neurosurgeon Michael Egnor has &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/01/i_win_a_golden_woo_award_but_w.html"&gt;accepted the Golden Woo&lt;/a&gt; I &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/01/the-golden-woos.html"&gt;awarded him three weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;.  This is the first formal acceptance.  In accepting his award, Egnor quoted my snippet of his words that I quoted as a justification for bestowing the honor:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no shared property yet identified by science through which brain matter can cause mental acts like altruism. Material substances have mass and energy. Ideas have purpose and judgment. There is no commonality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And he followed with&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I win this materialist&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Golden Woo Award&amp;quot; because I assert that there are properties of the mind, such as purpose and judgement, that are not properties of matter. Furthermore, I assert that this is a problem for materialism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes.  And the problem is just that – Egnor just &lt;strong&gt;asserts&lt;/strong&gt; these things; he presents no evidence for them.  He also conveniently ignores Steven Novella’s rebuttal, that I also linked, that starts with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Egnor’s argument] is utter rubbish on many levels. Egnor’s basic point is that the material brain cannot cause mental activity, which is immaterial. But he does not establish that premise, he merely assumes it and his justification is nothing more than semantics. He then accuses material scientists of assuming that mental functions are brain functions, while essentially dismissing a huge chunk of modern neuroscience as “interesting” but irrelevant by falsely invoking the “correlation is not causation” argument. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, he is treating mental function as a pure abstraction – but in so doing he is assuming his conclusion and therefore is making a tautological argument.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in my experience, this is the fundamental flaw with virtually all the philosophical arguments around this supposed “hard” problem, namely that the proponents of dualism (such as Egnor) or &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/10/subjective-idealism.html"&gt;idealism&lt;/a&gt;, just assume that mental functions cannot be physically caused.  And so ultimately, all their arguments circle back to (you guessed it) mental functions cannot be physically caused.  Seriously – I don’t think I’ve ever had a debate with one of these people without circular reasoning making its customary honored guest appearance at a crucial time. Egnor follows this with a hilarious list of arguments from authority figures from Socrates, Plato and Aristotle through Galileo, Newton and Einstein, all of whom, we are supposed to believe, agreed with Egnor.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sadly, there is no monetary stipend to go with the award as Egnor imagined, but then he wouldn’t need it to buy me the copy of &lt;em&gt;The Complete Idiot&amp;#39;s Guide to Philosophy &lt;/em&gt;that he thinks I need for the simple reason that I already have a copy.  And I have read it.  And, just as with Egnor’s writing, it contains not a shred of evidence that the mind is caused by anything other than the brain.  FAIL.  Still, if he really wants to spend some money on a book that might explain some things that he is obviously confused about, I humbly suggest this one.  It’s nearly a buck more that the philosophy book, but then you get what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Dummies-Math-Science/dp/0470117737" style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="0470117737" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010537001f1d970c-800wi" title="0470117737"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Nice gesture, I think; it's a small token of appreciation that doesn't cost anyone anything. The city of &lt;a href="http://www.dispatchpolitics.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2009/01/28/copy/darwin_folo.ART_ART_01-28-09_B2_LCCNAJT.html?adsec=politics&amp;amp;sid=101"&gt;Whitehall went for it, but then something odd happened — people complained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they watered it down to declaring February a &lt;i&gt;month&lt;/i&gt; of science, and added Galileo's name to the list of honorees. OK, that's a bit craven, and their intent is transparent, but it's a reasonable compromise. Go for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that wasn't enough for the creationists. Now they want to remove Darwin's name! What a silly thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now "expert" opinion has weighed in: Ray Comfort, professional dipsydoodling dingleberry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"They're trying to deitize Darwin,"&lt;/span&gt; he said. &lt;span&gt;"This is the atheist Christmas.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;"It's a God-given right to be an atheist, but they need to lighten up and let us talk about creationism, too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray must have a one talent, the ability to open his mouth and say things so stupid that one can scarcely believe he said them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would &lt;i&gt;atheists&lt;/i&gt; want to 'deitize' &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt;? It's just not something atheists think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is to be a celebration of an important individual in &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt;: I know Ray believes science to be unchristian, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atheism is a god-given talent? Now my head is spinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not noticed any impairment of the creationists' ability to talk, and honoring Charles Darwin's birthday does not somehow silence them. They have complete liberty to preach their nonsense even on secular holidays. Now, will &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; lighten up and allow us to talk about science in their churches? I don't think so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/atheist_christmas.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/mFLPYvme1q0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233202985514"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25805659.post-4949541092828817140">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/75c9e1add3e2dda3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Is Chiropractic X-raying Illegal?</title><published>2009-01-29T02:13:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T02:13:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/01/is-chiropractic-x-raying-illegal.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>Le Canard Noir</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233202675163"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1081">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/280b4585a676e989</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Snowclones"/><title type="html">'No word for X' archive</title><published>2009-01-29T03:56:41Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T03:56:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1081" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Responding to the popularity of this morning's post on the politico-lexical economy of &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt;, here's a list of some earlier LL posts on aspects of the No Word for X meme and its rhetorical deployment:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ScienceOnline'09, the third annual science communication conference (successor to the 2007 and 2008 &lt;a href="http://scienceblogging.com"&gt;North Carolina Science Blogging Conferences&lt;/a&gt;), was another unqualified success  wifi issues notwithstanding. Around 215 scientists, educators, students, journalists and bloggers gathered for three days of activities, meals, sessions and hallway conversations to explore ways to use online tools to promote the public understanding of, and engagement in, science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Find a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Blog_and_Media_Coverage/"&gt;comprehensive listing of links&lt;/a&gt; to the many blog entries and video clips posted before, during and after the conference to learn about the conversations and networking at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Like our first two conferences, ScienceOnline'09 was a collective activity  many organizations, companies and individuals pitched in, in ways large and small, to keep this conference free, attendees fed and the discussion lively. Please join us in thanking them  read below, and click through to their websites to show your interest in what they do. (We thanked the sponsors of the second event &lt;a href="http://www.blogtogether.org/index.php/site/thank_them_the_people_behind_scienceblogging/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the first event &lt;a href="http://mistersugar.com/article/4259/conferencethankyou"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;So, a huge Thank you to our sponsors for helping us to keep this event free:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our host&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sigmaxi.org"&gt;Sigma Xi&lt;/a&gt; once again hosted the ScienceOnline'09 conference, as well as the WiSE networking event  for free  in their beautiful center. &lt;strong&gt;Meg Murphy&lt;/strong&gt; kindly facilitated this - she's the unsung hero of the conference! and Mike was on hand for tech support. Sigma Xi was founded in 1886 to honor excellence in scientific investigation and encourage a sense of companionship and cooperation among researchers in all fields of science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our institutional partner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ncmls.org/"&gt;NC Museum of Life and Science&lt;/a&gt;, which last year arranged for the awesome grab bags, this year stepped up to be our institutional partner (to handle our funds). Debbie May, VP for Administration/CFO, was a delight to work with, and Troy Livingston, VP for Innovation Learning, continues to be one of our biggest boosters. The museum exists to create a place of lifelong learning where people, from young child to senior citizen, embrace science as a way of knowing about themselves, their community, and their world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our sponsors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bwfund.org/"&gt;Burroughs Wellcome Fund&lt;/a&gt; once again gave us a substantial grant to support the conference. Russ Campbell, communications officer, helped to make sure this funding was available to us. &lt;span&gt;BWF&lt;/span&gt;und is an independent private foundation dedicated to advancing the biomedical sciences by supporting research and other scientific and educational activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncbiotech.org/"&gt;The North Carolina Biotechnology Center&lt;/a&gt; repeated its support with a biotechnology event sponsorship grant; Ginny DeLuca and Chris Brodie there are our supporters. &lt;span&gt;NCB&lt;/span&gt;iotech seeks to provide longterm economic and societal benefits to North Carolina by supporting biotechnology research, business and education statewide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;We used the grants from &lt;span&gt;BWF&lt;/span&gt;und and &lt;span&gt;NCB&lt;/span&gt;iotech to give small travel stipends to our many session discussion leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jmp.com/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JMP&lt;/span&gt; Software&lt;/a&gt;, for the third year in a row, provided a cash grant to help pay for our delicious lunch. &lt;span&gt;JMP&lt;/span&gt; is a division of &lt;span&gt;SAS&lt;/span&gt;, the leader in business intelligence and analytics - they've also donated a copy of their &lt;span&gt;JMP&lt;/span&gt; 8 software (worth $1500), which we'll have as a drawing prize on Saturday (you need to fill the &lt;a href="http://mistersugar.wufoo.com/forms/scienceonline09-feedback/"&gt;feedback form&lt;/a&gt; to enter the drawing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceinthetriangle.org/"&gt;Science In the Triangle&lt;/a&gt; was a new sponsor this year. This site is an evolving experiment in community science journalism and scientific community organizing. If you are based here in the Triangle, think about how you might collaborate with the site to spread news of your organization or research - Anton and I are looking forward to getting involved with the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rtp.org"&gt;Research Triangle Foundation&lt;/a&gt; helped us even our accounts with a last-minute grant. The Foundation just celebrated the 50th anniversary of Research Triangle Park, and will host the &lt;span&gt;XXVI&lt;/span&gt; International Association of Science Parks World Conference June 14, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogads.com"&gt;Blogads&lt;/a&gt; has sponsored many of our BlogTogether events over the last four years, and once again Henry Copeland and his crew made a donation to this conference. They pioneered blog advertising in 2002 and trailblaze today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;We used the donations from &lt;span&gt;JMP&lt;/span&gt;, Science In the Triangle, Research Triangle Foundation and Blogads to feed everyone, with good coffee in the morning and delicious sandwiches and Mediterranean salads at lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our donors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enrico Maria Balli, Kim Gainer, Ryan Somma and Russ Campbell made personal cash donations, and David Kroll, our coorganizer, dipped into his own pocket to help make the conference unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grab bag of science swag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;span&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; provided recycled reusable bags. Other organizations, companies and individuals donated materials, including: &lt;a href="http://www.hhmi.org/bulletin/nov2008/features/revolution.html"&gt;Howard Hughes Medical Institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/"&gt;Seed Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://plos.org"&gt;Public Library of Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.copusproject.org/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;COPUS&lt;/span&gt; Year of Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/book/index.aspx?isbn=9780061340413"&gt;Harper Collins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://jmp.com"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JMP&lt;/span&gt; Software&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ncseagrant.org/"&gt;NC Sea Grant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nescent.org/index.php"&gt;National Evolutionary Synthesis Center&lt;/a&gt; and others to be named later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.counterculturecoffee.com/"&gt;Counter Culture Coffee&lt;/a&gt; invited us to attend their weekly coffee cupping. Mark Overbay, marketing communications manager, facilitated our group of 25 and gave a tour of the coffee roasting operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Afternoon lab tours were hosted by &lt;span&gt;NCCU&lt;/span&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://brite.nccu.edu/"&gt;Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; (David Kroll, director), Duke's &lt;a href="http://lemur.duke.edu/"&gt;Lemur Center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.smarthome.duke.edu/"&gt;Smart Home&lt;/a&gt; (Karl Bates arranged these), and the &lt;a href="http://www.naturalsciences.org/"&gt;NC Museum of Natural Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (Roy Campbell was host and tour leader).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish/"&gt;Rebecca Skloot&lt;/a&gt; couldn't join us last year, but with her book finally drafted and off to her publisher, she was game to come to &lt;span&gt;RTP&lt;/span&gt; this year to attend ScienceOnline'09 and keynote the &lt;a href="http://www.duke.edu/web/wise/jannetworkingevent.html"&gt;Women in Science and Engineering networking event&lt;/a&gt; Friday night at Sigma Xi. Erica Tsai, Phoebe Lee, Ana Sanchez, Amrika Deonarine and Rachel Witek put together a fantastic event, and Skloot's talk about the immortal contribution of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks"&gt;Henrietta Lacks&lt;/a&gt; to science was riveting. (Abel Pharmboy hosted a rousing wine tasting, too.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our discussion leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ScienceOnline'09 was an unconference in which all attendees were encouraged to participate and share alike; we asked 77 of them to serve as session discussion leaders, to provide their experiences or perspectives as a way to spark the session conversations. See the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Conference_Program/"&gt;conference agenda&lt;/a&gt; to find out who facilitated which session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our volunteers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.evoquelearning.com"&gt;Elle Cayabyab Gitlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/people/staff/zuckerman.shtml"&gt;Risha Zuckerman&lt;/a&gt; demanded the opportunity to spend the conference sitting at our welcome/registration table -; they were awesome! &lt;a href="http://mlsanimaldepartment.blogspot.com/"&gt;Larry Boles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sennoma.net/"&gt;Bill Hooker&lt;/a&gt; stuck around to help clean up. Lots of others helped out throughout the weekend, offering rides, organizing the swag table, keeping us on track and much more. &lt;a href="http://other95.blogspot.com/"&gt;Kevin Zelnio&lt;/a&gt; designed awesome name badges that in the end, couldn't be completed due to some technical difficulties with our printer. Thank you to you all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Food&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meals were catered or ordered from &lt;a href="http://www.fetzkocoffees.com/"&gt;Fetzko Coffees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.weaverstreetmarket.coop/"&gt;Weaver Street Market&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.saladelia.com/home/index.aspx"&gt;Saladelia Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.mediterraneandeli.com/"&gt;Mediterranean Deli&lt;/a&gt;. The Thursday Early Bird Dinner was held at &lt;a href="http://www.thetownhallgrill.com/"&gt;Town Hall Grill&lt;/a&gt;. Many local attendees brought fruit to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The organizers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, big thanks to &lt;a href="http://mistersugar.com"&gt;Anton Zuiker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig"&gt;Abel Pharmboy&lt;/a&gt; for making this all possible, by patiently putting together all the pieces of the conference throughout the entire year of planning. See you all next year!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Again, a huge 'thank you'  to all the individuals and organizations supporting our free, publicunderstandingofscience conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/thank_them_-_they_made_science.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/XsngCn7RwXo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233200215164"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_116.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b8715561f3a670c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS ONE</title><published>2009-01-29T02:17:12Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T02:17:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/thqiI2tCN0E/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_116.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_116.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=1&amp;amp;day=29&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;10 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004325" title=""&gt;Rhythmicity in Mice Selected for Extremes in Stress Reactivity: Behavioural, Endocrine and Sleep Changes Resembling Endophenotypes of Major Depression&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, including hyper- or hypo-activity of the stress hormone system, plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders such as major depression (MD). Further biological hallmarks of MD are disturbances in circadian rhythms and sleep architecture. Applying a translational approach, an animal model has recently been developed, focusing on the deviation in sensitivity to stressful encounters. This so-called 'stress reactivity' (SR) mouse model consists of three separate breeding lines selected for either high (HR), intermediate (IR), or low (LR) corticosterone increase in response to stressors. In order to contribute to the validation of the SR mouse model, our study combined the analysis of behavioural and HPA axis rhythmicity with sleep-EEG recordings in the HR/IR/LR mouse lines. We found that hyper-responsiveness to stressors was associated with psychomotor alterations (increased locomotor activity and exploration towards the end of the resting period), resembling symptoms like restlessness, sleep continuity disturbances and early awakenings that are commonly observed in melancholic depression. Additionally, HR mice also showed neuroendocrine abnormalities similar to symptoms of MD patients such as reduced amplitude of the circadian glucocorticoid rhythm and elevated trough levels. The sleep-EEG analyses, furthermore, revealed changes in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep as well as slow wave activity, indicative of reduced sleep efficacy and REM sleep disinhibition in HR mice. Thus, we could show that by selectively breeding mice for extremes in stress reactivity, clinically relevant endophenotypes of MD can be modelled. Given the importance of rhythmicity and sleep disturbances as biomarkers of MD, both animal and clinical studies on the interaction of behavioural, neuroendocrine and sleep parameters may reveal molecular pathways that ultimately lead to the discovery of new targets for antidepressant drugs tailored to match specific pathologies within MD.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003675" title=""&gt;Opposite Effects of Early Maternal Deprivation on Neurogenesis in Male versus Female Rats&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Major depression is more prevalent in women than in men. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood, but recent data shows that hippocampal volume reductions in depressed women occur only when depression is preceded by an early life stressor. This underlines the potential importance of early life stress, at least in women, for the vulnerability to develop depression. Perinatal stress exposure in rodents affects critical periods of brain development that persistently alter structural, emotional and neuroendocrine parameters in adult offspring. Moreover, stress inhibits adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a form of structural plasticity that has been implicated a.o. in antidepressant action and is highly abundant early postnatally. We here tested the hypothesis that early life stress differentially affects hippocampal structural plasticity in female versus male offspring. We show that 24 h of maternal deprivation (MD) at PND3 affects hippocampal structural plasticity at PND21 in a sex-dependent manner. Neurogenesis was significantly increased in male but decreased in female offspring after MD. Since no other structural changes were found in granule cell layer volume, newborn cell survival or proliferation rate, astrocyte number or gliogenesis, this indicates that MD elicits specific changes in subsets of differentiating cells and differentially affects immature neurons. The MD induced sex-specific effects on neurogenesis cannot be explained by differences in maternal care. Our data shows that early environment has a critical influence on establishing sex differences in neural plasticity and supports the concept that the setpoint for neurogenesis may be determined during perinatal life. It is tempting to speculate that a reduced level of neurogenesis, secondary to early stress exposure, may contribute to maladaptation of the HPA axis and possibly to the increased vulnerability of women to stress-related disorders.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004288" title=""&gt;Crohn's Disease and Early Exposure to Domestic Refrigeration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Environmental risk factors playing a causative role in Crohn's Disease (CD) remain largely unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that refrigerated food could be involved in disease development. We thus conducted a pilot case control study to explore the association of CD with the exposure to domestic refrigeration in childhood. Using a standard questionnaire we interviewed 199 CD cases and 207 age-matched patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as controls. Cases and controls were followed by the same gastroenterologists of tertiary referral clinics in Tehran, Iran. The questionnaire focused on the date of the first acquisition of home refrigerator and freezer. Data were analysed by a multivariate logistic model. The current age was in average 34 years in CD cases and the percentage of females in the case and control groups were respectively 48.3% and 63.7%. Patients were exposed earlier than controls to the refrigerator (X2 = 9.9, df = 3, P = 0.04) and refrigerator exposure at birth was found to be a risk factor for CD (OR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.01-4.29), P = 0.05). Comparable results were obtained looking for the exposure to freezer at home. Finally, among the other recorded items reflecting the hygiene and comfort at home, we also found personal television, car and washing machine associated with CD. This study supports the opinion that CD is associated with exposure to domestic refrigeration, among other household factors, during childhood.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_116.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/thqiI2tCN0E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233199078680"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-4183853648838982538">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7dd811581a908de5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="News" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Dr. Michael Majerus (1954 - 2009)</title><published>2009-01-29T01:04:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T01:11:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/t0Z76zf2OUg/dr-michael-majerus-1954-2009.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=4183853648838982538" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/01/dr-michael-majerus-1954-2009.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">It is with deep regret that I follow &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/mike-majerus-pa.html#comment-177915"&gt;Nick Matzke&lt;/a&gt; in announcing that Dr. Michael Majerus, an expert on industrial melanism and champion of the peppered moth as a prominent example of natural selection in the wild, &lt;a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/About/News/mikespage.html"&gt;has passed away&lt;/a&gt; after a short illness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Majerus was a professor at &lt;a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/majerus.htm"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, and was a dedicated researcher and teacher.

&lt;p&gt;The results were predictable. The UK media fell over themselves to report on the MMR vaccine causing autism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield's new hypothesis was that after the MMR was injected, it went to their gut and caused gastric problems - a condition he called "autistic enterocolitis" - after that it travelled to the brain where it caused or triggered autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He based this hypothesis on his 1998 study which looked at 12 autistic kids and in 8 of them alleged a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he did was send his gut samples off to a lab called Unigentics run by John O'Leary who used a technique called PCR to examine Wakefield's samples and said that it showed the children's symptoms were caused by the MMR because the PCR technique showed there was vaccine strain measles virus in the gut samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine years later in 2007, the Autism Omnibus hearings are taking place in the US. These are legal hearings wherein parents who thought their children were made autistic by vaccines grouped together to sue the US government and vaccine manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two people made very strong impressions on how weak the MMR hypothesis was. The first was Stephen Bustin. The second was Nick Chadwick who actually worked under Wakefield when he wrote his '98 paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Stephen Bustin is the world's foremost PCR expert. Bustin uses PCR every day in his work, he has 14 papers in the peer reviewed literature on PCR and is the author of the "A to Z of Quantitative PCR" which is considered "the bible" of PCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bustin examined Unigentics in great detail and found that the lab made a fairly basic error of science when looking at Wakefield's samples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now, these are from samples that should have been discarded according to the SOP from Unigenetics because there was no GAPDH present, i.e., the RNA is degraded. Now, if this is degraded RNA yet I'm getting the same Cts for my F-gene target this can't be RNA because it would have been degraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's what the GAPDH showed me. Now, if it isn't RNA it has to be DNA. If it is DNA it can't be measles virus it has to be a contaminant."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the samples Wakefield provided to Unigentics were useless because Unigenetics own documented lab procedure says they were. But they used them anyway. The results were a bombshell. Using O'Leary's procedure the results cannot actually be RNA. If its not RNA then it must be DNA and if its DNA then it can't be measles virus because measles virus doesn't exist as DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Unigentics lab detected in Wakefield's samples were contaminants. There's no way that Unigentics could possibly have been detecting measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was backed up by Chadwick who checked Wakefield's work (at his request). He also did a PCR test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What results did you receive from the gut biopsy materials for measles RNA?&lt;br&gt;
A. They were all negative.&lt;br&gt;
Q. They were always negative?&lt;br&gt;
A. Yes. There were a few cases of false positive results, which I used a method to see whether they were real positive results or false positive, and in every case they turned out to be false positive results. Essentially all the samples tested were negative.&lt;br&gt;
Q. Did you inform Dr. Wakefield of the negative results?&lt;br&gt;
A. Yes. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not only are the samples Wakefield provided useless, the testing he asked Chadwick to perform showed they were useless. He knew this. And yet he went ahead anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its also worth noting that every subsequent piece of MMR science (save one unpublished poster presentation) went through Unigenetics lab and went through the same process as Wakefield's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to find possible reasons for Wakefield sending material he knew was useless to a lab that screwed up we need to go back to 1997. One year before the Lancet paper implicating MMR was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In '97, a journalist called Brian Deer found out that Andrew Wakefield had filed a patent application.This application was for a rival vaccine that could potentially replace MMR. Deer alleges that if MMR could be framed as a bad guy then the NHS (and maybe the world's health services) would drop MMR and this new vaccine could step in. As the patent holder for this new vaccine, Wakefield could get very rich says Deer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, confidence in vaccines collapsed. Between the years 97/98 to 2004/05 MMR uptake dropped by 10%. In 2006 and again 2008, a child died of measles.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kev Leitch</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233189845762"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4123">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/129e2e2022e2ebab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="pepperedmoths" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="peppered moths"/><title type="html">Mike Majerus passed away</title><published>2009-01-29T00:32:18Z</published><updated>2009-01-29T01:33:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/mike-majerus-pa.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Images/portraits/majerus.jpg" alt="" style="float:left"&gt;I am shocked and very saddened to have just gotten the news that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Majerus" rel="external "&gt;Michael E. N. Majerus&lt;/a&gt;, Cambridge lepidopterist and world expert on the peppered moth and the evolution of melanism (and many other topics, e.g. ladybirds), has &lt;a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/About/News/mikespage.html" rel="external "&gt;unexpectedly died after a short illness&lt;/a&gt;.  This is very hard to understand, as he was quite young and in the midst of a very productive career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I admit that I was interested in his work mostly from evolution/creationism angle, and there is a lot more to his life and his work than that, but I want it noted that Majerus on many occasions went out of his way to not just do good science but to help improve the public understanding of science and evolution.  For example, he communicated helpfully with several of us on PT who wrote on the peppered moth issue, he wrote and talked for scientists, educators, and the public on the issue, including &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/peppered-moths.html" rel=""&gt;this great radio interview&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/h7n4r6h026q1u6hk/fulltext.html" rel="external "&gt;this just-published piece&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Evolution: Education, and Outreach&lt;/em&gt;, “&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12052-008-0107-y" rel="external "&gt;Industrial Melanism in the Peppered Moth, &lt;em&gt;Biston betularia&lt;/em&gt;: An Excellent Teaching Example of Darwinian Evolution in Action&lt;/a&gt;.”  &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:pandasthumb.org+majerus&amp;amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS239US239" rel="external "&gt;Google PT on Majerus&lt;/a&gt; for many other discussions.  Finally, Majerus maintained an amazing sense of composure in the face of what was a pretty ridiculous set of attacks on the peppered moth example from the media and creationists (which resulted, I am convinced, in the peppered moth getting inappropriately dropped from several textbooks).  Instead of getting mad and indignant, which would have been perfectly appropriate and understandable responses, Majerus went back to the field and gathered more data, tested the mainstream hypothesis again, and even &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/peppered-moths.html" rel=""&gt;changed the mind of some of his scientific critics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published online: 6 December 2008&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract  The case of industrial melanism in the peppered moth has been used as a teaching example of Darwinian natural selection in action for half a century. However, over the last decade, this case has come under attack from those who oppose Darwinian evolution. Here, the main elements of the case are outlined and the reasons that the peppered moth case became the most cited example of Darwinian evolution in action are described. Four categories of criticism of the case are then evaluated. Criticisms of experimental work in the 1950s that centered on lack of knowledge of the behavior and ecology of the moth, poor experimental procedure, or artificiality in experiments have been addressed in subsequent work. Some criticisms of the work are shown to be the result of lack of understanding of evolutionary genetics and ecological entomology on the part of the critics. Accusations of data fudging and scientific fraud in the case are found to be vacuous. The conclusion from this analysis of criticisms of the case is that industrial melanism in the peppered moth is still one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action and that it should be taught as such in biology classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keywords  Industrial melanism - Bird predation - Evolution in action - Natural selection - Genetic polymorphism - Peppered moth -  &lt;em&gt;Biston betularia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another recent article from Majerus, which rebutted the pretty clueless speculations by Judith Hooper and Jonathan Wells that the fact that bats eat many moths somehow invalidated the idea that differential predation by birds caused the change in peppered moth color from light to dark and back again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Majerus MEN. Non-morph specific predation of peppered moths (Biston betularia) by bats. Ecol Entomol. &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120122275/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;amp;SRETRY=0" rel="external "&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/[…]amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/a&gt;, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Majerus’s &lt;em&gt;E:EO&lt;/em&gt; article and various other sources mention his seven-year experiment re-doing Kettlewell’s predation experiments, which, to the dismay and ignorant denial of IDists/creationists, have re-validated Kettlewell’s initial conclusion, and Majerus’s consistent opinion, that bird predation was the cause of change of color in peppered moths.  To my knowledge, the actual paper describing Majerus’s experiment has not yet been published.  I assumed it was due out any time, likely in some special Darwin issue of some journal this year.  But if anyone in Majerus’s circle is reading, and the article is not already in press, please make absolutely sure it and his data get published.  His experiment was essentially the last, best chance to re-do the experiment in England, as melanic moths are now almost gone (as predicted, and expected by the bird predation hypothesis).  From Majerus’s &lt;em&gt;E:EO&lt;/em&gt; article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this experiment showed that the frequency of &lt;em&gt;carbonaria&lt;/em&gt; declined from 12% of the &lt;em&gt;carbonaria&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;typica&lt;/em&gt; population in 2001 to just over 1% in 2007. This is equivalent to a mean selection coefficient of 0.29 against &lt;em&gt;carbonaria&lt;/em&gt; over this period. In the predation experiment, proportionately more &lt;em&gt;carbonaria&lt;/em&gt; were eaten than &lt;em&gt;typica&lt;/em&gt;, the difference being equivalent to a selection coefficient of 0.22 against the black form. The difference between these selection coefficients is not statistically significant. The conclusion from this experiment is that differential bird predation of the forms is sufficient to explain the changes in the frequencies of the forms in Cambridge between 2001 and 2007 (Majerus 2007). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Majerus, and the &lt;em&gt;carbonaria&lt;/em&gt; form of the peppered moth, have left the scene at about the same time.  Although not an adequate tribute to a man’s life and his work, it will be a significant and appropriate partial legacy if Majerus’s work results in the return of the peppered moths to the introductory textbooks of thousands of young biologists.&lt;/p&gt;

I suppose it’s only to be expected, since it is repeated so often and by so many people. And clearly, there &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been an increase - a &lt;em&gt;steady &lt;/em&gt;increase - in the number of children reported as “autistic” by educational  sources and social service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; epidemic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a serious question because, if the rise in autism prevalence is &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;, then we need to find out &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;? Likewise, if the “autism epidemic” is an artifact of changes in awareness, diagnostic criteria, social implications, etc., then we should stop expending time, effort and - most of all - &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; trying to find the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a graph - similar to many that you may find all over the Internet - of the autism prevalence reported from 1993 (the first year “autism” was a mandated IDEA category) to 2007 (the last year USDE data is available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:160px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/aut_prev1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="aut_prev1" src="http://photoninthedarkness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/aut_prev1-150x150.jpg" alt="Autism prevalence 1993 - 2007 (from USDE data) - click on image to enlarge" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism prevalence 1993 - 2007 (from USDE data) - click on image to enlarge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the rise in autism - at least the USDE definition of “autism” - has been spectacular and continuous. There appears to be no slackening in the rise, no plateau in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is this an &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt; view of autism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another graph. This one shows both autism and mental retardation prevalence - as reported to the USDE - over the period 1993 to 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:160px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/autism_and_mr_cht.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="autism_and_mr_cht" src="http://photoninthedarkness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/autism_and_mr_cht-150x150.jpg" alt="Autism and Mental Retardation prevalence 1993 - 2007 (from USDE data) - click on image to enlarge" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism and Mental Retardation prevalence 1993 - 2007 (from USDE data) - click on image to enlarge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that struck &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; about this graph is that autism doesn’t look so “scary”. The second is that the rise in autism coincides with a decline in mental retardation. More about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third graph shows autism and mental retardation along with all children served under the IDEA. I have not changed the autism numbers a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:160px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/all_cht.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="all_cht" src="http://photoninthedarkness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/all_cht-150x150.jpg" alt="Prevalence of Autism, Mental Retardation and All Disabilities 1993 - 2007 (from USDE data) - click on image to enlarge" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevalence of Autism, Mental Retardation and All Disabilities 1993 - 2007 (from USDE data) - click on image to enlarge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, autism is not as significant a part of the total IDEA “picture” as some might imagine. You will note that over 10% of all US children are served under the IDEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next graph (number four), I have &lt;em&gt;normalized&lt;/em&gt; the prevalence of autism and mental retardation by dividing the number of children in those categories by the &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; number of children served under the IDEA that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for doing this is that the proportion of children classified under one or more IDEA disability categories has shown a slow but steady rise over the years. The possible reasons for this are many, but removing it by normalizing to the total number of children served under the IDEA eliminates one source of artificial (or &lt;em&gt;administrative&lt;/em&gt;) drift in disability prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:160px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/aut_mr_proportional.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="aut_mr_proportional" src="http://photoninthedarkness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/aut_mr_proportional-150x150.jpg" alt="Autism and Mental Retardation as a percent of All Disabilities (from USDE data) - click on image to enlarge" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism and Mental Retardation as a percent of All Disabilities (from USDE data) - click on image to enlarge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the prevalence of autism has shown a rise that rather closely parallels the decline in mental retardation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, a number of people supporting the “autism epidemic” hypothesis have derisively asked those who question the “epidemic” where the “hidden hordes” of adult autistic people are. Their argument being that if autism prevalence weren’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; rising, we should expect to find larger numbers of adults - even the elderly - with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have found the “hidden horde”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final graph (number five), I’ve added the autism and mental retardation prevalence and normalized to the total number of children served under the IDEA. This will more readily show how closely the decline in mental retardation is paralleled by the rise in autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:160px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/all_proportional.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="all_proportional" src="http://photoninthedarkness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/all_proportional-150x150.jpg" alt="Autism and Mental Retardation as a percentage of All Disabilities (from USDE data) - click on image to enlarge" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism and Mental Retardation as a percentage of All Disabilities (from USDE data) - click on image to enlarge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the rise in autism is almost exactly&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;paralleled by the decline in mental retardation (slope = 0.017, r = 0.999), indicating that the total prevalence of autism and mental retardation - as a fraction of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; children served under the IDEA - has not changed significantly since 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the rise in autism is simply a shift away from “diagnosing” children with mental retardation? Unfortunately, these data can’t make that determination - all they can show is that the “epidemic” rise in autism has been accompanied by an…. what would you call an &lt;em&gt;inverse&lt;/em&gt; epidemic?… an &lt;em&gt;anti-&lt;/em&gt;epidemic of mental retardation. However, a number of studies - looking at different data sets [Shattuck (2006) and Coo &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; (2007) come readily to mind] have shown that diagnostic substitution is a large part of the “autism epidemic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these data show is where the “hidden horde” might have been hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I don’t expect the folks who are heavily invested in the ”autism epidemic” idea to be very happy with this information. I expect that they will cast all sorts of aspersions on me, claiming that I am a “tool” of “Big Pharma” or even that I am in the pay of a sinister conspiracy of “the government”, “Big Pharma” and the “AMA”. Maybe they’ll even throw in the Rosicrucians, for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of my presence or absence on the payrolls of “Big Pharma” (or the Illuminati), I’d be interested in hearing an alternative explanation for these data that supports the idea of an “autism epidemic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, in order to play, you have to be able to account for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the data - you can’t just ignore the parts that don’t work for you. In addition, you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; use large government/industrial conspiracies or aliens as part of your explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

so much controversy, or even outright &lt;em&gt;hatred&lt;/em&gt; as Cantor's diagonalization. The idea of comparing the sizes of different infinities - and worse, of 
actually concluding that there are different infinities, where some infinities are larger than others - drives some people absolutely crazy. As a result,
countless people bothered by this have tried to come up with all sorts
of arguments about why Cantor was wrong, and there's only one infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Today's post is another example of that. This one is sort of special. Unless I'm
very much mistaken, the author of this sent me his argument by email last year, and I
actually exchanged several messages with him, before he concluded, roughly "We'll
just have to agree to disagree." (I didn't keep the email, so I'm not certain, but it's exactly the same argument, and the authors name is vaguely familiar. If I'm wrong, I apologize.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Anyway, this author actually went ahead and wrote the argument up as a
full technical paper, and submitted it to &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4144"&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;, where you can
download it in all it's glory. I'll be honest, and admit that I'm a little bit impressed by this. The proof is still completely wrong, and the arguments that surround it range from wrong to, well, not even wrong. But at least the author has the Chutzpah to treat his work seriously, and submit it to a place where it can actually be reviewed, instead of ranting about conspiracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; For those who aren't familiar with the work of Cantor, you can read my
article on it &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/05/fun_with_set_theory_cantors_di_1.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. A short summary is that Cantor invented set theory, and then
used it to study the construction of finite and infinite sets, and their relationships with numbers. One of the very surprising conclusions was that you can compare the size of infinite sets: two sets have the same size if there's a way
to create a one-to-one mapping between their members. An infinite set A is larger
than another infinite set B if every possible mapping from members of B to members
of A will exclude &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; one member of A. Using that idea, Cantor
showed that if you try to create a mapping from the integers to the real numbers,
for any possible mapping, you can generate a real number that isn't included
in that mapping - and therefore, the set of reals is larger than the set of
integers, even though both are infinite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This really bothers people, including our intrepid author. In his introduction, he gives his motivation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Cantor's theory mentioned in fact that there were several dimensions for infinity. 
This, however, is questionable. Infinity can be thought as an absolute concept and there should not exist several dimensions for the infinite.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt; Philosophically, the idea of multiple infinities is uncomfortable. Our
intuitive notion of infinity is of an absolute, transcendent concept, and the idea of being able to differentiate - or worse, to be able to compare the sizes of different
infinities &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Of course, what &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; wrong isn't necessarily wrong. It &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; wrong that the mass of something can change depending on how fast it's moving. It seems even more wrong that looked at from different viewpoints, the same object can have &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; masses. But that doesn't change the fact that it's true.

The fall-out has been rough for the Pacific Science Center, which has lost a ton of dough.  Commonly mentioned culprits are the terrible weather during Christmas (and yeah, it was indeed awful) and poor advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with the exhibit suggests that the problem is more likely to be price.  Getting into the Pacific Science Center is already pretty spendy — $38 bucks for a family of four.  Including the Lucy exhibit &lt;del&gt;was an additional&lt;/del&gt; raises the price to $20.75 per adult, and $16.25 for kids over 6 (Sorry PSC — misread the fine print on the web site, but it’s still expensive).  So, grand total for a family trip? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 75 &lt;del&gt;Well over a hundred&lt;/del&gt; bucks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an experience where there is a 50% chance that the kids are going to get bored in 15 minutes and start begging to hit up the gift shop for mood rings and pneumatic rockets.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So paint me not surprised that people did not exactly flock to the exhibit.  Maybe if they’d made it free for kids, more of the adults would have been willing to drag them in to satisfy their own curiosity.  But spending an extra $40&lt;del&gt;74&lt;/del&gt; bucks to see Lucy when the less civilized members of the family would rather go watch the PSC’s colony of naked mole rats just doesn’t seem like a rational decision to most parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(and yeah, I know that people without kids like science too, but I’m guessing that 90% of the visitors to science centers consist of parents taking their kids to an entertaining weatherproof space where the kiddos can run around and not break stuff).&lt;/p&gt;

Back then, people cried out for better testing to ensure that products intended for children were actually &lt;b&gt;safe&lt;/b&gt; for children.  Partly in response to this outcry, a new law, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, was passed.  The intent of the law is to protect kids from harm from lead (and other substances) in children's products.  However, the effect of the law may be something else altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

These New World Order conspiracy theorists are no better than any religious nut that ignores overwhelming evidence in favor their implausible view on history. And over time, these beliefs grow to a point where they deny much of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days it usually starts with just being convinced by a bunch of random, impressive-sounding claims that there are holes in “the official story” of 9/11. Next, you become convinced that “9/11 was an inside job.” Then you find yourself inexplicably drawn to Ron Paul even know Ron Paul is against most of your far-left political beliefs and has never publicly supported any 9/11 conspiracies. Then you’re introduced to Alex Jones’ radio show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point your critical thinking skills have almost entirely atrophied, and you are now willing to believe anything the charismatic leader, Jones, and a handful of lone “whistle-blowers” tell you unquestionably without evidence while inconsistently demanding an impossible amount of evidence from the over 99% of other experts that disagree with your lone experts. By this point, you’ve been primed to view all critics who have a public voice and get news attention as part of the conspiracy and all critics that don’t have a public voice as “sheep” or “sheeple” who just believe everything “the media” tells them. This keeps you from even hearing out the criticisms, let alone legitimately consider the refutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you’ll use bravado to launch into ad hominem attacks, calling your critics the most horrible things you can think of while insisting that because they don’t agree with you that makes them a sheep who just listens to what they’re told and never questions anything and who wouldn’t even be convinced if real evidence was right in front of them. It’s at this point they quite reasonably laugh at you for projecting your own dogmatism onto them.  By this point you’ve no doubt accepted that 9/11 wasn’t an isolated conspiracy but part of the great big conspiracy that’s been going on for centuries involving the Illuminati, The Rothchilds, the Rockefellers, and of course the Merovingians because you read the fictional novel The Da Vinci Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve now saturated your Myspace page with iconography from The Matrix, V For Vendetta, and the Freemasons while peppering your ever sentence with a reference to 1984 or Alice in Wonderland. So now everything the government says is viewed as Newspeak for something far more sinister. You now believe FEMA has 500,000 upright, plastic coffins laying out in a field somewhere for everyone to see that are supposed to be for their secret plan to gas us all for no good reason and FEMA has secret prison camps that only Alex Jones and his listeners know about that’s for when the secret police start hauling off random American citizens into concentration camps for no good reason. You also believe that the government is using fluoride they openly admit to adding to tap water as a means of poisoning us all very, very, very, very slowly…even though few Americans even drink tap water, and that the government is poisoning the air with “chemtrails” as another absurdly slow means of killing people, and that the government is responsible for causing AIDS and is poisoning vaccines with “toxins” to make kids autistic because apparently they ran out of dingos to eat your baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also believe that Pearl Harbor, like what you think with 9/11, was a false flag operation, that the U.S. was in cahoots with Hitler during the Holocaust while at same time Zionists are at the center of it all, and that all of this is because, as David Icke explains, all the major world leaders are secretly shape-shifting reptiles from another planet with sinister V-like evil plans for the Earth. You also believe this ties in somehow with Biblical prophecies of the Anti-Christ and 2012 doomsday prophecies.   All the while, you don’t find it at all odd that despite “exposing” the evil conspiracy through open channels on the internet that no secret police has shown up during the night to abduct you or your family, bribe you, or silence you in anyway despite the belief that they do such things on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also, despite believing that your own government is perfectly willing to kill 3 thousand people just for shits and giggles, have not seriously considered moving to another country or made any real attempt to go off the grid where the government couldn’t find you if they really wanted to. Nor have you made any attempt to plan a strategic military operation against those you are certain are secretly committing the worst crimes in history, no attempts to kill or kidnap David Rockefeller or one of the Rothchilds, etc. Instead, you’re perfectly satisfied just trying to spread the “Truth” to those who no longer find your craziness cute and don’t have any interest in even hearing you out anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after none of this impending doom actually happens, eventually a new president with an entirely different goals and values is freely elected and then finally inaugurated into office. Now that the old administration is obviously gone you finally accept that you were completely and utterly wrong about everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOL. Just kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not. No matter how different the 2 administrations are you know that that election was a sham and that both the former president and the current president are part of the same secret society and they just go through all this trouble to fabricate an election to further perpetuate the illusion that you’re in control when really they’re still running the show no matter what. All that time the 2 figures spent slamming each other during the campaign–that’s just to keep up the illusion. Duh! So even though after years of FEMA not poisoning 500,000 people during the Bush Administration, it’s still just around the corner, even if just around the corner means long after you’re alive to have your beliefs vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;

And it’s weird: it’s an elliptical galaxy eating a spiral! They’re in the last stages of merging into one bigger and messier galaxy. Dust from the spiral forms a huge ring around the center of the galaxy, with the gas and dust from both galaxies being dumped into the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at that core is a supermassive black hole, gobbling down the matter as fast as it can… and even that’s not fast enough. The material piles up around the black hole, forming a superheated disk which helps channel all the vast forces in play around it. The end result is two corridors, twin tunnels leading up and away from the poles of the disk. Material heated to millions of degrees blasts through these paths, creating beams of matter and energy screaming out from the black hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have a front row seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-03-09.html"&gt;This new look at Cen A&lt;/a&gt; is a combination of three different telescopes in three different wavelength regimes: visible light from a 2.2 meter telescope in Chile, X-ray from the orbiting &lt;a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2002/0157/"&gt;Chandra Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, and sub-millimeter emission (basically high-energy radio; if it were on your radio dial it would be off the scale to the right) taken by APEX, a 12 meter telescope located in the high desert in Chile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composite image is false color. The visible light (shown in more or less true color) is from stars and gas in the galaxy (and foreground stars in our own galaxy). The blue is from from Chandra, showing high energy X-rays. See how the jets are blue near the center? When they erupt from near the black hole they have tremendous energy and glow in X-rays. Measurements of how the gas is behaving indicate that the gas is moving outwards from the core &lt;em&gt;at half the speed of light&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Haleakala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new bit is the orange, which is from the submillimeter emission. That comes from cooler, less violent regions. That includes the ends of the jets, and the ring of dust circling the colliding galaxies. The jets slow as they ram gas outside the galaxy, and eventually puff up and stop. As they do, they emit much longer wavelengths in the radio and submillimeter region, where the new APEX instrument is sensitive — and this is the first time this part of the jets has been seen in this wavelength. Interestingly, the rammed gas at the tip of the bottom jet is glowing in X-rays, meaning a lot of activity is still going on there — you can see the arc of the shockwave. The density of gas in that area is much larger than &amp;quot;above&amp;quot; the galaxy, which is why you can see it better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ring of dust is interesting as well. It’s easy to see in visible light, too, as a dark band blocking light from stars closer to the galaxy’s center. All that gas disturbed by the collision is forming stars at a very high rate. Those stars pour out dust, which is warmed by the starlight. Warm dust emits lots of submillimeter light, making it obvious to APEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very heart of the galaxy, as material pours into the black hole, a fierce amount of energy is emitted. That can be seen as the starlike point right smack dab in the middle. We see it in all three wavelengths, which is why it looks so bright in this image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cen A is a funny study in contrasts. Galaxy collisions on this scale aren’t common, so it’s nice to have one so close; statistically that’s rare. The collision has made a complete mess of things, so it’s good we can see it from close by; we get more details that way. But it’s so messy it’s hard to say what’s going on exactly! We have a decent idea in general, but specifics can be hard to nail down. That’s why looking at it with many different telescopes helps so much. If we only had visible light telescopes, we’d miss the jets of matter. If we had only X-rays we wouldn’t see the stars and the dust ring.

&lt;p&gt;Like in the blind men and the elephant parable, we need to take all the information we have and combine it to get, literally, a complete picture of the scene.

That may soon be changing, of course, as the proposed &lt;strong&gt;Obama&lt;/strong&gt; stimulus plan attempts to direct money toward the poorest segments of our population.

&lt;p&gt;Pity Roger Highfield, editor of &lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt;, which published an issue in which the cover was the large, bold declaration that "&lt;b&gt;DARWIN WAS WRONG&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot;. He has been target by a number of big name scientists who have been hammering him in a small typhoon of outraged private correspondence (I&amp;#39;ve been part of it) that his cover was a misdirected and entirely inappropriate piece of sensationalism. We&amp;#39;re already seeing that cover abused by creationists who see it as a tool — a reputable popular science journal has declared Darwin to be wrong, therefore, once again, science must be in retreat! — and I expect we&amp;#39;re going to have to face the headache of many school board meetings where that cover is flaunted as evidence that students ought to be taught about how weak Darwinism is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was a mistake on &lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt;'s part. They could have published a cover that announced "DARWIN IS DEAD!", which would be just as true and just as misleading, and would also bring nothing but joy to the ignorant. I don't think it would really help sell magazines, even; I suspect that most creationists are going to only use that cover to flog their cause, and never read any deeper than the widely available cover image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you should read the inside. It sends a different message. Roger Highfield encouraged me to distribute the &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126923.000-editorial-uprooting-darwins-tree.html"&gt;editorial that accompanied the article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"THERE is nothing new to be discovered in physics." So said Lord Kelvin in 1900, shortly before the intellectual firestorm ignited by relativity and quantum mechanics proved him comprehensively wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If anyone now thinks that biology is sorted, they are going to be proved wrong too. The more that genomics, bioinformatics and many other newer disciplines reveal about life, the more obvious it becomes that our present understanding is not up to the job. We now gaze on a biological world of mind-boggling complexity that exposes the shortcomings of familiar, tidy concepts such as species, gene and organism.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A particularly pertinent example is provided in this week's cover story - the uprooting of the tree of life which Darwin used as an organising principle and which has been a central tenet of biology ever since (see "Axing Darwin's tree"). Most biologists now accept that the tree is not a fact of nature - it is something we impose on nature in an attempt to make the task of understanding it more tractable. Other important bits of biology - notably development, ageing and sex - are similarly turning out to be much more involved than we ever imagined. As evolutionary biologist Michael Rose at the University of California, Irvine, told us: "The complexity of biology is comparable to quantum mechanics."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biology has been here before. Although Darwin himself, with the help of Alfred Russel Wallace, triggered a revolution in the mid-1800s, there was a second revolution in the 1930s and 1940s when Ronald Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane, Sewall Wright and others incorporated Mendelian genetics and placed evolution on a firm mathematical foundation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth, we await a third revolution that will see biology changed and strengthened. None of this should give succour to creationists, whose blinkered universe is doubtless already buzzing with the news that "New Scientist has announced Darwin was wrong". Expect to find excerpts ripped out of context and presented as evidence that biologists are deserting the theory of evolution en masse. They are not.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nor will the new work do anything to diminish the standing of Darwin himself. When it came to gravitation and the laws of motion, Isaac Newton didn't see the whole picture either, but he remains one of science's giants. In the same way, Darwin's ideas will prove influential for decades to come.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So here's to the impending revolution in biology. Come Darwin's 300th anniversary there will be even more to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover is going to cause us some headaches, but just be prepared with that bit of text — I think even just the paragraph I&amp;#39;ve highlighted will be sufficient — and when a creationists sticks those 3 words in your face, just ask them to stretch their reading abilities a little bit further and read those 72 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's going to be hard, though. Most creationists can't read that many big words strung together all at once without twisting them, either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/new_scientist_says_darwin_was.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/qxH785TRIuc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233170181300"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/01/28/take-that-quarks/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1ff82637ae8a0b8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><category term="gomez's hamburger"/><title type="html">Take that, quarks!</title><published>2009-01-28T18:58:13Z</published><updated>2009-01-28T18:58:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/01/28/take-that-quarks/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Physicists usually get the props/scorn for crazy names, but &lt;a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0901.4256"&gt;astro-ph&lt;/a&gt; today reminded me that astronomers can frequently pull out names that shame even the kookiest bits of physics nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I present to you “Gomez’s Hamburger”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="100%" src="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/hamburger_hst.jpg" alt="Gomez&amp;#39;s Hamburger"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomez’s Hamburger is (as you may have guessed), not actually a gigantic threat to vegetarianism across the Galaxy, but instead is a “protoplanetary disk” seen edge-on.  Stars usually form in molecular clouds from dense cores of gas and dust.  Some of the higher angular momentum gas and dust, however, winds up not on the star itself, but in a rotating disk &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the star.  Some fraction of the material in the disk eventually winds up building a planetary system.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img align="left" width="40%" src="http://www.stsci.edu/stsci/meetings/shst2/img4471.gif" alt="proplyds"&gt;  The picture at left shows some of the these disks seen in silhouette against the glow of the Orion nebula.  Gomez’s Hamburger is what you get when one of these disks is seen perfectly edge-on.  The dust in the disk blocks the light from the newly formed star in its center, making the burger, while light reflected from the upper layers of the disk is less shielded, and manifests as the bun.&lt;/p&gt;

It works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New parents have a Health Visitor sent out to check on the health of their baby at periodic intervals for the first few years following birth. This is not checking up on you as much as trying to make sure milestones are hit when they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point before 36 months, the Health Visitor must have sufficient concerns to make a referral to two sets of people. The first is the Local Education Authority (LEA). More on them shortly. The second is the Local Health Authority (LHA). These are the people who will assess your child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment itself lasts for up to two weeks and essentially takes the form of a per-school playgroup. There are games, arts and crafts, singalongs etc. However, these are each carefully crafted to assess the triad of differences. At various point during the two weeks, experts in particular fields (mobility, seizures, language etc) will come on for half a day to observe as the nursing staff "play" with the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these experts makes a formal report and the nursing staff make supporting observations. At that point (the end of the two weeks), the autism specialist consultant will make a diagnosis and invite the parents back to share the diagnosis with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the LEA earlier. At this point, the LHA pass their diagnosis onto the LEA who make their own assessment. The results of this are formal and are the start of what is usually a pitched battle between parent and LEA. Educational services in the UK take two  forms. Public schooling provided by the LEA. Private schooling paid for by the parents.  The LEA will push for public as it is cheapest. There is also the option to Homeschool, which we do. We do not this out of choice but necessity. There is no suitable education for our child. In fact, in the UK there are twice as many autistic school age pupils as there are autistic specialist places. That is accounting for both public and private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of recognizing autistic adults in the UK is massive. There is little to no official counting going on. Therefore LEA's find it easy to avoid creating autism support for University students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know there is little to no public housing support at a national level for autistic adults. I have approached several Housing Authorities for this piece and received no data from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, I believe that--although it is certainly flawed--the largest (and oldest) UK autism organization, the National Autistic Society, frequently and increasingly has a good and autistic friendly attitude. It pushes for adult services, it recognizes that searching for a cure is not the chief concern of most of its membership and has several autistic individuals in key positions of responsibility. In my day to day life as I meet people curious about autism it is rare to meet people who are completely without a recognition that "nothing about us without us" is a good idea for autism. Most people recognize that it should not be necessary to change someone in order to make them accommodate. The UK is traditionally a nation of individuals and we respect idiosyncrasy and individuality. I believe this leads to a tolerant and patient attitude in most.  But far from all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the biggest challenge (I believe) facing autistic people is two-fold. Firstly, there is currently a lack of political will to recognize that education and support for autistic people is not good enough. For kids it is patchy and sporadic and the quality depends almost entirely on where you live. For adults it is almost non-existent.  Secondly is the need for quality science based research to establish once and for all the true autistic population of each county and the country as a whole. Only until this is known can we start to plan and supply the key services and support networks that autistic people may require.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kev Leitch</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233168166295"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/international_perspectives_on_autism_series">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/72d009eae7faf1ea</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">International Perspectives on Autism Series</title><published>2009-01-28T18:37:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-28T18:37:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/international_perspectives_on_autism_series" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2259/1540997910_dd04a385ae_m.jpg" alt="part of a globe of the earth with a political map" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;After an utterly United-States-O-Centric series of posts last week due to the inauguration, this week we're happy to start an ongoing (shooting for weekly) series of International Perspectives on Autism.  &lt;/p&gt;

We've asked our guests to first write about some common topics like diagnosis, education, employment, and advocacy.  Then to write about anything related to autism at all from the perspective of their country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the regular team of Kristina and Dora, our international guests will be an equal mix of parents of children on the spectrum and adults on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233168120024"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/new_microbiology_aggregator.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c43618d085a8f6ee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Microorganisms"/><title type="html">New microbiology aggregator</title><published>2009-01-28T18:04:43Z</published><updated>2009-01-28T18:04:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/iz6nFpTk68k/new_microbiology_aggregator.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/new_microbiology_aggregator.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://moj-blog.org/microbiology/" title=""&gt;New microbiology aggregator&lt;/a&gt; just went live in Belgrade, built (as always) by Vedran Vucic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/new_microbiology_aggregator.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/iz6nFpTk68k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233168120024"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/tear_down_this_myth.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/517aae095276f2f9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">Tear Down This Myth</title><published>2009-01-28T17:32:18Z</published><updated>2009-01-28T17:32:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/mAOsrSvEXDc/tear_down_this_myth.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/tear_down_this_myth.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tear Down This Myth.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Tear%20Down%20This%20Myth.jpg" width="159" height="240" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Will Bunch of &lt;a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/" title=""&gt;Attytood&lt;/a&gt; recently published an interesting and important book - &lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/141659762X/scienceandpol-20"&gt;Tear Down This Myth: How the Reagan Legacy Has Distorted Our Politics and Haunts Our Future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his blog, Will &lt;a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Why_Reagan_still_matters_A_sneak_peak_at_Tear_Down_This_Myth.html" title=""&gt;provides an excerpt&lt;/a&gt; and commentary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Twenty years gone - but Reagan still matters. About this time one year ago, unceasing Reagan idolatry hijacked the race for the White House. Sometimes it was voiced in the name of policies on immigration or toward Iran that were the exact opposite of what really happened a generation ago. The power of this political fantasy - expressed mainly, of course, on the GOP side but occasionally even spilling over to the Democrats - caused me to begin work on a book about the Ronald Reagan myth. The result - &amp;quot;Tear Down This Myth: How the Reagan Legacy Has Distorted Our Politics and Haunts Our Future&amp;quot; - is coming out now from Simon &amp;amp; Schuster&amp;#39;s Free Press.

&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK - but you may ask whether the Reagan myth matters as much now that George W. Bush is back at the ranch and President Obama in the White House. I would argue that it does. Increasingly, the GOP minority in Washington, including 41 senators with just enough votes to derail the administration's proposals, is going to invoke the Reagan myth to continue to justify a tax system that harms the middle class and policies that ignore the scientific consensus on climate change. Look at the first major policy debate of the Obama presidency, over the proposed $825 billion economic stimulus. Democrats are under enormous political pressure to weight the plan toward tax cuts, and away from spending programs, which Republicans quickly branded as much pork - despite evidence that jobs programs stimulate the economy at twice the rate of tax reductions. "I remain concerned about wasteful spending that might be attached to the tax relief," House GOP leader John Boehner said - and right-wing talk radio was a lot less restrained. Ironically, the spending sought by the Democrats seek to undo the crumbling of America's infrastructure and the failure to create "green-collar" jobs that dates back to the Reagan era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And here's another reason the Reagan myth still matters, and that's because there's a pundit class inside the Beltway that cuts its teeth in the 1980s and remains firmly convinced that America is a "center-right" nation, despite massive evidence to the contrary. These pundits will urge Obama to enact an economic recovery package in the Gipper's image, ignoring the long-term harmed caused by Reagan's brand of "trickle-down economics.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless we don't let them - and tear down this myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that distance the star, slightly less massive and cooler than our own Sun, would gently heat the planet, giving it an almost Earthlike temperature. And during the days and weeks it spends out there, the planet cools. But it’s not enough. It’s &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet has pulled away as far from the star as it can, but gravity cannot be denied. Slowly, inexorably, it begins the long fall back. Growing ever-larger as the planet draws ever-nearer, the star swells hugely. Just 55 days after reaching its farthest distance from the star, the planet drops hellishly close to the star’s surface, and a furnace blast of heat bears down on it. The planet’s atmosphere roils and churns, reaching temperatures hot enough to melt copper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerated by the star’s gravity to a speed hundreds of times faster than a rifle bullet, the planet whips around the star and begins the long climb back. It will cool down as it puts over 100 million kilometers between itself and the fierce light of the star… but the cycle will repeat itself, and the planet will burn once again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="50%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.2106v1"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/01/hd80606b_orbit.jpg" alt="orbit diagram of HD 80606b"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The orbit of HD 806060b. The small &lt;br&gt;circles represent 1 hour intervals, &lt;br&gt;the four positions separated &lt;br&gt;by 19 hours each.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the life of HD 80606b, a gas giant planet four times the mass of Jupiter that orbits a star 190 light years from Earth. The planet’s orbit is incredibly elliptical, with a whopping &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/04/does-this-perihelion-make-my-sun-look-fat/"&gt;eccentricity value&lt;/a&gt; of 0.927 — meaning the orbit is elongated like a rubber band being fought over by jealous children. It’s posited that gravitational interaction over time with a distant binary stellar companion to the star may have forced the orbit into this shape; it peaks at a distance of 125 million kilometers (75 million miles) from the star, but the planet’s 111 day orbit drops it to a mere &lt;em&gt;4 million kilometers&lt;/em&gt; (2.4 million miles) from the star’s surface. In the 55 days it takes to drop, it sees the disc of the star swell to 30 times its previous size, flooding the planet with nearly &lt;em&gt;800 times&lt;/em&gt; the amount of heat it felt at greatest distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the close approach in late November, 2007, astronomers used the Spitzer Space Telescope to observe the planet. They couldn’t resolve the planet; in fact they couldn’t even see it at all. All they could detect was the slight increase in infrared light emitted by the warming planet adding to the star’s light; a tiny fraction to be sure, but detectable by Spitzer. In just six hours, the planet’s upper atmosphere heated from about 500 C &lt;strong&gt;to over 1200 C&lt;/strong&gt; (980 to 2,240 degrees Fahrenheit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.2106v1"&gt;Using very sophisticated computer models&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists could make an image representing what the planet’s upper atmosphere would look like after its dip into hell. The image above is a simulation, a computer model of this Icarus planet 4.4 days after closest encounter. If you had infrared eyes and hovered over the planet, it might look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue light is the day side of the planet, lit by reflected light of the star. Most of the planet we see here is facing away from the star, so it’s night. But it’s hardly dark: the red glow is actually the heat from a massive storm, blasted into life by the intense energy absorbed during the close passage. It’s almost an explosion, with supersonic winds whipping air at 5 kilometers (3 miles) per second from the day side around to the night side. The planet’s rotation causes a Coriolis effect which wraps the storm into curls as it screams away from the heat of the star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think on it: this map shows violent weather on a distant planet &lt;em&gt;we’ve never actually seen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this isn’t a real image of the planet, it represents a huge step in our understanding of these hot gas giants which orbit so close to their stars. Remember, that’s not an artist’s drawing; it’s the output of a computer model of the atmospherics of the planet. The observations using Spitzer give astronomers critical information on how much the planet is heated, and how. Armed with that information, and the ability to understand how atmospheres behave, they can generate models like these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no other planet we know of makes such an extreme path around its star, there are plenty of other planets out there to observe. And we may find another bizarre world like this one; in fact, it’s almost certain we’ll find many. We’ve only detected the presence of about 300 planets, and there must be tens or even &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder: what’s out there that will make this planet seem almost normal by comparison?&lt;/p&gt;

On their website, &lt;a href="http://site.everythingweown.org/Home_Page.html"&gt;EverythingWeOwn.org&lt;/a&gt;, the Peters note that they have an autistic son and a daughter with &lt;a href="http://www.stillsdisease.org/"&gt;Still's Disease&lt;/a&gt;, and that, by selling &amp;quot;everything,&amp;quot; they are seeking to provide &amp;quot;DAILY therapy &amp;amp; a GFCF Diet&amp;quot; for their son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, one wishes that there were a less drastic way that the Peters could provide for their children. Whatever the claims and evidence for and against the treatments and therapies they seek, the mere fact that a family feels it has to something like this (selling even their children's carseats) suggestions the desperation that people feel. And it seems that someone, or rather someones---some agency? some school district?----isn't providing what they should be, pointing to a true lack of anything like "adequate" services and supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that the "fault" lies with those "someones" necessarily: Citing the January 23rd &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/us/24liquidity.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;_r=2&amp;amp;sq=disabilities&amp;amp;st=cse&amp;amp;scp=1"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, a recent &lt;a href="http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/01/26/nonprofits-credit/1872/"&gt;Disaboom&lt;/a&gt; entry notes that agencies for those with disabilities and other nonprofits are being "caught in the credit crunch as skittish banks reduce their lines of credit or cut them off entirely at a time when the need for their services is climbing sharply." A Long Island nonprofit which assists individuals with developmental disabilities, &lt;a href="http://www.stchristopher-ottilie.org/"&gt;SCO Family of Services&lt;/a&gt;, is not sure if it can pay its employees this month. While the agency started the year with a $25 million credit line at its bank, that bank has now cut its credit line twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's only January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's getting tougher out there, and it already was tough.&lt;/p&gt;

The annoying drinker of the "vaccines cause autism" Kool Aid is &lt;a href="http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ginger Taylor&lt;/a&gt;. The medical student is Adina Cappell. The slapdown is utterly comprehensive, methodical, and ruthless, pummeling Ginger's panoply of pseudoscience, logical fallacies, defenses of Jenny McCarthy, and conspiracy mongering under a barrage of science, reason, and fact, leaving nothing but smoldering ruins of antivaccinationist misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better, it's &lt;em&gt;polite&lt;/em&gt; blog napalm; its victim can't whine about how mean Adina was to her.

And why can't scientists make a dedicated effort to clarify things whenever they give an interview?  What hope is there for clarifying the most fundamental concepts when every story seems to reinforce misconceptions?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the Discovery Channel:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2009/01/27/animal-ancestor.html"&gt;Ancestor For All Animals Identified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sperm-looking creature called monosiga is the closest living surrogate to the ancestor of all animals, according to new research that also determined animal evolution may not always follow a trajectory from simple to complex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet another find of the study, published in the latest PLoS Biology, is that Earth may have given rise to two distinct groups of animals: bilaterians -- animals with bilateral symmetry, like humans -- and non-bilaterians, which include corals, jelly fish, hydra, unusual, often poisonous, creatures known as cubozoans, and other organisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free-living, unicellular organisms called choanoflagellates, however, could be on every person's family tree, so long as it was a gigantic one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They determined that so-called "simple" and "lower" tier animals, such as corals and jellyfish, evolved in parallel to "higher" animals, like seemingly more complex insects and even humans. On the tree of life, monosiga then currently holds the root position for the latter group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please, let's try to get this right from now on.  No study reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between modern taxa tells you what the ancestor of those taxa was.  It may provide some clues, but all species being examined are derived in some ways and primitive in others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Trichoplax_mic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:302px;height:290px" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Trichoplax_mic.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Trichoplax&lt;/span&gt; is not your ancestor.&lt;br&gt;You share a common ancestor with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No biologist who knows anything about evolution would suggest that evolution "always follow[s] a trajectory from simple to complex". There is no such thing as "higher" and "lower", though this pre-evolutionary idea apparently is hard to abandon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And not every rearrangement of proposed evolutionary relationships is a revolution.  Many of the deep nodes have been enigmatic for a long time, so it's not a surprise when they move around based on improved information.  Here is how I, an evolutionary biologist, react to each new molecular phylogeny that moves animal branches around:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Neat.  I wonder if it will hold up.  It will be interesting to think about what this means in terms of major patterns."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a much better take on this new phylogeny written by someone with expertise, see &lt;a href="http://evolutionarynovelty.blogspot.com/2009/01/two-animal-nervous-systems.html"&gt;Todd Oakley's latest post&lt;/a&gt;.  If we could just get more scientists to write blogs...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Incidentally, the idea that the ancestors of animals were choanoflagellate&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;-like&lt;/span&gt; organisms dates to the 19th century.  I even parodied this well-known idea on &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/darwinyear2009/6390179"&gt;a shirt&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/darwinyear2009"&gt;Get your Darwin Year gear here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/p95sY7e_wus" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233161092826"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/explore_evolution_gets_another.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/38e69223f3eb8872</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Explore Evolution gets another drubbing</title><published>2009-01-28T14:30:44Z</published><updated>2009-01-28T14:30:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/tyyT0A0QQyI/explore_evolution_gets_another.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/explore_evolution_gets_another.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you've been following the creationist strategy lately, you know that one of their efforts is to push a new and awful textbook, &lt;i&gt;Explore Evolution&lt;/i&gt;, in conjunction with the various political bills to endorse a &amp;quot;strengths &amp;amp; weaknesses&amp;quot; theme in the public school science curriculum. &lt;i&gt;Explore Evolution&lt;/i&gt; is the type specimen for that teaching technique; it contains nothing but imaginary problems in biology presented in a dueling opinions format, with creationists writing sloppy distortions of biological ideas coupled with creationists writing laudatory explanations based on Intelligent Design creationism. The book has been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/09/a_review_of_explore_evolution.php"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; (that is, panned) before, but now we have &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/01/explore-evolution-as-creationist-nostalgia-004233"&gt;another review published in Evolution &amp;amp; Development&lt;/a&gt;. The reviewer is not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even as the Discovery Institute&amp;#39;s Stephen C. Meyer was trying to convince the Texas state board of education of his scientific bona fides, the antievolution textbook he coauthored was receiving a scathing review in a top scientific journal. Reviewing Explore Evolution for Evolution &amp;amp; Development (2009; 11 [1]: 124-125), Brian D. Metscher of the University of Vienna described it as &amp;quot;159 glossy pages of color-illustrated creationist nostalgia,&amp;quot; adding, &amp;quot;All the old favorites are here -- fossils saying no, all the Icons, flightless Ubx flies, irreducible flagella, even that irritating homology-is-circular thing. There are no new arguments, no improved understanding of evolution, just a remastered scrapbook of the old ideas patched together in a high-gloss package pre-adapted to survive the post-Dover legal environment. The whole effort would be merely pathetic if it did not actually represent a serious and insidious threat to education.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, most schoolboards will completely disregard the informed assessment of experts in the field to rely instead on the petrified dogma of their local preacher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/explore_evolution_gets_another.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tyyT0A0QQyI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233161092825"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/science_is_a_source_of_virtue.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6a9f0e0a8a4647bd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Science is a source of virtue</title><published>2009-01-28T13:56:18Z</published><updated>2009-01-28T13:56:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/s75VZMi6KJ4/science_is_a_source_of_virtue.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/science_is_a_source_of_virtue.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/science/27essa.html?_r=2&amp;amp;ref=science"&gt;essay by Dennis Overbye&lt;/a&gt; makes an important point: if you want a source for good values, look to science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is not a monument of received Truth but something that people do to look for truth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That endeavor, which has transformed the world in the last few centuries, does indeed teach values. Those values, among others, are honesty, doubt, respect for evidence, openness, accountability and tolerance and indeed hunger for opposing points of view. These are the unabashedly pragmatic working principles that guide the buzzing, testing, poking, probing, argumentative, gossiping, gadgety, joking, dreaming and tendentious cloud of activity -- the writer and biologist Lewis Thomas once likened it to an anthill -- that is slowly and thoroughly penetrating every nook and cranny of the world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nobody appeared in a cloud of smoke and taught scientists these virtues. This behavior simply evolved because it worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd broaden it a bit and use that fine phrase &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/coyne_on_the_compatibility_of.php"&gt;Jerry Coyne used&lt;/a&gt;, "secular reason", instead of the narrower term of "science", but this is exactly right. And the antithesis of that virtue is faith and dogma, which teaches deceit and self-delusion, certainty, credulity, mystery, fear and guilt, and intolerance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/science_is_a_source_of_virtue.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/s75VZMi6KJ4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233159879832"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/28/pasadena-panel-on-friday/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d29a9c4331667934</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Pasadena panel on Friday</title><published>2009-01-28T16:04:57Z</published><updated>2009-01-28T16:04:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/28/pasadena-panel-on-friday/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a friendly reminder that the public astronomy panel I am moderating, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/21/explore-cosmic-limits-with-me/"&gt;&amp;quot;The Mysteries of the Cosmos&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, is this Friday at 7:00 on the Caltech campus.

(I handed it down to Junior who is now getting a psychedelic musical education. He's into the Marbles.) But the switch of course led to a huge drop in the ease of use. Here are the steps I have to go through to get my phone to play my mp3s in random order:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlock phone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If need be, navigate to "Favourites" tab of start screen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Windows Media Player.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on "Menu".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on "Library".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select "Storage Card" from top-left menu.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on "My music".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on "Play".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the software is absolute crap at remembering where I was in a file the last time I turned it off. In fact, it doesn't even remember &lt;i&gt;which file&lt;/i&gt; I listened to! How fun is that when you're listening to &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; whose weekly show is typically 80 minutes long? It's really hard to use an inch-long scroll bar to find your place in such a long sound file.&lt;/p&gt;

In the most recent LL post on the subject ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=965"&gt;No word for integrity?&lt;/a&gt;", 12/31/2008), I asserted that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[W]hen someone makes a sociological point by saying that language L has no word for concept C, you'll rarely lose by betting that they're wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a recent assertion by Bart Wilson seems more promising — the linguistic part is supported by reference to a chapter in a recent book by an actual (and eminent) linguist, and the socio-cultural part is supported by reference to a large body of empirical research, some of which was done by Wilson himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here's Wilson ("&lt;a href="http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/01/fairs_fair.php"&gt;Fair's fair&lt;/a&gt;", The Atlantic, 1/25/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;For the past 25 years experimental economists–of which I am one–have been infatuated with a pie-splitting problem known as the Ultimatum Game. […] The Ultimatum Game is so popular because it is simple to explain and simple to run, yet its results involve one of the most complex problems of society:  what are we saying when we say something is &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot;? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Because the word [&lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt;] is so central to how markets work, I&amp;#39;ve been engaged in a somewhat dizzying struggle to understand it better, or at least clarify how economists apply it to economic behavior. […] Early in my project I turned to one of my favorite linguists, Anna Wierzbicka of Australia National University, for her insight into the meaning of the word.  Luckily for me, when I emailed her she pointed out that she had recently published a whole chapter on this very topic in her book English: Meaning and Culture .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Did you know that fair is one-to-one untranslatable into any other language–that it is distinctly Anglo in origin?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very next day, James Surowiecki came back with the obvious counter-argument ("&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/jamessurowiecki/2009/01/is-the-idea-of.html"&gt;Is the idea of fairness universal&lt;/a&gt;", The New Yorker, 1/26/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The economist Bart Wilson has an interesting post on one of the more important experiments that behavioral economists have run, the ultimatum game. The core insight that economists have gleaned from ultimatum-game experiments is that people care quite a bit about fairness, and are actually willing to turn down free money if they feel that the amount of money they’re being offered is unfair. Wilson’s post, in turn, is a meditation on what, exactly, we mean “when we say something is ‘fair’.” Starting from the assertion that the word “fair” is apparently untranslatable into any other language, Wilson goes on to argue that if this doesn’t mean that fairness is peculiar to Anglophone cultures, it at least suggests that “the concept of fairness is not necessarily ubiquitous to human cultures.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Let’s set aside the fact that the definition of “untranslatable” is itself hard to pin down, as are its implications for thinking about human feeling. (English doesn’t have a single word that means the same thing as the German schadenfreude, but no one thinks this means that Americans don’t take pleasure when others fail.) What’s more perplexing about Wilson’s argument is that the ultimatum game has been played in many different countries with similar results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Bart Wilson tried to argue back ("&lt;a href="http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/01/is_fairness_cross-cultural_or_not.php"&gt;Is fairness cross-cultural, or not?&lt;/a&gt;", 1/27/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It&amp;#39;s less interesting to me that people nearly universally offer (and accept) more than $1; the benchmark of a game-theoretic automaton is a low standard. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I think there's a lot more value to be gained in observing how mean offers vary by context.  After translating the instructions and altering the protocols to fit different cultural settings around the world, we observe that mean offers vary from 48% to 26% of the pie.  We may all have a sense of fairness, but our sense of what is fair varies pretty dramatically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;As I mention we can also change the experimental protocols for participants right here in the US and observe nearly the same variance, 44% to 28%.  The interesting question is, how do people come agree on the tacit social rules for a particular context? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, another interesting question would be, is there really any evidence to support the view that differences between languages (as opposed to other cultural differences, or more simply, differences in the way the game is set up) actually affect how people play this game? And then there&amp;#39;s the more difficult question of whether the existence of a word &amp;quot;one-for-one translatable&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; makes a critical difference. So far, I haven&amp;#39;t seen any evidence for a believable effect of language at all — but perhaps it&amp;#39;s out there. We know that &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=968"&gt;linguistic priming&lt;/a&gt; can make a moderately large difference in the behavior of bilinguals on certain sorts of psychological tests — roughly half a standard deviation, in some well-designed and controlled experiments. Is this true of the Ultimatum Game? If it is, how much of the effect can be predicted by the distribution of senses among words whose meanings are in the general area of &lt;em&gt;equitable&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt;, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pending an examination of the literature on this point, I'll turn to a couple of more mundane issues that came up in Wilson's original essay. One is peripheral, but easy to test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;If you're anything like most Americans, you probably hear or speak that word many times a day.  "It's not fair!" screams the petulant child.  "That's a fair price," claims the smooth salesman.  "I'm trying to be fair," sighs your boss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered whether Wilson's estimate of "many times a day" is accurate, so I took a quick look at some corpus frequencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Source&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; count&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Total corpus size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 "fair" in __ words&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LDC English CTS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,804&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26,151,602&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14,496&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LDC English News&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;190,063&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,559,992,056&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13,469&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Brown corpus&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;87&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,034,478&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11,891&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BNC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8,972&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11,146&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;COCA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;30,236&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12,733&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/em&gt; 1923-2006&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9,632&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10,382&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These estimates — from conversational transcripts and from various kinds of written texts — all agree that a word spelled &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; comes up about once in 10,000-15,000 words. Some of these are other uses (like "World's Fair" and "fair complexion" and "a fair amount of trouble" and "fair to poor"), and perusing a sample of the LDC conversational transcripts suggests that these amount to about a quarter of the total (24 out of a random sample of a 100, to be precise). Applying this correction, we'd get roughly one Wilson-relevant &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; per 15,000-20,000 words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a typical average apeaking rate of 150 words per minute, one &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; in 15,000 words would be one &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; per 100 minutes of talk. Given three to four hours of conversation time per day (180 to 240 minutes), which seems to be about average (though the distribution has a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of variance), this would be around 2 uses of &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; per day. Putting it all together, it seems more accurate to say that "if you're like most Americans, you probably hear or speak that word &lt;em&gt;a couple of&lt;/em&gt; times a day".  (Depending on how much and how fast you read, you'd get a few more by eye as well as by ear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other concrete issue is  Wilson's claim about the lexicographical (and socio-cultural) history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Did you know that &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; is […] distinctly Anglo in origin? And a relatively new word at that? (Late 18th century, actually–the industrial revolution apparently also vastly enhanced our capacity to complain.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence for this historical claim seems weak to me. (And as stated, I think it's at least partly false.) Wilson got it (I think) from chapter 5, "Being FAIR: Another Key Anglo Value and Its Cultural Underpinnings", in Anna Wierzbicka's book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/English-Meaning-Culture-Anna-Wierzbicka/dp/0195174755/"&gt;English: Meaning and Culture&lt;/a&gt;. Wierzbicka's argument is more subtle than Wilson's (in part simply because it's longer), but I'm still not sure that it's really true. And it's clear that Wilson's summary gets some of the facts wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wierzbicka analyzes the OED's citations for forms of &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unfair&lt;/em&gt; going back to the 9th century, and argues that "the familiar twentieth-century sense of &lt;em&gt;unfair&lt;/em&gt; (as, for example, in &lt;em&gt;unfair competition&lt;/em&gt;) emerged and spread widely only in the nineteenth century", with the earlier uses that seem similar being in fact a vaguer and more general word of condemnation. This seems to be true, but her argument about &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; struck me as much less convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the OED's entry for &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt;, the closest thing seems to be sense 4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Equitably, honestly, impartially, justly; according to rule. Also in phr. FAIR AND SQUARE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems rather close to the sense that Wilson wants, and citations for it go back to 1300:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;c1300 Havelok 224 Al was youen, faire and wel.&lt;br&gt;
1603 SHAKES. Meas. for M. III. i. 141 Heauen shield my Mother plaid my Father faire.&lt;br&gt;
1680 OTWAY Orphan II. vii, I can never think you meant me fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entry also cites "fair-dealing" back to 1711:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;1711 SHAFTESBURY Charac. (1737) I. 63 There is as much difference between one sort and another, as between fair-dealing and hypocrisy.&lt;br&gt;
1718 Freethinker No. 14. 96 A fair-dealing, honourable Merchant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wierzbicka writes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The earliest examples that sound "modern" in their use of &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; are those with the phrase &lt;em&gt;fair play&lt;/em&gt;, attested from the end of the sixteenth century onward. In fact, however, even the phrase &lt;em&gt;fair play&lt;/em&gt; is misleading as putative evidence for a pre-eighteenth-century emergence of the modern concept of 'fairness': &lt;em&gt;fair play&lt;/em&gt; had its opposite in &lt;em&gt;foul play&lt;/em&gt;, not in &lt;em&gt;unfair play&lt;/em&gt;, whereas &lt;em&gt;fair competition&lt;/em&gt; has its opposite in &lt;em&gt;unfair competition&lt;/em&gt;. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In fact, one can speculate that the notion of 'fair play' as a whole played a significant role in the emergence of the new concept of 'fair': in &lt;em&gt;fair play&lt;/em&gt;, the notion of, roughly speaking, rules was part of the meaning of the word &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;, whereas in &lt;em&gt;fair competition&lt;/em&gt; (and other comparable modern collocations), it became part of the meaning of &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; itself. To put it differently, the notion of 'fair play' appears to have become absorbed, as it were, in the meaning of 'fair' itself; the meaning of &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt;, as applied to all types of human interaction, appears to have been built on the model of 'fair play'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as a plausible line of reasoning, but I wonder whether it's entirely true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first place, the relevant sense of "fair play" seems to start about a hundred years earlier than the OED citations than Wierzbicka relies on. A bit of search on LION turns up e.g. Robert Henryson (1430-1506). "The Taill of the Wolf and the Wedder":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;2560   'Is this your bourding in ernist than?' (quod he),&lt;br&gt;
2561   'For I am verray effeirit, and on flocht;&lt;br&gt;
2562   Cum bak agane and I sall let yow se.'&lt;br&gt;
2563   Than quhar the gait wes grimmit he him brocht.&lt;br&gt;
2564   'Quhether call ye this fair play, or nocht?&lt;br&gt;
2565   To set your Maister in sa fell effray,&lt;br&gt;
2566   Quhill he ffor feiritnes hes fylit up the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or John Skelton (1460-1529) "The auncient acquaintance, madam, betwen vs twayn":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;41   Play fayre play, madame, and loke ye play clene,&lt;br&gt;
42   Or ells with gret shame your game wylbe sene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Anon, 1100-1500, "Robin Hood and the Shepherd" (apparently in modernized spelling):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;55   'Arise, arise, thou proud fellow,&lt;br&gt;
56      And thou shalt have fair play,&lt;br&gt;
57   If thou wilt yield, before thou go,&lt;br&gt;
58      That I have won the day.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are these examples earlier than Wierzbicka&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;end of the sixteenth century&amp;quot; — and certainly well before the &amp;quot;late eighteenth century&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;industrial revolution&amp;quot; times periods that Wilson cites — but they&amp;#39;re all figurative, applying the notion of &amp;quot;fair play&amp;quot; outside of a literal game-playing context. And whether or not the word &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt; was used before 1500 in this sense, outside of its collocation with &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;, Wilson's concept of fairness-with-respect-to-social-norms is clearly present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be surprised, furthermore, not to find things from the same period in French or Italian or Dutch expressing similar sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also not clear that Tudor and Elizabethan authors would have paired &amp;quot;fair play&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;foul play&amp;quot; as opposed to &amp;quot;unfair play&amp;quot; — even in other uses, Shakespeare was happy to pair &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;unfair&amp;quot; (as in Sonnet 5 &amp;quot;And that vnfaire which fairely doth excell&amp;quot;) as well as with &amp;quot;foul&amp;quot;  (as in Sonnet 137 &amp;quot;To put faire truth vpon so foule a face&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiezbicka's general argument about changes in political culture may be right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"Fair play" as a model of human interaction highlights the "procedural" character of the ethics of fairness. Arguably, the emergence of the concept of "fairness" reflects a shift away from absolute morality to "procedural (and contractual) morality," and from the gradual shift from "just" to "fair" can be seen as parallel to the shifts from &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; and also from &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt; (and also &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;) to &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt;: in all cases, there is a shift from an absolute, substantive approach to a procedural one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it would be nice to find a way to make the linguistic arguments — whether about changes across time or across space — in a more testable form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As George Wither (1588-1667) put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;VVith these Cards , I, an &lt;em&gt;After-game&lt;/em&gt; have play'd,&lt;br&gt;
But, there's one &lt;em&gt;Card&lt;/em&gt; , by shuffling, so mislaid,&lt;br&gt;
That, now my &lt;em&gt;fore-game&lt;/em&gt;'s lost; yet, if I may&lt;br&gt;
Just &lt;em&gt;Dealing&lt;/em&gt; find, &lt;em&gt;Fair Gamsters&lt;/em&gt; , and &lt;em&gt;Fair-play&lt;/em&gt; ,&lt;br&gt;
What ever happens, I no question make&lt;br&gt;
But, I at last, may thereby save my &lt;em&gt;stake&lt;/em&gt; ;&lt;br&gt;
And, when the &lt;em&gt;Sett&lt;/em&gt; is ended, win much more&lt;br&gt;
Then ere I got by &lt;em&gt;Play&lt;/em&gt; , or &lt;em&gt;Work&lt;/em&gt; before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To play the winning linguistic card in a fair game of social science, it seems to me, we need a better way to track usage across time and space in a quantitative way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233148214375"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/what_is_sciences_rightful_place.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f021a6e93abb8dc8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">What is science's rightful place?</title><published>2009-01-28T13:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-28T13:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/EUZfnO6CGxs/what_is_sciences_rightful_place.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/what_is_sciences_rightful_place.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've browsed the r&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com"&gt;edesigned front page of ScienceBlogs&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see that our benevolent ScienceBlogs Overlords at Seed Magazine have started a project that they have so humbly termed &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/rightfulplace.php"&gt;The Rightful Place Project: Reviving Science in America&lt;/a&gt;, which is described thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In his first speech as President-elect last November, Barack Obama reminded us of the promise of "a world connected by our own science and imagination." He recently stated, "promoting science isn't just about providing Resources--it's about protecting free and open inquiry... It's about listening to what our scientists have to say, even when it's inconvenient -- especially when it's inconvenient." And in his inaugural address on January 20, President Obama cemented his commitment to this ethos and culture by vowing to "restore science to its rightful place."

&lt;p&gt;At Seed Media Group, we are firmly committed to President Obama's vision and will work to make it a reality. To this end, we have launched a new initiative we're calling The Rightful Place Project. We are inviting a national discussion around the President's idea of a "rightful place" for science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this project involves, at least from a blog perspective, is answering a deceptively simple-sounding question: What is science's rightful place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can play, but, because I happen to have been part of the ScienceBlogs Collective for nearly three years now and I am nothing if not a loyal Borg--I mean ScienceBlogger--I thought I'd give it a whirl. I will admit one thing, though. I didn't answer this right away because I wasn't sure I wanted to. For one thing, any ideas for responses that I came up with sounded relentlessly pretentious. Yes, I realize that many will ask the question, " So what? Who would be able to tell the difference?" Suffice it to say that I would. Another reason I may have procrastinated is because I hate going along with the crowd (well, too much). Finally, I wasn't really sure what I could say that others hadn't already said better in the few days I dithered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, hey, this is Orac we're talking about. When dozens of bloggers write about a story before me, does that stop me? Hell, no! (Well, actually, sometimes it does.) Blogging is nothing if not a self-indulgent process, and obviously I have become the quintessential blogger. (Just look at the long, self-indulgent prelude to this post.) In any case, it takes an enormous ego to think that anyone gives a rodent's posterior about what one writes day after day, and fortunately (or unfortunately) you, my loyal readers, have rewarded that ego with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/am_i_that_oblivious_did_i_actually_win.php"&gt;awards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/this_is_really_starting_to_go_to_my_head.php"&gt;nominations for awards&lt;/a&gt;; so you're stuck with my pontifications indefinitely. Just think of the last two or three paragraphs as just one more self-indulgent (but hopefully sufficiently amusing that you haven't already stopped reading) passage that I'll edit out if I ever turn my blog into a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the answer to the great question of Life, the Universe, and Everything!

You can watch the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPBIJjqL4SY"&gt;video here&lt;/a&gt;, along with some amusing commentary by a UFO believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;edit: The Youtube video was removed, so watch &lt;a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/2345983/ufo_at_the_obama_inauguration/"&gt;this version here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first saw the video my immediate reaction was that this blurry object that flies across the screen was a bird, or perhaps an insect closer to the camera. After looking more closely, and hearing various commentary, I am convinced that these are the most likely explanations - and of the two I think it is most likely a bird.Watch the video carefully. Despite the narrators description that the object moves in a straight line, it is not moving in a straight line at all. It is moving in a sinusoidal wave, which means it is bobbing up and down slightly as it flies. This is exactly how a flapping bird moves through the air (and why I think it’s a bird and not an insect).In fact the narrator mentions that it looks as if some flapping is visible, but he dismisses this as an artifact of the camera. I disagree - I think we are seeing the blurry flapping of wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator dismisses the bird hypothesis because it would have to be too big. However, it is clear that the object moves in front of the Washington Monument, therefore setting limits on how big it could be. The problem of estimating size, distance, and speed of objects against the sky is that there is no reference for perspective - but when a flying object moves in front of a more distant object, we get some perspective. In this case we can see that the object is relatively small. It is probably the size of a large bird, like a crow. Perhaps it is even larger, like a hawk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - watch &lt;a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/2345983/ufo_at_the_obama_inauguration/"&gt;this version of the video&lt;/a&gt;. At normal speed and continuous play it looks even more like a bird. You get a better impression of wings flapping and the feel of the movement. It’s a bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video also reminds me of the whole &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amnNgXRK_vo"&gt;rod phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; - videos that allegedly show “rods” flying across the camera’s view. “Rods” are insects, close to the lens and moving fast enough that their image is blurred and spread out. The insect body becomes a rod and the fast wing flapping becomes a sinusoidal blur around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video is similarly burred into an elongated shape, although it is not moving as much relative speed as an insect close to the  lens so it is not as spread out as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video and camera artifacts are interesting in and of themselves, and it is always amusing to see people misinterpret them as mysterious or paranormal phenomena. They provide frequent fodder for sloppy news programs looking to fill a slow news day, and for dedicated UFO conspiracy theorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they give skeptics something fun to examine. I admit I am endlessly fascinated by how people can turn a bird into a mystery. The Youtube narrator is classic - searching for anomalies, dismissing obvious evidence, and failing to see the forest for the trees. That is the real interesting phenomenon here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you probably can’t. But what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do is still very cool: the folks at the Space Telescope Science Institute &lt;a href="http://youdecide.hubblesite.org/"&gt;are letting people vote on six objects for Hubble to observe&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six objects are: a star-forming nebula, two planetary nebulae, and three galaxies (one spiral, one edge-on spiral, and a pair of interacting spirals). None of them has been observed by Hubble before. Here are some low-res images of the candidates, stolen right off their website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://youdecide.hubblesite.org/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3231825017_e583455151.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blurred part is how the voting for each object is going, and that’ll change as word gets out. I won’t tell you what I think they should observe, so as not to skew the results. Feel free to discuss what you voted for and why in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pictures they use are pretty low-res, so here are better ones, not at all presented in the order I think they should place in the voting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planetary nebula &lt;a href="http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/observers/n40.html"&gt;NGC 40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Planetary nebula &lt;a href="http://www.capella-observatory.com/ImageHTMLs/PNs/NGC6072.htm"&gt;NGC 6072&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Emission nebula &lt;a href="http://www.dl-digital.com/NHAC/HAS-March-2008.html"&gt;NGC 6634&lt;/a&gt; (part of the Cat’s Paw nebula)&lt;br&gt;
Edge-on spiral &lt;a href="http://server1.wikisky.org/starview?object_type=2&amp;amp;object_id=593&amp;amp;object_name=NGC+4289&amp;amp;locale=EN"&gt;NGC 4289&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/rc3/NGC_4289_UGC_7403_VCC_449_irg_hard.jpg"&gt;here too&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
Spiral galaxy &lt;a href="http://server6.wikisky.org/starview?object_type=2&amp;amp;object_id=1358&amp;amp;object_name=NGC+5172&amp;amp;locale=EN"&gt;NGC 5172&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Interacting galaxies &lt;a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/Figures/big_arp274.jpeg"&gt;Arp 274&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is being done as part of &lt;a href="http://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/"&gt;the International Year of Astronomy’s 100 Hours of Observing project&lt;/a&gt;, and the images will be released between April 3 and 5. That’s a pretty fast turnaround time for Hubble. They must have already coded up the commands to observe each of thee six objects, and they’ll upload them to Hubble as soon as the votes are tallied. Either that, or they’re cheating and have already picked the one they like best. Sneaky astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you vote, you can enter a contest to receive one of 100 pictures of the winning object. Voting closes on March 1, so get in there and point Hubble!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233127047523"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/01/28/science-democracy/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f19db6f741d140b7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Society"/><title type="html">Science &amp;amp; democracy</title><published>2009-01-28T07:17:06Z</published><updated>2009-01-28T07:17:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/01/28/science-democracy/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dennis Overbye has a nice &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/science/27essa.html?_r=1"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; in the NYTimes. Although the right-wing will get distracted by his effusiveness for Obama, politics is most certainly not the main point of the essay. Overbye is discussing science as a model democratic society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is not a monument of received Truth but something that people do to look for truth. That endeavor, which has transformed the world in the last few centuries, does indeed teach values. Those values, among others, are honesty, doubt, respect for evidence, openness, accountability and tolerance and indeed hunger for opposing points of view. These are the unabashedly pragmatic working principles that guide the buzzing, testing, poking, probing, argumentative, gossiping, gadgety, joking, dreaming and tendentious cloud of activity — the writer and biologist Lewis Thomas once likened it to an anthill — that is slowly and thoroughly penetrating every nook and cranny of the world.&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;br&gt;
It is no coincidence that these are the same qualities that make for democracy and that they arose as a collective behavior about the same time that parliamentary democracies were appearing. If there is anything democracy requires and thrives on, it is the willingness to embrace debate and respect one another and the freedom to shun received wisdom. Science and democracy have always been twins.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article can be summed up in his line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are not practicing good science, we probably aren’t practicing good democracy. And vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very sympathetic with his point of view, and his basic message is important and timely. However, I think it is important to keep this argument in context. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/anthill.gif" title="anthill (w/ lion)"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/anthill.thumbnail.gif" alt="anthill (w/ lion)" width="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; of science certainly has a democratic feel to it. But, ultimately, science is an absolute dictatorship. Nature calls the shots. It doesn’t matter if every scientist is convinced that the Sun will rise at noon tomorrow. The Sun will most likely rise at 7:17am (at least in Aspen, where I’m presently attending a workshop on &lt;a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~rbean/Aspen/AspenCosmo.html"&gt;Understanding the Dark Sector: Dark Matter and Dark Energy&lt;/a&gt;, co-organized by esteemed fellow blogger Mark Trodden). Although science is a human practice, and can often feel like a meritocracy, at the end of the day Nature is an unyielding despot. This tension between democracy and tyranny is what makes science a truly unique and fascinating pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

pollination ecologists and other biologists who want to gain greater&lt;br&gt;
knowledge of the systematics and biology of bees. &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/da100fotos/3231141758/"&gt;&lt;img title="bee" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3445/3231141758_a004e7b09a_m.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From the course description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The   field of pollination ecology explores the reproductive biology of plants in   general, including the biotic and abiotic agents associated with pollination   and seed-set. …the 20,000 species of bees worldwide play a dominant role in the sexual   reproduction of most plant communities.&lt;br&gt;
This course will empower students   with 1) the confident use of The Bee Genera of North and Central America, 2) an appreciation for the biological diversity   of bees, and 3) sufficient background to learn more about bees and   investigate pollination and conservation problems with greater insight.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2009 course will be held at the Southwestern Research Station, Portal, Arizona, from August 31 to September 9, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

But every time I mention that I think Jesus should just come down and visit with me, I get the old Christian rebuttals, such as&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;- "that would interfere with your free will" &lt;br&gt;- "God wants us to figure it out for ourselves"&lt;br&gt;- "suffering builds character"&lt;br&gt;- "God doesn't do what you want Him too, He does what He wants and He has his reasons that we can't understand"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and a few others I can't think of right now off the top of my head. Those statements basically reduce God to chance.  It turns out that Gods interaction in our life has all the appearance of Chance.  We may as well call God "Chance" then, or just say that Gods interaction in our life is what we call "Chance".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Did God Ever Appear To Anyone?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overlooking the fact that those rebuttals ignore some relevant real world qualifiers making them eligible to be fallacies, if any of those rebuttals are true, then why did God ever appear to anyone?  If they are true now, then they should have been true back then, unless something changed.  What changed, and what bearing does it have over whether God appears to people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Look at Paul.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;He seemed to be a pretty nasty character but Jesus popped up in front of him one day and gave him a message.  Did he talk to Paul or just put it in his head?  Why would God need to talk?  He could manipulate the neurons in Pauls head so He could ensure maximum integrity of the receipt and understanding of the information.  The details are sketchy because the instances where Pauls Conversion is described don't match up, but in one version, the men that were with him heard the voice but didn't understand.  Whats up with that?  And then Ananias heard God too.  What is the point of only appearing to a few? And what is the point of only partially appearing to some while appearing to one?  To have one of them go out and convince the rest of us?  Why should I believe them over anyone else?  I can understand why the sender would use that strategy if the sender of the message had limited resources, but supposedly God commands everything, including resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;It would be easy to believe if I could hear the voice of God. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I could make a rational decision to accept it or not.  But as it stands right now, I don't have any reason to think the Bible is anything more than Folklore from an Ancient Near Eastern Culture.  All previous precedents of other Gods interacting with people have become considered "Mythology".  Why shouldn't this instance be considered Mythology?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Verifiable Evidence is like mothers milk to a belief.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Bible, God has set a precedent of appearing to people in person, and it has the effect of unambiguously fostering and nurturing their belief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; It doesn't take much to change my behavior, just ask my wife or boss.  I'm a pretty reasonable guy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just like its true that if I want to foster a belief or change the behavior of another person I should logically "do what it takes", God should logically "do what it takes" to change my behavior.  Come on God, I love my kids and parents so I call them periodically. Why don't you call me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that popularity, or the number of times an individual was named as a friend, and the likelihood that those friends know one another, were both strongly heritable. Additionally, location within the network, or the tendency to be at the center or on the edges of the group, was also genetically linked. However, the researchers were surprised to learn that the number of people named as a friend by an individual did not appear to be inherited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included national data (from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health) for the social networks of 1,110 adolescent twins, both fraternal and identical. The researchers compared the social networks of the identical twins to those of the fraternal twins, and found greater similarity between the identical twins’ social network structure than the fraternal twins’ networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be an evolutionary explanation for this genetic influence and the tendency for some people to be at the center while others are at the edges of the group, according to the researchers. If a deadly germ is spreading through a community, individuals at the edges are least likely to be exposed. However, to gain access to important information about a food source, being in the center of the group has a distinct benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But at least one figure from the American Museum of Natural History has managed to bring in the crowds, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Director of the Hayden Planetarium. Tyson was apparently giving a reading at the Union Square Barnes &amp;amp; Noble in NYC. And while I’m bummed that I didn’t know about it, it seems that I wasn’t missed as &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5139776/who-is-neil-degrasse-tyson-and-since-when-is-he-a-literary-rock-star"&gt;he spoke to a packed house&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Or, I think of a term such as "mainstream" culture, or of something being "mainstream" now that was formerly avant-garde, never-before-heard-of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when the poem "&lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15308"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/8"&gt;Allen Ginsberg&lt;/a&gt; was published in 1957, it was considered to be "obscene." Poet  &lt;a href="http://www.citylights.com/ferlinghetti/"&gt;Lawrence Ferlinghetti&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.citylights.com/"&gt;City Lights Books&lt;/a&gt;, who had published the poem, was arrested on October 3, 1957. The famous opening lines of "&lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15308"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15308"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;" was later ruled not to be obscene and, it can be argued, it has now entered the mainstream and is taught in college and high school classrooms. So the revolutionary becomes mainstream or, one might even say, domesticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it possible to say that vaccine-autism research has gone "mainstream"----has gone from being an idea cast upon the public consciousness after the 1998 announcement of a certain &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; study most of whose authors have retracted their names from it, though not Dr. Andrew Wakefield---to being "accepted"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalist David Kirby and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., write that 'tis so in the January 27th &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/autism-vaccines-and-the-c_b_161395.html"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, in a post whose title has a kind of monumental ring to it, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/autism-vaccines-and-the-c_b_161395.html"&gt;Autism, Vaccines and the CDC: The Wrong Side of History&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the evidence connecting America's autism epidemic to vaccines mounts, dead-enders at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) -- many of whom promoted the current vaccine schedule and others with strong ties to the vaccine industry -- are trying to delay the day of reckoning by creating questionable studies designed to discredit any potential vaccine-autism link and by derailing authentic studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 12, a cadre of mid-level health bureaucrats left over from the Bush administration ignored Federal requirements for advance notice in order to vote to quietly strip vaccine research studies from funding allocated by Congress in the Combating Autism Act (CAA) of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, those "mid-level health bureaucrats" are indeed a "cadre," a group of well-oiled, well-heeled  "&lt;em&gt;rogue&lt;/em&gt; bureaucrats" (my emphasis). And who might be these "rogue" types, these crafty, plotting "mid-level health," may I dare say &lt;em&gt;career&lt;/em&gt;, bureaucrats who maybe once had ideals but now are 9-to-5'ers who rush off to get to Emma's soccer game and get Chinese for dinner? Are they the CIA operatives who put a certain jungle doc into Laos in what would turn out to be the prehistory of the Vietnam War?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, sorry, kind of got carried away and recalled some things I read in the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;id=rA8cm8l7JXsC&amp;amp;dq=dr+america+james+fisher&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=m6uXJK0P19&amp;amp;sig=yd34dMksVn5D3srdR5mLSpCpLLs&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=result"&gt;biography of Dr. Tom Dooley&lt;/a&gt;. Happens when you're reading language in such metaphoric overdrive as it is in Kirby's and Kennedy's piece, in which they try to make the &lt;a href="http://iacc.hhs.gov/"&gt;Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IACC) seem like some kind of "rogue" government committee in over-denial about what, write Kirby and Kennedy, is "mainstream"---research about autism and vaccines---rather than a topic that's becoming more and more but one among many branches of autism research and, indeed, one that is---as noted in a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/new_study_on_vaccine_safety"&gt;new study published this week&lt;/a&gt;---increasingly being disproven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirby and Kennedy, though, call this study "controversial" and "poorly designed," apparently because "it could only find one child in 1400 who tested with autism"----the study is said to be "poorly designed" because one child in the study was noted to have autism, though the study was &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/2/475"&gt;not specifically about autism&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of Kirby and Kennedy's piece---which, again, seeks to argue that vaccine-autism research is "mainstream"----is an attempted blow-by-blow listing of a number of news items from the past year or two about the &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/the-case-of-hannah-poling/"&gt;case of Hannah Poling&lt;/a&gt;, autism and &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/the-subpopulation-of-mitochondrial-autism/"&gt;mitochondrial disorders&lt;/a&gt;, other studies on &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/looking-for-autisms-causes-at-home/"&gt;autism and the environment&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_curious_incident_of_the_iacc_vaccines_and_autism_speaks"&gt;recent resignation of Alison Tepper Singer&lt;/a&gt; from the top levels of the administration of &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt; over the issue of vaccine research: These are all meant as examples of how those who argue that vaccines or something in vaccines are not linked to autism (like the CDC) are on the "wrong side of history."  Kirby and Kennedy end their piece with an appeal to President Obama and his new administration to "shed light on the government's abuse and mismanagement of autism research in this country," and cite something HHS Secretary Nominee Tom Daschle said in 2002, and that Obama said at a &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/another-way-to-access-the-candidates-the-vaccine-autism-question/"&gt;campaign rally in Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; in April of 2008 as "evidence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away Kirby and Kennedy's rhetoric---all the business about "cadres" and "rogue bureaucrats" and "subterfuge" (there goes that &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/politicking-pandering-and-paranoia/"&gt;paranoia&lt;/a&gt; thing again)---and what you have are some complaints about the workings of a federal committee (never heard that before, oh yes) and mostly a list of, again, numerous new items about autism and autism research and, more specifically, autism causation, that have received varying amounts of attention in the media over the last year. Without the rhetoric and the metaphors, it's just some facts, sirs, with the word-smithing put to use to add persuasive power and to pique the emotions of a reader and stir them in a certain direction---like a good Roman orator back in the days of the Roman Republic, or of a poet (and poets in ancient Rome were trained in rhetoric, the art of speaking and eloquence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quoted a poet, the now mainstreamed Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, at the beginning of his post. I first read "&lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15308"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;" when I was in college in a course on lyric poetry and those words, with their long incantatory lines and their mystical-wild imagery, have a way of sticking in one's mind, to the point that sometimes one's writing might get a little Ginsbergerian---"Howlesque"---to get that effect of seeing those "best minds" of one's generation "destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have seen their wonderful children. I have heard them wail in pain the whole night through, bang their heads into dented closet doors, hang their inflamed and pain-wracked bellies over the sofa back in vain attempts for deliverance from the agony they cannot describe, because they can no longer speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen children with autism run out of the house naked and into the cold, black night, only to be found hours later wandering down a lonely back road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lines are from a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/recovery-from-autism-is-n_b_154921.html"&gt;January 2nd Huffington Post post&lt;/a&gt; by David Kirby, in which he seems to have confused, conflated?, &lt;a href="http://www.change.gov"&gt;Change.gov&lt;/a&gt; with this website that you are reading (i.e., &lt;a href="http://www.change.org"&gt;Change.org&lt;/a&gt;). I am mentioned in &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/recovery-from-autism-is-n_b_154921.html"&gt;that post&lt;/a&gt;, and when I first read those above-quoted lines by Kirby---complete with alliteration ("&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;onderful children" who "&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;ail in pain") and internal rhymes ("hang"/"bang"; "black night"/"back road"), I knew that I'd heard that sort of long incantatory line with the imagery of a figure running into the dark night, somewhere before: In Allen Ginsberg's "&lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15308"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;," indeed. Here's the opening lines of Ginsberg's poem again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Kirby was (unknowingly; knowingly) echoing the Beat poet to catch the sense of horror at the opening of "&lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15308"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;," also to catch some of the sense of transgressive revolution of Ginsburg's poem as it was received back in 1957, when you could get arrested for publishing a poem. For, in their &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/autism-vaccines-and-the-c_b_161395.html"&gt;Huffington Post post&lt;/a&gt;, Kirby and Kennedy seek to give the impression that they're the transgressive ones, the mavericks going against the evil IACC cadre and busting it up to show, &lt;em&gt;the truth&lt;/em&gt;----that it's accepted by most that research be done on autism and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed: &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/thimerasol-exposure-declines-autism-rates-increase/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/ethyl-mercury-is-expelled-faster-from-babies-bodies-than-thought-and-other-autism-truths-and-autism-fictions-2/"&gt;has been&lt;/a&gt;, is being done, on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, it's nothing to howl about.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you remember 1981? I do. I was as sophomore in High School, and I loved the occult. There was a little shop in Salem, MA where I grew up called Crow Haven Corner. It was run by the "Official Witch of Salem," Laurie Cabot. Yes, that Salem. I grew up near where the witches were hanged and attended Witchcraft Heights Elementary School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sold potions, amulets books, etc. It was the only shop of its kind in town, right across from the Witch House, which is the former home of Judge Jonathan Corwin, one of the judges during the witch trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward nearly 30 years, and Salem has become witch and psychic mecca.

FBI spokesperson Greg Robins reported that found in the $37.9 million dollar mansion of the famous televangelist were 3 Hefty trash bags full of $100 bills that had been used as toilet paper over the course of two months. Authorities seized the excrement-covered bills as evidence for the upcoming sentencing of pastor Kilton who pleaded guilty to all charges.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Had pastor Kilton discarded the bags before we followed up on the anonymous tip that led us to the Kilton home, we would have had no case," said Robins. "But because of what we found, the pastor will be facing destruction of legal tender charges. It's against the law to destroy money."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This is awful news," says Joan Osted, associate pastor of the 46,200-member mega-church out of Orlando, Florida. "It isn't every day that you hear about a world-renowned scholar and televangelist and personal friend of Oral Roberts and Robert Tilton accused of a crime, much less a disgusting crime like this one." Pastor Osted refused to comment further, saying: "God is with brother Kilton. He has led many souls to the Lord. God will direct him through this storm, just as he did with past investigations by the I.R.S. of fraud and tax evasion.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Kilton was eager to explain his actions: "I was out of toilet paper, so all I could think to do was to wipe my butt with the money, with the wads and wads of hundred dollar bills that cover the floor of every room in my house. It got to my head. I got wasteful and lazy, and for that I am sorry."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting noticeably emotional, the pastor continued: "This is truly a low moment in my life. I could have used that money to feed Ethiopian children who starve and die by the day while I eat and get fatter by the minute, but instead I used it to wipe my stinking rump. I am so sorry! It's just that for years I did what all televangelists do—I never shut up about the necessity of tithing and about how God, "The Great I Am," needs our hard-earned cash. I have always preached that if you send me $20, then God will anonymously send you $200. It worked too well (at least it did for me).”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pastor continued: “Everyone sent me their money, and this made me rich—filthy, rotten, stinking, irresponsible rich. I have a Ferrari Enzo and a Ferrari F40 – each of them in two different colors – and I bought another 9.3 million dollar Bugatti Veyron less than a month ago. It was much nicer than the old one I bought a few months before that—the one I wrapped around a telephone pole and suffered whiplash from. And I bought everyone in my family the new car and house of their choice. I just invested in the purchase of a 9th golf course, which I've decided to call &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Shady Acres&lt;/span&gt;. I own vacation homes in 26 of the 50 states, the shabbiest one of them costs not a penny less than $320,000, and I have a solid gold banister leading up to our fourth floor bedroom at the main mansion, draped with cougar and bear skins, with ivory and platinum bedposts. The money got to my head."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pastor did not hide but confessed the fact that half of one of the bags was full of discarded bills that were used as maxi pads by his wife and as napkins by their six kids at the dinner table. There is no word from the authorities on whether or not Dr. Kilton's wife Florence will stand to face charges with her husband.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asked what he planned to do about the charges, the pastor said: "I may get up to 6 months in jail, and I'll have to pay some very big fines to make that light of a sentence happen, but that's ok. I have plenty of money to hire the best lawyer to get myself the most lenient sentence possible, and I have done that (though my lawyer would only accept a check, and not the barrels of cash I offered him)."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Kilton was also candid about his recent bouts of a weakening faith: "What I fear is that maybe God shouldn't have given me this money. Kenneth Copeland and I have flown in each other's private jets many times, and we prayed together that God would never give us anything that would take our hearts away from him. But at times, I have my doubts on whether God answered our prayers. Maybe the atheists are right. Maybe Christians who make tax-dodging pigs like me rich are just retarded, desperate, and naive. Maybe we TV preachers are nothing but pompous, greedy windbags who blow God's money on ourselves as we prey upon the idiocy and gullibility of others. Maybe idiots like me and my friends, Jesse Duplantis, Jimmy Swaggart, Benny Hinn, and Peter Popoff just get rich at the expense of the galactically dumb. I hope they aren't right."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Support from the church has been overwhelming," said Wilma Wheaton, senior church secretary and friend of the Kilton family for 20 years. "We still love him. We still support him. And yes, we still give to him. That's what makes us Christians. Our pastor has the prayers and the utmost support of the church as he has requested. The pastor's house will be kept stocked with toilet paper weekly. That is important because what got pastor into this mess was his heading out to the church burrito cook-off competition and forgetting to have Shameka the maid go by the store for more Angelsoft. Really, it could have happened to any of us!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Kilton told us that plans were underway to forego building what would have been his 27th vacation home in the Maui to build what he will call The Chapel of Conservatism, a daily meditation hall to remind him of his wasteful lapse and to prevent any future ones. We were informed that there will be no gold or platinum in the structure. Only silver and bronze and the usual selection of rare tiger skin adornments. "But I will still need your prayers and your financial support, brethren, now more than ever." pastor added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(JH)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably goes without saying that it isn't strongly related to the quality of the actual science, nor to the clarity of the writing. Appearing in one of the top journals does help (&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, PNAS and occasionally GRL), though that in itself is no guarantee. Instead, it most often depends on the 'news' value of the bottom line. Journalists and editors like stories that surprise, that give something 'new' to the subject and are therefore likely to be interesting enough to readers to make them read past the headline. It particularly helps if a new study runs counter to some generally perceived notion (whether that is rooted in fact or not). In such cases, the 'news peg' is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was for the Steig et al "&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/01/state-of-antarctica-red-or-blue/"&gt;Antarctic warming&lt;/a&gt;" study that appeared last week. &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?oe=utf-8&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ncl=1295661799"&gt;Mainstream&lt;/a&gt; media coverage was widespread and generally did a good job of covering the essentials. The most prevalent peg was the fact that the study appeared to reverse the "Antarctic cooling" meme that has been a staple of disinformation efforts for a while now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth remembering where that idea actually came from. Back in 2001, Peter Doran and colleagues wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6871/abs/nature710.html"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; about the Dry Valleys long term ecosystem responses to climate change, in which they had a section discussing temperature trends over the previous couple of decades (not the 50 years time scale being discussed this week). The "Antarctic cooling" was in their title and (unsurprisingly) &lt;a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/yore/transcripts/transcripts_021602_science.html"&gt;dominated&lt;/a&gt; the media coverage of their paper as a counterpoint to "global warming".  (By the way, this is a great example to indicate that the biggest bias in the media is towards &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt;, not any particular side of a story). Subsequent work indicated that the polar ozone hole (starting in the early 80s) was having an effect on polar winds and temperature patterns (&lt;a href="http://www.atmos.colostate.edu/ao/ThompsonPapers/ThompsonSolomon_Science.pdf"&gt;Thompson and Solomon, 2002&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2004/Shindell_Schmidt.html"&gt;Shindell and Schmidt, 2004&lt;/a&gt;), showing clearly that regional climate changes can sometimes be decoupled from the global picture. However, even &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6895/full/418291b.html"&gt;then&lt;/a&gt; both the extent of any cooling and the &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/109924363/abstract"&gt;longer term picture&lt;/a&gt; were more difficult to discern due to the sparse nature of the observations in the continental interior. In fact we discussed this way back in one of the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=18"&gt;first posts&lt;/a&gt; on RealClimate back in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ambiguity was of course a gift to the propagandists. Thus for years the Doran et al study was &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/27/opinion/27doran.html"&gt;trotted out&lt;/a&gt; whenever global warming was being questioned. It was of course a classic 'cherry pick' - find a region or time period when there is a cooling trend and imply that this contradicts warming trends on global scales over longer time periods. Given a complex dynamic system, such periods and regions will always be found, and so as a tactic it can always be relied on. However, judging from the take-no-prisoners response to the Steig et al paper from the contrarians, this important fact seems to have been forgotten (hey guys, don't worry you'll come up with something new soon!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, some of the pushback has been hilarious. It's been a great example for showing how incoherent and opportunistic the 'antis' really are. Exhibit A is an email (and &lt;a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.Blogs&amp;amp;ContentRecord_id=fc7db6ad-802a-23ad-43d1-2651eb2297d6"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;) sent out by Senator Inhofe's press staff (i.e. &lt;a href="http://conwebwatch.tripod.com/stories/2007/morano.html"&gt;Marc Morano&lt;/a&gt;). Within this single email there are misrepresentations, untruths, unashamedly contradictory claims and a couple of absolutely classic quotes. Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dr. John Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville slams new Antarctic study for using [the] “best estimate of the continent's temperature”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he'd prefer it if they used the worst estimate? &lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; It should go without saying that this is simply Morano making up stuff and doesn't reflect Christy's actual quotes or thinking. No-one is safe from Morano's misrepresentations!]&lt;br&gt;
[&lt;strong&gt;Further update:&lt;/strong&gt; They&amp;#39;ve now clarified it. Sigh….]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morano has his ear to the ground of course, and in his blog piece dramatically highlights the words "estimated" and "deduced" as if that was some sign of nefarious purpose, rather than a fundamental component of scientific investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal contradictions are par for the course. Morano has previously been convinced  that &amp;quot;… the vast majority of Antarctica has cooled over the past 50 years.&amp;quot;, yet he now approvingly quotes Kevin Trenberth who says &amp;quot;It is hard to make data where none exist.” (It is indeed, which is why you need to combine as much data as you can find in order to produce a synthesis like this study). So which is it? If you think the data are clear enough to demonstrate strong cooling, you can&amp;#39;t also believe there is no data (on this side of the looking glass anyway). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's even more humourous, since even the more limited analysis available before this paper showed pretty much the same amount of Antarctic warming. Compare the IPCC report, with the same values from the new analysis (under various assumptions about the methodology).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/ant_temp_ipcc_3.7c.jpg" align="left" width="48%"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/steig1.jpg" align="right" width="48%" height="285"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(The different versions are the full reconstruction, a version that uses detrended satellite data for the co-variance, a version that uses AWS data instead of satelltes and one that use PCA instead of RegEM. All show positive trends over the last 50 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further contradictions abound: Morano, who clearly wants it to have been cooling, hedges his bets with a "Volcano, Not Global Warming Effects, May be Melting an Antarctic Glacier" &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass"&gt;Hail Mary pass&lt;/a&gt;. Good luck with that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always helps if you haven't actually read the study in question. That way you can just make up conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Scientist adjusts data — presto, Antarctic cooling disappears
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. It's still there (as anyone reading the paper will see) - it's just put into a larger scale and longer term context (see &lt;a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/steig/images/Ant6900.jpg"&gt;figure 3b&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate personalisation is always good fodder. Many contrarians seemed disappointed that Mike was only the fourth author (the study would have been much easier to demonise if he'd been the lead). &lt;a href="http://jennifermarohasy.com/blog/2009/01/modellers-remove-evidence-of-cooling-and-editor-removes-comment-by-climate-sceptic/"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; pretended he was anyway, and just for good measure accused him of being a 'modeller' as well (heaven forbid!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others also got in on the fun. A chap called &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/01/state-of-antarctica-red-or-blue#comment-110357"&gt;Ross Hays&lt;/a&gt; posted a letter to Eric on multiple websites and on many comment threads. On Joe D'Aleo's site, this letter was accompanied with this little bit of snark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Icecap Note: Ross shown here with Antarctica’s Mount Erebus volcano in the background was a CNN forecast Meteorologist (a student of mine when I was a professor) who has spent numerous years with boots on the ground working for NASA in Antarctica, not sitting at a computer in an ivory tower in Pennsylvania or Washington State
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is meant as a slur against academics of course, but is particularly ironic, since the authors of the paper have collectively spent over 8 seasons on the ice in Antarctica, 6 seasons in Greenland and one on Baffin Island in support of multiple ice coring and climate measurement projects.  Hays' &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/01/state-of-antarctica-red-or-blue/#comment-110392"&gt;one or two summers&lt;/a&gt; there, his personal anecdotes and &lt;a href="http://tamino.wordpress.com/2009/01/23/antarctica-warming"&gt;misreadings of the temperature record&lt;/a&gt;, don't really cut it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither do rather lame attempts to &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4332784/Despite-the-hot-air-the-Antarctic-is-not-warming-up.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; these results with the evils of "computer modelling". According to &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wiki/index.php?title=Christopher_Booker"&gt;Booker&lt;/a&gt; (for it is he!) because a data analysis uses a computer, it must be a computer model - and probably the same one that the "hockey stick"  was based on. Bad computer, bad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/01/22/antarctic-warming-part-2-a-letter-from-a-meteorologist-on-the-ground-in-antarctica/"&gt;proprietor&lt;/a&gt; of the recently named "Best Science Blog", also had a couple of choice comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In my opinion, this press release and subsequent media interviews were done for media attention.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This remarkable conclusion is followed by some conspiratorial gossip implying that a paper that was submitted over a year ago was deliberately timed to coincide with a speech in Congress from Al Gore that was announced last week. Gosh these scientists are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the critical commentary about this paper has been remarkably &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/illconsidered/2009/01/classic_pielke.php"&gt;weak&lt;/a&gt;. Time will tell of course - confirming studies from ice cores and independent analyses are already published, with more rumoured to be on their way. In the meantime, floating ice shelves in the region &lt;a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUKTRE50I4G520090119"&gt;continue to collapse&lt;/a&gt; (the Wilkins will be the tenth in the last decade or so) - each of them with their own unique volcano no doubt - and gravity measurements continue to show net ice loss over the Western part of the ice sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the loss of the Antarctic cooling meme is clearly bothering the contrarians much more than the loss of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larsen_Ice_Shelf#Larsen_A.2C_B_.26_C_sectors"&gt;10,000 year old ice&lt;/a&gt;. The poor level of their response is not surprising, but it does exemplify the tactics of the whole 'bury ones head in the sand" movement - they'd much rather make noise than actually work out what is happening. It would be nice if this demonstration of intellectual bankruptcy got some media attention itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's unlikely though. It's just not news.&lt;/p&gt;

As always, you should &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/357" title=""&gt;rate the articles&lt;/a&gt;, post &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/254" title=""&gt;notes and comments&lt;/a&gt; and send &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/261" title=""&gt;trackbacks&lt;/a&gt; when you blog about the papers.

Here are my own picks for the week (wow! two circadian papers, plus dinosaurs and honeybees and heterochrony! - what a week!) - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004252" title=""&gt;Evidence of Combat in Triceratops&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The horns and frill of Triceratops and other ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) are interpreted variously as display structures or as weapons against conspecifics and predators. Lesions (in the form of periosteal reactive bone, healing fractures, and alleged punctures) on Triceratops skulls have been used as anecdotal support of intraspecific combat similar to that in modern horned and antlered animals. If ceratopsids with different cranial morphologies used their horns in such combat, this should be reflected in the rates of lesion occurrence across the skull. We used a G-test of independence to compare incidence rates of lesions in Triceratops (which possesses two large brow horns and a smaller nasal horn) and the related ceratopsid Centrosaurus (with a large nasal horn and small brow horns), for the nasal, jugal, squamosal, and parietal bones of the skull. The two taxa differ significantly in the occurrence of lesions on the squamosal bone of the frill (P = 0.002), but not in other cranial bones (P&amp;gt;0.20). This pattern is consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure for this taxon. Lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation in this genus, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already blogged about by one of the authors, &lt;a href="http://openpaleo.blogspot.com/2009/01/triceratops-combat.html" title=""&gt;Andy Farke&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004263" title=""&gt;Number-Based Visual Generalisation in the Honeybee&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the numerical abilities of many vertebrate species have been investigated in the scientific literature, there are few convincing accounts of invertebrate numerical competence. Honeybees, Apis mellifera, by virtue of their other impressive cognitive feats, are a prime candidate for investigations of this nature. We therefore used the well-established delayed match-to-sample paradigm, to test the limits of honeybees' ability to match two visual patterns solely on the basis of the shared number of elements in the two patterns. Using a y-maze, we found that bees can not only differentiate between patterns containing two and three elements, but can also use this prior knowledge to differentiate three from four, without any additional training. However, bees trained on the two versus three task could not distinguish between higher numbers, such as four versus five, four versus six, or five versus six. Control experiments confirmed that the bees were not using cues such as the colour of the exact configuration of the visual elements, the combined area or edge length of the elements, or illusory contours formed by the elements. To our knowledge, this is the first report of number-based visual generalisation by an invertebrate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004290" title=""&gt;Circadian Control of Dendrite Morphology in the Visual System of Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the first optic neuropil (lamina) of the fly's visual system, monopolar cells L1 and L2 and glia show circadian rhythms in morphological plasticity. They change their size and shape during the day and night. The most pronounced changes have been detected in circadian size of the L2 axons. Looking for a functional significance of the circadian plasticity observed in axons, we examined the morphological plasticity of the L2 dendrites. They extend from axons and harbor postsynaptic sites of tetrad synaptic contacts from the photoreceptor terminals. The plasticity of L2 dendrites was evaluated by measuring an outline of the L2 dendritic trees. These were from confocal images of cross sections of L2 cells labeled with GFP. They were in wild-type and clock mutant flies held under different light conditions and sacrified at different time points. We found that the L2 dendrites are longest at the beginning of the day in both males and females. This rhythm observed under a day/night regime (LD) was maintained in constant darkness (DD) but not in continuous light (LL). This rhythm was not present in the arrhythmic per01 mutant in LD or in DD. In the clock photoreceptor cryb mutant the rhythm was maintained but its pattern was different than that observed in wild-type flies. The results obtained showed that the L2 dendrites exhibit circadian structural plasticity. Their morphology is controlled by the per gene-dependent circadian clock. The L2 dendrites are longest at the beginning of the day when the daytime tetrad presynaptic sites are most numerous and L2 axons are swollen. The presence of the rhythm, but with a different pattern in cryb mutants in LD and DD indicates a new role of cry in the visual system. The new role is in maintaining the circadian pattern of changes of the L2 dendrite length and shape.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004301" title=""&gt;Genetic and Molecular Analysis of Wild-Derived Arrhythmic Mice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A new circadian variant was isolated by screening the intercross offspring of wild-caught mice (Mus musculus castaneus). This variant was characterized by an initial maintenance of damped oscillations and subsequent loss of rhythmicity after being transferred from light-dark (LD) cycles to constant darkness (DD). To map the genes responsible for the persistence of rhythmicity (circadian ratio) and the length of free-running period (τ), quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed using F2 mice obtained from an F1 cross between the circadian variant and C57BL/6J mice. As a result, a significant QTL with a main effect for circadian ratio (Arrhythmicity; Arrh-1) was mapped on Chromosome (Chr) 8. For τ, four significant QTLs, Short free-running period (Sfp-1) (Chr 1), Sfp-2 (Chr 6), Sfp-3 (Chr 8), Sfp-4 (Chr 11) were determined. An epistatic interaction was detected between Chr 3 (Arrh-2) and Chr 5 (Arrh-3). An in situ hybridization study of clock genes and mouse Period1::luciferase (mPer1::luc) real-time monitoring analysis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) suggested that arrhythmicity in this variant might not be attributed to core circadian mechanisms in the SCN neurons. Our strategy using wild-derived variant mice may provide a novel opportunity to evaluate circadian and its related disorders in human that arise from the interaction between multiple variant genes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004302" title=""&gt;Heterochrony and Cross-Species Intersensory Matching by Infant Vervet Monkeys&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Understanding the evolutionary origins of a phenotype requires understanding the relationship between ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes. Human infants have been shown to undergo a process of perceptual narrowing during their first year of life, whereby their intersensory ability to match the faces and voices of another species declines as they get older. We investigated the evolutionary origins of this behavioral phenotype by examining whether or not this developmental process occurs in non-human primates as well. We tested the ability of infant vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), ranging in age from 23 to 65 weeks, to match the faces and voices of another non-human primate species (the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta). Even though the vervets had no prior exposure to rhesus monkey faces and vocalizations, our findings show that infant vervets can, in fact, recognize the correspondence between rhesus monkey faces and voices (but indicate that they do so by looking at the non-matching face for a greater proportion of overall looking time), and can do so well beyond the age of perceptual narrowing in human infants. Our results further suggest that the pattern of matching by vervet monkeys is influenced by the emotional saliency of the Face+Voice combination. That is, although they looked at the non-matching screen for Face+Voice combinations, they switched to looking at the matching screen when the Voice was replaced with a complex tone of equal duration. Furthermore, an analysis of pupillary responses revealed that their pupils showed greater dilation when looking at the matching natural face/voice combination versus the face/tone combination. Because the infant vervets in the current study exhibited cross-species intersensory matching far later in development than do human infants, our findings suggest either that intersensory perceptual narrowing does not occur in Old World monkeys or that it occurs later in development. We argue that these findings reflect the faster rate of neural development in monkeys relative to humans and the resulting differential interaction of this factor with the effects of early experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It's very confused and poorly argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He first says that he believes in evolution, &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; that Darwin's ideas are outdated, and the new evidence suggests new theories of evolution, because Darwin's theory can't answer some big questions. OK, I thought, there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; many unanswered questions…but then I read his four questions and realized he didn&amp;#39;t have a clue about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) How does random change (mutation) in the genome add information to a genome to create progressively more complicated organisms?&lt;/b&gt; It Doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It Does. Errors in DNA replication and recombination can produce DNA strands that are longer and contain more information than the parent strand. This is trivial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) How is evolution able to bring about drastic changes so quickly?  An example is the Cambrian Explosion.&lt;/b&gt; It Can't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His example of "quickly" is a span of about 15 million years. This may be news to some creationists, but that is a long, long time. If you're a young earth creationist, it's a period of time approximately 2,000 times longer than you believe the whole earth existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Dach needs to review some population genetics. We have nice algorithms that can be used to estimate how long it takes genetic changes to sweep through populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3) How could the first living cell arise spontaneously to get evolution started?&lt;/b&gt; It couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn't. The first living cell would have been the product of millions (quick!) of years of chemical evolution. It did not arise spontaneously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4) The Human Genome Project showed that only 1-2% of Human DNA codes for proteins, or about 25,000 genes.  These are not enough  to account for the complexity of the organism.  What is the other 98% of the genome's function?&lt;/b&gt;  We don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fast becoming one of the most popular assertions by creationists. Exactly how many genes would be sufficient to account for the complexity of a human being? Show your work. How many genes do we need to have to make you happy, and why should your sense of self-worth be a reason for us to have more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 25,000 genes is simply the number. It's what has been counted in analyzing the genome. I don't quite get the point of complaining that it's not enough, becaust obviously, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; enough, or we wouldn't be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They always seem so dismayed that humans have that number — it&amp;#39;s never shock that mice or birds have that many, or that flies have about half as many. It&amp;#39;s apparently a very personal issue to them, sort of like how many millimeters long their penis is. Come on, creationists! Be proud of your 25,000 micrometers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also seem to take it as a personal insult that so much of their genome is junk. We do know what a lot of the non-coding DNA does: a small percentage of it is regulatory, and most of it does nothing at all. It really doesn't detract from the importance of the tens of thousands of genes to see that there's also a lot of filler surrounding them. Perhaps they think there is a secret stash of super-special hidden genes to fluff up the mere 25,000 they find so inadequate?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He throws in another problem for evolution: the lack of transitional fossils. You know you're dealing with a rube when they make a paleontological argument against evolution and simultaneously reveal that they've never looked at the paleontological data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, so what are his "new theories of evolution"? Now it's my turn to embarrassed: tossed into his superficial list of alternatives is &lt;i&gt;evo-devo&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;b&gt;No.&lt;/b&gt; Evo-devo is cool, but it isn't driven by any of his unanswered questions. We don't have any argument with the idea that mutations can add information, or that they can spread through populations "quickly", we don't dabble much in the issues of abiogenesis, and no, evo-devo does not create new jobs for long stretches of junk DNA, nor does it postulate any additional secret genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, all he is really doing is tossing about a few ideas he's heard about, but knows nothing about, simply to give the impression that he's fairly assessing the possibilities. We can all guess where he is &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; going with all of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the "Intelligent Design" argument and the question of "is there a creator of the universe?"  This is an obvious question raised from biology, which reveals DNA, the genetic code, and complex life forms in the world.  All life forms share the same underlying genetic code which translates base pairs into proteins.  The existance of a code, or "alphabet" is a language which implies an underlying intelligence for its creation.  Coded messages do not happen by random happening.  This DNA code was either designed by an intelligence, or not.  I will leave it up to you to decide for yourself.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
My Own Opinion
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My own opinion is that Life did not happen by itself.  It is self evident that everything in the Universe is the product of an intelligence, which can be considered as "the creator".  This may not be self evident to everyone, however.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ho hum. The genetic code is not simply the product of &amp;#39;random happening&amp;#39;, nor do we need to invoke a designer to create it. It certainly is not self-evident that the universe is the product of intelligence — that is a conclusion derived from the abundant ignorance Jeffrey Dach demonstrates in his argument.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/another_embarrassment_to_the_m.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/2FYTxvsJ19Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233102407278"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=2842">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6913acd61a4afc36</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Food"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="africa"/><category term="armyworm"/><category term="disaster"/><category term="Spodoptera"/><title type="html">Armyworms attack Liberia</title><published>2009-01-28T00:23:03Z</published><updated>2009-01-28T00:23:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/armyworms-attack-liberia/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That isn’t a joke–The Liberian president has &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jKYwbj30W4S1R1X0oo2jNtS8Bd1AD95VEQ9G0"&gt;declared a state of emergency&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — Liberia’s president declared a state of emergency over an invasion of crop-eating caterpillars that has affected 350,000 people in the West African country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told lawmakers Monday night that the pests “have invaded our country with the potential to set back our progress in the production of food and export crops.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is indeed a crisis and I hereby declare a state of national emergency with particular emphasis on the existing and potentially affected counties,” she said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inch-long (2-3 centimeter) pests, which have been identified as army worms — the caterpillar stage of a moth — are clogging wells and waterways with excrement and devouring vital crops including banana, plantain, coffee and cocoa.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/armyworm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="armyworm" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/armyworm.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=225" alt="armyworm" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News reports identify the invaders as &lt;a href="http://ethiopia.ipm-info.org/insect_pests_ethiopia/Spodoptera_exempta.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spodoptera exempta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the African Armyworm.  The caterpillar of this moth can suddenly become very abundant when conditions are right, and devastate all the crops in an area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because of the high numbers of caterpillars, they often have to move to find new food–and they and they all go together. Hence the name ‘armyworm’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo from the &lt;a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/wilsonk4/ARMYWEB/ARMYWEB.htm"&gt;Armyworm Biological Control Consortium&lt;/a&gt; gives you a sense of the kinds of damage these ‘pillars can do. They are eating and pooping as they go, which is why wells and waterways are being clogged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABCC has a nice overview of the devastating nature of armyworms, and also the attempts to control it biologically. Sadly, the only way that this outbreak can be controlled is probably insecticides.  Biological control won’t act fast enough to save Liberians’ food and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no information on how anyone can help; Liberia has asked for help from FAO (UN Food and Agriculture Organisation).&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s not clear why, exactly, but there is a curiously hideous article that was posted there, as noted on &lt;a href="http://wonkette.com/405745/conservative-wiki-offers-helpful-list-of-senate-democrats-to-assissinate-so-republican-governors-can-appoint-replacements"&gt;Wonkette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Constitution provides that if a senator is unable to complete his or her term then the governor of the state will appoint a replacement Senator. Below is a list of Senate Democrats from States with Republican Governors. Currently the Democrats hold a 58 seat majority in the Senate. If these Senators were unable to complete their terms and were replaced by qualified Republicans by their Republican governors, the Republican Party would regain a commanding majority in the Senate sufficient to prevent Barack Hussein Obama from socializing medicine, nationalizing the financial and auto industries, and creating a socialist wealth redistribution scheme.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is a list of all the Democratic senators in states with Republican governors. It's very difficult to read that without seeing it as a hit list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservapædia issued a disclaimer, saying that the article was an act of vandalism, but a little &lt;a href="http://lambdadelta.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/conservapedia-site-taken-down-abruptly-after-posting-an-embarrassing-hit-list/"&gt;detective work by Tony Sidaway&lt;/a&gt; shows that the author seems to have been a long-term wiki editor with a history of writing stuff that is fairly typical of Conservapædia.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm always on the lookout for anything that takes a more systemic, relationship oriented, approach to social interaction--is there greater success when the focus is not put on "fixing" the autistic child but on encouraging mutual understanding between the autistic child and the non-autistic children?  How does that work, and what might result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's Herald Tribune ran an article &lt;a href="http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090127/ARTICLE/901270309?Title=Children_with_autism_paired_with_buddies_to_create_art"&gt;Children with autism paired with buddies to create art&lt;/a&gt; describing a Sarasota project that mixed kids labeled autistic, kids labeled gifted, and kids without any label together for structured art activities. The kids without an autism label were further given education about autism prior to the event. The final result is an exhibit entitled "Building Friendships: Fostering Acceptance and Understanding of Others Through the Arts."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marjorie Williams, a teacher who participated in the project called it, "more successful than we ever imagined," and went on to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Students were selected based on their attitudes about other students, and the post-test demonstrated a dramatic change in acceptance after the project," Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But it was the actions and behaviors of these students that were most impressive. The children did not want to stop working with their new friends, and they wrote beautiful entries in their journals about their experiences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of an article last year &lt;a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/09/27/20080927friends0927.html"&gt;about Scottsdale Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; in Scottsdale, Arizona.  The school set up structured games at recess that involved the preferences and interests of the autistic students.  Not only did the autistic students start interacting with the other students with great success, but the other students actually had more fun at recess and liked the structured games better than the unstructured time.  The teachers even benefited as there were less behavior problems to remediate during and after recess.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not surprised by these reports as a combination between structured activities of mutual interest and greater education about autism to others is what has worked for me personally in improving my relationships with others.  The other benefit of such programs is that they teach children skills for gaining tolerance and understanding of difference in general, which goes a long way toward building a better, more humane future for everyone.  I hope more projects that address &lt;em&gt;mutual understanding&lt;/em&gt; are developed as time goes by--they are of benefit to all.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233100495972"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/01/stupidity_caught_on_celluloid.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed47a65722c1f15b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Stupidity caught on celluloid: The Beautiful Truth</title><published>2009-01-27T21:04:46Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T21:04:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/01/stupidity_caught_on_celluloid.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to pack a DVD with idiocy so dense that light bends around it?

Overbye writes about Obama’s inauguration speech, where he said &amp;quot;We will restore science to its rightful place.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cheered when Obama said that, but my brain, evil organ that it is, immediately then whispered, &lt;em&gt;You know Bush probably felt exactly the same way while he was gutting it&lt;/em&gt;. But I suspect Obama has more of a respect for reality than Bush did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to point out something that Overbye said in his article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is not a monument of received Truth but something that people do to look for truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That endeavor, which has transformed the world in the last few centuries, does indeed teach values. Those values, among others, are honesty, doubt, respect for evidence, openness, accountability and tolerance and indeed hunger for opposing points of view. These are the unabashedly pragmatic working principles that guide the buzzing, testing, poking, probing, argumentative, gossiping, gadgety, joking, dreaming and tendentious cloud of activity — the writer and biologist Lewis Thomas once likened it to an anthill — that is slowly and thoroughly penetrating every nook and cranny of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree. He goes on to say that democracy shares a lot of the same values as science, which is something I’ve been saying for a long time. Democracy is an experiment: it’s still in its early act on the world’s stage. It started with a hypothesis — people have a say in how they are governed — and it’s gone through a few versions since then. We try different things, even swapping out our equipment every few years when we need an upgrade. Our basic premise, the Constitution in our case, is updatable as needed. If the evidence that our choices were wrong becomes overwhelming, then we’re willing to start over again from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like science, it’s easy to follow the wrong but seductive path. But if we are honest with ourselves and are willing to pursue truth when we see it, and we use all the available evidence that we have that is untainted by rhetoric and authority, and we’re willing to unshakably and unflinchingly examine that evidence no matter where it leads, why then, &lt;em&gt;we will walk the correct path&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and democracy: their price is eternal vigilance, and it’s a small one to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See what &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference" title=""&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.unconference.net/" title=""&gt;Unconference Blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/understanding_the_unconference/" title=""&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; say about the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, people in the tech industry who like to attend various BarCamps and FooCamps (like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/08/final_scifoo_wrapup.php" title=""&gt;SciFoo&lt;/a&gt;) really like the idea that the program is set entirely by participants ahead of the coference, either on a wiki, or on a big white poster board on the morning of the conference, and thus take it that this is the defining aspect of an Unconference. It is fun to do it this way, it sounds democratic and in the spirit of the "wisdom of the crowds" but it has serious drawbacks we wanted to avoid - on that later, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the term Unconference also applies to the way sessions are run, regardless of who picked the topics. It is probably the best to quote &lt;a href="http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/03/05/what-is-an-unconference/" title=""&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The sum of the expertise of the people in the audience is greater than the sum of expertise of the people on stage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, if the person on the podium is talking and the audience is jotting notes, you are doing it Wrong. The unconferenc-ey session is highly participatory, with the person behind the lectern serving, pretty much, only as a moderator, breaking the ice and defining the topic at the beginning, making sure nobody hijacks the discussion, and making sure that the discussion does not veer off on crazy tangents without ever coming back to the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, every conference and every session would be an Unconference in both senses of the term, but in the real world, it does not work that way. Why?  Here is my experience from organizing three conferences to date, and why we chose a hybrid model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, for the 1st Science Blogging Conference, we did it the full Unconference way - the Program was set by the participants on the wiki beforehand. It worked pretty well, actually. But there was also something that bothered me at the time, and even more when we opened for the suggestions for the 2nd conference: the Program (just as it happened at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/08/final_scifoo_wrapup.php" title=""&gt;SciFoo&lt;/a&gt;) was quickly populated by sessions suggested by A-type, self-promoting, middle-aged, white males - people just like me. The women, minorities, the very young, the very old, the tech non-savvy, the n00bs, the marginalized, the shy, the always-silenced... they got silenced again. And we wanted to hear their voices. Especially their voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, many of the suggestions were for sessions that are blogging universals, e.g., how to deal with trolls, which don't have much to do with science. Most of the suggestions were about blogging in general. But, blogging is not the only thing in science online.  There are online scientific journals, magazines, books, social networks, virtual words, various repositories, applications, video, reference software, etc. and that's just the technical side, not to mention the social aspects of it all. The blogs are just one part of that ecosystem, perhaps the glue that binds those all together, and we wanted to have more than just blogging sessions - we wanted to explore how all those aspects relate to each other and how the Web is changing the way science is done.  This is the motivation, also, for the name-change of the conference to make this point clear: instead of Science Blogging Conference, now it is called ScienceOnline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, ScienceOnline is an evolving conference and we are trying to have year-to-year continuity, a year-to-year improvement, and yet having each conference having its own coherence and its own "stamp". Discussions starting in one year continue the next year, perhaps with an entire year of events and technical inventions in-between to report on, perhaps becoming more focused or more derived, or splitting into two or three more specific sessions. They should be providing something new to repeat participants, yet are not completely out of context for the first-time guests either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general "science education online" session in 2007 became a "using online technologies in the classroom" session in 2008, which became three sessions in 2009: online science for kids/parents, use of online technologies in middle/high schools from students' perspective, and using online technology in college teaching.  The 'gender and race' session last year provided so much fodder, it turned into four sessions this year (gender in science, race in science, blogging through transitions, and anonymity/pseudonymity session). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tough balance to provide, and the "wisdom of the crowds" does not work well with fine-tuning the sessions in this way. If we continued to let the participants set the Program on the wiki by themselves, every year we would have the same conference: a bunch of white, middle-age geeks leading sessions about beating the trolls on blogs. It would get old pretty fast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we decided to have a much bigger say on what the Program will be, picking among the suggestions that arrive on the wiki, working with moderators on building and defining their sessions, and actively pursuing interesting people to talk about interesting topics, in order to have exciting, novel, fresh and coherent program every year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the pre-conference crowd-planning may work for one-off conferences, but not for a series of annual conferences. Also, as the meeting gets bigger and bigger each year, a proper balance and diversity is harder to attain: this year 31 out of 77 presenters/moderators/panelists were women, which is actually not as good a ratio as we had last year, when the conference was smaller, but some changes always happen at the last moment and are out of our control. On the other hand, the diversity in race, ethnicity and age was greater this year than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, not every topic lends itself well to the unconference format. First, there are demos - 15 minute show-and-tell sessions where someone shows their site or software to the potentially interested users. There is not enough time for a long discussion beyond a brief Q&amp;amp;A.  Then, there are workshops where it is obviously intended to have an expert in front and the audience coming in with a specific goal to learn something new - Blogging 101, Blogging 102 and &amp;#39;Paint your own blog images&amp;#39; sessions fall into this category. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, there are sessions where the person on the podium clearly has greater expertise than all or most in the room, but once the audience learns something, a discussion may ensue, thus, having about half the time for a presentation and half the time for discussion is perfectly OK - examples: Semantic Web session, GeneWiki session, Rhetorics session, Carnivals session, Online resources for kids and parents session. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sessions are introductory (Open Access), some highly derived (Impact Factor, Open Notebook Science). On the other hand, some sessions were quite possible to open up to the audience right off the bat, even as easily as the moderator starting with a question "the topic is X, what do you want to talk about?".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, there are the panels (three this year) which are an entirely different animal....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in the feedback form (90 respondents so far - if you are not one of them, please take a couple of minutes to &lt;a href="http://mistersugar.wufoo.com/forms/scienceonline09-feedback/" title=""&gt;fill it&lt;/a&gt; - we will analyze the data and use it to make the next conference better), most people really liked the free-flowing feel of the participatory sessions. Some like the unconference feel so much they actively disliked when a session was any less than 100% participatory. And then, there are always a couple who are uneasy with the format and would prefer more top-down control and formalized lecture-like sessions (no, we are not going that way!). I think a hybrid model, with each session's format geared towards it's topic and audience, is the way to go, perhaps erring on the side of free-flow when in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while we were planning this year's program, I wanted to combine several of the things I mentioned above and do an experiment.  I wanted to see if we could still have a free-flowing participatory discussion if we had a huge panel with a lot of panelists, each panelist being kind of a blogging superstar, and each having unique experiences that others in the room don't have. Can we pull that off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the spirit of sessions evolving out of previous year's sessions, I thought that expanding the "blogging on the ocean" session of 2008 could be expanded into a "blogging from various exotic and weird places" panel this year. So, I put the feelers out to see if there was any interest in this.  And - oh yes! - there was interest, was there ever! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we had quite a large and delicious set of people on the panel: &lt;a href="http://thebeagleproject.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Karen James&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://vgspacecadet.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Talia Page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sunaddict86.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Anne-Marie Hodge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lemurhealth.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Meredith Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/deep_sea_news/" title=""&gt;Kevin Zelnio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.vanessawoods.net/" title=""&gt;Vanessa Woods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://coralnotesfromthefield.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Rick McPhearson&lt;/a&gt;, all participating in the session on &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Blogging_adventure/" title=""&gt;Blogging adventure: how to post from strange locations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (it could have been even bigger, as I also tried to lure in &lt;a href="http://www.samanthalarson.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Samantha Larson&lt;/a&gt; (who liveblogged her ascent to the top of Mt.Everest), &lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;John McKay&lt;/a&gt; (who liveblogged a mammoth dig), &lt;a href="http://laurahendrix.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Laura Hendrix&lt;/a&gt; (who blogs from rural places in the developing world) and perhaps some of the &lt;a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/halley/halleyvi/" title=""&gt;Antartctica bloggers&lt;/a&gt;, but they either could not come or could not be reached in time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="weird places 1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/weird%20places%201.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, even with such a large panel, and each panelist having a story to tell, it worked wonderfully! First, they started off by engaging the audience - asking us to liveblog the session while they were going around the room and making it physically and mentally difficult to do - lights going on and off, strange noises, chairs shaking, pens falling out of our hands, weird insects falling into our hair...hey, it wasn't easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the taste of what it feels like to try to blog outside the comfort of our pajamas in our basements, we were eager to hear about the real challenges they experiences while blogging from strange places.  Rick and Kevin are marine biologists and they do their field work on ships, submarines and while diving. When you are out at sea, there is a lot of water around you, and that water contains a lot of salt.  Neither water nor salt are good for your laptops!  But more importantly, there is no time - a month at sea is all one has to collect a year-worth of data.  Thus data-collecting takes precedence.  They work 24/7 on their research, do not even sleep enough, and there is just no time for sitting down and writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="weird places 2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/weird%20places%202.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time constraints were also the biggest problem for Anne-Marie, Vanessa and Meredith, who do ecological/conservation field-work in the tropics.  Anne-Marie blogged from Belize last summer, Vanessa studies bonobos in Kenya, and Meredith studies lemurs on Madagascar. In such places, electricity is another limiting factor - it is unreliable, or rationed. Likewise for internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne-Marie also realized that poachers do not like cameras that they set up to take pictures of animals in the rainforest - when they triggered the light-beams and got pictures taken off, they just smashed and broke the expensive equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, having diarrhea-inducing tropical diseases, like Ghiardia, is not just all-around bad news for you, but also a special impediment to blogging.  While in India, Talia had to use an Internet cafe to write her blog. First time the nasty bug sent her running to the bathroom someone stole her notes from the computer desk. She diligently immediately copied them from memory, but then had to run to the bathroom again.  But this time, there was no toilet paper. Oh, look, what's that in my hand?  Notes?  I am so glad I took them with me so they do not get stolen again.  And notes are on paper - a very useful material in this situation.  You know how that story ended....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, Talia will report on blogging from South American countryside, and in 2012 she will blog from space - a Virgin Atlantic space flight. By that time, as technology progresses, she probably will not need to have a laptop with her - we will be able to instantly see what she sees, hear what she hears, and read what she says. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of people in the room added their stories, and a number of technical suggestions were made (see the wiki page of the session and the blog coverage of this session). Sending datasets to one's advisor back home is one problem - requires time and bandwidth and reliable internet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, blogging requires time and energy - something most people in the field do not have. Thus, long essays on a blog are unlikely to become common.  But Twittering, or using audio (something you can do while walking and talking, or while finally resting in the hammock with a cold beer in the evening) may catch on as the favourite method for communicating the wonders of doing science in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Senate unveiled its version of the stimulus package, with a much more terse &lt;a href="http://blog.aas.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/2009_01_23_senate_appropriations_committee_releases_highlights_of_american_recovery_and_reinvestment_plan.pdf"&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;.  Oddly, the section specifically mentioning science only talks about &lt;a href="http://blog.aas.org/tag/senate/"&gt;NSF and NASA&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Science Foundation (NSF) Research: $1.4 billion in funding for scientific research, infrastructure and competitive grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA): $1.5 Billion for NASA, including $500 million for Earth science missions to provide critical data about the Earth’s resources and climate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the DOE Office of Science?  NIH?  NIST? NOAA? I surely hope that the next summary will call out items to the level the House summary did.  But, further down, under Energy, we find &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$40 billion to the Department of Energy for development of clean, efficient, American&lt;br&gt;
energy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa.  Suddenly, the DOE is not your daddy’s Atomic Energy Commission any more!  (Or your grand-dad’s Office of Naval Research…)  In fact, I winder just how many congresscritters really know the history of the DOE, that its &lt;a href="http://www.mbe.doe.gov/budget/08budget/Content/Approp_summary.pdf"&gt;2008 $24.6 billion budget&lt;/a&gt; included&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- $8.7 billion for energy programs, of which $4.4 billion is for science, and most of the rest is for actual energy projects, and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- $15.5 billion for weapons activities, of which $5.4 billion is for nuclear cleanup.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By my calculation, therefore, the non-weapons, non-basic-research part of DOE’s budget is less than 20% of the whole DOE program.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what will this mysterious $40 billion for in the Senate plan be for?  Do they seriously envision giving ten times the present budget to that portion of the DOE and say, “here, invent clean, efficient American energy”.  I am going to guess that the “$40 billion” is going to augment the DOE Office of Science programs in basic research by something like the $1.9 billion in the House bill (of which $400 million was specifically tagged for energy research).  But what about the other $38 billion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway it all boggles the mind.  No doubt the so-called “Clean Coal” people will be all over this, as will the T. Boone Pickens compressed natural gas types, those who want enormous (and I mean freakin’ enormous - do the math) wind farms and the supporters of first- (ick) and second-generation biofuels.  (I say “ick” because corn-based methanol is simply a big waste of resources).  To me it seems that that “energy” is clearly the buzzword these days.  (It will certainly be in the title of my next proposal, but with “high” in front of it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two main areas of debate and discussion spring to my mind here. Firstly, I think that it is high time to merge the disparate funding agencies which support basic research into a cabinet-level Department of Science, rather than a dozen little agencies.  This was discussed (and eventually dismissed) in the early Clinton years, the argument essentially being that “the more spigots the better.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we have the much more difficult question: Where will all this new, efficient, clean American energy actually come from?  Presently we have in place systems for nuclear, hydro, solar, fossil, wind, and geothermal.  Fossil fuels dominate by far in the US.  It is interesting, in fact, to look at the DOE’s Energy Information Agency’s chart of where it all comes from and where it goes (as of 2007):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/eia_energy_flow_2007.jpg" title="eia_energy_flow_2007.jpg"&gt;&lt;img width="600" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/eia_energy_flow_2007.jpg" alt="eia_energy_flow_2007.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see we are rather heavily dependent on coal, oil, and gas.  I wonder if the average person on the street quite realizes just how deep we are into carbon based energy…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am all for research into new approaches to energy, but we are going to have to be realistic about  the basic underlying physics.  And we had better fund basic research in physics in our universities if a new generation of physicists is going to emerge to develop new energy sources, and spend all these taxpayer dollars effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in amazing times.&lt;/p&gt;

His parents, Larry and Beth Markin, did not like the "options" (which often seem to be the only alternatives offered), institutionalization or a group home. The Markins purchased Beth Markin's parents' house and refurbished it and then, as noted in the January 25th &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/advice/chi-0125-cover-autismjan25,0,7120738.story?page=1"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;L,Larry Markin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...... poured a considerable amount of money into it, converting it to a state-of-the-art home for his autistic son, a personalized residence that takes into account his son's behavior and needs. The house has been remodeled to accommodate a still-undetermined second special-needs person, as well as a caretaker provided by an agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric has been living in the house since early September and, after a tough transition, has been getting used to his new house:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At first, he automatically migrated to the basement when he got upset," Larry explains. "He did that probably the first two months."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric banged his head on and kicked the walls, but the hard wall construction stopped him from making a habit of such behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projector in the basement and the fish tank between his room and the living room helped calm him. After a couple of months of retreating to the basement, Eric now tends to hang out upstairs. And, his father reports, there have been no aggressive episodes for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He seems to be enjoying himself," Larry says. "My wife goes over regularly, I go over there regularly. Eric goes to a day program. It's working."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://autismblog.easterseals.com/a-special-home-for-a-special-son-with-autism/"&gt;Easter Seals and Autism blog&lt;/a&gt; also links to &lt;a href="http://www.easterseals.com/site/PageServer?pagename=ntlc_easyaccesshousing"&gt;Easy Access Housing for Easier Living Program&lt;/a&gt;, which has more information about creating "attractive, accessible housing" for individuals with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and i have thought about doing what the Markins did, buying a house for Charlie, refurbishing it, and making it a place for him to live, with staff and supports and, possibly, a roommate. I don't quite know how we might go about this, or whether this is possible, or if it will be the right living situation for Charlie when he is older. I like very much the idea of Charlie living &lt;em&gt;in the community&lt;/em&gt; and not being isolated, segregated, "somewhere else"----and I thank the Markins and Eric for creating a model of what can, indeed, be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually was fond of the miniseries when it came out, silly as it was. The Nazi allegory was done pretty well. It was subtle at first, then built up until it was obvious (right down to the Hitler youth wearing brown shirts and the Nazi-esque flags). I gagged when an alien bred with a human woman — I had to explain to a friend who saw no problem with that that she was unlikely to give birth were she to go at it with a Gila monster — but other than that it was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the science of the show… why come all the way here to get our water? There are giant comets in the outer solar system that are dozens of kilometers across that could last a species centuries! Not only are they easier to get at than coming all the way down our gravity well to the Earth’s surface, but they’re already in a convenient solid form, ready to pack and go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And eating us is silly– our proteins would likely poison them. And why pick Sirius as their home star? Given that it has a white dwarf companion, that means that it was once in a system with a red giant star, which would make any planets orbiting Sirius a rough place to evolve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, just in case the producers, Scott Peters and Jason Hall do an ego-search using Google and find this blog entry: you need a science advisor. One who loves science fiction, and knows the science of aliens and planetary invasion (I even wrote a whole chapter about it &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;in my latest book&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;As many of you may know, I was in commercial clinical research prior to joining the JREF earlier this month, and I always cringe when I hear someone is going to profile a “miracle” substance that hasn’t even been tested in humans.  There’s a reason for clinical testing having several phases, and there’s a reason it starts in &lt;em&gt;pre-&lt;/em&gt;clinical testing in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my question isn’t about the vagaries of mainstream media.  It’s more esoteric:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could take a pill that would allow you to live to be 150, would you do it?  What about 250?  And if so, what would you do with your extra time?  (Assume you’d be relatively healthy for 80% of this time, aging as normal in the last 20%.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>a.real.girl</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233089672637"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2997748051376867434.post-7460054971959447607">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d289c34e3ac1c62e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Rynek kontra naukowcy</title><published>2009-01-27T19:08:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T19:08:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ModneBzdury/~3/524695353/rynek-kontra-naukowcy.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;Rafała Ziemkiewicza zdaje się zagalopował w swojej notce pt. &lt;a href="http://blog.rp.pl/ziemkiewicz/2009/01/20/naukowcy-przeciwko-demokracji/"&gt;"Naukowcy przeciwko demokracji"&lt;/a&gt; pisząc, że:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;W natłoku ważnych spraw &lt;span&gt;umknął być może uwadze większości czytelników spór o to, czy należy refundować tzw. leki homeopatyczne&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;[wytłuszczenie - moje]&lt;span&gt; Piszę “tak zwane leki”, bo jako byłego autora science fiction - co wymagało pewnego otarcia się o naukę - całkowicie przekonują mnie argumenty uczonych, iż homeopatia to jeden wielki humbug i bzdura.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Humbug i bzdura to się raczej zgadza, ale jak później się okazało o refundacji produktów homeopatycznych nigdy nie było mowy. Ministerstwo Zdrowia wydało nawet &lt;a href="http://www.mz.gov.pl/wwwmz/index?mr=m037613801&amp;amp;ms=376&amp;amp;ml=pl&amp;amp;mi=380&amp;amp;mx=0&amp;amp;mt=&amp;amp;my=657&amp;amp;ma=012103"&gt;oświadczenie&lt;/a&gt; w tej sprawie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jak się okazało chodzi o ciągnący się już &lt;a href="http://modnebzdury.blogspot.com/2008/05/homeo-apatia.html"&gt;od jakiegoś czasu&lt;/a&gt; spór między Naczelną Radą Lekarską a Ministerstwem Zdrowia. Ci pierwsi uważają, że stosowanie homeopatii przez lekarzy to czary-mary i w zasadzie działalność etycznie wątpliwa, ci drudzy, że wszystkie jest OK,  bo homeopatia jest legalna i nie można zakazywać czegoś, co jest legalne. Jak &lt;a href="http://www.rynekzdrowia.pl/Farmacja/Awantura-o-homeopatie-serial-bez-konca,4204,6.html"&gt;donosi Rynek Zdrowia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jak pisaliśmy wcześniej, trwa konflikt między resortem zdrowia a samorządem lekarskim o to, czy lekarz powinien stosować środki homeopatyczne.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wiceminister zdrowia Marek Twardowski w liście do Naczelnej Rady Lekarskiej z 5 stycznia napisał, że homeopatia powinna być stosowana na tych samych zasadach co inne leki. Lekarze z Rady są oburzeni.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Już w 2002 roku samorząd podkreślał, że nie jest to metoda leczenia oparta na dowodach naukowych.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;W kwietniu ubiegłego roku samorząd lekarski przyjął jeszcze ostrzejsze stanowisko. „Stale narasta liczba dowodów, że homeopatię należy zaliczyć do nienaukowych metod medycyny alternatywnej, która proponuje stosowanie bezwartościowych produktów o niezweryfikowanym naukowo działaniu“ – napisali lekarze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zdaniem samorządu doktor, który stosuje leki homeopatyczne, narusza kodeks etyki zawodowej – a za to można nawet stracić prawo wykonywania zawodu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;W grudniu ubiegłego roku, wiceminister Marek Twardowski napisał list do Naczelnej Rady Lekarskiej z prośbą o anulowanie stanowiska dotyczącego homeopatii. Resort podkreślał w piśmie, że lekarz ma prawo przepisywać pacjentom leki, które są dopuszczone do sprzedaży na terenie Polski – czyli także środki homeopatyczne.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nadal powtarza się ten sam schemat. NRL twierdzi, że homeopatia to banialuki, minister broni  homeopatii powołując się na jej legalność. Trudno oczekiwać, że dojdzie tu do jakiegoś porozumienia ponieważ obie strony poruszają się po dwóch płaszczyznach sporu. NRL upiera się przy aspektach empirycznych (które mogą i - moim zdaniem - powinny być punktem wyjścia do rozwiązań prawnych), ministerstwo przy zagadanieniach prawnych (dla nich aspekty empiryczne zdają się być nieistotne).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tutaj Ziemkiewicz musi przyznać, że tytuł jego posta powinien brzmieć raczej: "Rynek kontra naukowcy".&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>Modne Bzdury</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233089672637"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/01/my_sweet-ass_new_business_card.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b0377af66de4a1e0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">My sweet-ass new business cards have arrived</title><published>2009-01-27T11:47:41Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T11:47:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/01/my_sweet-ass_new_business_card.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today my sweet new business cards arrived from &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.moo.com"&gt;Moo.com&lt;/a&gt; - a whole 6 days ahead of schedule!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to get some made for a while, and Moo.com have a seductively simply online card creator, allowing you to upload pictures or import them from Flickr, Facebook, etc. You can even use several different images if you want.

Says Hirst of the project:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was given a paperback copy of On the Origin of Species many years ago by a friend and I loved it, especially the contentious aspects of it. Being brought up a Catholic and questioning the nonsensical creation theory, it was exciting... I suppose the work, in a modest way, acknowledges Darwin's analytical mind and his courage to believe in those ideas that questioned the very fabric of existence and belief in his time. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

They go too far sometimes (many times), but it’s usually entertaining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s a gossip site, which means you can awaken any particular writer there out of a cold sleep and they’d still be able to recite Lindsay Lohan’s daily measurements. So it’s no shock that &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5139776/who-is-neil-degrasse-tyson-and-since-when-is-he-a-literary-rock-star"&gt;they don’t know much about astrophysicists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an article about a crowd going to a book signing event by Neil DeGrasse Tyson, head of the Hayden Planetarium in NYC, author of many books, and frequent talk-show guest. I have no surprise that the Gawker writer didn’t know who he was, since Neil’s never hit a paparazzi, not been seen to do drugs after swearing he doesn’t do them, or hasn’t had massive plastic surgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil is, though, kind of a big deal. He’s hosted his own PBS series, been on Colbert a number of times, and was on &lt;del&gt;Conan&lt;/del&gt; Leno recently too. Of course, readers of this particular blog are probably far more likely to know who Neil is, so we’re biased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a sense, it’s cool that Neil has risen to the level of getting snarked by a gossip blog. It’s something all us astrobloggers can aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gordon has no credible expertise in immunology, epidemiology, biochemistry, or any other area that qualifies him to speak with authority on vaccines and the law. He is a star-struck pediatrician from Los Angeles who poses as McCarthy’s science adviser and mentor. His notoriety comes from talk shows and being photographed with Jim Carey at Hollywood fundraising parties, and not from any serious scholarship or study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His law review article is rife with half-truths and misinformation. Most curious was this statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When children or babies who have been in contact with other children (or adults) contract most illnesses, there is no feasible way to know from whom they got the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is demonstrably false. Last year’s &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5708a3.htm"&gt;outbreak of measles in San Diego&lt;/a&gt; was directly traced to an unimmunized seven-year-old who contracted the disease while on vacation with his family in Switzerland. After returning home, the child infected four other children in a doctor’s waiting room. One of those children, an 11-month-old too young for the measles vaccines, later boarded a plane for Hawaii, where he exposed 250 passengers to the disease. According to Gordon, these facts are unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Gordon is apparently unaware that in viral illnesses, hypervariable regions in the genome can be used to “fingerprint” the organism and trace the path of the infection. It is very practical, and done all the time in tracing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon’s muddled thinking is on further display when he tells us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also situations—medical and personal—which justify waiving all or some childhood vaccines, but these are not good reasons to abandon vaccines altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a false choice. One must not abandon vaccines altogether in order to jeopardize public health - simply discouraging ten percent or more of parents from immunizing their children will do. For decades, the nation’s vaccine program has depended on the public’s confidence and trust in public health officials. But that confidence is undermined by uninformed and biased spokespersons such as Dr. Gordon, who use their positions for personal gain and ego gratification. Vaccines are far safer than the diseases they protect against, a point Gordon ignores throughout his piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon says parents who don’t vaccinate are being vilified, and he cites &lt;a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080213-9999-1n13measles.html"&gt;press accounts&lt;/a&gt; of last year’s measles outbreak where most cases were traced to children whose parents chose not to vaccinate. But the public’s fear of vaccines can also be traced to the unfounded vilification of vaccines by Gordon and others who continually misrepresent the science, and even lie about vaccine ingredients. For example, Gordon has claimed that vaccines contain anti-freeze and ether, which they do not. He has since recanted, but we must ask ourselves why a self-described spokesperson for the “Green Vaccines” movement would make such a reckless statement in the first place. Gordon has also warned parents of the dangers of formaldehyde, which is present in vaccines. Here our Pediatrician to the Stars shows his ignorance of the biochemistry he surely studied in medical college - formaldehyde is a natural by-product of single-carbon metabolism, and a 12-pound infant makes far more formaldehyde every day than is present in any five childhood vaccines combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been 500 years since the Swiss physician &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus"&gt;Paracelsus&lt;/a&gt; coined the phrase “dose makes the poison.” When Gordon and his fellow travelers in America’s anti-vaccine movement forget that lesson, they discourage more and more parents from protecting their children against the same diseases that stalked our 16th century ancestors. Gordon talks about parents’ right to choose, but those choices must be made in the light of knowledge and truth. Gordon’s dark suspicions, both baseless and self-aggrandizing, contribute nothing to the important decisions that parents are asked to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal theories behind compulsory vaccination statutes are worthy subjects for a law review, and I commend the &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt; for tackling this subject. But the cause of scholarship is best served by informed comment and knowledgeable experts in relevant fields. It’s bad enough that the line between news and entertainment has all but disappeared. Let’s not make the same mistake with the law.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>autblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism News Beat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233083454320"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3813">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e239028daadbdf6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="gas prices"/><category term="gasoline"/><title type="html">I'm Sorry, But We're All Paying Less for Gas</title><published>2009-01-27T18:23:28Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T18:23:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/uTfP9w8gtj0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/im-sorry-but-were-all-paying-less-for-gas/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A story in our local paper talks about the problems of West Texas.

But it is indirectly about autism in a few ways that I think make it worth writing about in this space.  A new &lt;a href="http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/what-were-doing/our-campaign/about-the-campaign"&gt;ad campaign&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/"&gt;Time to Change&lt;/a&gt;, an UK organization working to end mental health discrimination, has been launched.  The focus is not on "poor crazy people" nor is it on "curing the crazies," but on the impact of social stigmatization on people who have mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism is not a "mental health problem;" it is a developmental disability.  Fear and hate does not make this distinction however, and society holds many of the same taboos and stigmas against people on the autistic spectrum as it does against people with mental health issues (and indeed against many, many other disabilities as well).  Taboos, stigmatization, hostility, and fear can lead to enormous problems such as a person being too frightened to seek help necessary for survival, or to disclose the nature of disability for fear of losing employment, relationships, or control over their decision making processes.  It can also lead to mental health problems in itself, some far more dangerous than the autism (or mental health issue, or other disability).  Especially when one is repeatedly told to "get over" or "just do" something that is literally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exercise I found enormously interesting was to read through the &lt;a href="http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/what-were-doing/our-campaign/about-campaign/behind-our-campaign"&gt;Behind our campaign&lt;/a&gt; page and substitute the word "autism" for the phrase "mental health problem."  ([words to substitue in brackets] mine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Raising awareness of the stigma and discrimination that millions of people with mental health problems [an autistic spectrum diagnosis] face every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Changing stigmatizing attitudes into acceptance and respect, and beginning to reduce discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Creating a new England-wide public space to lead the debate on bringing attitudes on mental health [autism] into the 21st Century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really, really happy to see a campaign to go after the stigmatization of mental health problems; it is sorely needed.  I'd love to see such a campaign for developmental disabilities (including autism) as well.  The disability may have a different label, but the effects of stigmatization are unfortunately similar.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233076878956"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4122">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2cefaf5c3563e58a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Texas" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="creationism" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Creationism"/><category term="lawton" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Lawton"/><category term="newscientist" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="New Scientist"/><category term="texas" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Texas"/><title type="html">New Scientist ignores its own story.</title><published>2009-01-27T16:58:03Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T17:23:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/new-scientist-i-1.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kerfuffle over New Scientist’s &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126921.600-why-darwin-was-wrong-about-the-tree-of-life.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;amp;nsref=online-news" rel="external "&gt;recent story&lt;/a&gt; – “Darwin was wrong about the tree of life” – has stirred the science blogosphere.  The author of the article, Graham Lawton, has popped up on various critical blogs attempting to defend (sort of) the title and content of his article.  (See &lt;a href="http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2009/01/still-wrong.html" rel="external "&gt;John Pieret’s directory to the critical posts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/graham_lawton_was_wrong.php" rel="external "&gt;Bora’s similar directory and snark&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that linked post Pieret points out that the New Scientist article has already apparently been cited by a creationist Texas Board of Education member in support of her  proposal to weaken the Texas science standards (see &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20090123/NEWS07/90123017/1009/Texas+school+board+votes+to+drop+evolution+%E2%80%98weaknesses++from+curriculum" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the original story):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbara Cargill, a Republican who supported the weaknesses requirement, said there have been “significant challenges” to the theory of evolution and she cited a recent news article in which a European scientist disputed Darwin’s “tree of life” showing common ancestors for all living things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s even more entrancing, Pieret  notes that &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16485-creationism-defeated-in-texas.html" rel="external "&gt;New Scientist reported&lt;/a&gt; on the same creationist proposal, but somehow neglected to mention Cargill’s implicit citation of Lawton’s “Darwin Was Wrong” story as support for her proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Graham Lawton these days?  Busily showing that Galileo was wrong when he thought there were just four moons of Jupiter, or that the earth isn’t really round but is an oblate spheroid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added in edit:&lt;/strong&gt;  Reading Pieret’s post more carefully, I find that he borrowed the directory of critical posts &lt;a href="http://evolvingwithdarwin.blogspot.com/2009/01/great-graham-lawton-smackdown.html" rel="external "&gt;from Adrian Thysse&lt;/a&gt;, to whose post and blog I commend your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

He writes the &lt;a href="http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/"&gt;What’s New&lt;/a&gt; online column (sort of like a blog) where he discusses the latest science and skeptical news, usually with a pretty snarky and funny tone. While he and I disagree on some topics, he is a fierce intellect and has a pretty good grip on what it takes to be a skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why his article, &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i21/21b02001.htm"&gt;The Seven Warning Signs of Bogus Science&lt;/a&gt;, is a must-read for anyone who has dealt with a crackpot, might eventually deal with a crackpot, or &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a crackpot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apropos to the last few posts I’ve written about homeopathy and vaccines, he makes a big point that the plural of anecdote is not data — in other words, because you’ve heard some people say that distilled water cured their hemorrhoids, that doesn’t mean you can take them seriously. Claims, especially medical ones, need to be analyzed thoroughly and scientifically — using a double blind test if possible. Only then can you make sure that the phalanx of fallacies our brains hold so dear can be circumvented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many stories to be told about science, but not every story is scientific.

Today I read &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5139776/who-is-neil-degrasse-tyson-and-since-when-is-he-a-literary-rock-star"&gt;this entry&lt;/a&gt; reporting a mob at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble to see Neil Degrasse Tyson, news that comes as absolutely no surprise to me or probably to most of you reading this. The writer, though, seems shocked that someone he’s never heard of could attract so many people. WTF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m often reminded that I always live in delightfully liberal bubbles like Boston, where pretty much everyone agrees that same-sex marriage should be a given, women should have access to birth control, and creationism is a fairy tale. This time it’s a reminder that I also live in a rational bubble, where an amazing, intelligent astrophysicist following in the footsteps of Carl Sagan is far more important and more interesting than a social-climbing fameball with nothing to say at all. The entire week I was in London was a total dream, spending 100% of my time with fascinating people who were smart and funny and curious about the world, eager to learn more and to teach more. I came home to do Skeptics in the Pub last night, full of even more awesome critical thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m always interested to see whether or not that rational bubble is growing. I mean, it’s gotta be a good sign when Tyson rocks a book store so hard that even Gawker stops fawning over celebutards for a moment. It gives me hope that we’re gaining some momentum, showing people that science is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5139776/who-is-neil-degrasse-tyson-and-since-when-is-he-a-literary-rock-star?t=10317762#viewcomments"&gt;my favorite comment&lt;/a&gt; from the Gawker thread, posted by user “ian spiegelman”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Um… A person who actually knows something real about something that can be tested and that challenges the imagination? A person writing about actual, provable ideas that don’t involve the “Here’s what I don’t get” philosophy of every non-fiction book out there right now? Gosh, why would anyone choose him over the mighty “I Hate You” works of Jim Norton and Ann Coulter? And the four dozen “Barack is Messiah” books from the other side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because people are rightly sick of that shit. You can debate the universe and physics, but you have to be a thousand times smarter than most of the humans who are allowed to publish books. Science can provide a true “spin-free zone.” Even if the author is spinning one way or another, it’s still within the heady world of physics, a world with no room for Jim Norton to tell you why he thinks so-and-so “stinks” or for Denis Leary to tell you why good ol’ Irish Boston logic will save America, or for Coulter to vomit all over your face with things only members of The Brand really even pretend to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science books, even bad ones, lets us escape America, a place where any high school drop-out blue collar idiot can come along with “I have street smarts” and sell a satchel of shit to a lot of stupid, hopeless people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I a snob? God yeah I am! Scientific non-fiction is the only shot we have against semi-tarded “working class” millionaires who are poisoning every single conversation in America. It’s the one thing that they can’t counter, because they’re too fucking stupid. And ideas of how we got here and how we might evolve is more interesting to ANYONE than yet another hack going off about “America is getting sissified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d rather a thousand science books a year come out than to see one more of these “I’m a just a blue collar guy but I know what’s up” books come out. They are a fucking cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer who says he’s just blue collar and doesn’t know much but he knows *this much* is a wicked little coward who should be ridiculed until he needs a hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: A few random things happening back inside our rational bubble.

Today I read &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5139776/who-is-neil-degrasse-tyson-and-since-when-is-he-a-literary-rock-star"&gt;this entry&lt;/a&gt; reporting a mob at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble to see Neil Degrasse Tyson, news that comes as absolutely no surprise to me or probably to most of you reading this. The writer, though, seems shocked that someone he’s never heard of could attract so many people. WTF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m often reminded that I always live in delightfully liberal bubbles like Boston, where pretty much everyone agrees that same-sex marriage should be a given, women should have access to birth control, and creationism is a fairy tale. This time it’s a reminder that I also live in a rational bubble, where an amazing, intelligent astrophysicist following in the footsteps of Carl Sagan is far more important and more interesting than a social-climbing fameball with nothing to say at all. The entire week I was in London was a total dream, spending 100% of my time with fascinating people who were smart and funny and curious about the world, eager to learn more and to teach more. I came home to do Skeptics in the Pub last night, full of even more awesome critical thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m always interested to see whether or not that rational bubble is growing. I mean, it’s gotta be a good sign when Tyson rocks a book store so hard that even Gawker stops fawning over celebutards for a moment. It gives me hope that we’re gaining some momentum, showing people that science is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5139776/who-is-neil-degrasse-tyson-and-since-when-is-he-a-literary-rock-star?t=10317762#viewcomments"&gt;my favorite comment&lt;/a&gt; from the Gawker thread, posted by user “ian spiegelman”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Um… A person who actually knows something real about something that can be tested and that challenges the imagination? A person writing about actual, provable ideas that don’t involve the “Here’s what I don’t get” philosophy of every non-fiction book out there right now? Gosh, why would anyone choose him over the mighty “I Hate You” works of Jim Norton and Ann Coulter? And the four dozen “Barack is Messiah” books from the other side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because people are rightly sick of that shit. You can debate the universe and physics, but you have to be a thousand times smarter than most of the humans who are allowed to publish books. Science can provide a true “spin-free zone.” Even if the author is spinning one way or another, it’s still within the heady world of physics, a world with no room for Jim Norton to tell you why he thinks so-and-so “stinks” or for Denis Leary to tell you why good ol’ Irish Boston logic will save America, or for Coulter to vomit all over your face with things only members of The Brand really even pretend to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science books, even bad ones, lets us escape America, a place where any high school drop-out blue collar idiot can come along with “I have street smarts” and sell a satchel of shit to a lot of stupid, hopeless people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I a snob? God yeah I am! Scientific non-fiction is the only shot we have against semi-tarded “working class” millionaires who are poisoning every single conversation in America. It’s the one thing that they can’t counter, because they’re too fucking stupid. And ideas of how we got here and how we might evolve is more interesting to ANYONE than yet another hack going off about “America is getting sissified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d rather a thousand science books a year come out than to see one more of these “I’m a just a blue collar guy but I know what’s up” books come out. They are a fucking cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer who says he’s just blue collar and doesn’t know much but he knows *this much* is a wicked little coward who should be ridiculed until he needs a hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

Now CNN.com has published &lt;a href="http://cnn.com/2009/CRIME/01/26/police.death.notices/index.html?ere"&gt;an article &lt;/a&gt;about the problems that law enforcement officers experience when it’s their job to give the bad news to relatives about murder victims and other tragedies. Giving the bad news is hard on the police. Some do it well; others don’t. But giving the ultimate bad news is necessary, no matter how hard we stuggle to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us have to communicate bad news to suffering people at some time in our lives, whether it’s the type that police have to announce, the type that financial advisors have to give clients who have just lost their life savings in a stockmarket dive, or the type that physicians sadly have to give their patients. No bad news giving  is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago my wife, Jana Staton, and I carried out an ethnographic study of terminally ill patients and their caregivers in order to learn some ways to improve that difficult time of life. Among other things, we wanted to find out what was going well for them and what wasn’t. We discovered a lot about how the patients felt their pain was being managed, what activities gave them some small pleasure, their satisfaction with their medical help, the support (of lack of it) that they were getting from their community, their regrets, how they were meeting their ultimate death, and many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study was part of a larger research project called the Missoula Demonstration Project and, as far as I can tell, ours was the only part of that study that appeared as a book. We published our research under the title, &lt;a href="http://www.dyingwell.org/fewmonths.htm"&gt;A Few Months to Live&lt;/a&gt; (Georgetown U Press, 2001). Our data came from a sample of the Missoula population that was, in that year, officially designated by their doctors as terminally ill. We visited them (not interviewed, for we let them control the topics) in their homes about once a week after their doctors gave them the bad news up until the week they died, focusing our tape-recorded visits on what both the patients and their care-givers wanted to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we weren’t present when their doctors told them they were terminal, the patients related this information willingly and, we believed, accurately. Perhaps oncologists have developed their own communicative strategies to give the bad news, because most of the patients who were capable of understanding it had good things to say about how they were told they were about their forthcoming deaths. Those who agreed to let hospice help them in their last months of life had nothing but praise for how their hospice nurses were preparing them for their ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A younger very intelligent cancer victim told us that his doctor used crisp medical terms to describe his terminal status: “The doctor told me that my body would not continue to respond to chemotherapy … it would sooner, more than later, go to strictly pain medication, palliative treatment, and that my immune system would be so compromised that infection would set in and blood sepsis would set in and they would not be able to do anything and my body parts would just start shutting down. And he said at that point we’ll just make sure that your pain medication is adequate and we’ll make you as comfortable as possible, but I don’t see really going beyond the summer…I think we can get you through the summer. He will tell it as it is…but he’s as gentle as he can be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An older emphysema patient reported that her doctor gave her the bad news as  a gently posed  question: “Is it time for hospice?” The daughter of a patient with congestive heart failure told us much the same thing, only her doctor was more authoritative: “He declared mother hospice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bone cancer patient who had positive attitudes about everything told us that her doctor gave her the bad news more indirectly and positively, telling her: “You’d be good for the people at Hospice House.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another emphysema patient’s doctor was more direct: “It’s time to get hospice care.” He couldn’t recall the doctor’s exact words but he considered this a professional recommendation that he couldn’t refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An younger ovarian cancer patient was too upset to remember that it was anything but “a blur,” but her husband translated the doctor’s information to her in clearer terms: “It’s terminal. We can’t give it a time…it doesn’t look good. Your chances of recovering are slim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of the patients in our study were clear about how they got the bad news, or if they ever got it at all. One with considerable mental deterioration did not believe she was ill even to the very end saying, “He wanted to put me in Hospice House…I’m not ready yet.”  Another vehemently denied she had ever been told, although her caregiver, her daughter, understood very well what the doctor had tried to communicate to her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language offers many ways to say things. We can be direct or indirect. We can be blunt or tactful. We can prepare patients well in advance or drop it on them all at once. We can give an opinion or ask for one. We can suggest or recommend. And we can highlight what few positives remain,  saying things like, “I think we can get you through the summer” or "you'd be good for the people at Hospice House."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving the bad news is difficult, no matter which speech act we use. We can be thankful for those who do it well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233071383939"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-8927652575334869253">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3f8b1989e1f3dd07</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Genome sequencing" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Media" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Lower and basal.</title><published>2009-01-27T12:32:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T12:41:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/-aIHjAPSPXI/new-tree-of-life-divides-all-lower.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=8927652575334869253" title="2 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-tree-of-life-divides-all-lower.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">The story:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090126203157.htm"&gt;New Tree Of Life Divides All Lower Metazoans From Higher Animals, Molecular Research Confirms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The response:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another" (Charles Darwin, 1837)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SX7_4t7C9DI/AAAAAAAAAnk/ZSyWs0oY2uI/s1600-h/bart-simpson-generator.php.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SX7_4t7C9DI/AAAAAAAAAnk/ZSyWs0oY2uI/s400/bart-simpson-generator.php.gif" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More information:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/v41w288751r82653/?p=d35545958045449c894dc3ca47563f77&amp;amp;pi=4"&gt;Understanding evolutionary trees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(By the way, Rob DeSalle, who is quoted in the story, was one of my postdoc advisors and he definitely understands phylogenies -- but the story is pretty sloppy nonetheless)&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/-aIHjAPSPXI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233071326795"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/science_cafe_raleigh_-_superno.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6ab4fd63161b1fbd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="North Carolina"/><title type="html">Science Cafe Raleigh - Supernova: The Violent Death of a Star</title><published>2009-01-27T13:49:41Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T13:49:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/wYkrJoGbHq8/science_cafe_raleigh_-_superno.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/science_cafe_raleigh_-_superno.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.naturalsciences.org/calendar/scicafe.html" title=""&gt;Museum of Natural Sciences&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Supernova: The Violent Death of a Star

&lt;p&gt;Massive stars end their lives in spectacular supernova explosions, visible across the Universe, that blast material into space that contributes to future generations of stars, produces cosmic rays, and stirs up interstellar gases. Many heavy elements, including the calcium in our bones and trace amounts of copper and zinc in our bodies, are formed only in supernovae; we are quite literally made of star stuff. Some supernovae can even be used to gauge distances to remote galaxies; from these we have learned the astonishing fact that the expansion of our Universe is actually picking up speed. Join us as we discuss ongoing work on supernovae, their remnants and related astronomical work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the Speaker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stephen Reynolds, professor of physics at NC State University, has been studying supernova remnants for almost 30 years. Reynolds' research focuses on the generation of cosmic rays by supernova remnants, involving theoretical work and observations with national radio-astronomical facilities and orbiting X-ray observing satellites. Reynolds and his colleagues recently made international headlines when they discovered the youngest-known remnant of a supernova in the Milky Way.&lt;/p&gt;

"One consequence is that Americans are embracing an unpredictable and contradictory body of beliefs."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results are a dramatic departure from the nation's foundings, when leaders held prayer meetings in the halls of Congress and attributed to Almighty God the victory in the Revolutionary War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Barna noted the millions of people who describe themselves as Christian and believe Jesus sinned, or those who say they will experience eternal salvation because they confessed their sins and accepted Christ as their savior, "but also believe that a person can do enough good works to earn eternal salvation."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Barna's private, non-partisan, for-profit research group in Ventura, Calif., has been studying cultural trends since 1984. For this study, the organization randomly sampled 1,004 adults across the continental U.S. The study has a margin of error of 3.2 percent at the 95 percent confidence level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, "born-again Christians" were defined as people who said they had made a personal commitment to Jesus Christ that was still important in their life today and who also indicated they believed that when they die they will go to heaven because they had confessed their sins and had accepted Jesus Christ as their savior. The results highlight the significant shift in beliefs held by Americans, the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"For much of America's history, the assumption was that if you were born in America, you would affiliate with the Christian faith," the report said. Now however, "half of all adults now contend that Christianity is just one of many options that Americans choose from and that a huge majority of adults pick and choose what they believe rather than adopt a church or denomination's slate of beliefs."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifty percent of Americans believe Christianity no longer has a lock on people's hearts. Two-thirds of evangelical Christians (64 percent) and three out of every five Hispanics (60 percent) embraced that position, making them the groups most convinced of the shift in America's default faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In contrast, the poll showed the importance of belief was growing along with the number of options about what to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"By an overwhelming margin – 74 percent to 23 percent – adults agreed that their religious faith was becoming even more important to them than it used to be as a source of objective and reliable moral guidance."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forty percent of respondents who do not affiliate with Christianity confirmed the increasing influence of their beliefs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The result "underscored the fact that people no longer look to denominations or churches to offer a slate of theological views that the individual adopts in its entirety," the report said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By a margin of 71 percent to 26 percent adults "noted that they are personally more likely to develop their own set of religious beliefs than to accept a comprehensive set of beliefs taught by a particular church," the report said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly two-thirds of "born again Christians" adopted that stance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In the past, when most people determined their theological and moral points of view, the alternatives from which they chose were exclusively of Christian options - e.g., the Methodist point of view, the Baptist perspective, Catholic teaching, and so forth," Barna noted. "Today, Americans are more likely to pit a variety of non-Christian options against various Christian-based views. This has resulted in an abundance of unique worldviews based on personal combinations of theology drawn from a smattering of world religions such as Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, Hinduism, and Islam as well as secularism." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I can see the raw intelligence in their eyes when they torment my dog, Canis Minor, staying &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; out of reach. Or when they calculate trajectories and ballistics, jumping from tree to tree, going through trigonometric geometries in their heads, perhaps even solving n-dimensional manifolds almost literally on the fly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My proof?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See that? &lt;em&gt;See it?&lt;/em&gt; Today was colder than the time I took &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/13/squirrel-wavelength/"&gt;the Squirrel Wavelength photograph&lt;/a&gt;. That means lower energy, and the squirrels, with lower energy, can’t jump as far. The Squirrel Wavelength is shorter. But in quantum mechanics, lower energy means &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt; wavelengths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is obvious: &lt;em&gt;squirrels have disproven quantum mechanics&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our technology is based on QM: digital cameras, store scanners, even the machines that make M&amp;amp;Ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re toast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s next? Gravity? String theory? Is there no limit to what these rodents can do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, my fence. Tomorrow, the LHC.&lt;/p&gt;

How did he open his part in the debate here in Edmonton? By claiming that atheism was an amoral philosophy that led to the corruption of society, and to prove it, he cited a political scientist named &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Rummel"&gt;Rummel&lt;/a&gt;, who he claimed, had shown that cultures built around a core of atheism had killed the most people in all of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you actually go to Rummel's site, &lt;a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/welcome.html"&gt;Freedom, Democide, War&lt;/a&gt;, you'll discover that he said no such thing. His thesis is that &lt;i&gt;democracy&lt;/i&gt; is the critical factor in reducing war and the slaughter of civilians. This, of course, I could not do during the debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will quickly discover that Rummel does not talk about this strange "atheist core" to murderous societies like Stalinist Russia or the Pol Pot regime. It's nonsense; atheism is not the core of Marxism, for instance, and these were autocratic societies with a tyrannical cult of personality. It requires a distortion of history to make this argument, and imposing a personal bias on the data to make up this correlation. Pol Pot was a monster who killed millions, including religious people, in a reign of terror; Mao exterminated any institution, including the religious, to secure a monopoly on power; when I pointed out that Hitler was Catholic and Germans were Catholic and Lutheran, Durston replied that he might have been formerly a Lutheran (?), but he was an atheist. Why? Because anyone who was not doing as Jesus taught was not a true Christian. It's an interesting piece of circular reasoning. It's also an &lt;a href="http://theroadtoemmaus.org/RdLb/21PbAr/Pl/DthByAthsm.htm"&gt;interpretation of his own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He just ignored the fact that the only time in history when you could even describe any society as atheist was in the 20th century, coinciding with the emergence of industrialized tools of mass destruction. There are &lt;a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/articleprint.php?num=298"&gt;smart takedowns of the amoral atheist claim&lt;/a&gt;, but I was not prepared at all to deal with Durston's simultaneous poisoning of the well and argument from consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durston is not stupid. He studiously avoided discussing any biology in his major points. Most of his argument for a personal god consisted of 1) atheists are bad people, 2) cosmology requires a beginning, and that beginning had to have been a god, and 3) the truth of the biblical accounts of Jesus. Would you believe he actually claimed the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus"&gt;Flavian testimony of Josephus&lt;/a&gt; was valid historical evidence for the divinity of Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's a good debater, because he relies on a powerful tactic: he'll willingly make stuff up and mangle his sources to make his arguments. I'm at a disadvantage because I won't do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson for me is to pin these guys down much more tightly on the precise subject of the debate. This one was all over the place, especially since Durston consciously avoided any topic on which I might have some expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some confusion about what my argument in the debate was. Here's my first slide, which outlines the two points I tried to make in 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do gods exist?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence of intervention by any supernatural force in the history of life on earth, and god-based explanations are inconsistent and incoherent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every biological phenomenon that we have examined in sufficient detail has been found to be explainable by purely natural causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Therefore, probably not.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked this approach because it does address the question in the debate (about the existence of an interventionist god), it was actually relevant to the major arguments for intelligent design creationism that Durston has a reputation for making, and I thought it would be a way to introduce some real evolutionary biology into the discussion. Contrary to the assertions of others, I did not open with any insults to Durston at all — it was to be a discussion with some actual evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Durston&amp;#39;s first words that were insulting and illogical — a shot at calling atheists evil. I suppose if I&amp;#39;d opened by announcing that Christians were all stupid, we would have had equivalency…but I did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, we talked past each other the whole time. The debate topic was far too broad, I thought we were going to argue about the evidence for design, but Durston wiggled away and talked about anything but.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/an_ugly_debate_in_edmonton.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/5F8DRHVQ4aM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233065530389"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_first_of_i_hope_many_very_bad_days_f.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e10c085f43f47d7c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">The first of (I hope) many very bad days for antivaccinationists in 2009</title><published>2009-01-27T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/6E3Pz87HR7s/the_first_of_i_hope_many_very_bad_days_f.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_first_of_i_hope_many_very_bad_days_f.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It looks like I've been sucked into another streak again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular readers know that examining the claims of the antivaccine movement with skepticism, science, and critical thinking has been a theme of this blog from the very beginning. If there's one thing I've learned over the last four years, it's that vaccine news seems to come in streaks. Often weeks will pass without much, and, because the antivaccine wingnuttery over at, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt; Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; is such a constant that it blurs into background noise, provoking my attention only when someone really brings the crazy home in a way that produces a level of burning stupid that results in sufficient pain to my harried neurons that it finally provokes a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/more_disease_and_death_among_the_unvaccinated.php"&gt;story I wrote about yesterday&lt;/a&gt; has yet to provoke a response. It couldn't possibly be because it was a story of how not vaccinating leads to death from Hib infection, could it? Perish the thought! Maybe our boys (and girls) are slipping. Maybe, in spite of having the entire weekend to think of an angle to use to attack this story as not being evidence of the dangers of not vaccinating (given most of the children involved were completely unvaccinated, including the one who died). I'm wondering if that's the same reason they haven't come out of the woodwork yet to attack a study that was released on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's yet another nail in the coffin of the idea that thimerosal causes autism. You know, that hypothesis has so many nails holding its coffin shut that high explosives wouldn't dislodge the door, but I can still hear pounding from inside the coffin. It's pseudoscience trying to get out. It's a good thing we have a &lt;a href="http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan/26/study-backs-thimerosal-safety/"&gt;stake like this to drive into its heart&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_first_of_i_hope_many_very_bad_days_f.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_first_of_i_hope_many_very_bad_days_f.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/6E3Pz87HR7s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233063360321"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc1aa3636490b703</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Grandfather Clocked</title><published>2009-01-27T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/legal/grandfather.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Linguistic origins: Invited houseguests cannot be required to leave a home thanks to the "grandfather clause."</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233062414794"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1078">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/86246f92431109c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and technology"/><category term="Psychology of language"/><category term="Semantics"/><category term="ambiguity"/><title type="html">Pause, on, off, whatever: human interface design</title><published>2009-01-27T13:16:51Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T13:16:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1078" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the lecture room where I will be giving a talk later today at the Max-Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, the audiovisual equipment is controlled by a small touch-screen unit.  Right now, the part of the display that controls the ceiling-mounted projector looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table border=""&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border=""&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="blue"&gt;ON&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;OFF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;PAUSE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is almost exactly what it looks like.  Now, you tell me: would that mean that the projector is on, or that it is off?  Is the blue button the operative one, showing the name of the current state?  Or is it the white button beside it that we should pay attention to?  (I should make it clear that the PAUSE across below them is not a button: only the ON and the OFF buttons change color when touched.) And then once we have decided whether we should see this as saying "ON" or as saying "OFF", do you think it means that the pausing function is &lt;b&gt;on&lt;/b&gt;, which would mean that the projector is &lt;b&gt;off&lt;/b&gt;?  Or that the pausing function is &lt;b&gt;off&lt;/b&gt;, which would mean that the projector is &lt;b&gt;on&lt;/b&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry about me.  I'll figure it out by trial and error.  I simply offer this to you as proof number 37 (I have made mention of many such examples in the past: road sign psycholinguistics and so on) of my claim that &lt;b&gt;human/machine interface design today is in a state of total freaking disaster&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devices are being design, constructed, and marketed with interfaces so badly botched one can only guess what to do with them.  It's a neglected crisis for the economy.  Human safety is at risk.  Millions of people every day turn on the wrong burner because of badly designed cooktops.  Some merely leave the vegetables sitting in cold water for a quarter of an hour beside a glowing burner, but some melt spatulas into pools of plastic, and some set light to dishcloths and die in the resultant apartment fires.  Yet nothing is being done.  Things are getting worse.  (Am I going red in the face and developing weird staring eyes?  I don't want to seem like those stringy-haired old guys you see in the street wearing sandwich boards that say the world is about to end; I feel I would lose credibility.  Trust me.  I'm not a loony.  Really I'm not.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own apartment in Edinburgh, neither of my parents (they were visiting at Christmas) could figure out how to get water to come out of the faucet in the bathroom.  Why are people redesigning washbasin taps in such a way that people cannot figure out how to make the water flow? Did any of us ask for common water faucets to be redesigned?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we didn't even give them a clock radio.  We have a cheap clock radio with a front panel so badly designed that it would take me hours to explain it to you.  The 15 buttons, each with several tiny words written under them (they all have multiple functions) are arranged like this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table border=""&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And do you know how you switch from station number 1 to station number 2 using this array? I will tell you.  It is B1, A4, A3.  That's highly intuitive, isn't it?  And never mind setting the time and date; I'm just not going to go through it.  You couldn't bear it.  We're going to have to throw it away and shell out for a Bose.  (Bose are a counterexample to any claim about superb design being too difficult to achieve or too much to ask.  With Bose clock radios, learning is fast and effortless; you can control them without trouble even in pitch darkness.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appeal to young, talented people everywhere: get trained in a few relevant subjects — psycholinguistics, visual perception, writing systems, reading, electronics, industrial design, microsociology of human interaction, ergonomics — and go to work in the design of human-machine interface systems.  Get out there and make stuff that can be understood by the sort of mammals we happen to be.  Please.  We users are desperate.  We read the manuals, we look at the display panels, and we simply cannot understand what the hell we are supposed to do to make the thing go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

This study adds to the large and growing body of scientific evidence for the safety of vaccines, and contradicting the claims of the anti-vaccine movement that vaccines cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is a bit fortuitous in that it was not originally designed to probe this question. Rather, this was a safety and efficacy study of the acellular pertussis vaccine conducted in Italy between 1992 and 1993. But it created a cohort of children who were carefully screened and monitored, and randomized to different exposures to thimerosal. This allowed the researchers to go back 10 years later to survey and examine the children for neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who were enrolled in an efficacy trial of&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;pertussis vaccines in 1992–1993 were contacted in 2003.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Two groups of children were identified, according to thimerosal&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;content in vaccines assigned randomly in the first year of life&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;(cumulative ethylmercury intake of 62.5 or 137.5 µg),&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and were compared with respect to neuropsychological outcomes.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Eleven standardized neuropsychological tests, for a total of&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;24 outcomes, were administered to children during school hours.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Mean scores of neuropsychological tests in the domains of memory&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and learning, attention, executive functions, visuospatial functions,&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;language, and motor skills were compared according to thimerosal&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;exposure and gender. Standard regression coefficients obtained&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;through multivariate linear regression analyses were used as&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;a measure of effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results - there was only one case of autism in the entire study, and that was in the group that received the lower dose of thimerosal. Of the 24 neuropsychological tests, only two were significantly worse in the higher dose thimerosal group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girls with higher thimerosal intake&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;had lower mean scores in the finger-tapping test with the dominant&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;hand and in the Boston Naming Test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences were clinically small, even though they were statistically significant. However, by chance alone (with the statistics used) 4 outcomes on average should have varied significantly, therefore the fact that 2 outcomes were significant is almost certainly due to chance alone. Further, these same measures were not different for boys or the groups as a whole, only when girls are considered seperately, which further suggests it is statistical chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, a &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=17"&gt;previous study by the CDC &lt;/a&gt;that also looked at a large number of neurological measures also found a few statistical outliers - but they were different outcomes. For example, the previous CDC study showed that motor tics were increased in the thimerosal exposure group, while this study shows no difference in motor tics but does show a decrease in finger tapping. This is all consistent with statistical noise - not a real effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study authors conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No study conducted to date has been able to provide conclusive&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;evidence of an effect of thimerosal on neuropsychological development.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Final judgments regarding this association must rely on the&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;entire body of results from studies conducted in different settings&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and with different levels of validity and on the coherence of&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;results. The lack of consistency among the results of our study&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and other available studies suggests that an association between&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;thimerosal exposure through vaccination in infancy and neuropsychological&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;deficits is unlikely or clinically negligible. Additional data&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;from populations with wider ranges of exposure to thimerosal&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and additional neuropsychological assessments at older ages&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;may help to clarify the issue of potential associations between&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;thimerosal and neurodevelopmental outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is appropriately conservative prose for a technical paper, but even so the conclusion is solid - any association between thimerosal and neurological disorders is “unlikely or clinically negligible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, no one study by itself is definitive, especially in establishing the absence of a correlation. But this new study adds to an already large body of evidence, and therefore raises our confidence further that thimerosal in vaccines did not cause autism or other neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors are also candid about the strengths and weaknesses of the study. Anti-vaccinationists have been calling for years for a randomized study with and without vaccines - because that is the one type of data that was not available. It is unethical to randomize a patient not to receive a standard therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study, however, is close because subjects were randomized to two very different doses of thimerosal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another likely source of criticism is that the total cumulative dose of ethylmercury in the higher exposure group was 137.5 µg and that this might be below the threshold of toxicity, and therefore says nothing about the risks of higher exposures. This is true, but not likely to be relevant to the thimerosal question. In the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6VHT-493DGDC-5&amp;amp;_user=483702&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000022720&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=483702&amp;amp;md5=9228dca00da7bf02bd08baedae9676c0"&gt;US thimerosal exposure &lt;/a&gt;was about 75 µg in 1989 and peaked in 1997 at 187.5 µg cumulative exposure through the routine childhood schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not seem plausible that the increase in µg of ethylmercury from 75 to 187.5 resulted in a dramatic increase in autism, but the difference between 62.5 and 137.5 in this study was sub-threshold. Also, I have to point out that since 2000 the use of thimersal in the US has decreased and now there are &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal_faqs_thimerosal.htm"&gt;less than 3 µg&lt;/a&gt; in the childhood schedule and the rate of increase in autism diagnoses has not decreased even six years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study adds to the consensus of existing evidence for a lack of association between thimerosal in vaccines and autism or other neurological disorders. However, since the anti-vaccination movement is largely ideological and disconnected from the scientific evidence I do not anticipate that this will end the controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1116602/Why-face-truth-Having-autistic-child-wrecks-life-.html"&gt;Why Can't We Face the Truth?&lt;/a&gt; in the January 15th &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/simon_baron-cohen_on_the_prospect_of_a_prenatal_test_for_autism"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;, Carol Sarler describes the more than harried life of her friends Cath and John and their autistic son, Tom. According to Sarler, both parents are unable to work full-time to take care of Tom and attempts to educate him at special schools have not been successful; if it weren't for Cath's mother, Helen, they'd have no one to babysit Tom who, as he gets older is "getting worse." Sarler writes of "brave and devoted mothers" like Charlotte Moore who "have clung to the positives brought into their lives by their children. But when she gave Cath and Tom &lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=2-9780312374242-0"&gt;George and Sam&lt;/a&gt;, Moore's book, "they simply could not see Tom in George and Sam."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarler's article is written in response to the recent &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/charlotte_moore_on_prenatal_autism_testing"&gt;speculation about a prenatal test for autism&lt;/a&gt;, in the wake of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/simon_baron-cohen_on_the_prospect_of_a_prenatal_test_for_autism"&gt;new research under Simon Baron-Cohen&lt;/a&gt; (research which was not about, or intended to be about, a prenatal test). Based on her assessment of Cath's, John's, and Tom's lives---or rather, as she seems to see it, the wreck of their lives----Sarler concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;......... looking on, as a relatively dispassionate observer; looking at the damage done, the absence of hope and the anguish of the poor child himself, do I think that everyone concerned would have been better off if Tom's had been a life unlived?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unequivocally, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to make of this account?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as I think has been noted, I seek too to "cling" (if you want to use that word) to those "positives" brought into my life by my son Charlie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Acceptance is the beginning of hope" I said on in a special on neurodiversity and autism rights on &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/i-dont-feel-that-i-suffer/"&gt;Good Morning America back in June&lt;/a&gt;. But wasn't all this talk of acceptance just "a beautiful way of justifying heartbreak," a consternated Diane Sawyer asked at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can assure you, everything Sarler says about Tom's life, and Cath's and John's, we've been through. I'm not going into all the messy details, as they are quite clearly described in &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1116602/Why-face-truth-Having-autistic-child-wrecks-life-.html"&gt;Sarler's article&lt;/a&gt; some of it just in the past few week since Charlie started to have &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hard_hard_questions_residential_placement"&gt;trouble&lt;/a&gt;, serious trouble at times, and, really, Jim and I have never had to hang onto him so tightly. With a lot of attentiveness, a change in medication, the hard work of teaching, and just a lot of love, things have been much better for the past week, with Charlie himself seeming to do as much as he can, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there's been "damage done," even an "absence of hope" and a lot of, what can I call it, dark night of the soul sort of despair that maybe Jim and I had reached the end of the road we promised Charlie and ourselves that we'd always walk together. Charlie has been going through a lot in these past few months, the massive changes occasioned by puberty and the realities of his growing up. I have been beyond grateful for everything I've been learning about policy and services and community inclusion for adults on the autism spectrum---these make me hopeful and these are the things I know we need to focus on and work for, on doing what we can to help those on the autism spectrum have good lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But judging that some children's, some people's lives, would have been best left "unlived"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Sarler's judgment from the outside, as she herself notes. What Cath and John, her friends, think about this matter is not noted. Perhaps Sarler did not wish to include this information in her piece. But her assessment of her friends' lives makes me keenly aware of how others who don't live with Charlie, who don't know Charlie, might be judging Jim's and my life. Do people think it's a life of one tantrum, one catastrophe, after another, with a child, a child growing up too fast, and unable to communicate a single thing---excuse the expression, a tall young man who's a "perpetual toddler" inside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such impressions of life with an individual on the autism spectrum only persist, and exist, as long as that is all that we hear. There's little positive said about Tom in Sarler's article other than a (somewhat stereotpyical) reference to his being an "amazingly beautiful child (they often are)." And it is possible for me to write about the tough things and that's part of a day (of anyone's day; who has great days all the time?), but really, life with Charlie is not only good and full and rich and packed. It's fun----piggy-backing Charlie in the pool per his request on Sunday afternoon (yes, I mean I was piggy-backing Charlie) inbetween him swimming half-laps and splashing water into the bleachers and my contacts with his kick; the three of us run-rushing down a street down by the Jersey City waterfront with a cold wet wind blowing on us, on our way to the kind of diner that just makes you think of that last episode of &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, when Charlie's very upset and the anxiety is working its way through all of his body, it's been hard to hold him. But how much better to have him to hold and to love, than the empty alternative, a life without our son, Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233041470097"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=1965">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/64c9fcfe66b043fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Future Technology"/><category term="AI"/><category term="bees"/><category term="facial recognition"/><category term="Robots"/><title type="html">Bees hold the secret to better eyesight for AIs?</title><published>2009-01-27T07:29:28Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T07:29:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/bees-hold-the-secret-to-better-eyesight-for-ais/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from Monash University bee researcher Adrian Dyer could lead to improved artificial intelligence systems and computer programs for facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really liked was that I got to keep a CD with her X-rays.  When I put a CD in my laptop, I get images that are somewhat interactive, i.e., if I click on a detail, that detail gets enlarged.  But I could not figure out how to save that format on my computer - all I get are static images that I cannot manipulate in any way.  But anyway, here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth study to look for subtle signs of mercury toxicity and show that that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1990s, thousands of healthy &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Italian&lt;/span&gt; babies in a study of &lt;span style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;whooping cough&lt;/span&gt; vaccines got two different amounts of the preservative thimerosal (pronounced thih-MEHR’-uh-sawl) from all their routine shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years later, 1,403 of those children took a battery of brain function tests. Researchers found small differences in only two of 24 measurements and those “might be attributable to chance,” they wrote in the February issue of the journal Pediatrics, which was released Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only one case of &lt;span style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;autism&lt;/span&gt; was found&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;and that was in the group that got the lower level of thimerosal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat it Jenny!&lt;/p&gt;

Right on the front page, below the article on our new President, was an article about the performance of the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/01/21/ST2009012100305.html?hpid=topnews"&gt;stock market on Inauguration Day&lt;/a&gt; (including a handy table of the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/20/AR2009012003212_pf.html"&gt;performance over the last 15 inaugurations&lt;/a&gt;). The markets tanked, with the Dow shedding 4% of its value. The Wall Street Journal also ran some &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123258545247904479.html"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; noting the connection between Obama’s election and market performance. Is there an important message here? No. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/stock-down-arrow.jpg" title="stocks drop"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/stock-down-arrow.thumbnail.jpg" alt="stocks drop" width="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There is essentially zero causation between Obama’s installation in the oval office and market performance on the same day. It’s not like stock brokers woke up that Tuesday morning, flipped on their TVs, discovered that Obama was about to become president, and decided to dump their portfolios. Obama’s election has been incorporated into market valuations for months. These articles are tantamount to talking about the weather on inauguration day (brutally cold, I can assure you). Obama had little to do with the miraculous break in the clouds and sunshine that immediately preceded his swearing in. Newspapers are unlikely to devote an article to the weather on 1/20. And they’re certainly not going to put such an article on the front page. So why are the markets so fetishized that their performance is considered front-page “news”, even on a day with plenty of other notable events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market drop is indeed relevant, not as a sign of what Obama will do to the financial markets, but rather, what the financial markets will do to Obama. We are in an era of immense volatility and huge losses. In other times a 4% drop would be highly unusual and notable. But, sadly, in the present climate it has become routine. The economic downturn will almost certainly impact essentially every aspect of Obama’s time in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the weather can also play an important role in the inauguration of a President. It was bitter cold for President William Harrison’s inauguration in 1841. His speech lasted for almost two hours (a record length), with him standing outside with little shelter. He caught pneumonia, and within a month was dead. There was undoubtedly little correlation between the cold and his death. But it makes for a perfect apocryphal story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it that whenever &lt;a href="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2009/01/moment-of-silence-case-decision.html"&gt;a judge disagrees with a conservative pundits&lt;/a&gt; these days, it must be an evil activist judge with their own evil agenda?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why is it that while in the process of whining and complaining about things not going their way because they’re insecure with having their power threatened, conservative pundits feel the need to mock the complaints of others with condescending fake crying and calling them insecure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that conservative pundits fail to accurately characterize every controversy? He keeps saying he can’t say “prayer” but where is he pulling that bullshit? Nobody is stopping you from saying the word “prayer.” That’s not even close to what this news story is about. . .and that’s GLENN’S ENTIRE ARGUMENT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And nobody is taking your poor, little prayer way Glenn? So don’t worry. You can still pray to your imaginary friend any time you want, so long as you don’t disrupt everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this judge DID stop is a slimy, dishonest attempt to force prayer on everyone. If your kid wants to pray on his own, he can so long as he doesn’t disrupt the class. If you want your kid to have a moment of silence, he can do that at home. But school is for learning. And the rest of our kids shouldn’t have to waste their time simply because you want your kid to waste class time saying silent magic spells to his invisible sky daddy and because with you as a father he needed to fantasize about a better one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone seriously believe that Glenn over here wouldn’t suddenly change his position if he found out his kids were being forced to prayer towards mecca to the god of the Muslims?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, the facts and Glenn Beck aren’t even on the same planet. And these assholes really think that you can just rename prayer by calling it “a moment of silence” that the rest of the world is too stupid to realize it’s the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see why Glenn decided not to have anyone on to challenge him. Both of these guys are walking advertisements for abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2009/01/2008_medical_weblog_awards_sponsored_by_epocrates_meet_the_winners.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2009/01/am_i_that_oblivious_did_i_actually_win/award_lr.gif" width="120" height="122" alt="award_lr.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned a while back that, although I like awards as much as the next guy, I don't go actively seeking them, I wasn't kidding. As evidence that I wasn't kidding, I point out that, until some of you started letting me know about it, I had no clue that I had actually won the &lt;a href="http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2009/01/2008_medical_weblog_awards_sponsored_by_epocrates_meet_the_winners.html"&gt;2008 Medical Weblog Award for Best Health Policies/Ethics Weblog of 2008&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, even though I do peruse Medgaget, the blog that hosts the competition, I had somehow missed the post last Friday announcing the winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it would have helped if the Medgadget guys would have shot me a quick e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I am surprised and humbled. I realize that a lot of readers probably think my expressions of amazement at the size of my readership and my "aw shucks" bit in the face of praise is an act, but it's not. Even four years on, I remain amazed that anyone cares about my self-indulgent blather. It's not that I don't think I'm any good. It's rather that I still have a hard time believing I'm &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether I am or am not "that good," I remain grateful to my readers, who voted for me in sufficient numbers to put me over the top. You keep me going, and you keep me honest when I screw up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't congratulate the other winners, including longtime favorite &lt;a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/"&gt;Kevin MD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sandnsurf.medbrains.net/"&gt;Life in the Fast Lane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://runnerwrites.blogspot.com/"&gt;Running for My Life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.clinicalcorrelations.org/"&gt;Clinical Correlations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/"&gt;Life as a Healthcare CIO&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://sixuntilme.com/"&gt;Six Until Me&lt;/a&gt;.

Of these five cases, three of the children were unvaccinated, one had started the series of vaccines but did not complete the series due to shortages, and the fifth -- who had been fully vaccinated -- had an immune deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five cases may not sound like a lot... until you learn that one of the unvaccinated children died.

Their “evidence” for this comes from instances in which Darwin specifically refers to superior races. What they don’t tell you is that “races” in Darwin’s time was synonymous with “species,” and that Darwin is referring only to species that are better adapted to their environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, according to a new book, &lt;em&gt;Darwin’s Sacred Cause &lt;/em&gt;by Adrian Desmond and James Moore,&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSLD55838020090123"&gt; hatred of slavery drove Darwin ideas &lt;/a&gt;because it challenged the assumption held by many at the time that blacks and whites were separate species.&lt;/p&gt;

But it just so happens that I'm actually really working on implementing a really interesting and broadly useful data structure now, called a &lt;em&gt;Rope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A bit of background, to lead in. I've got this love-hate relationship with
some of the development tools that Rob Pike has built. (Rob is one of the Unix
guys from Bell labs, and was one of the principal people involved in both the
Plan9 and Inferno operating systems.) Rob has implemented some amazing
development tools. The two that fascinate me were called Sam and Acme. The
best and worst features of both are a sort of extreme elegant minimalism.
There's no bloat in Rob's tools, no eye-candy, no redundancy. They're built to
do a job, and do it well - but not to do any more than their intended job.
(This can be contrasted against Emacs, which is a text editor that's grown
into a virtual operating system.) The positive side of this is that they're
incredibly effect, and they demonstrate just how simple a programmers text
editor should be. I've never used another tool that is more effective than
Acme or Sam. In all seriousness, I can do more of my work more easily in Sam
than I can in Emacs (which is my everyday editor). But on the other hand, that
extreme minimalist aesthetic has the effect of strictly eliminating any
overlaps: there's one way to do things, and if you don't like it, tough. In
the case of Acme and Sam, that meant that you used the mouse for damn-near
everything. You couldn't even use the up and down arrows to move the cursor!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This is a non-starter for me. As I've mentioned once or twice, I've got terrible
RSI in my wrists. I can't use the mouse that much. I like to keep my hands on my
keyboard. I don't mind using the mouse when it's appropriate, but moving my hand from
the keyboard to the mouse &lt;em&gt;every time I want to move the cursor?&lt;/em&gt;. No. No
damned way. Just writing this much of this post, I would have had to go back and
forth between the keyboard and mouse over 50 times. (I was counting, but gave up when
I it 50.) A full day of that, and I'd be in serious pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I recently got reminded of Acme, because my new project at work involves using a
programming language developed by Rob Pike. And Acme would really be incredibly
useful for my new project. But I can't use it. So I decided to bite the bullet, and
use my free time to put together an Acme-like tool. (Most of the pieces that you need
for a prototype of a tool like that are available as open-source components, so it's
just a matter of assembling them. Still a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; non-trivial task, but a
possible one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Which finally, leads us back to today's data structure. The fundamental piece of
a text editor is the data structure that you use to represent the text that you're
editing. For simplicity, I'm going to use Emacs terminology, and refer to the
editable contents of a file as a &lt;em&gt;Buffer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; How do you represent a buffer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As usual with data structures, you start by asking: What do I need it to do? What performance characteristics are important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the case of a text buffer, you can get by with a fairly small set
of basic operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fast concatenation:&lt;/em&gt; concatenating blocks of text needs to be
		&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fast.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fast insert:&lt;/em&gt; given a point in a block
		of text, you need to be able to quickly insert text
		at that point.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fast delete:&lt;/em&gt; given two points in a block of
		text, you need to be able to quickly remove the text between those points.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;Reasonably fast traversal: &lt;/em&gt; Lots of algorithms,
		ranging from printing out the text to searching it are based
		on linear traversals of the contents. This doesn't have to be
		incredibly fast - it is an intrinsically linear process, and it's
		usually done in the context of something with a non-trivial cost
		(I/O, regular-expression scanning). But you can't afford to make it
		&lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;Size:&lt;/em&gt; you need to be able to store effectively unlimited
		amounts of text, without significant performance degradation in the

The cause of his death was a bizarre, tragic accident, yet one that is supremely ironic for someone who devoted his entire adult life to the study, teaching, and explication of Chinese language: John choked on a piece of Peking Duck at a Christmas dinner in a Honolulu restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John with some of the books he published, in 1996 by John DeFrancis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tribute to John, I shall not dwell on the extremely interesting story of his life, inasmuch as that has been covered well in obituaries in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; (January 19, 2009, p. A21), &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/us/15defrancis.htm"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere, e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/27082"&gt;Yale Daily News&lt;/a&gt; (January 16, 2009). There is also a wonderful Website for John &lt;a href="http://johndefrancis.wordpress.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with plentiful biographical details and lots of photographs.  Suffice it to say here that John was a socially committed and politically active individual who also was unusually adventurous and gregarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I wish to do in this necrology is give a brief accounting of John as a teacher and scholar of Chinese.  Perhaps the easiest way to approach John's academic career is to divide it into four stages: student, teacher, researcher, and lexicographer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at Yale, John majored in economics, and his interest in the measurable, quantifiable aspects of politics and society continued to have an influence upon his scholarship throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John began his graduate studies at Yale under the legendary George A. Kennedy (1901-1960), for whom there is now an excellent, insightful &lt;a href="http://www.umass.edu/wsp/sinology/persons/kennedy.html"&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's intimate feel for the spoken languages of China vis-à-vis the written tradition surely must have had a lasting effect upon John.  Subsequently, however, John moved to Columbia for his Ph.D., since the program in Sinology there was larger.  At Columbia, John's concern with the here and now, with the quality of human existence, together with his focus on Chinese language issues, were perfectly married in his dissertation, which later became his first book, &lt;em&gt;Nationalism and Language Reform in China&lt;/em&gt; (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1950, with several reprints).  This is a masterpiece of critical inquiry that combines research in history, political science, and sociolinguistics.  It is still regularly consulted by researchers today, nearly six decades after it was first published, and it set the tone for all of John's later books and articles on Chinese.  In this volume we can see clearly how he was inspired by the passionate views of the great Chinese writer, Lu Xun (1881-1936), and how he was motivated by his own deep empathy for illiterate Chinese peasants and workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although John had held a number of teaching positions in various subjects at more than half-a-dozen institutions between 1938 and 1961, his mission as a major force in the field of Chinese language instruction did not really crystallize until 1962, when he was appointed as Research Professor of Chinese at Seton Hall University.  It was here that John wrote his famous series of 12 volumes of beginning, intermediate, and advanced textbooks for the study of Mandarin.  Significantly, John was one of the first Western pedagogues to use pinyin as the Romanization for Mandarin in his textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DeFrancis textbook series had a tremendous impact on the Chinese language teaching field in America and abroad throughout the 1970s and 1980s.  When John passed away, he was still working on the revisions of his &lt;em&gt;Beginning Chinese Reader&lt;/em&gt;, and they will soon be completed by John Montanaro of Yale University Press and Tom Bishop of Wenlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1966-1976, John was Professor of Chinese at the University of Hawai'i.  Upon retirement, he wasted no time in diving back into pure research.  His &lt;em&gt;Colonialism and Language Policy in Viet Nam&lt;/em&gt; (The Hague: Mouton, 1977) dissected the intricacies of the successful implementation of an alphabetical script for an Asian language that had once been a part of the sinographic sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John had studied and traveled in China from 1933 to 1936, but — because of his intense disappointment at the Communist government&amp;#39;s failure to implement greater usage of pinyin — did not go back again until 1982 when he returned with Y. C. Li to attend the 15th International Conference on Sino-Tibetan Languages and Linguistics that was held in Beijing that year.  While in Beijing, he met with Zhou Youguang (b. 1906) and other luminaries in the Chinese language reform apparatus of the PRC.  He also deepened his appreciation for the pellucid analyses of problems related to the Chinese writing system by such distinguished linguists as Lü Shuxiang (1904-1998), Li Jinxi (1890-1978), and Wang Li (1900-1986), and by writers of the stature of Mao Dun (1896-1981) who recognized the need for additional applications of pinyin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoyed by what he considered to be the backtracking of Mao Zedong and the waffling of Zhou Enlai with regard to their earlier commitment to romanization, John poured his heart and soul into works such as &lt;em&gt;The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1984), in which he destroyed many widespread myths about Chinese characters (ideographic, universality, emulatability, monosyllabic, indispensability, successfulness), and "Digraphia," &lt;em&gt;Word&lt;/em&gt;, 35.1 (1984), 59-66, in which he strenuously advocated a two-track system for writing in China: characters and pinyin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John's magnum opus, however, is &lt;em&gt;Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing&lt;/em&gt; (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1989), which has on its cover a stunning illustration consisting of the phonetic representation of the first six words of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address transcribed as follows: acoustic wave graph of the voice of William S.-Y. Wang, IPA, roman letters, Cyrillic, devanagari, hangul, Egyptian hieroglyphics, Arabic, katakana, Yi (Lolo, Nuosu, etc.), cuneiform, and sinograms (a fuller version of the cover illustration may be found on the frontispiece [facing the title page] and there is a generous explanation on pp. 248-251).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visible Speech&lt;/em&gt; contains countless feats of outstanding linguistic inquiry (for a tour de force example, see John's revealing treatment of a Yukaghir love letter).  In essence, &lt;em&gt;Visible Speech&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that in terms of the nature of writing systems globally - there is nothing particularly special or unique about Chinese characters, except perhaps how difficult and phonetically imprecise they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last stage of John's career as a Chinese linguist began in the early 1990s, just after he had become an octogenarian, upon the occasion of which many of his friends contributed to a &lt;a href="http://www.pinyin.info/readings/Schriftfestschrift.html"&gt;Schriftfestschrift&lt;/a&gt;.  From that time until his death, John labored tirelessly and selflessly on the ABC (Alphabetically Based Computerized) Chinese dictionaries.  These revolutionary dictionaries are a monumental achievement that make it easy to look up whole words by their sounds instead of by the shapes of the individual characters used to write the syllables of which they are composed.  In the not-too-distant future, the massive ABC dictionary database will be made available online, a move that is sure to greatly enhance information technology for Chinese.  Finally, the proofreading for the crowning achievement of the ABC series, the portable English-Chinese Chinese-English (ECCE) dictionary, was virtually concluded on the day John&lt;br&gt;
took his last breath.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233014770795"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/activism_must_be_accessible">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e3e1d60fa2b9847</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Activism Must Be Accessible</title><published>2009-01-27T00:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-27T00:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/activism_must_be_accessible" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3097/3211752086_118c16eabe_m.jpg" alt="u.s. capital building from the front, fenced off with a sign that reads no access" style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://moveon.org/"&gt;MoveOn.org&lt;/a&gt; is an organization for progressive political activism in U.S. politics.  It includes both an online component and in-person events.  The first line of the &lt;a href="http://www.moveon.org/about.html"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; section reads "The MoveOn family of organizations brings real Americans back into the political process."  Recently though it was brought to my attention that some "real Americans" are being left out of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan Ellis, President and Chief Organizer of &lt;a href="http://gonextstep.org/"&gt;Next Step&lt;/a&gt; reports,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Presidential campaign, MoveOn.org invited me and other of its members who belong to Next Step to dozens of local Obama campaign events at private homes. After the elections, MoveOn sponsored local training events to teach people how to mobilize others to support the Obama agenda, to which we were also invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some invitations indicated up front that the locations were inaccessible. Others did not, but when I was able to contact the local sponsors, I found none of them were. Carole Tonks checked out 6 in the Jersey Shore area and found only one that was accessible. Zinke McGeady checked out all within a thirty-mile radius of her home in South Jersey, none of which were accessible. Luke Koppisch made similar inquiries in the Camden-Burlington area with similar results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts by Ellis to contact MoveOn.org about the accessibility concerns have been met not with the democratic response one might expect from an organization that supports human rights, but with "thanks for your comment" type form letters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not meaning here to pick on MoveOn.org exclusively (and they have done their share of good work), but this situation points out the larger issue of the enormous amount of effort still to be done to make activism accessible--to enable people with disabilities to participate fully in public policy.  This is critical not just from a human rights and legal (ADA) standpoint, but because public policy decisions can affect us deeply: Nothing about us without us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reminded here of a situation that I'm in myself where most of the disability activist groups in my area meet in person, require members to be able to use the telephone, and assume a level of interpersonal communication, which, without considerable assistance, I frankly do not possess.  It's been a huge struggle for me, still unresolved, to figure out how I can assist with the work these organizations are doing, and which I care deeply about, without being afforded the accommodations I need to be an effective advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is needed here is greater awareness of the access needs of people with disabilities in general and in the arena of activism in particular.

In Texas, a bill has been introduced to allow public school special education students to use state funds to enroll in private school. &lt;a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/html/HB00716I.htm"&gt;House Bill 716&lt;/a&gt; was introduced by State Rep. Debbie Riddle (R-Tomball). As noted in &lt;a href="http://capitolannex.com/2009/01/26/bill-would-allow-vouchers-for-special-education-students-to-attend-private-schools/"&gt;Capitol Annex&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill, House Bill 716, would also allow special education students to transfer to any other public school within the school district in which the student resides, or in another public school district even if the student does not reside there.&lt;br&gt;
.......&lt;br&gt;
There are a few differences between this and &lt;a href="http://capitolannex.com/2007/02/28/sb-1000-the-autism-voucher-bill/"&gt;other special education scholarship/voucher programs such as those introduced last year&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, the only private schools qualified to receive the funds must be accredited; must adhere to a requirement that they not “advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion,” (which may well knock a lot of religious schools out of this one); must administer the appropriate TEA-approved assessment instruments (such as end-of-course exams and standardized tests) or an equivalent nationally “norm-referenced” assessment approved by &lt;a href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us/"&gt;TEA&lt;/a&gt; [Texas Education Agency].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://capitolannex.com/2007/02/28/sb-1000-the-autism-voucher-bill/"&gt;other special education scholarship/voucher programs such as those introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; alluded to included &lt;a href="http://capitolannex.com/2007/02/28/sb-1000-the-autism-voucher-bill/"&gt;SB 1000: The Autism Voucher Bill&lt;/a&gt;, which was filed in February of 2007. SB 1000 would create the create the “Autism Services Accessibility Program” and allow autistic students to transfer within a particular school district, to a public school in another school district, or to an accredited private school equipped to deal with students with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros and cons of such a voucher: Students could use public funds to attend accredited private schools best suited to their educational needs, or that seemed to provide such. But would public schools then have less of a motivation to create quality special education programs? Would chances for inclusion be further limited or even eliminated, for special ed students who might benefit from these?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hearing was another in a series of open forums leading up to the board’s vote on the science curriculum in March. At these meetings, the public is invited to address the board in person, and so far, supporters of good science have bettered the opposition in numbers and eloquence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the board is not obligated to act according to the public testimony, however, it is still not clear if all the supporters for sound science education will sway the board away from pushing a creationist agenda when it adopts new statewide science standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap the issue, the debate centers on a passage in the current Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) guidelines for Earth and Space Science (ESS) that requires students to critique all scientific theories. Specifically, they are required to explore “the strengths and weaknesses” of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This standard, with the “the strengths and weaknesses” language, was originally passed to please religious conservatives. In Texas, religious conservatives are a very squeaky wheel, and they’ve had this bit of grease for nearly 20 years. The good news is, in practice teachers rarely pay attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with seven of the 15 current state board members openly creationist, and with the TEKS guidelines coming up for a vote in 2009 and new textbook selection based on those new guidelines to follow, this issue can no longer simply be ignored by science teachers and citizens in favor of sound science education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that in mind, a review panel assigned to revise the curriculum proposed dropping the words “the strengths and weaknesses” from the TEKS guidelines, urging students instead to “analyze and evaluate scientific explanations using empirical evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern of biologists and science teachers is that if the “the strengths and weaknesses” language remains in the TEKS guidelines, the board could then force textbook publishers to include what some conservative religious people see as weaknesses in Darwin’s theory. This ploy is a latter day scheme by creationists to sow doubt about science and support the Biblical version of creation. (For more information about what the “strengths and weaknesses” of evolution are supposed to be, Google Ben Stein or the Discovery Institute. Or you can save time and just stare off into space. Both options are equally enlightening.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the board did amend the proposed TEKS guidelines last week in order to have a final draft ready for the March vote. And in what many are calling a &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/01/victory-over-weaknesses-texas-004236"&gt;victory for sound science&lt;/a&gt;, the the Texas State Board of Education approved a revision of the state’s science standards that lacks the controversial “strengths and weaknesses” language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all of the board’s actions last week were met with such approval. Steven Schafersman of &lt;a href="http://www.texscience.org/"&gt;Texas Citizens for Science&lt;/a&gt; attended the hearing, and reports on the amendments made to the guidelines. He says that there were 13 proposed changes to the TEKS guidelines for ESS, and not all of them are so favorable to good science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . all 13 of the proposed changes…are not needed and were proposed to weaken and damage the ESS TEKS. The reasons for the proposed changes were to “qualify” the ESS standards and add “humility and tentativeness” to them. These are not good scientific reasons to revise science standards, but just the opposite. The standards were written by Earth science professionals and experts, but [the board] took the advice of two non-Earth scientists to write [the] changes, Dr. Stephen Meyer of the Discovery Institute and Dr. Charles Garner of the Baylor University chemistry department. Neither of these two gentlemen is an “expert” in Earth and Space Science as claimed by [some members of the board], and Dr. Meyer is not a scientist at all. To the contrary, both have religious and pseudoscientific agendas that wish to promote Intelligent Design Creationism, a non-scientific doctrine, and their suggestions have that effect on the ESS curriculum . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it appears Schafersman is right. Looking at each amended passage in the guidelines, one gets the impression that an agenda is still being pushed. Schafersman outlines some of the revisions as follows (the original standard is included first, followed by the revision).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) &lt;strong&gt;Earth in Space and Time&lt;/strong&gt;. The student knows how Earth-based and space-based astronomical observations reveal the structure, scale, composition, origin, and history of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) &lt;strong&gt;Earth in Space and Time&lt;/strong&gt;. The student knows how Earth-based and space-based astronomical observations reveal &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;differing theories about&lt;/span&gt; the structure, scale, composition, origin, and history of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revision is very suspect, and as Schafersman points out, scientifically awkward and unacceptable. There is only one scientific theory of the structure, scale, composition, origin, and history of the universe. It’s called the Big Bang Theory. There are no “differing theories” and it is unscientific to claim otherwise. The purpose, it seems, is to suggest that there are alternative explanations for these phenomena, but the only alternative explanation ever proposed in this regard is not a scientific theory but a religious myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) &lt;strong&gt;Earth in Space and Time&lt;/strong&gt;. The student knows that Earth’s place in the solar system is explained by the solar nebular accretionary disk model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) &lt;strong&gt;Earth in Space and Time&lt;/strong&gt;. The student &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;understands&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;that Earth’s place in the solar system is explained by&lt;/span&gt;the solar nebular accretionary disk model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Schafersman points out that substituting “understands” for “knows” is a minor change. But the phrase “that the Earth’s place in the solar system is explained by” explains the context, and removing it weakens the guideline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5)(B) investigate sources of heat, including kinetic heat of impact accretion, gravitational compression, and radioactive decay, which allows protoplanet differentiation into layers;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5)(B) investigate sources of heat, including kinetic heat of impact accretion, gravitational compression, and radioactive decay, which &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;are thought to allow &lt;/span&gt;protoplanet differentiation into layers;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schafersman concedes this is yet another minor change, but maintains it also weakens the standard. He points out that scientists are very sure that Earth’s internal heat allowed protoplanet Earth to differentiate. In fact, there is no other known method, and none have been hypothesized, so it is silly and awkward to say that heat is “thought to allow” differentiation, but is not strictly scientifically inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the word ”allows” was correctly changed to “allow”, since it refers to “sources”, not “heat”. This mistake apparently escaped the grammar checkers in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(8)(A) evaluate a variety of fossil types, transitional fossils, fossil lineages, and significant fossil deposits with regard to their appearance, completeness, and rate and diversity of evolution;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(8)(A) evaluate a variety of fossil types, &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;proposed&lt;/span&gt; transitional fossils, fossil lineages, and significant fossil deposits &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;with regard to their appearance, completeness, and rate and diversity of evolution&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;and assess the arguments for and against universal common descent in light of this fossil evidence&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change is by far the most unscientific revision. (Also, suspiciously, several important words were struck by the revision that were not announced to the public beforehand.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, transitional fossils are not “proposed”. There is no doubt about their existence; they exist in reality and are well-known by paleontologists, so insertion of the word “proposed” makes that part unscientific, since it suggests a false uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the phrase “with regard to their appearance, completeness, and rate of diversity of evolution” should not have been removed since it is essential to the purpose of the standard, which is to evaluate fossils and their evolution. The removal weakens the evolution content of the standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the phrase “and assess the arguments for and against universal common descent in light of this fossil evidence” is totally unscientific. There are no good arguments in modern science “against universal common descent”. It has been accepted by biologists for over 130 years, so the phrase is asking for something that authors and publishers cannot honestly supply. The added phrase supports an anti-evolution intent which is not scientific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schafersman says this change in particular will make the entire ESS standards an object of ridicule, since it will reveal that the science standards of Texas are subject to ideological revision by public officials who ignore the good advice of the expert scientists they themselves appointed to write science standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hats off to Steven Schafersman for the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned. There’s sure to be more to come as the Texas State Board of Education votes on new TEKS guidelines in March.&lt;/p&gt;

Sex is awesome isn't it!? Things we love being bad for us always makes for a depressing story, which is of course a good story for the media peeps. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saying that the BBC story is quite good actually, pointing out that the sample size is too small and so on, but the others are worse. The Italian one starts like so:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Sexual abstinence, besides opening the gates to paradise, also seems to prolong the lives of men.&lt;/blockquote&gt;That's a neutral point of view if every I saw one. But more importantly not a single one of these articles mentions the increase in terms of the quantitative risk of getting the disease (aka the natural frequency, or in this case how many people per 100,000 will get prostate cancer every year). As we will see is kind of a big deal. I've had a spare ten minutes so I've just guesstimated what that would be. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So lets ignore the very small sample size. Lets ignore the complexity of comparing the rate men masturbate. Lets ignore the fact that people who have more sex might do lots of other things to excess too (like drugs and rock and roll) so the idea that it is specifically sex isn't necessarily true (though they make sensible sounding hormonal claims to my non-biologist ears). Anyhow lets ignore all that and take the worst values we can find.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;For about 400 cancer stricken men 40% had lots of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;bump-and-grind&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;For about 400 cancer free men 32% had lots of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;chummy-time-sex-wees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So you might think that means your chance of getting Prostate Cancer increases by 20% by &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;plunging-your-oats &lt;/span&gt;to excess. Which sounds quite scary until you realise that's only a 20% increase over the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;natural frequency&lt;/span&gt; of getting the disease in the first place. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And from a quick google &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; 117 in every 100,000 men get prostate cancer in a year. &lt;/span&gt;(according to &lt;a href="http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/prostate/incidence/"&gt;UK Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt; - oh and I chose the largest value I could find - because if your doing a quick guesstimate you may as well go conservative).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which means that at maximum if everyone had lots and lots of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;how's-your-father&lt;/span&gt;, then the number getting prostate cancer would increase from 117 in every 100,000 to &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;140&lt;/span&gt; in every 100,000.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or to put it another way by having lots of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;hide-the-sausage&lt;/span&gt; your chance of catching prostate cancer skyrockets from 0.116% to a absolutely no less scary 0.140%. A massive 0.024% increase! QUICK TO CELIBACY! Never shall my loins mingle again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember this isn't to do with the legitimacy of the science involved. This is purely an issue about the way it has been reported. For this, my friends, is how the media turns non-scary medical research into scary &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;everything-you-love-kills-you&lt;/span&gt; stories. I know it may come over a little pedantic to say this, but a lot of people would have read this today and felt guilty over a natural part of their lives, and the media hid the values that might have reassured them that the sex is &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;so fucking worth it &lt;/span&gt;in order to make it scarier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unless your making a horror film why would you want to make peoples lives scarier than needed? Is circulation really that important to you? Is it too much to ask for you to report the risks in a way we can easily judge it?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Oh, and if you are thinking I only wrote this because I've just read Ben Goldacre's book - you would be right)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33112888-2307299781389954501?l=www.skeptobot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Bill)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.skeptobot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.skeptobot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Skeptobot</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skeptobot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233004635906"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/26/super-neptune-caught-by-small-telescopes/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0e6a6481c55b796e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Super-Neptune caught by small telescopes</title><published>2009-01-26T21:00:35Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T21:00:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/26/super-neptune-caught-by-small-telescopes/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You’re standing outside, and it’s a sunny day. You bask in the sunlight, enjoying its warmth, when suddenly it dims a bit. That catches your attention, so you look up, and see a cloud scudding across the Sun. It’s not a thick cloud, but enough to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You understand one of the basic principles of looking for extrasolar planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers at the Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) &lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/press/2009/pr200905.html"&gt;have announced&lt;/a&gt; that they have discovered a planet orbiting a star 120 light years away, using roughly the same technique. Called &amp;quot;transit searching&amp;quot;, &lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~gbakos/HAT/"&gt;they use small telescopes to look at lots and lots of stars&lt;/a&gt; all at the same time. They look for tiny drops in the amount of starlight. This can be caused by a myriad of events: the star might be a variable, or the detector in the camera might be faulty, or an asteroid might have passed between us and the star, or, yes, a cloud may have crossed the ’scope’s field-of-view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, a planet orbiting that star has its orbit aligned so that we see it edge-on, and that planet crosses the face of the star. When that happens, the star light dips a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases like that, the star is flagged for more observations. If the culprit is a planet, and it’s close to the star so that its orbital period is short, it’ll quickly pass in front again on the next orbit, and the dimming repeats. And again, and again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what happened in the case of one star in the constellation of Cygnus. The CfA telescopes bagged a planet dimming the star’s light. We know what kind of star it is, so we know how bright it is, and how big it is. By measuring the amount the light drops, we can say how big the planet is (a bigger planet makes the light drop more than a smaller one). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, by carefully measuring the spectrum of the star over time, we can figure out how hard the planet pulls on the star; that depends on its gravity which depends on its mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the planet, called HAT-P-11b, has a size about 4.7 times the Earth’s, and has about 25 times our mass. To compare, Neptune is 3.8 times the size of Earth, and 17 times the mass, so this new planet is like a beefier Neptune. Doing a little math, we can even determine that this new planet is slightly &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; dense than Neptune. So &amp;quot;beefier&amp;quot; is the wrong word. Puffier, maybe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we know its size, mass, and density… not bad for a planet we can’t even see directly! And knowing its orbital distance from the star (measured from the orbital period) we can guess at its temperature, too. Incredible. All that, from a 0.4% dip in the light from a star (well, that plus some pretty sharp spectral measurements).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s perhaps most amazing about this are the telescopes involved: six of them, each with a mirror only 11 cm (4 inches) in diameter! You don’t need huge telescopes to look for transits. Small ones with electronic detectors (similar to what’s in off-the-shelf cameras) can pretty easily look at bright stars and see a brightness drop of 1% or less. In many ways they’re better than big ’scopes: they see bigger chunks of the sky, their detectors are cheaper, &lt;em&gt;they’re&lt;/em&gt; cheaper, it’s easy to get time on them — heck, you can build ‘em yourself — and therefore they can stare for long periods of time at a single star or collection of stars, increasing your chance of seeing something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic time to be an astronomer. Cutting-edge stuff is now cheap enough that it’s not hard to set up. Looking for transiting planets would have been incredibly hard before digital detectors, and now you can literally do it from your back yard. And who knows, the next super Neptune discovered might even be the one &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; find.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233004408474"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/sometimes_justice_does_find_quacks.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6293d70141022a7a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Sometimes, justice does find quacks</title><published>2009-01-26T20:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T20:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/JgATDTqJB8g/sometimes_justice_does_find_quacks.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/sometimes_justice_does_find_quacks.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember the quack-friendly scammer &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/an_unexpected_analogy_1.php"&gt;Kevin Trudeau&lt;/a&gt;?

It was a really great time, if a bit cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But during that trip, Maria and my husband got into an argument that almost escalated to broken bones and stitches. And now, I’m asking you to settle this for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never seen Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Friday that we arrived in Pittsburgh, my husband turned on Star Wars (I? IV? “The first one”? “The original”? “A New Hope”? I don’t know what you people call it.) I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to know and what I was not supposed to know. For someone watching with &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; understanding of the story (stories?), it’s very confusing. I couldn’t even follow because I was asking all kinds of questions, not knowing what information I should and should not have at this point in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, while having lunch with Maria and company, I mentioned this. I then asked what order I should watch to minimize my confusion and maximize my Star Wars appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband says I should watch the original 3 then the prequels because that’s how the story was intended to be told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria says I should watch the prequels then the originals to avoid the confusion that comes with having a little bit of knowledge about the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s up to you to settle the score:&lt;strong&gt; What order should a Star Wars newcomer watch the movies? And does that order change based on how much they may already know about the story? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I post his revised table of figures including the diss numbers below the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Shannon writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;…below each of the job numbers [in the right-hand column, from Chris&amp;#39;s table of job ads from 2008] is the number of dissertations listed at proquest in the last 5 years in [each] area…note proquest lists 3124 dissertations in linguistics in the last 5 years in total (I believe I controlled for dissertations in English, and used the subfields as search terms with &amp;quot;linguistics&amp;quot;).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's the result of his count:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4" width="100%"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;General linguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22
&lt;p&gt;(no dissertations in 'general linguistics')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon cautions me to warn that his survey of numbers on proquest was not 'scientific', so consider yourselves duly warned! But there are some interesting discrepancies in the ratios of jobs available to ratios of dissertations produced; compare syntax, e.g, with job:diss ratio of 12:749 (0.016), to applied linguistics, with a job:diss ratio of 20:38 (0.526).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let me just echo Chris&amp;#39;s amazement that every 4-year college in the US doesn&amp;#39;t have a linguist on the faculty. Linguistics is tailor-made for courses that provide a stimulating, analytical, scientific research experience in the absence of significant amounts of expensive lab equipment or external funding. Students are excited about language and usually surprised and intrigued to discover its hidden complexities as well as to learn more about the more obviously attention-grabbing topics… and language is one of the core human capacities‚ surely suggesting it should be included on the curriculum of any humanistically-oriented undergraduate degree program. Four-year colleges, you&amp;#39;re missing a golden opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Heidi Harley</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233000718500"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/going_to_chester.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/82e0dc374b2b8e4d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NOIBN"/><title type="html">Going to Chester</title><published>2009-01-26T18:27:11Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T18:27:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/dixSeHn7x-k/going_to_chester.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/going_to_chester.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next week I'm going to Chester in England to visit the archaeology department there and accept a position as Visiting Research Fellow.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, James Felton, Peter T. Koper, John Mitchell and Michael Stinson &lt;a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=918283"&gt;conducted research&lt;/a&gt; that sought to establish, &lt;em&gt;inter alia&lt;/em&gt; how perceived hotness of professors affected their RateMyProfessors evaluations for teaching quality. As part of this exercise, Felton et al. ranked (Table 2 in their paper) the relative hotness quotients of 36 different academic disciplines. My estimable colleague John Sides prepared a nice graph of the Felton et al. data (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(Political Science is in red for the obvious reason. Farrell was pleased to see that his discipline ranked so high. And noted the low ranking of Economics with glee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://web.mac.com/arnold_zwicky/hotness.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hat tip to James Wimberley.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linguists will of course be disappointed to see that our discipline was not one of the 36 in the Felton et al. study. But then Classics, Astronomy, and Physics were also disregarded (as were Dance, Photography and Cinema, Art History, and a number of other programs you could think of). The list of disciplines clearly wasn&amp;#39;t made up ahead of time, but emerged from what students reported in web-based evaluations of teaching (which is why you get Humanities, Social Science, and plain old Science, in addition to specific disciplines in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences — plus Not Specified).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't been able to get hold of the Felton et al. paper (without paying for it), and I doubt that my time would be well-spent examining its methods. Here's Farrell on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m glad to say that we actually have Real Social Scientific Data&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; that we can bring to bear on [the question of whether academia in general, or political science in particular, is a sexy profession].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Real Social Scientific Data is a term of art here, meaning ‘statistics that are sufficiently entertaining and gratifying&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that I really don’t want to look at them too hard.’ This understanding of data is very commonly applied in the public sphere of learned debate although it is, perhaps surprisingly, rarely spelled out in explicit terms. I note in passing that some commenter at the Monkey Cage wants to control for differences in sex ratios between professors and students and similar irrelevant persnickets. All I want to say to this pedant (whom I suspect to be a jealous chemistry professor or denizen of a similarly low-ranked discipline) is &lt;em&gt;political science is number 5! Suck on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In a collective rather than individual sense (I don’t imagine that I’m pulling my discipline’s score up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 1/27: I've now looked at the Felton et al. paper and can shed some light on some of the details. The list of disciplines was indeed derived from student reports, but with various changes made "due to limited data": Health Science and Medicine were combined; Women's Studies and Ethnic Studies were combined; Physics became part of Science; Architecture became part of Engineering; and Film became part of Communications. Meanwhile, Business faculty were divided, wherever possible, into Accounting, Business Information Systems, Economics, Finance, Management, and Marketing. The analysis is based on ratings for 6,852 faculty from 369 American and Canadian institutions, using only faculty with at least 20 posts on 9/13/03.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students supply ratings to RateMyProfessors on a voluntary basis. They are asked to give ratings on Easiness, Helpfulness, Clarity, Overall Quality, and Hotness. On the last factor, the student can judge a faculty member as "hot" or "not hot", contributing +1 or -1, respectively, to that teacher's raw score, which is then converted to a percentage score, ranging from a low of -100% to a high of +100%. The score for each discipline is the average of the scores for faculty members in that discipline, given in the relevant table as a decimal fraction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These disciplinary scores are all negative, ranging from a low of -.332 (Chemistry) to a high of -.062 (Languages). Faculty members as a group are not particularly hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felton et al. were primarily interested in correlations. They noted "strong positive correlations between Quality and Easiness and between Quality and Hotness" and concluded that "these self-selected evaluations from Ratemyprofessors.com cast considerable doubt on the usefulness of in-class student opinion surveys for purposes of examining quality and effectiveness of teaching."]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/architecture/salamanca.asp"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/01/ancient_astronaut.jpg" alt="Ancient astronaut?"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Does this picture depict an astronaut? I would agree it does. Then why is it carved in the wall of a cathedral &lt;em&gt;that was finished in 1733?&lt;/em&gt; Did the architects of this Spanish cathedral know about humanoid aliens? Did they have astronauts plying space before the American Revolution? Was the architect clairvoyant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, nope, and nope. You might think so, since apparently emails are going around about this. Remember though, if you aren’t sure when you get an email like this, &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/architecture/salamanca.asp"&gt;go to snopes.com&lt;/a&gt;! They have the skinny on this: the astronaut carving is real, but was done during a renovation of the Salamanca cathedral in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple solution to a silly problem. But then, I have sometimes received questions that I cannot answer right away, and in general it’s because the question itself is ill-posed. If you start off emphasizing the date the cathedral was built, you can distract an otherwise skeptical person from realizing that maybe not all of the cathedral was built at the same time, something that seems obvious enough upon reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Moon Hoax believer Joe Rogan told me that Werner von Braun was a Nazi, my initial reaction was to discuss whether or not that was true, when the real question should have been, &amp;quot;So?&amp;quot; What difference does it make? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, when an antiscience question comes up, a lot of the time the solution is found simply and quickly by looking at the question itself, and not the puzzle it ponders. In this case, ancient astronauts aren’t so ancient, and the timeline of a cathedral’s completion didn’t end when the questioner assumed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always question the questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a copy of Adam’s book lying around here somewhere, but I can’t find it right now; I’ve looked through it, but admittedly haven’t read it closely.  You can get some feeling for where he’s coming from by checking out &lt;a href="http://theconstantfire.blogspot.com/"&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt; devoted to the book.  Roughly:  “Sure, simple-minded creationism and a naively interventionist deity is crazy.  But there is something valuable in notions of the sacred and  spiritual endeavor that captures something important about being human, and it’s a mistake to simply dismiss it all under the same umbrella.”  There is a family resemblance to the argument made (in very different words) by Stuart Kauffman in his recent book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Sacred-Science-Reason-Religion/dp/0465003001/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reinventing the Sacred: A New View of Science, Reason, and Religion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Kauffman points out an indisputably true fact:  there is such a large number of possible configurations of the genetic material in a complex organism that we will never come anywhere close to exploring every possible arrangement.  Therefore (he leaps), we have to look beyond simple determinism to understand our world.  There is (he bravely continues) a radical contingency in the way life actually plays itself out, and it makes sense to grapple with this contingency by turning to concepts such as “the sacred.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get the agreement out of the way first.  There is certainly no question that the techniques of fundamental physics are not sufficient for dealing with getting us through our everyday lives.  Even if we are hard-core determinists, and think that every particle and quantum field does nothing but march to the tune of the universal Schrodinger equation, that fact isn’t very helpful when it comes to fixing the economy or listening to music.  We deal with complicated human experiences, and a different set of concepts and vocabulary is required, &lt;em&gt;even if&lt;/em&gt; it’s nothing but the laws of physics underlying it all.  And it would indeed be nice if atheist/materialist thinkers spent more time putting forward a positive agenda of living human life, in addition to their undoubtedly successful programs of understanding the natural world and highlighting the inadequacy of traditional religious belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m very happy to have creative and intelligent people like Frank and Kauffman address these hard issues from the perspective of someone who takes the laws of nature seriously.  However, I continue to be baffled about why they would ever think it was a good idea to invoke words like “spiritual” or “sacred” as part of that endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, words have meanings.   When you start talking about “spirituality,” people are going to take you to mean something that goes &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; the laws of nature, in the sense of being &lt;em&gt;incompatible&lt;/em&gt; with them, not just “hard to understand in terms of them” — something &lt;em&gt;supernatural&lt;/em&gt;.  Now, you may not want them to make that association; that might not be a connotation you wish to invite.  (Or maybe it is, in which case I’ve completely misunderstood.)  And you are free, as was &lt;a href="http://www.sundials.org/about/humpty.htm"&gt;Humpty Dumpty&lt;/a&gt;, to insist that words mean whatever you say they mean.  But it’s a very good strategy for guaranteeing that people will misunderstand you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puzzles of human life, and our mutual sense of wonder, and a feeling of awe when confronted with the cosmos,  are all perfectly respectable topics for discussion.  And there exists perfectly respectable vocabularies for discussing them, that don’t come laden with unfortunate supernatural overtones:  literature, anthropology, psychology, the arts, and so on.  There is a huge disadvantage to throwing around words like “sacred” and “spiritual,” in that you will very frequently be understood (misunderstood, one hopes) to be talking about the supernatural.  So if you really want to rehabilitate those words in the eyes of a cheerful naturalist such as myself, your task is clear:  give very specific examples and contexts in which we gain some sort of understanding by using that vocabulary that we would not gain by sticking to words without those unfortunate connotations.  I’m happy to admit that such a context might be possible, but I haven’t seen anything close to a persuasive argument, so I’ll remain extremely skeptical until one comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, one can’t leave this territory without bringing up Richard Dawkins for some good bashing.  Here is where &lt;a href="http://theconstantfire.blogspot.com/2008/10/dawkins-goodenough-and-god.html"&gt;Adam has a go&lt;/a&gt;.  “Dawkins only addresses a naive and simplistic view of religion,” etc.  We’ve talked before about how &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/10/29/the-god-conundrum/"&gt;“sophisticated” approaches to religion are not any better&lt;/a&gt;, and how Dawkins has &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/02/14/thank-you-richard-dawkins/"&gt;served an extremely valuable rhetorical purpose&lt;/a&gt;.  But there is a deeper point, which is consistently missed by the gentle-minded/accommodationist/agnostic/liberal-religious/sophisticated-theology segment of the debate:  It’s Not About You.  Richard Dawkins was not addressing this kind of touchy-feely non-interventionist religion, for the excellent reason that it doesn’t match up with what the overwhelming majority of religious believers actually believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins was, rather, addressing the kind of religion professed by &lt;a href="http://www.cynical-c.com/?p=12609"&gt;Congressman Paul Broun&lt;/a&gt; (R-GA).  Rep. Broun is shown here, accompanied by two ministers, anointing a doorway in the U.S. Capitol building with oil.  It was the doorway that Barack Obama would walk through on the way to his inauguration, and these well-meaning gentlemen understood that a carefully placed dab of oil might make God look more charitably on the new President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/3l0o2lV2jwo%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Richard Dawkins was arguing against.  This is a member of the U.S. Congress, who in fact is a member of the &lt;em&gt;House Committee on Science and Technology&lt;/em&gt;, who believes that some sort of esoteric rite is going to curry favor with an omnipotent being.  Dawkins is worried about them, not about people who are occasionally impressed with the grandeur of the cosmos.  If the oil-anointers were a tiny minority of religious believers rather than the vast majority, I suspect Dawkins would spend his time worrying about other things.&lt;/p&gt;

But they are items of some interest anyway, so here they are as a potpourri of mini-posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Follow-up on the film Adam (see &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/consulting_on_adam_an_interview_with_jason_ross"&gt;Consulting on Adam, an Interview with Jason Ross&lt;/a&gt;): Adam has &lt;a href="http://www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=42810&amp;amp;Category=521"&gt;won the Alfred P Sloan Prize&lt;/a&gt; at Sundance, an award for "an outstanding feature film focusing on science or technology as a theme, or depicting a scientist, engineer or mathematician as a major character."  Whoot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. In other movie news, high school students in Louisiana &lt;a href="http://www.2theadvocate.com/entertainment/arts/38237399.html?index=1&amp;amp;c=y"&gt;made a film&lt;/a&gt; called Piano Lesson about an Aspergers high school student.  According to the students, the message of the film could be taken as "don't judge a book by its cover" and "treat others the way you want to be treated."  Sounds good to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Entirely unrelated to movies, a school in Denmark has a special program (AspIT) to &lt;a href="http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/article635048.ece"&gt;educate and employ&lt;/a&gt; autistic people in IT.  According to the article not only has the program been successful, but is expanding both geographically and into more areas of study.  Unfortunately I'm a lame American and don't read anything but English (boo on me!) so I couldn't get any further information.  But on the surface the idea of it sounds quite keen!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232992966105"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4085">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d4ac17cceb7da40</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="1000words" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="1000 words"/><category term="natureimages" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="nature images"/><title type="html">Gorilla beringei</title><published>2009-01-26T18:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-02T16:31:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/gorilla-beringe.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of &lt;strong&gt;Kelly Lyon&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="http://kellylyonphotography.com" rel="external "&gt;&lt;a href="http://kellylyonphotography.com" rel="external "&gt;http://kellylyonphotography.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The antivaxxers yell loud and long, but their evidence is anecdotal and doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. But because the forces of antiscience are so vocal, we need to keep restating the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s more force behind the statement: &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090126/ap_on_he_me/med_vaccine_safety"&gt;an Italian study shows that thimerosal has essentially no effect on brain function in children who got a whooping cough vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8499561@N02/2756332192/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/01/syringe.jpg" alt="Syringe, from http://www.flickr.com/photos/8499561@N02/2756332192/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 1400 children who got a thimerosal-based vaccine for pertussis in the early 90s were tested for brain function impariments. The vaccines had different amounts of the mercury-based preservative in them (one had twice the amount of the other), so if thimerosal had any effect on the brain — like causing autism — then the children in the study should have clearly different results depending on what vaccine they got. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They didn’t&lt;/strong&gt;, above what would be expected from chance variations. Even better, the study was randomized in such a way that outside factors like environment wouldn’t play a role, so antivaxxers cannot say it was something else that may be affecting these results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s be clear: &lt;a href="http://www.cispimmunize.org/archives/CDCEliStoneThimerosalTimeline1.30.08.doc"&gt;thimerosal has been known scientifically not to have any link to brain disorders for years&lt;/a&gt; (link goes to a Word doc), and the Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR) vaccine never contained thimerosal anyway. Antivaxxers wrongly targeted thimerosal as a health risk, and thimerosal was removed from vaccines in 2001, but no reduction in autism spectrum disorder diagnoses occurred. In other words, thimerosal is not linked with autism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antivaxxers, not willing to let something like evidence sway them, turned instead to vaccines themselves, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/08/22/antivaxxers-must-be-stopped-now/"&gt;even though many studies have been made showing vaccines in general have no link to autism&lt;/a&gt;. Still, because this group is vocal and has larger-than-life spokesmen (and because it’s very easy to sway the media and public opinion when talking about sick kids, especially because it’s so easy to confuse correlation with causation), antivaxxers still have influence in this country. That’s one reason why we’re seeing outbreaks of preventable diseases.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/24/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-from-a-preventable-disease/"&gt;And kids are dying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect any of this to slow them down; antivaxxers tend to be impervious to evidence-based arguments. As with creationism, quack medicine, and all the other antiscience forces, all we can do is continue to show the public the truth, keep making ourselves heard, and make sure that when nonsense is presented as fact — especially when our children’s health is concerned — we do not tire. Lives are literally at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know that I have been very intrigued by the way the Web is changing the way we use language, especially in science communication, and have inserted my thoughts on that into many a post over the past couple of years. I have also been in a more-or-less continuous communication with &lt;a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~cfcasper/" title=""&gt;Christian Casper&lt;/a&gt; over the past several months, for various reasons (including one really fun one - the Millionth Comment party at the Zoo). So, over those months, we came up with the idea for him to do a session, a little more academic in tone than what most other sessions were going to be, on &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Rhetoric_of_science/" title=""&gt;Rhetoric of science: print vs. web&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the interested lay audience is bypassing the intermediaries of the media, who are more often than not, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/graham_lawton_was_wrong.php" title=""&gt;sensationalist and wrong&lt;/a&gt;, they increasingly rely on science bloggers, most of whom are actual experts, being scientists, for their science news. Bloggers use different rhetoric than journalists, being both more accurate on facts, and using more approachable and readable language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the rise of Open Access publishing is making primary research available to everyone.  Thus, papers originally intended for colleagues as the only audience are now being read by everyone.  I was wondering if this will make the language in scientific papers gradually become more readable, especially as new metrics that include traffic, number of downloads and trackbacks replaces the Impact Factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I had to somehow set the stage for this session. And I mulled a blog post in my head for a long time.  Then, with a perfect timing, and containing everything I wanted in there, I posted &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/12/the_shock_value_of_science_blo.php" title=""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, a blog post that was read very widely, I am happy to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the session was exactly what I wanted and expected.  We had a very interesting discussion about the use of language, mostly between Christian Casper, Henry Gee, Tom Levenson, Leah Gordon, Bob O'Hara, Roger Harris and myself. Check out the wiki page for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are complaining about a court decision that ruled that &lt;a href="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2009/01/moment-of-silence-case-decision.html"&gt;a 'moment of silence' rule in a public school was a veiled attempt to introduce sectarian religious belief into the classroom&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody is afraid of prayer; kids can pray all they want, however they want, whenever they&amp;#39;ve got the free time. However, you don&amp;#39;t get to tell my kids that they have to contemplate your god — do me that favor, and I won&amp;#39;t insist that the schools force your kids to stop whatever they&amp;#39;re doing and think about the nonexistence of same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Dobson, you confused the Constitution with the Declaration of Independence. Our constitution is a secular document that says nothing about the endowment of rights by a creator.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/you_will_be_stupider_after_wat.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ihHksqR9oYw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232986088164"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3805">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/41d3fa31f9f5d9b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="abortion"/><category term="obituary"/><title type="html">The Woman Behind New York State's Abortion Law</title><published>2009-01-26T16:27:37Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T16:27:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/wIc4aXF90cE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/the-woman-behind-new-york-states-abortion-law/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The Times recently reported the death of Constance E.

No doubt many of our readers will appreciate just how scary this prospect is: sea level during the last Ice Age was up to 120 meters &lt;em&gt;lower &lt;/em&gt;than today. Our favourite swimming beaches – be it &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/fotoalbum/oz/oz.html"&gt;Coogee&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney or the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dar%C3%9F"&gt;Darß &lt;/a&gt;on the German Baltic coast – would then all be high and dry, and ports like Rotterdam or Tokyo would be far from the sea. Imagine it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But looking beyond the silly headline (another routine case of careless science reporting), what was the real story behind it? The &lt;em&gt;Mirror &lt;/em&gt;article (like many others) was referring to a new paper by Grinsted, Moore and Jevrejeva published in &lt;em&gt;Climate Dynamics&lt;/em&gt; (see &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/527178062596k202/"&gt;paper &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.glaciology.net/Home/PDFs/Announcements/gslprojection"&gt;media materials&lt;/a&gt;). The authors conclude there that by 2100, global sea level could rise between 0.7 and 1.1 meters for the B1 emission scenario, or 1.1 to 1.6 meters for the A1FI scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method by which they derive these estimates is based on a semi-empirical formula connecting global sea level to global temperature, fitted to observed data. It assumes that after a change in global temperature, sea level will exponentially approach a new equilibrium level with a time scale τ. This extends the semi-empirical method I &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Nature/rahmstorf_science_2007.pdf"&gt;proposed in &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in 2007. I assumed that past data will tell us the&lt;em&gt; initial rate&lt;/em&gt; of rise (and this initial rate is useful for projections if the time scale τ is long compared to the time horizon one is interested in). The new paper tries to obtain both the time scale τ and the final equilibrium sea level change by fitting to past data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my approach is a special case of Grinsted&amp;#39;s more general model, as you can see by inserting their Eq. (1) into (2): namely the special case for long response times (τ &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 100 years or so). Hence it is reassuring and a nice confirmation that they get the same result as me for their &amp;quot;Historical&amp;quot; case (where they get τ=1200 years) as well as their τ=infinite calculations, despite using a different sea level data set (going back to 1850, where I used the &lt;a href="http://www.pol.ac.uk/psmsl/author_archive/church_white/GRL_Church_White_2006_024826.pdf"&gt;Church&amp;amp;White 2006&lt;/a&gt; data that start in 1880) and a more elaborate statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I find their determination of τ is on rather shaky ground since the data sets used are too short to determine such a long time scale with any confidence. That their statistics suggest otherwise cannot be right - you can tell by the fact that they get contradictory results for different data sets (e.g., 1200 +/- 500 years for the "Historical" case and 210 +/- 70 years for the "Moberg" case). Both can’t be correct, so the narrow uncertainty ranges are likely an underestimate of the uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem gets even more apparent when looking at the equilibrium sea level resulting from their data fit. From paleoclimatic data (see Figure) we expect that per degree of temperature change, the final equilibrium sea level change is somewhere between 10 and 30 meters (as I argue in my &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;paper – this was my basis for assuming τ must be very long). Grinsted et al. find from their data fit that this is only 1.3 +/- 0.4 meters (for the Moberg case, which they call the most likely) - see Figure. This means that getting the sea level lowering of ~120 meters that is well-established for the Last Glacial Maximum would have required a global cooling of about 90 ºC according to their model. And for the future, the model would predict that melting all ice in Greenland and Antarctica (resulting in 65 meters of sea level rise) would require about 50 ºC of global warming. This lack of realism matters, since it is directly linked to the short τ: the observed sea level rise of the past century or so can either be fitted by a short τ and a small equilibrium rise, or by a long τ and a large equlibrium rise (per degree). I consider the latter case the realistic one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;font size="-1"&gt;Global mean temperature and sea level (relative to today’s) at different times in Earth’s history, together with the projection for the year 2100 (which is not an equilibrium change!). The red line shows the "most likely" equilibrium response according to Grinsted et al. [Modified after &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Global-Warming-Understanding-David-Archer/dp/1405140399/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1232716877&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Archer (2006)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wbgu.de/wbgu_sn2006_en.pdf"&gt;WBGU 2006&lt;/a&gt;; see p. 33 there for references and discussion.]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grinsted et al. did apply some paleoclimatic data constraints, but they are based on a misunderstanding of these data. They assume (their constraint 3) that the last interglacial was globally 3-5 ºC warmer than present – however the reference cited in support (the &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter6.pdf"&gt;IPCC paleoclimate chapter&lt;/a&gt;, of which I am a co-author) explains that these are Arctic summer temperatures. This Arctic summer warming is due to orbital changes which cause cooling elsewhere on the planet, resulting in global mean changes that are very small (see e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Journals/kubatzki00.pdf"&gt;Kubatzki et al. 2000&lt;/a&gt;). Grinsted et al make the same mistake for glacial climate (their constraint 4), where they assume glacial maximum temperatures were globally 17 ºC below present – the reference cited states already in the abstract that this only applies to the latitude band 40-80ºN. Glacial cooling was highly non-uniform, with global mean cooling estimated as 4-7ºC (see &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Journals/schneider_etal_grl_2006.pdf"&gt;Schneider et al. 2006, “How cold was the Last Glacial Maximum?”&lt;/a&gt;) These misguided paleo-constraints lead Grinsted et al. to limit equilibrium sea level rise to a fraction of what the data points show in the Figure above, and this rules out a good data fit for long time scales τ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons I am unconvinced by the short τ found (or assumed) by Grinsted et al. which is the key difference to my earlier study, and I would still maintain that assuming the equilibration time to be very long is a more robust assumption. Note that (unlike Grinsted et al.) this does not assume that the approach to equilibrium is exponential with a single time scale, which in itself is doubtful given the different processes involved. It only assumes that the &lt;em&gt;initial &lt;/em&gt;rate of rise scales with temperature and is relevant on time scales of interest. On the positive side, Grinsted et al. have shown that the data fit and projected sea level rise for the case of large τ is robust with respect to the chosen statistical method and data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinements of the semi-empirical approach are welcome - I had hoped that my paper would stimulate further work in this direction. While empirical approaches will not give us definitive answers about future sea level since the past can never be a perfect analogue of the future, these analyses can still be useful to give us a better feeling for how the sea level responded in the past and what that might imply for what lies ahead. But one thing is certain: I'm not too worried that sea level might drop to glacial levels during this century.&lt;/p&gt;

On the morning of Tuesday, January 6, 2009, a group of villagers in the Highlands region dragged the woman to a dumpsite, stripped and bound her, stuffed a rag in her mouth, and tied her to a log. She was then set ablaze atop a pile of tires. According to the country’s Post-Courier newspaper, last year more than fifty persons were put to death in two Highlands provinces for allegedly practicing sorcery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such practices occur elsewhere around the world, for example in South Africa and neighboring tribal areas, as I learned from Joachim Kaetzler, author of Magie und Strafrecht in Südafrica (“Magic and Criminal Law in South Africa,” 2001). As he told me in an interview in Darmstadt, Germany, in 2007, he conducted research in the mid-1990s while living in various South African townships and villages. He was investigating what he called a “powerful belief in magic,” which extended, he said, even to the well-educated, and had strong implications to the legal system. A poll of 400 black Afrikaner law students revealed that between eighty and ninety percent believed in witches, and more than half had actually consulted a witch doctor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Kaetzler, a witch doctor functions as an intermediary between the living and the ancestral spirits of the dead. He typically acts as a fortuneteller, herbal doctor, informal tribal chief, and diviner of witches. As well, priests may embrace superstitious beliefs and adopt magical practices in their churches. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As in Papua New Guinea and elsewhere, the South African “witch” is often a scapegoat for some accidental misfortune or even the crime of another. In one instance, a drunk man had an accident in which a child died, but his guilt was supposedly mitigated by a diviner’s uncovering of the one who “bewitched” him. That man voluntarily confessed (as do about a third of all “witches”), walked to the center of the village, and was stoned to death. Each year in South Africa, some seven- to eight-hundred persons perish in witch-related incidents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Belief in witchcraft—whether sweeping Europe from the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries, or Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692, or some of the world’s tribal villages in the twenty-first century—is a frightening delusion. It not only continues to claim lives, but even in its milder manifestations, such as soothsaying and spirit communication, it promotes fantasy—always at the expense of science and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

But perhaps he would have turned out to be a Sicilian with an illicit cargo and would have refused to talk to me about it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train sped on toward Utrecht and Nijmegen, leaving me wondering if &lt;i&gt;omerta&lt;/i&gt; could possibly be a word in some other language as well, with a perfectly innocent meaning — a girl&amp;#39;s name in Dutch, say (&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d like you to meet my fiancée, Omerta Knooihuizen&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pairs of distinct words that are written identically are called &lt;b&gt;homographs&lt;/b&gt;, and you get them within languages as well as across languages.  One surprising homographic pair in English shares the spelling &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape_(disambiguation)"&gt;&lt;i&gt;agape&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It's the spelling for both the Anglo-Saxon word meaning "with mouth hanging open" and the Greek word for Christian brotherly love (often written &lt;i&gt;agapē&lt;/i&gt;, with a macron over the &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, to distinguish it).  They sound very different (‘uh-gape’ versus ‘agga-pay’), but from the common spelling without the macron you might never know it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;Happy Chinese New Year, everybody! Today is the first day of the year of the Ox according to the farmers' calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rundkvist family is heavily secularised, to the extent that I have let slip almost all Western observances and have very vague ideas about the Chinese ones. So, to learn what this day is traditionally about, I turn as always to Wikipedia, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_new_year#First_day_of_the_new_year"&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt; that I should:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Welcome the deities of the heavens and earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not eat meat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not cook.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the most senior members of my extended family.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hire a lion dance troupe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give money to my kids.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set off fire crackers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these activities and abstentions, I find only the visit to family, the lion dance troupe and the fire crackers attractive. Sadly, I have no crackers and I can't afford hiring dancers. But it so happens that I am spending the day at the house of the most senior member of my patrilineage, viz. my dad. So apparently I'm celebrating!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/happy_chinese_new_year_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/E-dm54EGMIA" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232978965929"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_582.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/494c856b83706448</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-01-26T13:26:49Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T13:26:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/1TCBgmAHrK4/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_582.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_582.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_582.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_582.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/1TCBgmAHrK4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232978904380"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1073">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a798f63a98348c70</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">Emoticons as skin care</title><published>2009-01-26T14:04:52Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T14:04:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1073" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.arcamax.com/zits"&gt;Zits&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The strip takes  it for granted than emoticons are a sort of transcription of facial expression, rather than indications of the attitude that the writer wants to project, via icons of stereotypical facial expressions. Whether or not it would cause wrinkles, this information is missing from written forms of language, since the projection of attitude in speech lacks the intersubjective &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=600"&gt;constancy&lt;/a&gt; that makes the identification and transcription of word sequences possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although emoticons were suggested in a primitive form by Ambrose Bierce in 1877, in the form of "the snigger point, or note of cachinnation", the full development didn't take place until the expansion of various forms of mass electronic communication, during the two decades following Scott Fahlman's 1982 BB post (see "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004935.html"&gt;The prehistory of emoticons&lt;/a&gt;", 9/21/2007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, this is almost exactly the same time period as the development of the scientific version of the emoticon, namely the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_Action_Coding_System"&gt;Facial Action Coding System&lt;/a&gt; — the first version came out in 1976, and the current version was published in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;a href="http://fox.com/blogs/lietome/"&gt;FACS analysis is on national television every week&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s reasonable to wonder whether emoticons might see a new period of development, in a more abstract direction, leading to something less like icons of stereotypical faces and more like the multidimensional analysis of FACS. I doubt it — as I suggested above, emoticons are not really a transcription of facial expressions, but rather a set of emergent conventions for communicating attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of Paul Ekman's work on facial expressions is an interesting study in intellectual politics, sketched in two earlier LL posts: &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003720.html"&gt;Political correctness, biology and culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003725.html"&gt;The cabinet of Dr. Birdwhistell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232977886083"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/new_study_on_vaccine_safety">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49ca040c91968baa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">New Study on Vaccine Safety</title><published>2009-01-26T13:50:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T13:50:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/new_study_on_vaccine_safety" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://publichealth.yale.edu/eip/pictures/VACCINE.jpg" height="92" alt="Vaccines image from Yale Public Health" style="float:left" width="218"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further evidence that vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal are safe from a study by Italian researchers published today in &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;.  From the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jp7ZD1RFVm7yOzgaB04Ra4dY_ZuQD95UKPPG0"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1990s, thousands of healthy Italian babies in a study of whooping cough vaccines got two different amounts of the preservative thimerosal (pronounced thih-MEHR'-uh-sawl) from all their routine shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years later, 1,403 of those children took a battery of brain function tests. Researchers found small differences in only two of 24 measurements and those "might be attributable to chance," they wrote in the February issue of the journal Pediatrics, which was released Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one case of autism was found, and that was in the group that got the lower level of thimerosal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like any new and complex tool, however, it is critical to understand how the tool works, especially when interpreting research. A new study published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; may cause fMRI researchers to change how they conduct an interpret their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fMRI is an application of regular MRI, made possible by advances in computer processing power and researchers finding new ways to exploit how living tissue responds to a powerful magnetic field. In the case of fMRI it was discovered that blood reacts differently when it is highly oxygenated than when it is less oxygenated. This is because oxyhemoglobin (the form of hemoglobin with oxygen) is diamagnetic, while deoxyhemoglobin (the form of hemoglobin without oxygen) is paramagnetic. Most living tissue (and in fact most stuff) is diamagnetic - in response to a strong external magnetic field it creates a weak opposite magnetic field. In superconductors this property can be exploited to create levitation above a strong magnet. A paramagnetic substance, rather, in response to a strong external magnetic field creates an attractive magnetic field. Unlike ferromagnetic materials (like iron), diamagnetic and paramagnetic substances lose their magnetic field as soon as the external field ends - they are not permanent or long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this means that oxygenated and less oxygenated blood behave differently in the magnetic field of an MRI and this differential response can be exploited to image relative arterial blood flow to different parts of the brain. An entire branch of neuroscientific research has sprung up over this fact - using fMRI to see which parts of the brain are active when subjects are asked to perform a specific task, when they are exposed to external stimuli, or in different disease states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, using fMRI in such research is based upon the assumption (reasonable, but an assumption none-the-less) that blood flow as imaged by fMRI correlates with brain activity.  This premise is based upon sound physiological knowledge, and also experience from other technologies, such as PET and SPECT scanning, that also image blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is also this exact premise that is being challenged, at least to a degree, with this new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists Yevgeniy Sirotin and Aniruddha Das at Columbia University performed studies on two monkeys. They monitored their brain activity with implanted electrodes and simultaneously monitored their cerebral blood volume and oxygenation with optical methods. They then exposed the monkeys in a dark room to a tiny light at regular intervals and rewarded the monkeys if they fixed their gaze on the light for a few seconds. What they found is that the electrical activity in the visual cortex remained stable (there was not enough light to cause significant activity in the visual cortex),  however the blood flow did rise and fall and peaked a few seconds before the light was to go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed in this study that blood flow and cortical activity were not closely correlated. Of course, interpretation is key. As reported in a &lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/121/1"&gt;Science news article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings “by no means call into question the whole body of fMRI research,” Das says they should cause fMRI researchers to rethink how they design and interpret their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree this study does not contradict the whole of fMRI research. The usual caveats apply - this was just one study with two subjects, for example. Many studies with various study designs will be necessary to see which variables are important for determining blood flow and cortical activity. But taking these results at face value, what can they mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not seem as if there was no relationship with blood flow and brain activity. The changes in blood flow were not random - they correlated with the task. One interpretation is that the specific measures of blood flow in this study are more sensitive to changes in brain activity than the electrical recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another intriguing possibility is that the brain can anticipate its metabolic needs and increase blood flow to parts of the cortex that are about to become active. In this study the light was shown at a regular interval, and the monkeys were being rewarded for fixing their gaze upon it. Perhaps they were anticipating the appearance of the light and priming their visual cortex for the task, but because the light was so small it didn’t actually require that much visual cortical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is typical for scientific research, this new finding does not so much contradict prior research as add a new level of depth and complexity. There is copious evidence that blood flow tracks with brain activity, but this relationship is probably not as simple as was at first assumed. The good news is that if there in an anticipatory effect, as suggested by this research, then that is something that can be controlled for in the design and interpretation of future fMRI studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means there is a previously unknown physiological mechanism in the brain for anticipating immediate metabolic needs. This makes sense as the brain is a hungry organ, requiring incredible optimization of delivery of glucose and oxygen as well as a tightly controlled metabolic environment. Even a fleeting drop in blood pressure, or a drop in blood sugar, can cause someone to pass out. Therefore if there were a way to deliver much needed oxygen and glucose to brain tissue just prior to its increased activity, that would be a useful adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this study does more than anything else is raise an interesting question, and will likely result in a slew of follow up research. There will likely be criticism and disagreement as well. But that’s the nature of science - it’s all good.&lt;/p&gt;

Please be on the look out for this car thief.  He is described as a white quadruped, bearded and hoofed, with a singular vocabulary and a penchant for eating grass, devouring fibers, and stealing Mazdas.  He is considered horned and dangerous. He might shoot milk in your direction, so please, if you see the suspect, call the authorities immediately or call reporters at The Vanguard newspaper.  They are the ones that initially reported the crime.  &lt;a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D95T2NI80&amp;amp;show_article=1"&gt;Here is the story&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of Breitbart, in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is really not a whole lot to be said from the halls of science about this claim. It is just another reminder, albeit a humorous one in this case, that there are parts of the world where belief in magic and superstition not only outweigh science and rational thought, but science and rational thought are downright absent. Today it is a report about people transforming into goats using black magic.  Tomorrow we will read about children that are tortured and killed because adults think they are witches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medieval beliefs yield medieval results.&lt;/p&gt;

I definitely thought about liveblogging it, but honestly, it's been done better by other people already. I have nothing new to add. It's exactly as bad as you've been told, if not a little worse, and I'm glad that I've read the accounts of the interviewees beforehand. I'm also glad that I had the &lt;a href="http://www.bogosity.tv/forum/index.php?topic=27.0"&gt;lie-correction subtitles&lt;/a&gt; open on my computer (haven't quite figured out how to get them onto a copy of the disc yet). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The whole film is an exercise in dishonesty, logical fallacies, projection, and the celebration of ignorance. The only time evidence was &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; mentioned was in how the "Darwinists" are "distorting" it; there's no discussion of evidence for ID (or why that would even be a &lt;i&gt;concern&lt;/i&gt;), nor is there any real discussion of the typical Creationist talking points against the fossil record, radiometric dating, and so forth. There's a concerted effort to avoid talking about evidence at all, which I imagine is because even considering it causes the film's thesis to fall apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The movie, as you know, posits a conspiracy--explicitly including "The Academy," "Watchdog Groups," "The Media," and "The Courts"--which is keeping people from even asking the relevant questions about Design and campaigning to keep these crusading Intelligent Design advocates out of the system. It goes against all our American values of freedom and democracy, but the conspiracy goes beyond America. It's a global confederation that controls science and is against religion, even though ID isn't actually religious. This conspiracy is massively well-funded and powerful, though prominent scientists, thinkers, and politicians all over the world are questioning the Darwinist dogma. The whole concept is ridiculous--who makes up this conspiracy? How efficient must it be that it can operate so broadly and so powerfully when it seemingly requires its entire contingency to be atheists? Somehow, the tiny number of scientifically-minded atheists is able to subjugate and persecute the vast billions of religious people. It's global apartheid! And somehow, this massive global conspiracy can't &lt;i&gt;stop&lt;/i&gt; this movie (or the books involved, or the interviews with scientists) from being produced; somehow, this conspiracy doesn't see the value in pandering to those religious billions. How much more funding would be available if the Big Science conspirators were investigating Creationist and Biblical principles? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The interviews themselves may be the most painful bit of the film. I've never seen such dishonest questioning tactics and interviews so shallow due to editing tricks. The questions are frequently leading or loaded, often non sequitur, and repetitive--dear FSM, are they repetitive. Michael Shermer noted in his &lt;a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/2008/06/expelled-exposed/#more-412"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that Stein asked him the same question a dozen different ways, clearly fishing for some particular response. This is blatantly obvious in his interview with Dawkins, where he asks "do you believe in God" in at least a dozen different and increasingly frustrating ways. I can only imagine how this might have influenced Dawkins' other comments; if someone's being that intentionally obtuse and thick-headed, I can imagine it might lead to some bristling and irritation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film is awful in every measurement. It makes Michael Moore's worst offenses look positively fair by comparison, and I'm pretty sure it invents new ways to be dishonest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the worst things, though, is that the movie really confirmed a lot of my suspicions and misgivings regarding &lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/search?q=religulous"&gt;Religulous&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from the dishonesty in setting up the interviews, the shallow interviews (largely due to butcher-quality editing), the unnecessary stock footage, the largely out-of-place tone shift toward the end, all echo the tactics used in Expelled. Religulous is still the much better film on all those issues (far fewer digressions into stock footage, the interviews and thoughtful threads are more deeply explored, the leading questions were more clearly attempts to elicit humor rather than objectionable statements), and wins out by virtue of not exploiting the Holocaust to make an invalid point. Even so, I really wish that the comparison of tactics wasn't so easy and so apt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, um, yeah. It's not an experience I'd recommend. If you're going to watch it, do it when there's no chance that you'll wake sleeping people by screaming at the TV, move any desks and hard furniture out of range of your forehead, and remember the buddy system. Good luck.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-6041143809906301445?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232972730135"><id gr:original-id="http://dcscience.net/?p=920">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ad040b3027fd12f7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The Prince of Wales joins the ?Detox? fraud</title><published>2009-01-26T11:46:08Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T11:46:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dcscience.net/?p=920" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">It’s only a matter of weeks since a lot of young scientists produced a rather fine pamphlet pointing out that the “detox” industry is simply fraud.  They concluded

&lt;p&gt;I know this is not a sceptical issue but I am so proud of my Dad I just had to tell everyone my/his news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Da (as he is affectionately known to me) was awarded a &lt;a href="http://itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/awards/medals/medal_order_australia.cfm"&gt;Medal of the Order of Australia&lt;/a&gt; today for &lt;a href="http://itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1139909&amp;amp;search_type=quick&amp;amp;showInd=true"&gt;services to veterans through the Royal Australian Regiment Association, and to youth, particularly through &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.operationflinders.org/"&gt;Operation Flinders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:280px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img_29791.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="img_29791" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img_29791-300x239.jpg" alt="Me, Ma, Moose (OAM)." width="270" height="215"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me, Ma, Moose (OAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colonel Graham John Dunlop, (known as “Moose” to almost everyone) served as an Officer in the Australian Army for 25 years. He trained at Duntroon (now known as ADFA), Canberra following high school in Maryborough, rural Queensland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did a tour of duty in Vietnam for 13 months in 1969 as part of 3RAR where he was a platoon leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel after 25 years of service, he continued to work for the rights of Veterans and as a volunteer for the army cadets. In fact, he was made an honorary Colonel as part of his work for the cadets, where he served as a mentor for over ten years. This is particularly unusual since this position is generally for only 12 months, but owing to popular demand, Da was asked to keep coming back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His work for &lt;a href="http://www.operationflinders.org/"&gt;Operation Flinders&lt;/a&gt; is included in today’s OAM and involved him mentoring troubled youth (often from broken homes or off the streets) and teaching them survival skills, team work and instilling them with self esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through his tireless work with campaigning for Veterans Affairs he has lobbied government to improve the entitlements for veterans. He continues this today, with his newly appointed role on the Veteran’s Affairs advisory committee. Throughout this campaign he has been stubborn, dogmatic and brave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:204px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/oam_lge.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="oam_lge" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/oam_lge-300x214.jpg" alt="Despite him requesting they inscribe the medal with &amp;quot;Moose&amp;quot; it was deemed the name had to match hs birth certificate. " width="194" height="138"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite him requesting they inscribe the medal with &amp;quot;Moose&amp;quot; it was deemed the name had to match his birth certificate. UN-AUSTRALIAN. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such was the case when he agreed to appear on Hack, the &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/"&gt;Triple J&lt;/a&gt; current affairs show hosted by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cannane"&gt;Steve Cannane&lt;/a&gt;, to share his experiences in the Vietnam war, as part of a series on how &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hack/notes/s1623768.htm"&gt;war has intergenerational effects&lt;/a&gt;*. I also contributed to this interview, which eventually resulted in Steve winning a &lt;a href="http://www.walkleys.com/"&gt;Walkely Award&lt;/a&gt; for excellence in Journalism - it was a harrowing experience for us both, but not more than for my Da. He opened up about the effects war had, and continues to have on him, all the while his daughter was berating him in the studio for putting her under too much pressure (don’t I feel like a twit now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response to this interview from fellow veterans and families was overwhelming and the effects were felt far and wide. My Da helped so many ex-soldiers that day, by demonstrating it is not a failing to admit to your problems, and talking to your family can go a long way to helping with the healing process. I can certainly attest to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process leading up to him being awarded an OAM today, began with a phone call to my Ma from one of his mates suggesting the nomination be made. It’s been around 12 months since the wheels began to turn on this, and all the while, we as a family had to keep quiet. Mum, I am so proud of you for dealing with the secret negotiations when we all wanted to burst! I remember Mum showing me the official letter back in November 2008 when I was home for the sceptics national convention and I couldn’t hold back the tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:192px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img_0468.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="img_0468" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img_0468-225x300.jpg" alt="Colonel Moose OAM; &amp;quot;Tie your own bloody knots, I&amp;#39;m fishing&amp;quot;." width="182" height="242"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonel Moose OAM; &amp;quot;Tie your own bloody knots, I&amp;#39;m fishing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would feel the same if you visited the pub after an ANZAC day march and saw how much his mates respect him. The moment they find out you are the daughter of Moose Dunlop, they 1) insist on buying you a drink 2) pour their guts out about how much of a good mate he is and a bloody good soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any father and daughter we have our disagreements. However, there is nothing better than sitting in the tinnie, a couple of lines in the water, gazing onto a deserted beach somewhere on the west coast of South Australia and pulling in the King George whiting. But, don’t expect him to tie your rig for you,&lt;br&gt;
“I gave you a bloody how-to-tie-knots-book, do it yourself, I’m fishing!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da, I am so incredibly proud of you. Well done you bastard.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, it's so disturbing that I kept procrastinating all weekend until I wasn't even sure I was going to write about it at all. But the comments kept coming, and I realized once again that, once one gains a reputation as a go-to blogger about a certain topic, there's actually a bit of an obligation involved. As hard as I still find to believe it, more people than I would have dreamt possible actually care what I think about certain issues. (Yes, it's pretty amazing, but there you go.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into this story, you'll notice one thing that I &lt;em&gt;haven't&lt;/em&gt; seen thus far (at least not as of late Sunday night, when I wrote this). I haven't seen, for example, anyone on the antivaccine blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; acknowledging this story. I haven't seen one word there or on any of the other antivaccine sites that I monitor. Nothing from David Kirby on HuffPo. Nothing from &lt;a href="http://vaccineawakening.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Barbara Loe Fisher&lt;/a&gt;. No Dr. Jay "I'm not an antivaccinationist I just sound like one" Gordon showing up to say how exaggerated the story is. Nope. I've seen none of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's because this story, which appeared in the New York Times on Friday afternoon and was entitled &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/01/23/health/AP-MED-Hib-Infections.html"&gt;Minn. Illnesses Worry CDC Officials&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/more_disease_and_death_among_the_unvaccinated.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/more_disease_and_death_among_the_unvaccinated.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/YRMskHooFlg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232969504880"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1072">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0e4a43e76493004b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lost in Translation"/><title type="html">All baggage is lost</title><published>2009-01-26T11:29:35Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T11:29:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1072" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm on a train in Holland, travelling from Amsterdam to Nijmegen for a lecture I have to give at the Max-Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. Arriving at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport is wonderful, not just because you can walk in a few minutes from the gate along the concourse to your train, but because you can actually buy the train tickets from a flawlessly interfaced automatic machine located inside the baggage hall. I strolled over to buy my ticket to Nijmegen while waiting for the bags off my flight from Edinburgh to show up.  However, when I got back to carousel number 9, the area around it was deserted.  Everyone had gone. The conveyor belt was still going round, but it was empty.  And on the screen above it was a sign that appeared to convey the most disappointing news imaginable:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Alle bagage is gelost.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, no!  All of it, lost and gone to who knows where!  For a few seconds I felt that this visit was going to start with a major disappointment, and a highly inconvenient hour of claiming for mislaid baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one must be careful of false friends when translating verbs between closely related languages.  It is true that &lt;i&gt;ge-&lt;/i&gt; is a past participle prefix (as it was in Old English), and that &lt;i&gt;lost&lt;/i&gt; is the main part of the verb form.  But luckily, in Dutch &lt;i&gt;gelost&lt;/i&gt; does not mean "lost".  The sign was saying "All baggage is unloaded."  The &lt;i&gt;los-&lt;/i&gt; bit should be thought of here as suggesting the root of the English verb and adjective &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;loose&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (as in "set something loose") rather than the verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;lose&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (though as Björn Lindström pointed out in a comment after seeing the first version of this, the two are in fact distantly related to each other).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the pleasures of knowing even a little tiny bit about a foreign language!  Nothing was wrong.  I turned my gaze back to the slowly circulating belt, and after another half a minute or so, my bag, the only one that hadn&amp;#39;t already been collected, completed its full circle and pushed through the hanging strips again.  I grabbed it, and within three minutes I was on the platform watching the 12:55 slow train roll out as the second hand approached the top of the clock (12:55 is the time you need to be there: at 12:55:58 the doors closed and it began to move). Three minutes after that I was on the 13:00 Intercity, which began to roll out at 13:00:58.  I adjusted the time on my watch by it — you really can trust the train times in Holland.  And the airport baggage handling too. Punctually &lt;i&gt;gelost&lt;/i&gt;, but not lost.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;Professor John Beddington is the chief science advisor for the government in the UK &lt;del&gt;England&lt;/del&gt;. As it happens, several Ministers of Parliament (roughly equivalent to Congress here) support homeopathy, and fund it through government-sponsored hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine how I feel about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, don’t imagine it. I’ll tell you: It’s a travesty. Homeopathy doesn’t work. It’s &lt;em&gt;water&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;There’s no medicine in it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a scientist, Beddington should know this [Edited to add: Apparently, &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=404295"&gt;he does&lt;/a&gt;. It’s what he does with this knowledge that concerns me.]. There is no evidence — none — that homeopathy is anything more than a placebo, and tons of studies showing it has no medicinal value. If he were inactive about, simply not stopping it, that would be bad enough. But he actually &lt;em&gt;defends&lt;/em&gt; it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking before his official appointment in 2007, Professor Beddington told MPs his role as chief scientist was “really trying to ensure that, when a new policy is made, it is based on the best possible scientific advice that is available at the time”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But speaking to the select committee about NHS funding for homeopathy last year, he said that “wider factors other than science may be relevant”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[cue comical head-shaking and finger-cleaning-ears]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wha-wha-WHA? &amp;quot;Wider factors other than science may be relevant&amp;quot;? And what would those be, exactly? Magic? Reading entrails? He’s supposed to be &lt;em&gt;a scientist!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why several MPs have taken him to task. &lt;a href="http://news.parliament.uk/2009/01/committee-reports-on-skills-department/"&gt;The Department of Universities, Innovations, and Skills has issued a report calling Beddington’s behavior into question&lt;/a&gt;. They are understandably concerned that Beddington is not emphasizing the need for scientific evidence in making policy decisions about &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Edited to add: in the comments, &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmdius/51/5111.htm#a47"&gt;a link was given to a more complete quotation by Beddington&lt;/a&gt; (I looked for but didn’t find it earlier). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Professor Beddington, in November 2008, whether he considered that the National Health Service should spend money on homeopathic treatments.[251] He replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on the extent of the placebo effect[…] It is not just in terms of homeopathy, but, I suppose, less conventional medicines. There does seem to be some evidence that they are effective. In terms of homeopathy […] I see no evidence beyond the placebo effect that it works. […] I can make that point to government and say that there is no evidence that homeopathy works. The decision on whether you wish to fund homeopathy as part of the National Health Service has other factors which are beyond science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is more policy than science[…] I am quite firm with this. I see no scientific evidence that homeopathy has an effect beyond the placebo effect. The question that […] is a reasonable one, but I think it is possibly better posed to the Department of Health rather than me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am reading that correctly, he is saying this is a policy decision and not a scientific one. But shouldn’t the policy be driven by science? He says that himself in the first quotation above! SO I still think he’s wrong. The article goes on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found Professor Beddington’s statements equivocal compared to those of this predecessor, Professor Sir David King, who stated in evidence to us in December 2007:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of homeopathic medicine leaves me completely puzzled. How can you have homeopathic medicines labelled by a department which is driven by science? There is not one jot of evidence supporting the notion that homeopathic medicines are of any assistance whatsoever; therefore, I would say they are a risk to the population because people may take them expecting that they are dealing with a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bingo! That’s it precisely. People taking homeopathic sugar pills may think they are taking medicine, and forgo real medicine. That’s the danger of this kind of thinking.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be more than concerned. I’d be calling for his head. I’ve done the same here in this country when I’ve felt that a politician or advisor has strayed from the path of, y’know, reality. If the chief advisor of the government is advising people to take small doses of highly priced water to cure real ailments, then it’s time to find a new chief advisor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings up why I’m not sure what amazes me most about this situation. Certainly it’s incredible that the nation’s top science advisor advocates magic. But the thing is, &lt;em&gt;a bunch of people in the government actually spoke out against him!&lt;/em&gt; In our own government here, we’ve had — and still have — a large number of Congresscritters advocating against reality, and we’ve seen almost nothing but the others rolling over and letting them get away with it. To see the government actually &lt;em&gt;govern&lt;/em&gt;… well, it’s refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad they’re speaking out. If they don’t, who knows what’s next. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Wider factors.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The next thing he’ll want is to set up a Department of Astrology at Greenwich Royal Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232961052361"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/clock_quotes_186.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4e011ac2d252c424</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-01-26T08:52:32Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T08:52:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/f8RGJT69V_s/clock_quotes_186.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/clock_quotes_186.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give me the fruitful error any time, full of seeds, bursting with its own corrections.

I was there, too, and I could have said something, but I decided to remain silent as the traffic of this blog, which - cha-chink - means more money, is more important than accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few readers will read your article.  But everyone will see the cover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few people will read this post to the end, especially the links on the bottom that really contain the meat of the argument.  But everyone will see this post title in their feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham, you know print is swiftly dying and that journalism is moving to the Web, don't you? Do you understand that this means that in a year or two you will have to come here and play with the Big Boys?  Do you understand that all the silly comments you plastered all over the blogs will be remembered?  And if not remembered, easy to find - this blog has bigger Google juice than The New Scientist, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you understand that in your future transition to online journalism you will have to abandon all the lies you were taught in J-school?  That you will need to upgrade your journalistic ethics in order to match the higher &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2008/09/18/because_we_have.html" title=""&gt;ethics of the blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are you trying to start your career on a wrong foot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham, and someone needs to tell you now before it's too late, that you don't &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2009/01/darwin_was_wrongish.php#comment-1340543" title=""&gt;know shit about science&lt;/a&gt;. And that you'll have a steep hill to climb in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/07/scientists_are_excellent_commu.php" title=""&gt;order to start trying&lt;/a&gt; to play on the level field with people who actually know their stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/dccd8a09-bb6a-c7cd-d624-3675f8948910/New-Scientist-runs-a-money-headline-Darwin-was/" title=""&gt;curmudgeoned yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now sit back and learn by reading, very carefully, what people with actual expertise have written (including people with expertise in the comments) and learn from your mistake as not to make it again:&lt;/p&gt;

As reported in the January 25th &lt;a href="http://www.connpost.com/ci_11551521"&gt;Connecticut Post&lt;/a&gt;, the girl then "sat in the classroom naked from the waist up" for about 15 minutes, after which a paraprofessional told the principal what was going on. The incident occurred on October 6, 2008, at Dwight School in Fairfield, Connecticut. The teacher, Elizabeth Valeriay, was arrested earlier this month and charged with "intentional cruelty to persons," and will be back in court on February 13th. She is no longer employed by the Fairfield school district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.connpost.com/ci_11551521"&gt;Connecticut Post&lt;/a&gt; article focuses on the teacher's removing the "source of distraction"---the girl's shirt---and noted that this is an "an accepted method of handling a child with autism." Sara Reed, the executive director of the &lt;a href="http://www.autismsocietyofct.org/"&gt;Autism Society of Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, and Karen Cubbellotti, director of children's services at the &lt;a href="http://www.thekennedycenterinc.org/general/home.php"&gt;Kennedy Center&lt;/a&gt;, are both interviewed; both note that removing an object that a child is fixating or distracted by is (in the words of Reed) a "'technique that is often used in dealing with fixations.'" Both women emphasized, though, that each autistic child is different and needs different teaching methods and approaches, and suggest that, while a certain technique might be effective with one child, it might not be with another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's certainly true and yet, it just seems a little puzzling that the child was in a public school classroom without a shirt on for 15 minutes and, indeed, "naked." Perhaps she could have been given another shirt to wear? It's noted that Valerlay has been a special education teacher for 30 years and has a master's degree in special education, but was there anyone else on hand---a behavioral therapist, perhaps----to consult with about what to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no cookie-cutter approach when teaching autistic children, and that means you have to know when it's necessary just to change what you're doing and forget about technique----and go with common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) reports that it spent NZ$37 million [US$20 million] on CAM in the 2007-2008 year up from NZ$18.4 million [US$9.8 million] in 2003-2004. It was decided that there were "legitimate questions" about the effectiveness of some alternative treatments, and the issue is being looked at as part of a broader ACC review. In the past year, the ACC spent $14 million [US$7.4 million] on acupuncture alone, and NZ$12.7 million [US$6.8 million] on chiropractic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand doctors have wisely said that any treatment receiving government funding should be subject to the same rigorous standards as conventional medicine, though some alternative therapies for disability-allowance clients are approved by "registered medical practitioners," which includes chiropractors. One NZ MD, Dr. John Welch, said the idea of integrating conventional and complementary medicine was a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...fake proposition. There can only be one sort of medicine that's shown to be effective and works and should be publicly funded.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232945020235"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=1944">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b9d5920bbae109c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><category term="UFOs/aliens"/><category term="Barack Obama"/><category term="inauguration"/><category term="UFO"/><title type="html">Take Me To Your Leader</title><published>2009-01-26T04:42:50Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T04:42:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/25/take-me-to-your-leader/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5661"&gt;&lt;img title="take-me-to-your-leader" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/take-me-to-your-leader.jpg?w=202&amp;amp;h=300" alt="take-me-to-your-leader" width="202" height="300"&gt;Even space aliens love Obama&lt;/a&gt; - This is the stupidest thing I’ve seen all day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Rebecca Watson says it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlights include the gnat obviously zipping back and forth &lt;em&gt;in front of&lt;/em&gt; the Washington Monument while the hick points out that it is actually (contrary to the video) a very large object flying &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; “the obelisk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I think my favorite part is at the 1:35 mark when he admits seeing the flapping of the wings but then just dismisses it as a glitch in the video because it doesn’t conform to his insanely idiotic hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

Why is it that whenever insects and food go together, people immediately go for the shock value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boing Boing recently ran a post titled “&lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/01/15/maggot-cheese-that-t.html"&gt;Maggot Cheese that tries to Eat Your Eyes&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Casu marzu is an illegal Sardinian cheese that is served riddled with writhing maggots that try to jump into your eyeballs as you eat it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, not the case at all.  It is cheese, and it is riddled with maggots (which is why it is also illegal). But the maggots are not crazed eye-seeking missiles; they are insects known as &lt;a title="Proper taxonomy, for those who want to know" href="http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=all&amp;amp;search_value=Piophila+casei&amp;amp;search_kingdom=every&amp;amp;search_span=exactly_for&amp;amp;categories=All&amp;amp;source=html&amp;amp;search_credRating=All"&gt;cheese skippers&lt;/a&gt;.  They get the name “skipper” because the larvae can jump up to 15 cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, they could, &lt;strong&gt;potentially&lt;/strong&gt;, jump into your eyes. But that isn’t where they are aiming–in fact, they don’t aim much at all. The larvae “flip” to escape from a predator or parasite that disturbs them.  You can see a lovely&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ_-JzM-YQg"&gt; video on how the cheese is made&lt;/a&gt; here. The actions of the maggots make the cheese nice and runny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, like the &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/01/09/breaking-fail-news-scientific-american/"&gt;Scientific American Fiasco&lt;/a&gt;, you can trace coverage of this &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; maggoty cheese (even I might not eat it, which should tell you something) through the filter of the internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nov. 27&lt;a href="http://www.neatorama.com/2008/11/27/10-weird-gourmet-foods/"&gt;, Neatorama:  factually correct about jumping&lt;/a&gt; (although it does add “flies are filthy”, which isn’t the case.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan 9th, Mental Floss:&lt;a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/21465"&gt; mostly factual, but tending toward sensationalism;&lt;/a&gt; They describe the maggots as leaping with “malevolent precision”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan 15th: &lt;a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2009_01_01_archive.asp"&gt;William Gibson picks it up from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan 16th: &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/01/15/maggot-cheese-that-t.html"&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt; makes it viral and sensationalist  (”OMG My eyes! My eyes!”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what are these cheese skippers, anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a very entertaining profile of the fly and its relatives &lt;a href="http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/school/researchstaff/bonduriansky/piophilidparadigm.html"&gt;here, from a professor &lt;/a&gt;that studies them. (He is the author of &lt;a title="Leaping larvae, Batman!" href="http://www.cababstractsplus.org/abstracts/Abstract.aspx?AcNo=20043034293"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, BTW.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These flies are attracted to decomposing protein, and away from humans, they are important in the decomposition of dead animals.  These flies are also &lt;a href="http://www.deathonline.net/decomposition/corpse_fauna/flies/cheese.htm"&gt;used in forensic entomology&lt;/a&gt; to date corpses and determine what habitat they may have been left in. (You’ll find them mentioned in Lee Goff’s book &lt;a title="A Fly for the Prosecution" href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/GOFFLY.html?show=catalogcopy"&gt;A Fly for the Prosecution&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When humans conveniently supply protein-rich food products (another name for cheese skippers is “bacon fly”),  flies will move in and happily lay eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not a lot of current, non-technical information about the cheese skipper online, although there are lots of charming &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H4c5AAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA288&amp;amp;dq=cheese+skipper&amp;amp;ei=6398Sf_bNomUMoLHycoE&amp;amp;client=firefox-a#PPA289,M1"&gt;publications from the 1900’s&lt;/a&gt; available.  This is probably why the Wikipedia article was relied on so heavily as a source in the posts I linked to above.  The best recent coverage of the cheese skipper for a general audience is in May Berenbaum’s book “&lt;a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/73ryk8yf9780252063220.html"&gt;99 More Maggots, Mites, and Munchers.&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could they hurt you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a probability thing. As I stated above, the maggots &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; hit your eyes, but that’s incredibly unlikely. And they certainly aren’t aiming for them, nor would they burrow into your eyes if they hit them.  There also is a &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; for the maggots to survive the trip through your stomach, and then pierce your intestines with their mouth hooks, although most of the reports of that happening seem to stem from &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oYUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA309&amp;amp;dq=cheese+skipper+intestine&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;ei=9IF8Sfi_Fp-eMtqAmccE&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;1912&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5IsoAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA526&amp;amp;dq=cheese+skipper+intestine&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;ei=9IF8Sfi_Fp-eMtqAmccE&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;1922&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random and Intriguing side tidbit: apparently cheese skippers were an important part of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menocchio"&gt;16th century heretic’s view of creation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Menocchio said: “I have said that, in my opinion, all was chaos, that is, earth, air, water, and fire were mixed together; and out of that bulk a mass formed- just as cheese is made out of milk- and worms appeared in it, and these were the angels. The most holy majesty decreed that these should be God and the angels, and among that number of angels there was also God, he too having been created out of that mass at the same time, and he was named lord with four captains….”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title="The cheese and the worms" href="http://www.amazon.com/Cheese-Worms-Cosmos-Sixteenth-Century-Miller/dp/0801843871"&gt;book covering this hallucinating miller&lt;/a&gt; is interesting enough, it needs its own post!&lt;/p&gt;

The usual assumption is that linguists are employed almost exclusively in academia, and that they are generally engaged in esoteric theoretical work. I've long suspected that this is not completely true, but I'd never really looked into it. Facing two long plane rides this past week, I decided to get the data and wade through them. This post reports some initial findings about 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My source for the data is &lt;a href="http://linguistlist.org/"&gt;The Linguist List&lt;/a&gt;. For at least ten years, The Linguist List has been the primary place for jobs ads specifically targeting linguists. This orientation is important. I&amp;#39;m not asking the question, &amp;quot;Where do linguists work?&amp;quot;, because they work in many, many fields; linguists have a mix of skills from the sciences and the humanities that has a lot of market potential outside the field. Rather, I am curious about which employers are looking for linguists in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My scrape of the 2008 advertisements on The Linguist List turned up 579 jobs. Here's a rough breakdown by employer type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th colspan="2"&gt;Advertisement counts by employer type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Universities&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;414 (71%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Colleges&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17 (3%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Other&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;148 (26%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems true that most linguists work in academia. The &amp;quot;Other&amp;quot; list is robust, though, and it is filled with a wide array of job types: lots of tech firms, lots of research institutes, some libraries, some advertising firms, as well as odd-balls like Gap International and the PricewaterhouseCoopers. &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/nonacademic-jobs.txt"&gt;Here's the full list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of linguists are employers seeking? To get a rough answer to this question, I looked at all the job area types with more than one advertisement associated with them, then did some hand clustering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th colspan="2"&gt;Counts of specific areas targeted by job ads&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Institutionally prominent theoretical areas&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;203&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Specific non-English languages&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;182&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Computational&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;167&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;163&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Applied linguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;139&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;General linguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most ads list more than one area. The counts in this table are  the number of times that the area was mentioned. Thus, a single ad seeking either a computational person or an applied linguist would be counted twice. I went this route because I am curious about the opportunities open to particular specialists. For example, &amp;quot;How many jobs could someone like me apply to?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Applied linguistics&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;General linguistics&amp;quot; are single categories. To get the others, I combined various areas. Some notes on the breakdowns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Institutionally prominent theoretical areas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list I&amp;#39;ve called &amp;quot;Institutionally prominent theoretical areas&amp;quot; sorts out, from most to fewest ads, in almost exactly the order that modern theoretical linguistics developed, suggesting that the initial Chomskyan conception still shapes the way departments are built up and replenished:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th colspan="2"&gt;Institutionally prominent theoretical areas&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Syntax&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sociolinguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Phonology&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Phonetics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Specific non-English languages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The category &amp;quot;Specific non-English languages&amp;quot; consists mainly of advertisements for positions that call for specific language skills. I even left out things like &amp;quot;Spanish linguistics&amp;quot;, opting instead to include just the ones that seemed to care about fluency alone. Here are the top eleven:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's a link to &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/specific-languages.txt"&gt;the full list of languages with at least two job ads targeting them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Computational&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Computational&amp;quot; group is dominated by the simple category &amp;quot;Computational linguistics&amp;quot;, which probably covers lots of different researchers, ranging from people who just rely on computing power to get their work done to people who use language as a testing ground for new machine learning models and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;

&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;English&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &amp;quot;English&amp;quot; area covers a diverse bunch (perhaps too diverse):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TEFL&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English studies&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;All positions, with counts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close out this section, here is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/all-areas.txt"&gt;the raw list of positions with their counts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Specialists and specialist positions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more thing I'd like to check. Many people, I think, have the impression that it is getting harder to survive as a pure theoretician, or perhaps as a pure &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; for any &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. The sense is that most jobs are looking for people with multiple skill sets. Is this true? It is hard to answer definitively without looking carefully at each ad, but how about this related question: For which areas &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; are there ads for &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and only &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; (rather than a disjunction of areas). Specialists in such areas are more likely to be competing against just other specialists, for positions already tailored to them. Here are the top ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th colspan="2"&gt;Numbers of ads  targeting exactly one area&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Computational linguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;General linguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Applied linguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Syntax&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Phonology&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Semantics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Psycholinguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sociolinguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Phonetics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cognitive science&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the top 10. &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/singleton-areas.txt"&gt;The full list&lt;/a&gt; has 136 jobs ads on it. So about 23% (136/579) of the jobs target just single areas. Once again, computation looks like a safe specialization. Jobs in  &amp;quot;General linguistics&amp;quot; are open to a wide range of specialists, so that category should probably be removed from the list. If we do that, then just 20% of the jobs target single specialist areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to do more analysis like this in the future. &lt;a href="http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~rwalker/"&gt;Rachel Walker&lt;/a&gt; and I are starting an &lt;a href="http://elanguage.net/"&gt;eLanguage&lt;/a&gt; journal that will report on hiring in linguistics, and I'd like to provide general data like this in addition to specific information about individual moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, some questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are so few colleges (as opposed to universities) looking for linguists? Or: how can colleges get away with &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; having linguistics? Shocking!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the TESOL/TEFL jobs mostly being advertised elsewhere?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there areas not represented on &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/nonacademic-jobs.txt"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; that linguists should be exploring for jobs (and internships)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I could go on and on about resonances and horseshoe orbits and co-orbital debris, but you can read all about it at &lt;a href="http://astroprofspage.com/archives/1890"&gt;AstroProf’s page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/01/25/strange-asteroid-2009-bd-stalks-the-earth/"&gt;Universe Today&lt;/a&gt;. And I still have nothing in my email inbox about it. Grrr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asteroid is not in danger of hitting us, and is only 10 meters across anyway. Something that big hitting us would explode high in the atmosphere (maybe dozens of kilometers high, depending on the composition of the asteroid; rock is fragile and it would detonate way up, but iron would get down lower before exploding) and rain down debris over some unsuspecting area — probably the ocean, given that’s 70% of the planet — but that’s about it. And again, this one won’t hit us, so don’t panic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232929214416"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/teens_and_online_social_networ.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ab0d2be12485ccb2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">Teens and Online Social Networks</title><published>2009-01-25T22:26:23Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T22:26:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/j4MSi0D9Do8/teens_and_online_social_networ.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/teens_and_online_social_networ.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How many of you have been blogging since June 1997?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many, I think.  But &lt;a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/" title=""&gt;danah boyd&lt;/a&gt; has.  And she's been studying online social networks almost as long, first starting with Friendster, then moving on to MySpace and Facebook as those appeared on the horizon and became popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, danah defended her Dissertation on this topic and, a few days ago, &lt;a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/01/18/taken_out_of_co.html" title=""&gt;posted the entire Dissertation&lt;/a&gt; online for everyone to download and read - &lt;a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/TakenOutOfContext.pdf" title=""&gt;Taken Out of Context: American Teen Sociality in Networked Publics (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Abstract: As social network sites like MySpace and Facebook emerged, American teenagers began adopting them as spaces to mark identity and socialize with peers. Teens leveraged these sites for a wide array of everyday social practices - gossiping, flirting, joking around, sharing information, and simply hanging out. While social network sites were predominantly used by teens as a peer-based social outlet, the unchartered nature of these sites generated fear among adults. This dissertation documents my 2.5-year ethnographic study of American teens' engagement with social network sites and the ways in which their participation supported and complicated three practices - self-presentation, peer sociality, and negotiating adult society.

&lt;p&gt;    My analysis centers on how social network sites can be understood as networked publics which are simultaneously (1) the space constructed through networked technologies and (2) the imagined community that emerges as a result of the intersection of people, technology, and practice. Networked publics support many of the same practices as unmediated publics, but their structural differences often inflect practices in unique ways. Four properties - persistence, searchability, replicability, and scalability - and three dynamics - invisible audiences, collapsed contexts, and the blurring of public and private - are examined and woven throughout the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    While teenagers primarily leverage social network sites to engage in common practices, the properties of these sites configured their practices and teens were forced to contend with the resultant dynamics. Often, in doing so, they reworked the technology for their purposes. As teenagers learned to navigate social network sites, they developed potent strategies for managing the complexities of and social awkwardness incurred by these sites. Their strategies reveal how new forms of social media are incorporated into everyday life, complicating some practices and reinforcing others. New technologies reshape public life, but teens' engagement also reconfigures the technology itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely worth a read for everyone interested in the Web, the social networks, and in the use of those in working with kids and teens (e.g., in education).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/teens_and_online_social_networ.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/j4MSi0D9Do8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232929214416"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/what_is_sciences_rightful_plac_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/adc3b43370267ad2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Education"/><title type="html">What is science's rightful place?</title><published>2009-01-25T22:05:05Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T22:05:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/gv9TetNkrK0/what_is_sciences_rightful_plac_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/what_is_sciences_rightful_plac_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our heads, of course.  All of our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Seed is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/rightfulplace.php" title=""&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt;, so let me elaborate briefly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/2008/10/25/an-interview-with-bora-zivkovic-organizer-of-science-online-09/" title=""&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, science is not just active participation in research.  Science is a mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all born scientists, exploring the world around us and experimenting with it. When we grow up, we continue being scientists in our day-to-day lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you walk into a room and flip a switch and the light does not come on, what do you do? I doubt that you throw yourself on the floor in fear, speaking in tongues, praying, blaming the Aliens or asking the Government to help you. You calmly go about dissecting the problem into pieces: is there electricity in the house? If not, did you pay the bill?  If yes, should the fuse be flipped or replaced?  If not, perhaps the light bulb burned out: replace and see what happens. If that does not work, perhaps replacing the socket will work.  If not, checking the wiring may help.  You go through the problem systematically, testing each element, until you find the problem and fix it.  You do the same if water is dripping in your kitchen sink, or your car is running funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to bigger problems that affect the broader society, some adults forget their inherent scientific mindset and let indoctrination and ideology take over. As the problems become more complex, and the science behind it more difficult to understand, other social influences tend to take precedence.  See: global warming denialists, HIV/AIDS denialists, anti-vaccination crowd, Creationists of all stripes, New Age proponents, medical quackery believers, animal rightists, and so on.  Faced with complexity that goes against the dogma received by parents, teachers, priests and media, people shut off their natural scientific mindset and go with what "feels" right to them, instead of with reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'm not a fan of facts. You see, the facts can change, but my opinion will never change, no matter what the facts are." - Stephen Colbert&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;[Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.tamaralackeyblog.com/" title=""&gt;Tamara Lackey&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/TamaraLackey/status/1140606375" title=""&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, of course, translates into politics and policy.  I may disagree with Obama on some things.  I may not like some of the people he hired to work for him. But what I like, and what he said many times including in his inaugural address, is that he will use the scientific method in all policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identify the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gather all available empricial information about the way the world really works in respect to that problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fund the additional research to come up with missing data if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come up with a rational plan to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implement it, test it and monitor if it works as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modify if needed, until the problem is solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this approach spreads into the broader national psyche - making decisions from the head, not the gut.  Basing policy on data, not emotions. I feel that Obama won primarily because of his pragmatism and rationality as he is so non-ideological (heck, I wish he was more ideological!). People are tired of policy based on wishful thinking and fairy tales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this happens, it will be much easier to defeat the anti-rationality movements and to teach the kids how to apply their natural scientific mindset to all aspects of their lives as they grow into adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not just research.  It's not just specific science education.  It is about making rational thinking the respectable norm, and emotion/ideology-based thinking a laughing-stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the science's rightful place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/what_is_sciences_rightful_plac_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/gv9TetNkrK0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232928255109"><id gr:original-id="477 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8b9b4fad33aae606</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">1,000,000 Hits, and the Strange Ways People Find Me</title><published>2009-01-24T14:50:42Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T14:50:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/477" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following the move to the new server just over a month ago, I've been taking a look through the server statistics to see who's visiting The Lay Scientist.

With an unclear purpose and a $100+ billion price tag, I think the money might have been better spent on a better design. Still, &lt;em&gt;it’s a space station&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s pretty cool. Cooler yet, NASA just put out a four-part series of videos of a tour of the ISS. It’s hosted by astronaut Mike Fincke (who, in microgravity, bears a weird resemblance to Louie Anderson), and he’ll show you various geegaws and gizmos on board.&lt;/p&gt;

And on the other hand, advocacy is on a much smaller level, and seemingly less grand. For me, advocating for my son isn't only about trying to change the world to accommodate his needs as an individual on the autism spectrum. It's also about my trying to change myself to understand things from his perspective and point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/_MMORgBV5Yw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance: Charlie--he's now more than 11 1/2 as I've been saying, as his birthday is in May---seems to have trouble identifying figures and objects when they're drawn. It's hit or miss what he'll call a drawing of any four-footed animal from cows to dogs to cats to horses. His teacher sends home worksheets with simple phrases; he's to circle the drawing that the phrase describes. He'll squint at the black and white drawings and I suspect he's seeing them as a bunch of black lines, of some indeterminate "what." (This difficulty identifying pictures was one reason that Charlie was never too inclined to use &lt;a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/subjects/8561.asp"&gt;PECS&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or rather, I don't think that Charlie sees in a drawing what I'm seeing, or what he's "supposed" to see---a picture of a street scene is a mass of lines and colors and shapes, perhaps, to him. There's a review in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/arts/design/23raph.html?ref=arts"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; about an exhibition of drawings, "&lt;a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId=%7B4EF0DAB2-E291-43C8-B2B2-A03DF2DAA0C4%7D"&gt;Raphael to Renoir: Drawings From the Collection of Jean Bonna&lt;/a&gt;," at the &lt;a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;.  The review caught my eye because of its title, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/arts/design/23raph.html?ref=arts"&gt;Where Lines Become a Language&lt;/a&gt;. Here's how some of the drawings were described:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show has ..... memorable examples of drawing-as-writing. A faint, scratchy ink landscape by the Florentine painter Baccio della Porta, better known as Fra Bartolommeo, suggests a letter quickly written as a pen was running dry. Cézanne’s graphite-and-watercolor “Wooded Landscape” seems to be composed largely of punctuation marks indicating starts, stops, pauses and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is Parmigianino’s “Holy Family With Shepherds and Angels” if not a devotional poem jotted down in a shorthand script made up entirely of abstract flourishes — squiggles and loops — that by some miracle cohere into recognizable shapes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the "squiggles and loops" that Charlie seems (as far as I can tell, from numerous experiences watching him looking at pictures) to see, as if his mind---as noted in an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/while_i_was_reading_obamas_speech"&gt;article in the February Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;---tends to focus on what many would say is "irrelevant," to minute details, rather than on the "big picture."  Or perhaps, it'd be more accurate to say that Charlie's got a very different way of seeing the world, a kind of hyper-focus somewhat similar to whatever enables the artist &lt;a href="http://www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk/gallery.aspx"&gt;Stephen Wiltshire&lt;/a&gt; to draw his perfectly detailed panoramic landscapes of cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/my-secret-life-stephen-wiltshire-artist-34-1488487.html"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Wiltshire in today's &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/my-secret-life-stephen-wiltshire-artist-34-1488487.html"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;. He sums up in his life in seven words as "Keep doing what I do best, drawing" (and notes that he likes the movie &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/"&gt;Rain Man&lt;/a&gt;). Like Charlie, Wiltshire likes "to stroll through the city, working on new ideas"; he rides public transport and prefers the upper level of a double-decker bus "as the view is better from there." Charlie also has a fondness for public transportation, though it's usually underground, in the form of the subway and, so far, he's not been interested in drawing. Wiltshire's impeccably detailed art suggests to me how Charlie might be viewing the world, with an attention to details that I didn't know where there, to the squiggles and the loops and lines of things.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232920861779"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1066">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b363e5c03862552</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><category term="The language of science"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">snarge</title><published>2009-01-25T21:48:11Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T21:48:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1066" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It isn't often that I learn a new English word while reading the newspaper, but &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/science/25birds.html"&gt;today's New York Times&lt;/a&gt; contains one: &lt;i&gt;snarge&lt;/i&gt;.

These signs go by the name of “supergraphics.” Actually, this word doesn’t add much to the lexical inventory of English. If you look it up, you’ll learn, not surprisingly, that it means really, really, really big signs — ones that are much bigger than billboards, some of them even two stories tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this advertising solution, reported in &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-outdoor-signs-backlash20-2009jan20,0,2704358.story"&gt;The Los Angeles Times &lt;/a&gt;(although it's prevalent other cities as well), is that supergraphic signs irritate the  commercial and professional businesses that suddenly find their office windows covered by large vinyl or plastic sheets hawking  advertising  services and products that are very different from their own businesses and are not at all helpful for attracting their own customers. Instead of stimulating business, they complain that it drives their customers away, thereby negating any stimulus to the economy that might be wrought by supergraphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proves to be just one of an increasing number of recent urban signage battles– like the one I described in an &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=837"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, only much more serious. In case anybody is still interested, I should report that the signage battle I wrote about finally was resolved bloodlessly. Lucky Lil’s decided not to try to erect a sign on a newly constructed parapet at top of its building after all. It’s not clear whether the casino was discouraged by the fuss brought up by Missoula’s City Council or, as I like to think, by Language Log (nudge, wink).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern electronic developments have given the signage experts a strong boost lately and advertisers are eager to make good use of them. But supergraphics is neither technologically advanced nor new. It’s not even electronic. It’s just a really, really, really big vinyl or plastic sheet that hangs over a large office building and irritates the heck out of the realtors and dentists who’ve plunked down  exorbitant rental costs, only to find that their views are blocked and their natural lighting is seriously dimmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised if the supergraphics kerfluffle will lead to some heated discussions about whether attempts to prohibit supergraphic advertising signs will lead to a restriction of free speech. But they certainly restrict the visibility of the people inside the buildings and they don’t do their businesses any good either. No economic bailout for them, I’d guess.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232920368865"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20494433.post-1556951427508490050">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dd7faad890eb5bb6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Memes" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Geekery" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Cheaper by the Dozen</title><published>2009-01-25T20:29:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T20:47:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2008/12/cheaper-by-dozen.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/1556951427508490050/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20494433&amp;postID=1556951427508490050" title="5 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="html">So, &lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2008/10/six-random-things.html"&gt;Bronze Dog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ferretcage.blogspot.com/2008/11/meme-numero-dos-that-is-how-you-spell.html"&gt;King of Ferrets&lt;/a&gt; both tagged me with a meme, the rules of which are as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;1.

Let the tagger know when your entry is up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I got tagged twice, I might as well double it up, right? Here are &lt;i&gt;twelve&lt;/i&gt; random things about me.&lt;span&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I haven't looked it in a month or so, but I was working again on memorizing some favorite poems and passages. Off the top of my head, I can do &lt;a href="http://www.clicknotes.com/dream/T.5.1.html"&gt;Puck's speech&lt;/a&gt; from the end of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and the full text of &lt;a href="http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/130.html"&gt;Sonnet 130&lt;/a&gt;. I know most of &lt;a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/363.html"&gt;Sonnet 116&lt;/a&gt; and some of &lt;a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/200.html"&gt;this bit&lt;/a&gt; from King Lear. I used to know all of Robert Herrick's "&lt;a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/herrick/tovirgins.htm"&gt;To the Virgins to Make Much of Time&lt;/a&gt;," but I've more or less lost the middle two stanzas at this point. I've always wanted to memorize Marvell's "&lt;a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/marvell/coy.htm"&gt;To His Coy Mistress&lt;/a&gt;," so that's high on the list, and I've also printed out Marlowe's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passionate_Shepherd_to_His_Love"&gt;The Passionate Shepherd to his Love&lt;/a&gt;" and Raleigh's brilliant reply "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nymph%27s_Reply_to_the_Shepherd"&gt;The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;," since I randomly quoted a line from the former recently. While in the past, I kind of focused on renaissance poetry (as ought to be obvious at this point), I also started working on Poe's "&lt;a href="http://www.eapoe.org/works/poems/ravent.htm"&gt;The Raven&lt;/a&gt;" and Carroll's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberwocky"&gt;Jabberwocky&lt;/a&gt;," the former largely because it was around Halloween when I started, the latter because it's fun and easy (I've got two stanzas down just today--three if you count that the first one is repeated at the end). If I had the time and a better memory, I'd add Ginsberg's "&lt;a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Sprayberry/poems/howl.txt"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;" and Eliot's "&lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/198/1.html"&gt;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&lt;/a&gt;" to the list, but I think Poe and Marvell are already pushing it as far as length. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, I recognize how useless and geeky this is, but I decided to do it after I had an epiphany about the scads of useless knowledge already rattling around my head (Jaster Mereel!) and figured I could at least put some culture in there. Besides, I tend to neglect my literature geek side, and it deserves a bit of love now and then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incidentally, I can recite large swaths of "Green Eggs and Ham" and "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish," which really put everything else on the list to shame. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think "The Exorcist" is vastly overrated, and I didn't find it to be even the least bit scary. It's been awhile since I watched the flick, so this is from a few-years-old memory, but it seems to me that it took the same approach to horror that Carlos Mencia takes to comedy. Loudly saying curse words and doing moderately shocking things for no apparent reason neither equals humor nor horror. Maybe it's just me, but I'm seriously bothered by villains who have no discernable motivation--with the possible exception of &lt;a href="http://tomfoss.blogspot.com/2007/09/oh-horror.html"&gt;Michael Myers&lt;/a&gt; in the original "Halloween," who was more "force of nature" than "villain"--and I don't understand why the Lord of Lies and King of the Underworld would waste his time dicking with a teenage girl and a couple of priests. Really, Satan? That's the best you got? It's certainly no wonder God won that war, but I really can't fathom why fundies and such would legitimately fear you. The film makes Satan look like a petty middle-aged loser who never grew out of the pranks he pulled with his frat brothers. In fact, "The Exorcist" makes the Devil look an awful lot like Biff Tannen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;For close to two weeks now, I've lost sensation in my big toe on my left foot. When I was moving out of my apartment, I spent a lot of time in boots, out in the cold, and I was on my feet almost constantly for eleven hours on the day I finally checked out. About halfway through that marathon of packing, I noticed that it felt like I'd worn a hole into the sole of my left boot, and my big toe was in some kind of indentation; when I took the shoes off, it felt like my toe was asleep. The sensation hasn't gone away since, leaving about half of that toe numb. I saw my doctor, who prescribed arch supports, steroids, soaking in warm water, and a follow-up visit. So far, not much change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a possibly related note, the skin on several of my fingertips has been really rough lately, and I suspect that it's due to some frostbite, damage from the moving process, and exposure to rock salt, though I can't be totally sure. For a couple of days after moving, though, it felt like everything I touched was made of sandpaper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;I picked up the first "Fable" game, and I started playing it. I haven't gotten very far (and I haven't really touched it in several weeks), but so far I'm not entirely sure what the hype's about. I expected the black-and-white moral system, thanks to chats with the Action Skeptics crew at GenCon, but I didn't realize the story would be quite so terribly clichéd. I mean, spunky kid whose small farm town is razed by villains, killing his whole family, who then gets adopted by a wizard of some sort? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's even mentioned in the &lt;a href="http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html"&gt;Evil Overlord List&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, I'm about as far into "Psychonauts" time-wise as I am with "Fable," and it's living up to my expectations so far. If someone had told me before that it had a graphic style somewhere between "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "Aaah! Real Monsters," I would have picked it up months ago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of XBox games, I've gotten burned thrice now with superhero games on the console. I posted my lengthy thoughts on Spider-Man: Web of Shadows &lt;a href="http://tomfoss.blogspot.com/2008/11/oh-what-tangled-web-we-weave.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I don't regret buying Incredible Hulk, but it generally feels like a pale imitation of Hulk: Ultimate Destruction on the previous generation consoles, albeit with a more destructible landscape. I played Iron Man for an hour or so before giving up due to the terrible flight controls (I got spoiled by the near-perfect flight mechanics in Superman Returns) and imprecise directions (how am I supposed to stop the jets without killing the pilots when all I have are missiles and lasers?). Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a great game, and DC Universe/Mortal Kombat was pleasantly surprising (because I had no expectations for it), but other than that, I don't think I've played a really good superhero game on the system. Am I just stuck waiting for M:UA2, or are there games that I've overlooked? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've watched a few episodes of the "new" Unsolved Mysteries, and I'm not sure what bugs me more: the fact that they've dubbed Dennis Farina over the reused Robert Stack segments, the fact that the show is &lt;i&gt;so insanely credulous&lt;/i&gt;, or the fact that I watched it completely uncritically for most of my childhood. It'd be one thing if it just went after missing persons and unsolved murders, but they throw in every bit of crazy ghost, alien, and psychic woo-woo that they possibly can. Pitting the two together lends the fantasies the credibility of the realities--inasmuch as the criminal cases are realities and not conspiracy theories. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least I can have a chuckle that a show which used to air exclusively on Lifetime: Television for Women now airs exclusively on Spike TV: Television for Men. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mercifully, my allergies haven't been acting up much this break. Usually on breaks, the time I spend at home and at my girlfriend's house leaves me in cat-induced misery, but I've only had one real reaction all this break, despite routinely forgetting to take my Claritin. Lucky me, I guess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/SXzLvloCCSI/AAAAAAAAA6s/gFU1Mi1DZTE/s1600-h/mary.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:240px;height:320px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/SXzLvloCCSI/AAAAAAAAA6s/gFU1Mi1DZTE/s320/mary.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" title="Jesus&amp;#39; mom has got it goin&amp;#39; on!" alt="Jesus&amp;#39; mom has got it goin&amp;#39; on!"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I recently saw another of the Jesus figures at the Wal-Mart where I bought mine. Alongside him: Mary, his inexplicably hot mom. She wasn't particularly impressive, and I didn't have any real ideas for fun scenes with the two of them, but I may pick her up next time I'm there, just because I'm curious if she talks, and what she would say if she did? "Blessed art I among women"? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they'd had Moses, on the other hand, I wouldn't have hesitated. Incidentally, I bought a large Thor figure for god-battles, but had to return him when he broke immediately after being opened. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've been getting dragged to church on a slightly regular basis since I moved back home. As a kid, I spent the time mostly playing Tic-Tac-Toe or Hangman on the back of bulletins; when I got a little older, I started working on various stories or writings on the bulletins. What I generally didn't do was pay attention to the sermons, which really didn't hold much meaning for me. Lately, though, I've listened in, and it's been enlightening. The sermon this past Sunday was one of the most inept public speeches I've heard since High School. It was long, it was rambling, it was boring, it was weepy, it was filled with "ums" and "likes" and the other placeholder sounds that demonstrate that you've not written out careful enough notes or practiced your speech enough, and it was occasionally hilarious. I'm paraphrasing, but I'm &lt;i&gt;absolutely serious&lt;/i&gt;: 'you know how sometimes you're out shopping, and you find a really great sale, and you just can't wait to call your friend so you can tell someone? Like, oh, I got such a great deal, and I thought you should know about it. You're just so excited that you need to tell someone? Well, that's how you should be about Jesus, so excited that you just can't wait to tell someone!' My eyes just about rolled out of my head at that point. "Hey Barb, didja see that Jesus is on clearance at the Cracker Barrel? You better hurry down, 'cause there's only one left in your size, and you wouldn't want a Jesus that's too small." &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)"&gt;Jonathan Edwards&lt;/a&gt; she wasn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm itching to liveblog &lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2008/07/liveblogging-haunting.html"&gt;A Haunting&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/SXzLvo8AIzI/AAAAAAAAA60/mZ3WEMm6vUw/s1600-h/450px-NewMountinDew.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:240px;height:320px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/SXzLvo8AIzI/AAAAAAAAA60/mZ3WEMm6vUw/s320/450px-NewMountinDew.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" border="0" alt="Shouldn&amp;#39;t it be &amp;#39;Mntn Dw&amp;#39;?" title="Shouldn&amp;#39;t it be &amp;#39;Mntn Dw&amp;#39;?"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm really confused by the new Mountain Dew packaging. What the hell is up with that? Are they suddenly too extreme for vowels? Does M&lt;strike&gt;oun&lt;/strike&gt;t&lt;strike&gt;ai&lt;/strike&gt;n Dew make you too fast-paced to use full words? I can't wait to try the new Sr Mist and Pps and Dr. Pepper...okay, maybe the last one is a bad example. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2009/01/back-to-old-friend.html"&gt;Bronze Dog&lt;/a&gt;, I never managed to get into Magic: The Gathering. I've got gajillions of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverPower"&gt;Overpower&lt;/a&gt; cards if anyone wants to play, though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Anyone?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-1556951427508490050?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232919188989"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/25/solar-eclipse-kinda/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c6f37626277cf5a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Solar eclipse.

But there are two things you should know: it’s annular, and you probably won’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/01/annular_eclipse.jpg" alt="Annular eclipse, pedigree unknown"&gt;Annular eclipses happen when the Moon is at or near apogee, the point in its orbit when its farthest from Earth. It looks a bit smaller because it’s farther away, so it doesn’t cover the Sun completely. In this case, the eclipse is happening near &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/04/does-this-perihelion-make-my-sun-look-fat/"&gt;perihelion&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;em&gt;Earth&lt;/em&gt; is closest to the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt;, so we’re maximizing the effect: the Moon looks small and the Sun looks big. When this happens, the Moon leaves a ring of sun around it, called an &lt;em&gt;annulus&lt;/em&gt; (Latin for &lt;em&gt;ring&lt;/em&gt;). Hence annular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEplot/SEplot2001/SE2009Jan26A.GIF"&gt;this eclipse happens mostly over the vast nearly empty &lt;del&gt;Pacific&lt;/del&gt; Indian  Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not a great one to get lots of folks to see it. A partial eclipse will be seen over south Africa, Australia, and Indonesia, so that’s cool. For &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. It’ll be snowing here in Boulder. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232916768733"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5666">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b5013847464e224</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Links elsewhere"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">A Minefield of Woo</title><published>2009-01-25T20:18:55Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T20:18:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5666" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know you don’t usually see me post here outside of the Quickies but I came across this stunning example of pseudoscience that has inspired me to be a little more wordy than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Otis and Jenny Funkmeyer it takes only 3 steps to bend a spoon:  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOGkCxcp6CE"&gt;announce your intentions, command the spoon to bend, and let go of your goal-oriented mindset.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/WOGkCxcp6CE%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that though spoon bending is called an amazing example of the mind’s ability to influence objects, none of the people in the video are able to bend a spoon without aid from their HANDS.  You may also note that they use the old “rubber pen” trick as a way to bend a spoon.  Unfortunately, this method does not have lasting results since as soon as you stop bouncing the spoon, it’s magically straight again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In looking into the Funkmeyer’s &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://funkmeyers.com/"&gt;web&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://otisfunkmeyer.com/"&gt;presence&lt;/a&gt;, I find myself much more disturbed than by this video alone.  They seem to be marketing themselves as a brand that’s based on “the power of positive thinking.”  If you take a look at the post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.funkmeyers.com/10-books-that-changed-my-life"&gt;“10 books that changed my life”&lt;/a&gt; you’ll find mention of &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php"&gt;The Law of Attraction&lt;/a&gt;.  There is also a post of &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.funkmeyers.com/10-books-on-health-that-shaped-my-body-mind"&gt;books on health&lt;/a&gt; which is a comprehensive collection of woo.  And their top recommended book for changing the world in 2009?  It was &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.funkmeyers.com/2009-worldchanging-book-recommendation-not-what-youd-think"&gt;channeled from an extraterrestrial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://otisfunkmeyer.com/2008/09/23/i-am-28-and-i-am-grateful/"&gt;Otis mentions&lt;/a&gt; that his goal for this upcoming year is, “…is to be rich. Make a lot of money and invest well and become an aggressive, risk-taking, shrewd businessman. Like a new age Richard Branson or something.”   He seems to be well on his way to doing so.  Today, in fact, they’re hosting &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.funkmeyers.com/events"&gt;a spoon bending party&lt;/a&gt; that you can attend for a mere $30.  Certainly a bargain compared to the $400 it costs to get &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://store.funkmeyers.com/"&gt;a psychic reading from Otis or an energy healing session with Jenny&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that this is small scale in comparison to the Sylvia Brownes, the John Edwards, the Deepak Chopras of the world yet we can see the same tricks of the trade being practiced here by the Funkmeyers.  A promise of hope as long as you’re willing to pay for it.  A new insight on life if you have the cash.  The world can be yours and you can do anything if you just hand over your credit card and attend our workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What saddens me even more in this case is that these two people seem to have truly and deeply drunk of the Kool Aid and believe everything that they espouse.  From energy healing to psychic readings to spoon bending to raw food to the Mayan calendar predictions, they seem to absorb every bit of woo that crosses their path wholecloth.  And now they’re doing their damndest to market it to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Amanda</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232914435944"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/nazi_zombies_preparing_to_invade_the_uni.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/93cfa286a2762065</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment/culture"/><title type="html">Nazi zombies are preparing to invade the United States</title><published>2009-01-25T18:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T18:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/WsCjZns7tfM/nazi_zombies_preparing_to_invade_the_uni.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/nazi_zombies_preparing_to_invade_the_uni.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in December, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/when_zombie_nazis_attack.php"&gt;pointed out a Norwegian movie&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/history/hitler_zombie/"&gt;Hitler Zombie&lt;/a&gt; definitely approves of: &lt;em&gt;Dead Snow&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dodsno.no"&gt;Død Snø&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Norwegian). After all, how can you go wrong with Nazi zombies in a remote, snow bound area in Norway attacking the usual bunch of hapless but beautiful young people?

The perspective of people who were born with their disabilities and the perspective of people who acquired their disabilities later in life.  While people with different perspectives often disagree (sometimes violently) with each other, I also feel there is much to be learned from considering  and integrating multiple perspectives (blame this on my systems science Interest!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism cause member &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/profile/view/403974"&gt;Elesia Ashkenazy&lt;/a&gt; is a person who has many those perspectives at once.  She's always been an Aspergers' autistic, and also went from having a usable amount of hearing to being profoundly deaf.  She has been a professional in the speech language pathology field, and is the parent of an autistic child.  She has been involved in both the Deaf and Autistic culture movements.  Since it's hard to get people from all those perspectives to agree on much of anything, I was curious what the experience of having all these perspectives (particularly the cross-disability perspectives) at once may have taught Elesia about disability and advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: You've been able to view disability from a lot of different perspectives.  What is the most important insight you feel you've gained from experiencing disability in so many different ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: The most important insight I have gained about disability through my experiences would fall right in line with a Kim Peek quote, which goes: &lt;em&gt;You don't have to be disabled to be different because everybody is different.&lt;/em&gt; I have also come to feel that being disabled is more about being mismatched with the environment rather than being "broken" or "afflicted." It is not until I learned that life is not always about labels--though labels definitely have a time and a place--but more about learning to love myself for who I am. It was from that idea that I was able to choose to &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; life, which has now become a game that I am playing; only I am the director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: You were active in the Deaf community before you became involved with the Autistic community.  What knowledge or skills gained from being an advocate in the Deaf community have you found most applicable to being an advocate in the Autistic community (both as a self-advocate and as an advocate for your child)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: Cliché as this may be, I suppose that I have learned that it really is best to catch flies with a little honey. I completely understand taking a militant stance.  I mean, enough is enough. There is, however, great value in putting out positive proactive messages and sticking to the bottom line without using negative tactics. I have never &lt;em&gt;fought&lt;/em&gt; for Deaf or Autistic rights, per say, but I have stood my ground armed with peace and love. Sharing ideas and beliefs keeps the world turning. On the other hand, precious energy is wasted when power is given to ongoing disagreements. A message is most effective when simply stated and then lived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: What thing or things do you feel are the most similar between the Deaf and Autistic communities?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: Compassion and understanding along with sharing a common culture. Our autism brings us together in the same way that deafness binds the Deaf community. There is what I call "special homing chemicals" between those who fall from the same tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: What thing or things do you feel are the most the different between the Deaf and Autistic communities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: Obviously, autistics do not share a language specific to the community. It also comes to mind that the Autistic community is much newer and lacks the rich history of the Deaf community. For too long, autistics have been robbed of having a voice. It is as if we are greenhorns as far as building a community and expressing a culture. It pleases me how successful we have become thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Some self-advocates might claim that you've adopted a cure rather than acceptance stance by getting a cochlear implant.  Would you agree or disagree?  Could you talk a little about why you decided to get the cochlear implant, and how you feel your decision fits in (or not) with the complex issue of "cure?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: Cochlear implants are not a cure for deafness. That is a myth. Cochlear implants are an assistive device. I can choose when I do and do not want to use my cochlear implant. I would not have gone through with the surgery if I were not able to have this control. Cochlear implants are an individual choice. Forcing cochlear implants on every deaf child or person is, in and of itself, proposing that one shoe fits all. As far as the complex "cure" issue, let me put it this way. I used to live my life practically killing myself to please anyone and everyone. Guess what? I had no true friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: What do you feel is the most important thing the Autistic community can learn from the Deaf community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: How empowering and meaningful it is to be a part of a positive (or posautive) thriving close knit community regardless of antagonistic societal fears or disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232910674185"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/25/sundaynia/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/460d0bd401c939f4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="SciFi"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><title type="html">Sundaynia</title><published>2009-01-25T19:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T19:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/25/sundaynia/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s snowing and I’m tired and I have a pile of work to do, so here’s some stuff to gawk at on a Sunday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Popular Mechanics has an article up about &lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/4299775.html"&gt;the Five Most Powerful Telescopes&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not big on the word &amp;quot;powerful&amp;quot;, since telescopes are passive. They are the biggest, or can see the faintest objects, or have the best resolution. What irritates me more is that I use the word myself sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) From &lt;a href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/blog/2009/01/watch_it_doctor_whobattlestar.html"&gt;FlickFilosopher&lt;/a&gt; comes news of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHddca_TiaI"&gt;this very well-done mashup&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/AHddca_TiaI%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) HiRISE posted &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010074_2020"&gt;this image&lt;/a&gt; of carbonate deposits in Nili Fossae, a region where methane gas being generated was recently detected. Pretty! It’s a fault fracture in the Martian surface, with blocks of crust that have dropped down between the fault lines, and it’s also been partially flooded with sediment from a nearby crater. &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16305-longsought-carbonate-minerals-found-on-mars.html"&gt;The carbonates may have come from liquid water mixing with some minerals in the region&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still and all, there I am. I don’t use Facebook much, as I find it an irritating way to talk to people. MySpace is far, far worse, with a signal-to-noise that I swear is actually negative.

It&amp;#39;s all very sensible. Until the evangelicals discovered them. Now there&amp;#39;s a missionary campaign to put a bible in every one of them, too, since, as the founder of this plan says, &lt;span&gt;"I realised then this was a captive audience."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I'm going to have to move to New Zealand now. The &lt;a href="http://canadiancynic.blogspot.com/2009/01/sometimes-people-have-right-idea.html"&gt;response by hikers to this effort is classic pragmatism&lt;/a&gt;. They think it is a fine idea.&lt;/p&gt;

However, if a magazine is about science and wishes to preserve its credibility as a source of science information (and thus, to sell magazines), it should do its best to avoid unnecessary hype, especially when this touches on sensitive issues in science policy or education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, I am afraid to say that New Scientist, which I have previously praised for excellent, balanced coverage [&lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2007/07/new-scientist-gets-it-right.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/04/my-growing-respect-for-new-scientist.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;], now looks to be taking the hype road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at these two recent cover stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/files/currentcover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:150px;height:197px" src="http://www.scientificblogging.com/files/currentcover.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forget genes?  Really?  This story was about epigenetics, and floated the idea that maybe evolution is Lamarckian after all.  Nevermind the fact that they &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/07/epigenetics-and-neo-neo-lamarckism.html"&gt;don't seem to know what Lamarckian evolution actually is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SXkJYbOgGUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/66gj6P_kqWk/s400/currentcover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:150px;height:197px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SXkJYbOgGUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/66gj6P_kqWk/s400/currentcover.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This one has, rightly, provoked the ire of many bloggers/scientists [see &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/01/the_trouble_with_science_journ.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/01/and-new-scientist-drops-notch.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/darwin-was-wrong.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://chancenecessity.blogspot.com/2009/01/its-such-fine-line-between-stupid-and.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hoxfulmonsters.com/2009/01/darwin-the-genius-of-evolution/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://roughguidetoevolution.blogspot.com/2009/01/of-trees-of-life-and-straw-men.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://evolutionlist.blogspot.com/2009/01/horizontal-gene-transfer-and.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/graham_lawton_was_wrong.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://evolutionarynovelty.blogspot.com/2009/01/was-darwin-wrong.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;].  It is without question irresponsible, poorly timed, and sure to be invoked by anti-evolutionists, making the job of defending science and science education more difficult.  The &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/explaining-new-scientist-cover.html"&gt;explanation offered by the author/editor for it is unacceptable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fundamentally, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Darwin was right&lt;/span&gt; about his two big ideas that really matter: common descent and natural selection. To say "Darwin was wrong", even within the article's context, is nonsense.  The fact that it will undoubtedly be taken to refer to the big ideas rather than a specific analogy makes it infuriatingly misleading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compare this with the approach taken by National Geographic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SXxo7fuv2II/AAAAAAAAAnU/wdd10q06cJ0/s1600-h/darwin-no.thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:308px;height:227px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SXxo7fuv2II/AAAAAAAAAnU/wdd10q06cJ0/s400/darwin-no.thumbnail.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pretty provocative cover, but still phrased as a question -- and answered without ambiguity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SXxqCrD7KJI/AAAAAAAAAnc/4cmKudaIzmw/s1600-h/promo_feb09_ngm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:121px;height:173px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SXxqCrD7KJI/AAAAAAAAAnc/4cmKudaIzmw/s400/promo_feb09_ngm.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a lot that Darwin didn't know, and I hope that the success of evolutionary biology in the 150 years since the Origin is talked about in abundance this year.  But the fact that his two big ideas, common descent and natural selection, have survived every scientific discovery since the mid 1800s is overwhelmingly convincing that he was brilliant and insightful and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;.  (The associated story, &lt;a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/02/darwin-legacy/ridley-text"&gt;Modern Darwins&lt;/a&gt; by Matt Ridley, is certainly worth reading.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be clear, I don't think magazines should make decisions about their covers or articles solely on the basis of how anti-evolutionists might use them.  But as communicators, they -- and any scientists interviewed in popular articles -- have a responsiblity to think about the implications of what they say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As pointed out recently by &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/n47h34357743w4p0/?p=b92eaf8c7a5a4eccb52f94dde6cb99ee&amp;amp;pi=1"&gt;Scott and Branch&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;in science, we do not shape our research because of what creationists claim about our subject matter. But when we are in the classroom or otherwise dealing with the public understanding of science, it is entirely appropriate to consider whether what we say may be misunderstood.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I strongly encourage New Scientist to rethink the message that cover stories like this send.&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/14X5veZYS1s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232900184480"><id gr:original-id="http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/01/dear-eggspectations-waiters-w/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a86364a453c15706</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">dear eggspectations waiters, w…</title><published>2009-01-25T16:13:51Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T16:13:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/01/dear-eggspectations-waiters-w/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;dear eggspectations waiters, when it’s a table of 10 please write down the order, trying to memorise is not smart or cool, kthxbye&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232899763075"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/unaccustomed_to_free_time.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bd3bbb7f15401562</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Introspection"/><title type="html">Unaccustomed to Free Time</title><published>2009-01-25T14:56:08Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T14:56:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/oDhe7OxYv3s/unaccustomed_to_free_time.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/unaccustomed_to_free_time.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being a married man and a father of small children, I am very rarely alone in the workday evenings or weekends. Indeed, in the past five or or six years, my capacity for sustained self-entertainment (yeah, yeah, OK; "nudge, nudge") has atrophied to the point where I no longer know what to do when faced with a free Sunday. Yet this was the situation I found myself in last night. Wife off on business trip. Son at mom's place. Daughter likely to spend day at friend's place. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some thought, I reached the conclusion that I would very much like to spend the afternoon with friends at a museum and a café. That is the sort of enjoyable pastime that small children turn into a stressful chore. So I was happy, having found out what I would like to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, I started planning this too late. My daughter's friend was only available until three o'clock. My own friends have kids too or were otherwise occupied. So here's what I did with my lazy Sunday:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Went to town reading Pratchett on the train.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had vaguely Asian chicken &amp;amp; shrimp wok.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempted to get replacement for non-functional remote control at shop in town, was directed to suburban mall.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to mall reading Pratchett.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got remote control replaced. Checked price on wifi card for old laptop.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rode bus home reading Pratchett.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought groceries.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was invited to new neighbours for tea and a bun and a chat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader, if you found yourself with a free Sunday, would it surprise you?

Fortunately, the next meeting of the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com"&gt;Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt; is just around the corner, scheduled to hit the blogosphere on Thursday, January 29 over at &lt;a href="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/2009/01/24/skeptics-circle-update/"&gt;Space City Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, skeptical bloggers (or bloggers who want to dip their toes into the skeptical pool), fire up your computers, start tapping those keyboards, and provide the material needed to make this a great one. We don't want the burning stupid of many of the creduloids to be the only source of warmth around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'm in the process of updating the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;Skeptics' Circle hosting schedule&lt;/a&gt; to accommodate a change and the addition of a couple of more hosts. (Come to think of it, I really need to update the template and the lists of past hosts too, but I don't know if I'll get to it today. Anyone who is good at Blogger template generation, your help would be welcome.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is a perfect time to add yet more hosts to our roll of skeptical awesomeness. ("Awesomeness"? Methinks I've been reading &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/"&gt;Skepchick&lt;/a&gt; too much. Actually, you can never read Skepchick too much. But you can say "awesomeness" too much.) So, if you--yes, you!--are interested in skepticism and have a blog where you write about science or skeptical topics more than just once in a blue moon, why not volunteer to host? It's fun, and it'll give you a traffic boost. Just peruse the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;guidelines and schedule&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/07/skeptics-circle-reloaded.html"&gt;guidelines for hosting&lt;/a&gt;, and then drop me a line at orac@scienceblogs.com. I'll run your blog through my patented James Randi-style BS detector to make sure you're not a closet woo trying to go all Deepak Chopra on the Circle and then, assuming you pass the test (and if you're really a skeptic, it's a pathetically easy test to pass), find you a spot on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/fast_approaching_once_again_the_104th_me.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/-x-CaPAySwU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232892061597"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1063">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a5ff62f37c7fdaf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lost in Translation"/><title type="html">Rational use of Russian bowels</title><published>2009-01-25T13:26:18Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T13:26:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1063" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Headlined as a list of &amp;quot;Top 10 translation fails of 2008″, &lt;a href="http://www.altalang.com/beyond-words/2009/01/05/top-10-translation-fails-of-2008/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; at the company blog of Alta Language Services is a mixed bag. There are amusing solutions to translation difficulties (the Arabic, French, and Italian for &lt;em&gt;Maverick&lt;/em&gt;), subtle choices with serious consequences (whether Russian troops provide security "for" South Ossetia and Abkhazia or security "in" South Ossetia and Abkhazia), unsubtle choices with funny consequences ("state regulation of bowels use" rather than "state regulation of underground natural resources use"), and so on. Regular LL readers will recognize several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the "bowels" document is still on line at the web site of the European Commission, despite having been &lt;a href="http://kosmyryk.typepad.com/wu_wei/2008/09/mistranslation.html"&gt;featured&lt;/a&gt; back in September on the Wu Wei website: "&lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/energy/russia/events/doc/2003_strategy_2020_en.pdf"&gt;The Summary of the Energy Strategy of the Russia for the Period of up to 2020&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning behind "bowels" seems to have been something like "oil and gas", or perhaps more generally "things found beneath the earth", via a misapprehension of the generality of the English expression "bowels of the earth". On page 9 of the cited document, there's a section headed "Bowels' Use and Management of the State Bowels' Fund", which starts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The current condition of mineral and raw base of fuel-energy complex indicates the necessity of cardinal changes in the mechanisms of reproduction of raw base of carbohydrates. The imperfection of state control system in the sphere of reproduction and use of strategic kinds of raw material can lead to the forced labour-rent of the best supply, slow rates of new fields' development, nonobservance of projects of development, slow rates of supply preparing and other negative tendencies, threatening the energy safety of Russia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The main task of the public energy policy in this sphere is the reproduction of the mineral-raw base of hydrocarbon and other fuel-energy resources and rational use of Russian bowels for providing the stable economic development of the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that "carbohydrates" is used in place of "hydrocarbons" in the first sentence, although "hydrocarbon" is used correctly in the last one.) I suppose that this document was originally written in Russian and then translated into English, though perhaps it was originally written in English by a non-native speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For solution of this task we provide:&lt;br&gt;
- perfection and coordination of management of mineral-raw base development on the basis of long-term and half-term programs of bowels' study, taking into account the estimated levels of consumption of inflammable minerals;&lt;br&gt;
- coordination of executives of all the levels, securing by the executives authorities on the strategy of mineral-raw complex development, the main control functions, differentiation of the executive and management functions in the state regulation of bowels use;&lt;br&gt;
- perfection of Russian legislative branch, connected with the bowels use. This provides the opportunity for use of the bowels plots both on the administrative and on the civil and legal basis, including concession contracts, regulation of the mechanism of bowels use with the explicit regulation of all the stages and phases of the process of license making, simplification of the procedure of license issuing on the small fields for providing the local needs in fuel-energy resources, making the licenses and contracts about bowels users'  engagements, connected with the bowels use, stages and terms of field developments, checking of financial state of the client when giving him right for bowels use;&lt;br&gt;
- development and realization of programs for the use of bowels plots, including the carrying on the auctions on bowels use and the issuing of transparent licenses for search and development of resources;&lt;br&gt;
- creating the stable legal conditions for taking by bowels users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note that this offers a new linguistic perspective on the recent Russian gas crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232889122796"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_581.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eba99c7d84319de4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-01-25T12:52:53Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T12:52:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/sDIvlsLUSR0/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_581.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_581.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_581.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_581.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/sDIvlsLUSR0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232884909170"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=422">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44a9e32de1aa5862</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Prophesy"/><category term="Religion/Faith"/><category term="bible"/><title type="html">Bible Prophesy</title><published>2009-01-25T12:00:54Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T12:00:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=422" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We recently received the following e-mail from a listender:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;br&gt;
I’m 26 years old and spent my entire life as a “christian” until recently thanks to folks like you, Penn &amp;amp; Teller and of course Randi. I just got into my first discussion with a christian and they dumped something on me that I haven’t been able to find a lot of info on the web from the skeptic community.  It’s about a supposedly “fulfilled” prophecy regarding the lost tribe of Israel called Zebulun.  Whenever I hear about prophecies being fulfilled my skeptic goggles immediately go on.  Here’s an excerpt of what he emailed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Genesis 49:13&lt;br&gt;
Zebulun will dwell at the seashore;&lt;br&gt;
And he shall be a haven for ships,&lt;br&gt;
And his flank shall be toward Sidon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two lines are blatant and they’re what I’ll address here. That prophecy was NOT fulfilled in Canaan: Zebulun was landlocked, touching neither the Mediterranean nor the Galilee.&lt;br&gt;
In those westward migrations, a people called Sabalingoi settled Holland. Sabalin means Zebulun (if you are familiar with linguistics) and goi is the Hebrew word for people: the people of Zebulun.&lt;br&gt;
Holland is something like 80% seashore and they possess the Europort at Rotterdam, which is the largest seaport in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a fulfilled prophecy, the divine authorship of the Bible has credence. With more study, you will find plethoras of facts like that upon which you can build a strong foundation of faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize for this being so long but I just don’t have the information to continue a dialogue with this fellow and any and all help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;clint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the question, Clint. First some observations about prophesy in general, then I will delve into Genesis 49:13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prophesy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said recently on the SGU - prophesy is easy.  It is easy to make stuff up. Typically, stuff made up as prophesy is poetic and vague in form. The advantage of this is twofold - it sounds more profound, and it places the burden on the receiver of the prophesy to do all the hard work. The one receiving the prophesy has to scour world events to find a fit for one possible interpretation of the poetic vagaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nostradamus, of course, perfected this style. His quatrains are literal poetry. He was deliberately vague, mostly so that he could trash talk his contemporaries and have plausible deniability. It is important to recognize that many of his prophesies were meant for his patrons, and so they dealt with subjects his patrons cared about - namely their own time and place. They did not care about distant lands and times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, proponents of Nostradamus as a legitimate prophet increase the probability of finding a “hit” by removing his prediction from all context. They allow themselves all of human history to scour for pattern recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to think of it this way - if Nostradamus were just making up random crap, would we be able to find apparent matches between that random crap and the subsequent centuries of world history? The answer is clearly yes - and therefore the fact that apparent matches exist does not mean the prophesies have any reality to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broader concept is that the use of vague or open-ended criteria allow for finding correlations even where they do not exist. Humans are great at pattern recognition. Vague patterns therefore have no predictive value, because you can find them anyway. Only specific hits (for example when an actual date and place are unambiguously mentioned) are of any value - and it turns out that every time Nostradamus gave us a date his prophesy was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible  Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Western culture the Bible is a popular source of prophesy. This is partly because some parts of the Bible were meant as prophesy. However, even books that are not actual prophesy are dredged by believers for any out-of-context snippets that can be presented as such. The extreme version of this is the Bible Code - taking the words and letters even out of linguistic context and dredging them for random patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most popular book of the Christian Bible for prophesy seekers in the Book of Revelation. Believers have fun interpreting every passage and trying to link it to the modern world so that it seems as if it is predicting the end times to come (and very soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, scholars understand that the Book of Revelation is a commentary on the corrupt Roman Empire. Again - trash talk was disguised as poetic prophesy. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/texts/revelation.shtml"&gt;this reference explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infamous seven-headed Beast that rises from the sea demanding to be worshipped symbolises Rome. By John’s time seven emperors had ruled over Rome and Rome was known as the city of seven hills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, detach the imagery from the known historical context, and the seven-headed Beast can be anything that has the number 7 attached to it in any way. Of course, when this is applied to something specific it can seem very compelling - our brains are simply hard-wired to find such patterns very compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 49:13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a look at the verse in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zebulun will dwell at the seashore;&lt;br&gt;
And he shall be a haven for ships,&lt;br&gt;
And his flank shall be toward Sidon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s put this into context. Chapter 49 of genesis is entirely composed of Jacob calling his sons before him and giving each a blessing/prophesy for their future. At the end of the chapter he breathes his last and dies. The chapter, as is typical, is very poetic, and therefore difficult to interpret in places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for context, keep in mind that the text was written after the events allegedly took place. While some elements of Genesis are historical, the literary form is not straight history. Genesis reflects the later beliefs of the Jewish people and their interpretation of their own faith, history, and relationship with God. Prophesies were often retrodicted. Or they were simply added to make a moral point, not as literal prophesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let us take this passage as prophesy, which it seems it was meant to be. The prophesy is clearly about each of the sons of Jacob, who went on to head each of the 10 tribes of Israel. The simplest interpretation of the passage, therefore, is that Jacob’s son, Zebulun, would later reside by the seashore and his tribe’s lands would extend toward Sidon. &lt;a href="http://www.garriss.org/OT_files/Gen%2049.pdf"&gt;How does that prophesy check out:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tribe of Zebulun settled in the north, between the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean Sea (see the map on the following page). The prophecy is challenging, because Zebulun was actually landlocked; in Joshua’s days it did not border either of these seas. There are a few suggestions on how to view this prophecy. One, it might have referred more to Zebulun’s trading partnerships with the Phoenicians. Two, it might have referred to its size later in history; during the reign of Solomon, Zebulun’s borders extended to the Med.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm…not so good. Zebulun’s lands were landlocked. In order to rescue the prophesy we have to project further into the future when the tribe of Zebulun extended to the Mediterranean. Of course, the author of this passage (or later revisions of it) would have known this at the time of the “prediction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is therefore not really a prediction (although it is a story of a prophesy) - it is just a literary device. This is similar to me writing a story today about the founding of America and including in that story a made-up conversation between Washington and Jefferson in which Washington says some prophetic things about modern America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, some of the modern claims for this passage, such as those referenced by Clint, remove the passage from all context. Even though the entire chapter in Genesis is Jacob giving his final blessings to his sons, and he specifically refers to Zebulun, one of his sons,  by name, we are now meant to believe that Jacob, in that one verse, was not talking about his son but was making an irrelevant pun. He was using his son’s name to refer obtusely to some of the people of Israel who would later settle in Holland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, this is supposed to be an impressive hit because Holland has coastline and ports. Most of human civilization concentrates around shorelines and ports. That some of the people of Zebulun found their way to a country with ports is of no great surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we see the pattern of so-called prophesies - the actual text is removed from its historical and literary context, the statements are interpreted in a vague and extremely loose fashion, and then all of human history is scoured for an apparent match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some poor, credulous redneck saw a gnat flying through a CNN broadcast of Barack Obama’s inauguration, naturally assumed it was &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;aliens visiting the planet Earth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“military security technology&lt;/span&gt;,”** and quickly uploaded the video to YouTube complete with his delightful color commentary. Highlights include the gnat obviously zipping back and forth &lt;em&gt;in front of&lt;/em&gt; the Washington Monument while the hick points out that it is actually (contrary to the video) a very large object flying &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; “the obelisk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let this be a lesson to you: when looking for hits on YouTube (&amp;gt;374,000), don’t let the facts get in the way. EVER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*I’m sorry, Southern rednecks. I really do love you, especially Maria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**That’s a quick edit I just did after I read the info he put on the video, which currently reads, “I don’t think it’s alien, if anything, it must be some military security technology we have or something.” The words “bug,” “gnat,” or “insect” do not appear in his description.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232871383456"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/squiggles_and_loops_a_different_way_of_seeing">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9779b01ac8b3aa52</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Squiggles and Loops: A Different Way of Seeing</title><published>2009-01-25T08:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T08:15:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/squiggles_and_loops_a_different_way_of_seeing" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the one hand &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/so_what_is_autism_advocacy"&gt;advocacy for autism&lt;/a&gt; is about policy, and lobbying for changes in policy to provide necessary supports, services, and accommodations. And on the other hand, advocacy is on a much smaller level, and seemingly less grand. For me, advocating for my son isn't only about trying to change the world to accommodate his needs as an individual on the autism spectrum. It's also about my trying to change myself to understand things from his perspective and point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/_MMORgBV5Yw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance: Charlie--he's now more than 11 1/2 as I've been saying, as his birthday is in May---seems to have trouble identifying figures and objects when they're drawn. It's hit or miss what he'll call a drawing of any four-footed animal from cows to dogs to cats to horses. His teacher sends home worksheets with simple phrases; he's to circle the drawing that the phrase describes. He'll squint at the black and white drawings and I suspect he's seeing them as a bunch of black lines, of some indeterminate "what." (This difficulty identifying pictures was one reason that Charlie was never too inclined to use &lt;a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/subjects/8561.asp"&gt;PECS&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or rather, I don't think that Charlie sees in a drawing what I'm seeing, or what he's "supposed" to see---a picture of a street scene is a mass of lines and colors and shapes, perhaps, to him. There's a review in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/arts/design/23raph.html?ref=arts"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; about an exhibition of drawings, "&lt;a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId=%7B4EF0DAB2-E291-43C8-B2B2-A03DF2DAA0C4%7D"&gt;Raphael to Renoir: Drawings From the Collection of Jean Bonna&lt;/a&gt;," at the &lt;a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;.  The review caught my eye because of its title, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/arts/design/23raph.html?ref=arts"&gt;Where Lines Become a Language&lt;/a&gt;. Here's how some of the drawings were described:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show has ..... memorable examples of drawing-as-writing. A faint, scratchy ink landscape by the Florentine painter Baccio della Porta, better known as Fra Bartolommeo, suggests a letter quickly written as a pen was running dry. Cézanne’s graphite-and-watercolor “Wooded Landscape” seems to be composed largely of punctuation marks indicating starts, stops, pauses and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is Parmigianino’s “Holy Family With Shepherds and Angels” if not a devotional poem jotted down in a shorthand script made up entirely of abstract flourishes — squiggles and loops — that by some miracle cohere into recognizable shapes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the "squiggles and loops" that Charlie seems (as far as I can tell, from numerous experiences watching him looking at pictures) to see, as if his mind---as noted in an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/while_i_was_reading_obamas_speech"&gt;article in the February Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;---tends to focus on what many would say is "irrelevant," to minute details, rather than on the "big picture."  Or perhaps, it'd be more accurate to say that Charlie's got a very different way of seeing the world, a kind of hyper-focus somewhat similar to whatever enables the artist &lt;a href="http://www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk/gallery.aspx"&gt;Stephen Wiltshire&lt;/a&gt; to draw his perfectly detailed panoramic landscapes of cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/my-secret-life-stephen-wiltshire-artist-34-1488487.html"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Wiltshire in today's &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/my-secret-life-stephen-wiltshire-artist-34-1488487.html"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;. He sums up in his life in seven words as "Keep doing what I do best, drawing" (and notes that he likes the movie &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/"&gt;Rain Man&lt;/a&gt;). Like Charlie, Wiltshire likes "to stroll through the city, working on new ideas"; he rides public transport and prefers the upper level of a double-decker bus "as the view is better from there." Charlie also has a fondness for public transportation, though it's usually underground, in the form of the subway and, so far, he's not been interested in drawing. Wiltshire's impeccably detailed art suggests to me how Charlie might be viewing the world, with an attention to details that I didn't know where there, to the squiggles and the loops and lines of things.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232871185183"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_101.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/48c6d51040a3c3db</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SO'09"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline'09 - Saturday 10:15am</title><published>2009-01-25T07:19:33Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T07:19:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/F0O74HJj6Ko/scienceonline09_-_saturday_101.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_101.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="scienceonline09.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scienceonline09.jpg" width="355" height="175"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on with the morning, once again, I had to make a tough choice. OK, in this case, it wasn't that tough, really, as this was the session I was looking forward to all along: &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Science_online_middlehigh_school_perspective/" title=""&gt;Science online - middle/high school perspective (or: 'how the Facebook generation does it'?) &lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href="http://blogging4biology.edublogs.org/" title=""&gt;Stacy Baker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/" title=""&gt;her students&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this session has a long history....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a session on using blogs in science education at the 1st science blogging conference and it was quite an eye-opener. It was led by Adnaan Wasey and Lea Winerman (from the The Online PBS NewsHour at the time). Takehome message #1: a lot of science educational materials on the Web are not accurate (and need scientists to verify them). Takehome message #2: no matter how good a blog post is, it is useless to a teacher if it does not fit into the curriculum as designed by the state. The result of that discussion was the starting of the initiative to collect in one place all the posts that cover &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/basic_concepts/" title=""&gt;Basic Concepts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2nd Science Blogging Conference, we had snow! And because this is NC, structurally unprepared for snow, about 30 of our registered participants could not show up - almost all of them middle/high school teachers from all around the state!  Thus, although the session about education was led by Maestro himself, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/05/removing_the_bricks_from_the_c.php" title=""&gt;David Warlick&lt;/a&gt;, it had a strange feeling: a bunch of bloggers, scientists and web developers were sitting in the room talking about people who were not there - teachers and students - people who actually have day-to-day experience with technology in the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the very next day, I started plotting a plan to bring in a Real Teacher and Real Students to the conference to tell us from their perspective how online technologies are used in a science classroom. So, naturally, I started looking around the Triangle and NC for candidate teachers, but without much success. Then, one day, I saw that my SciBling Sandy posted &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/2008/09/finding_outreach_opportunities.php" title=""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and I saw the first comment by a familiar name....so I responded by posting &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/09/help_biology_teachers_use_blog.php" title=""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and the rest is history. Both Stacy Baker and Elisa Hoffman  (from that comment thread) came to ScienceOnline'09 in the end, but it was logistically feasible only for Miss Baker to bring along the students, so she ended up leading the session with eight of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="scienceOnline09 - Miss Baker.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scienceOnline09%20-%20Miss%20Baker.jpg" width="336" height="448" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Now, don't think that logistics of doing this were easy! There were legal issues (e.g., exactly who is allowed to drive a vehicle with students!), and there were ethical issues, especially regarding the students' privacy and anonymity (you may have noticed that their names were not listed anywhere on the wiki or elsewhere online - it was up to them, after discussing this with Miss Baker, to reveal as little or as much as they wanted, but only in person at the conference, not plastered all over the internets). But going through all the intricacies of organizing this session was a pleasure to do with Miss Baker, not the least because we could both easily and comfortably use bazillions of communication channels: from phone and e-mail, through Twitter, Facebook to FriendFeed and others. That's one Teacher Who Rocks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of this work paid off!  What a pleasurable sight it was when the yellow school bus pulled up at the Radisson!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their session, the students explained to us how, in their Biology classes (9th grade Biology, and 11th grade AP Biology) they use various online tools, why they use such a variety, and pros and cons of each tool. For instance, their blog is public (these days, I'd say, very public!), commenting is open to everyone (even solicited, though moderated) and part of the students' grades depends on the quality of their posts and comments there. On the other hand, they use Twitter and Ning in a closed, private setting for in-class discussions. In-between are their wiki, their video page, the Flickr account, etc., which are public but not as visible or popular as the blog. They do not use Facebook for school due to difficulties in separating personal from professional and the potential for the Creepy Treehouse effect (check their session's wiki page for links to everything mentioned in this paragraph).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="ScienceOnline09 - students.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/ScienceOnline09%20-%20students.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a large conference like this (200+ people were there on Saturday), moderating a session or being on a panel is the opportunity to have one's 5 minutes (OK, really 65 minutes) in the spotlight, with everyone's attention trained at you. But with Miss Baker and her students, it was different - their session was just a highlight, a small part of it, they stole the entire show!  And that was good! Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I've been to a bunch of techie/blogging conferences and most of the people in attendance look..., well, they look sort of like me: mostly male, white, 40-ish, middle-class, graying geeks. We have always strived to make our conference more diverse than that, and one aspect of diversity is certainly age. The eight students (and there were 3 others in the 16-18yrs old range as well, who came with their parents) changed the tone of the conference in a very positive way. Just their presence made the conference more exciting and lively and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I've been watching the blogosphere, including edublogs, for quite some time now and have noticed that Generation Wars erupt every now and then.  There are two highly opinionated camps in those wars.  One camp takes it for granted that the kids are 'digital natives' who use the Web intuitively while all those over 30 are dinosaurs. The other camp likes to remind that computers, Internet and Web were thought of, invented and built by the elders and that kids tend to be digitally illiterate and need to be taught the basics in school. Of course, both camps are somewhat right: digital nimbleness has to be learned (as far as I know, nobody Twittered from the womb....yet), and anyone of any age can become a digital native after a while. Some people of all ages have become so, the others of all ages are still behind the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an opportunity for some tremenduously smart, self-aware, thoughthful and Web-savvy teenagers to mingle with a crowd that usually thinks of them in purely abstract, academic terms.  The two age groups got to meet each other in flesh and dispel some of each other's myths about the other. Perhaps some (on both sides) were surprised with the computer savviness of the other. It's hard to tell who was more excited about meeting each other!  We all learned from this interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that the conference was as eye-opening to the students as it was for us. For a couple of days they were equals with all those scientists, librarians, popular bloggers, web developers, journalists and writers - not just treated as equals due to good will, but because they &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; equals in the domain of the use of online technologies in science communication and education. All of this is new to everyone, and age plays no role in the degree of expertise one has. They came to learn from us, and we learned from them just as much. I hope that this experience is going to help them in their future lives and careers, and I sure hope they can come back next year!&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Blog_and_Media_Coverage/" title=""&gt;blog/media coverage linkfest&lt;/a&gt; is growing fast (perhaps start at the bottom and work your way up, posting comments on the way and saying Hello to your new friends), there are ongoing discussions on &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/scienceonline09" title=""&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; and new pictures on &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/scio09/" title=""&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Some examples: Crapstone, England; Ugley, Essex; East Breast, in western Scotland; North Piddle, in Worcestershire; Spanker Lane, in Derbyshire; Crotch Crescent, Oxford; Titty Ho, Northamptonshire; Wetwang, East Yorkshire; Slutshole Lane, Norfolk; Thong, Kent;  Pratts Bottom (Pratt there means “buffoon”), and Penistone (pronounced  ‘PENNIS-tun,’)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this one might be my favorite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(What is wrong with Corfe Close, you might ask? The guidelines mention the hypothetical residents of No. 4, with their unfortunate hypothetical address, “4 Corfe Close.” To find the naughty meaning, you have to repeat the first two words rapidly many times, preferably in the presence of your fifth-grade classmates.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took more the better part of a minute to get it but it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s Bryan Fischer of the &lt;a href="http://www.idahovaluesalliance.com/"&gt;Idaho Values Alliance&lt;/a&gt;’s complaint about the University of Idaho planning to launch co-ed dorm rooms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fischer says besides the risk of sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy, young women will be subject to an increased risk of date rape and other violent domestic crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As opposed to adults, who everyone knows have 100% immunity to sexually transmitted disease, pregnancy, date rape, and other violent domestic crimes. And as everyone knows, women are all weak and totally defenseless, in need of a strong man to protect them. What a jackass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010536f3e1b2970c-pi"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010536f3e1b2970c-pi" alt="" width="154" height="137"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/01/psychic-joe-power-wrong-about-shannon_matthews.html"&gt;“Psychic” Joe Power WRONG&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, English woman &lt;a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/67023/Mum-gets-8-years-jail-Shannon-gets-life-of-nightmares/"&gt;Karen Matthews was jailed for eight years&lt;/a&gt; for faking the abduction of her nine year old daughter Shannon.  Matthews had arranged for a relative to kidnap and hold the little girl prisoner, drugged and bound, so that later the relative could “find” the little girl and claim the £50,000 ($68,000) reward money they would both share.  What a scumbag.  And well deserved jail sentences for both of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s more to this story. This was another case where a “psychic” trying to find the missing girl and after the fact claiming their predictions were accurate when he wasn’t even capable of figuring out the most important factor in this case, that &lt;strong&gt;the child’s abductor was sitting right in front of him!&lt;/strong&gt; So the picture to the left of the psychic standing with the victim’s mother is doubly ironic. And the bad predictions just get worse and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AND NOW FOR A MOMENT OF SCIENCE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090121093339.htm"&gt;&lt;img title="scientist-use-in-case-of-emergency" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/scientist-use-in-case-of-emergency.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=166" alt="scientist-use-in-case-of-emergency" width="300" height="166"&gt;Infidelity Produces Faster Sperm&lt;/a&gt; - “Until now, it has been difficult to prove that fast-swimming sperm have an advantage when it comes to fertilizing an egg. But now a research team at Uppsala University can demonstrate that unfaithful females of the cichlid fish species influence the males’ sperm. Increased competition leads to both faster and larger sperm, and the research findings now being published in the scientific journal PNAS, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, thus show that the much mythologized size factor does indeed count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In promiscuous species we found that males produced larger and faster sperm than in closely related species that were monogamous,” says Sigal Balshine, associate professor in the department of Psychology, Neuroscience &amp;amp; Behaviour at McMaster University, and senior author on the study. “This research offers some of the first evidence that sperm has evolved to become more competitive in response to females mating with multiple males.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090122152711.htm"&gt;Females Extend Reproductive Life Of Male Mice&lt;/a&gt; - “Living with a female mouse can extend the reproductive life of a male mouse by as much as 20 percent, according to a study conducted by Ralph Brinster and a team of other researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. The study was reported online January 22 in the journal Biology of Reproduction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take that, &lt;a href="http://www.idahovaluesalliance.com/"&gt;Idaho Values Alliance&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090121123041.htm"&gt;Lizards Adapting To Escape Attacks By Fire Ants&lt;/a&gt; - “Penn State Assistant Professor of Biology Tracy Langkilde has shown that native fence lizards in the southeastern United States are adapting to potentially fatal invasive fire-ant attacks by developing behaviors that enable them to escape from the ants, as well as by developing longer hind legs, which can increase the effectiveness of this behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58e0123a1.htm"&gt;Centers for Disease Control has put out an alert&lt;/a&gt;: in Minnesota in 2008, there were five confirmed cases of Haemophilus influenzae type b (or Hib) among children younger than five years old. Of these five cases, three of the children were unvaccinated, one had started the series of vaccines but did not complete the series due to shortages, and the fifth — who had been fully vaccinated — had an immune deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five cases may not sound like a lot… until you learn that one of the unvaccinated children died. This was a baby, just a seven-month-old infant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what lesson can we draw from this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disclosure comes as Haggard, 52, is about to give a series of high-profile interviews to promote the cable documentary about his time in exile. He is scheduled to appear on CNN’s Larry King Live on Thursday, the date of the documentary’s premiere, and already has taped “The Oprah Winfrey Show.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and of course this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 10:30, we'll be having brunch at the Best Western Village Park Inn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 2:00, I'll be &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/calgary/events/voices_of_reason_lecture/"&gt;speaking at the University of Calgary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 6:00, come around to the &lt;a href="http://www.calgaryplus.ca/portal/profile.do?profileID=91273"&gt;Kilkenny Irish Pub&lt;/a&gt;. There are possibilities of haggis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound good? Sounds busy! See you tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great comment registration experiment is still in progress. I will switch it off on Wednesday to allow everyone to weigh in with their opinion. There are a few things I can experiment with on my end, too — we&amp;#39;re supposed to somehow be able to use OpenID instead of Typekey, for instance. Bear with it for a little longer, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/calgary.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-ut8lqmUL30" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232862918308"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1062">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e162b2083598ca6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">Nashville English Only amendment fails</title><published>2009-01-25T05:53:20Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T05:53:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1062" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Nashville English Only &lt;a href="http://www.nashville.gov/vote/plaintext/ballot_text_090122.htm"&gt;amendment&lt;/a&gt; whose chief proponent gave as justification for it the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1005"&gt;un-fact&lt;/a&gt; that some California state legislators do not speak English has been voted down by a &lt;a href="http://www.nashville.gov/vote/returns/090122.htm"&gt;substantial margin&lt;/a&gt;, 41,752 to 32,144.

&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, I had tough choices to make - which session to go to out of four in each time slot! Of course, I spent a year planning, and talking with moderators/panelists/presenters and building each session over time. Now I wanted to see them all.  How could I afford to miss any one of them?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But choices had to be made, and I knew I could rely on the blogosphere to write about other sessions so I could get the idea of how the other stuff went. The &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Blog_and_Media_Coverage/" title=""&gt;blog/media coverage linkfest&lt;/a&gt; is growing fast (perhaps start at the bottom and work your way up, posting comments on the way and saying Hello to your new friends), there are ongoing discussions on &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/scienceonline09" title=""&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; and new pictures on &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/scio09/" title=""&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you were there, please fill up this short &lt;a href="http://mistersugar.wufoo.com/forms/scienceonline09-feedback/" title=""&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; to give us feedback, so we can make next year's meeting even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first thing in the morning, I went to &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Blog-To-Book/" title=""&gt;You are a science blogger but you want to publish a pop-sci book? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, moderated by &lt;a href="http://inversesquare.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Tom Levenson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/" title=""&gt;Dave Munger&lt;/a&gt;. Am I thinking about writing a book?  No, and this session re-affirmed that decision.  I can edit books.  I can throw blooks up on Lulu.com.  I may even get a collection of essays put together one day. But book-length exposition is not my forte - I do not have the patience and discipline for it.  Blogs are just a perfect medium for me - jumping in when the inspiration hits and not worrying when it doesn't. But for those who are interested in writing a book, this session was chockful of good information, from how to pitch a proposal, to how to make yourself disciplined, to how to actually organize your thoughts for such an endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

The book is currently #13 on the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/books/review/InsideList-t.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=review"&gt;New York Times best-seller list&lt;/a&gt;. Today's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/books/review/InsideList-t.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=review"&gt;TBR-Inside the List&lt;/a&gt; column quotes Grandin saying that "cats seem autistic" (a point made in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Cats-Have-Asperger-Syndrome/dp/1843104814"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;) and includes a quote that bears repeating here, with a nod to our friends over at &lt;a href="http://animalsrights.change.org"&gt;Animal Rights&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the animal rights movement, Grandin — who has drawn on her insights as an autistic person to design chutes that keep cattle calm before slaughter and developed a monitoring system for McDonald’s — writes: “I think people in general are becoming abstractified. You always hear about autistic children ‘living in their own little world,’ but these days it’s normal people who are living in their own little world of words and politics. Things have changed. People who wanted to help animals used to study animal behavior. Today they go to law school.” Not that she’s down on all activism. “The big companies are like steel, and activists are like heat. Activists soften the steel, and then I can bend it into pretty grillwork and make reforms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes----walking down Kennedy Boulevard to meet Jim at the &lt;a href="http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/path/html/"&gt;PATH train&lt;/a&gt; in Jersey City last night, every other person (certainly if they were a teenager) was oblivious to police sirens, car alarms going off, and horn-honking thanks to whatever tunes were streaming into their ears via their MPG devices or whatever text message they were composing or reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie, on the other hand, could not have been more "in the world": We hadn't made the walk down Kennedy Boulevard since our &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_transition"&gt;trip to California&lt;/a&gt; and it was just fun to hurry past Bellaluna pizza and the travel agency, closed behind the metal grillwork, and the deli with 50 cent cans of soda and hookah pipes, and the Joyce Leslie store which was having a supersale ($3, $6, $9!). Charlie stopped at every intersection and waited for the light to change and when a bunch of teenagers in North Face jackets imitated his humming and laughed, I turned around and said, quietly and firmly, "he has autism." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ok," said one young man, and kept walking, quietly now, in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if I'm able to turn steel into "pretty grillwork and make reforms," as Grandin says she does, but if I can "soften the steel" a little---that would be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

I voted for the guy and to a large extent I’m already sick of hearing about him. More specifically, I’m tired of hearing about his race.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for the black community, but I think we’re doing them a disservice. We were already naming roads, schools, and bridges after the man, and he hadn’t even taken office yet. There was some hope that his election would be a turning point in our nation’s racist history, but I don’t think it has been. Racism isn’t over when we elect a black President. That comes when we elect a black President and his race isn’t mentioned in every paragraph about him. It’s when we name airports after him not because of his skin color, but because he did a great job of serving our country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I have to say, I’m feeling hopeful. I read this very thorough article in &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12931660&amp;amp;fsrc=nwlgafree&amp;amp;source=most_commented"&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt; about the Bush Presidency, which details “a presidency knocked sideways by the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001″ and explains how incompetence, nepotism, anti-intellectualism, and misplaced loyalty led to what may be the worst Presidency in the history of our nation. Then a couple hours later, I was reading about &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/us/politics/22obama.html?ref=us"&gt;Obama’s executive orders&lt;/a&gt; banning torture, extending habeas corpus to the detainees in Cuba, and closing secret prisons. Makes you proud to be an American again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232861184013"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=1925">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8ab51fd35a0f2f4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Conspiracy Theories"/><category term="Holocaust Denial"/><category term="religion"/><category term="9/11 Truth"/><category term="Catholicism"/><category term="Holocaust"/><category term="Pope"/><category term="Richard Williamson"/><category term="SSPX"/><title type="html">Pope Joey Ratz’ new best friend</title><published>2009-01-25T05:24:43Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T05:24:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/24/pope-joey-ratz-new-best-friend/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/24/pope-joey-ratz-new-best-friend/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/qWrDjysLlHM/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Aired in late November, 2008, the presentation "The Toughest Call" emphasized common "alternative" approaches to adoption issues, rather than  citing excellent empirical research from investigators such as Sir Michael Rutter. "The Toughest Call" (Nov. 28, 2008, Parts 1-5; &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020"&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)  encouraged the public to accept myths about adoption, including the idea that adopted children have many unpredictable mental health risks. The program suggested that the children they discussed were cases of Reactive Attachment Disorder, a legitimate diagnosis-- but in fact the symptoms described were not those conventionally considered for diagnosis of this disorder, but another, more frightening set of behaviors advertised by the cult-like "Attachment Therapy" community.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232850084417"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/01/24/barack-obama-vs-genetic-determinism/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e1b93ef84f0572d8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humanity"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Barack Obama vs. Genetic Determinism</title><published>2009-01-25T01:35:54Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T01:35:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/01/24/barack-obama-vs-genetic-determinism/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My theory is that Barack Obama, among his various superpowers, has the ability to reach out to groups of people across the world and subtly re-arrange their DNA.  How else are we to explain &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/education/23gap.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the study made public on Thursday, Dr. Friedman and his colleagues compiled a brief test, drawing 20 questions from the verbal sections of the Graduate Record Exam, and administering it four times to about 120 white and black test-takers during last year’s presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    In total, 472 Americans — 84 blacks and 388 whites — took the exam. Both white and black test-takers ranged in age from 18 to 63, and their educational attainment ranged from high school dropout to Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    On the initial test last summer, whites on average correctly answered about 12 of 20 questions, compared with about 8.5 correct answers for blacks, Dr. Friedman said. But on the tests administered immediately after Mr. Obama’s nomination acceptance speech, and just after his election victory, black performance improved, rendering the white-black gap “statistically nonsignificant,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study hasn’t yet been published (or accepted), and doesn’t seem to be online; here is the &lt;a href="http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/548294/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via &lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/?p=16170"&gt;DougJ at Balloon Juice&lt;/a&gt;, who says everything that needs to be said.  Including that this is no surprise at all, at least to people who recognize the phrase “&lt;a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/58/women-cant-do-mathor-can-they"&gt;stereotype threat&lt;/a&gt;.”  Studies have shown that simply &lt;em&gt;reminding&lt;/em&gt; women or minorities that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; women or minorities causes them to do statistically worse on tests involving subjects that they are, stereotypically, supposed to be bad at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is almost tempted to conclude that scores on standardized tests might be influenced by factors other than one’s genetic background.  Who could have guessed?&lt;/p&gt;

Nintendo, long the face of family-friendly gaming, were said to be aghast and promised to immediately discontinue their wildly popular Wii system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, so only one part of the above is true. A &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-01/byu-vgl012009.php"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University"&gt;Brigham Young University&lt;/a&gt; revealed that undergraduate Alex Jensen and his tutor had questioned 813 college students on their gaming habits and other behaviours, concluding that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;	&lt;li&gt;"As the amount of time playing video games went up, the quality of relationships with peers and parents went down."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"That the more young adults play video games, the more frequent their involvement in risky behaviors like drinking and drug abuse"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"For young women, self-worth was low if their video game time was high."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is of particular concern to young Alex, as according to the press release: "Jensen had hoped to find some positive results as justification for playing Madden NFL.". Ho ho, Jensen you little scallywag, trying to use science to justify your Madden NFL vice. That'll teach you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fairness to the authors, there is a frank admission that the correlation is 'modest' (a euphemism for 'weak'). Most importantly, there's no hint that these findings are anything but a correlation (a quick email to the university press officer confirmed this).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Correlation is a word you'll hear a lot if you hang around scientists and skeptics, so it's worth taking a moment to discuss. Scientists look for relationships between different things: taking a particular medicine and how quickly the patient recovers, the shape of an aircraft wing and its fuel consumption, religious persuasion and mental instability. However, often two things look like they are related when in fact they're not. Ginger-haired people are more common in Scotland, but that doesn't mean moving to Edinburgh will turn your hair red. So living in Scotland and having red hair is an example of a correlation. It's always important to demonstrate whether the relationship between two things is causative, or simply a correlation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The insinuation in BYU's press release is that playing video games increases the likelihood of your relationship with friend and family breaking down, makes you a pot smoker and (for the ladies) decreases self-esteem. But it's pretty obvious that people who choose to stay in and maintain a small number of relationships are going to need something to do with all that extra time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, British readers might be forgiven for wondering why a university would publish such a weak study with nothing more than correlational findings to the major news outlets. The answer to that could be that &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University"&gt;Brigham Young University&lt;/a&gt; is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and is the largest religious university in the United States. BYU students are required to adhere to strict codes of conduct prohibiting extra-marital sex, alcohol, tea, coffee and porn, homosexual behaviour, wearing a beard without permission, swearing, and more, and if you think I'm making this up then &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University_Honor_Code#Standards"&gt;read it for yourself&lt;/a&gt;. So these 'findings' fit neatly into an ideology that encourages a 'chaste and virtuous life.' Personally I think &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)"&gt;saving humanity by annihilating thousands of hell-spawned demons&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty virtuous pursuit, but perhaps I'm in the minority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Video games already get a bad rap, and this guilt-by-association is particularly tedious. Fawning over findings that fit your own pre-existing ideological beliefs, despite their weakness or even falsity, is a dangerous game. So-called &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_science"&gt;pathological science&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for some of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_experiment"&gt;most upsetting&lt;/a&gt; episodes of science in history. The worst part of incomplete arguments such as this one from BYU is that it obfuscates the true causes behind human behaviours such as drug use. And when the resulting misconceptions find their way into government policy, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_war"&gt;the results are often disastrous&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there are still &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pseudosciences_and_pseudoscientific_concepts"&gt;plenty of people out there&lt;/a&gt; trying to force square scientific pegs into round ideological holes. My question to BYU is: why? I get it that you don't like drugs and tobacco and smoking, and to be honest I couldn't care less. But releasing half-baked 'science' to support your case is embarrassing. Morality isn't something measured in SI units, so why argue from evidence?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/01/mormon_scientists_video_games.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk beta</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232847436951"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/01/hello_scienceblogs.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/194c186e81ca6d98</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Hello, ScienceBlogs</title><published>2009-01-16T09:42:19Z</published><updated>2009-01-16T09:42:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/01/hello_scienceblogs.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="scipunk logo 100.png" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/images/scipunk%20logo%20100.png" width="100" height="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As some sharp-eyed reader may have already spotted, the SciencePunk blog has relocated to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://seedmediagroup.com/"&gt;Seed Media Group&lt;/a&gt;'s ScienceBlogs. Let's take a moment to absorb these new surroundings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, done? Those of you who have already run back to check &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sciencepunk.com"&gt;sciencepunk.com&lt;/a&gt; will find it too has changed substantially. Drama abounds! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From today, the whole SciencePunk caboodle is getting cranked up a notch. Wave goodbye to the version 5 we all knew and loved, and say hello to version 6. (Ah, you always wondered what that stray /v5 signified, didn't you? Why not check out &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v4"&gt;v4&lt;/a&gt;? Web 1.0-tastic!) The site has now been diversified and distributed, so that the blogging section will now come exclusively via ScienceBlogs. Back at SciencePunk central you'll find this blog on feed, a new mini-feed of links I've found interesting but have no time to write about, separate sections for longer articles, videos, and possibly a non-science blog to vent all the wonderful and disturbing things that thrash about like angry eels in my head. Although the invitation to start blogging from the Seed servers was a pleasant surprise, the SciencePunk upgrade has been on the books for a long while. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you've already signed up to the SciencePunk.com rss feed, then by the miracle of .htaccess code you should receive updates of all new material, both on SciencePunk.com and ScienceBlogs. If not you can sign up &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=fKlwSynj3RGeI1v_PhJ3AQ&amp;amp;_render=rss"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kudos to Arikia at ScienceBlogs for humouring my many questions and demands with grace and expedience. If anything isn't working as it should be, please don't hesitate to tell me. Abusive comments will be tolerated so long as they're funny. Regular blogging will commence once everything is running smoothly, and by golly there's a lot to write about...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/01/hello_scienceblogs.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk beta</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232846110319"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1059">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d0f09c27b04cec6e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Taboo vocabulary"/><title type="html">Taboo toponymy</title><published>2009-01-25T01:13:25Z</published><updated>2009-01-25T01:13:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1059" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the 23rd, the New York Times ran a "fun Friday" &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/world/europe/23crapstone.html"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on British place names that are arguably offensive: Sarah Lyall, &amp;quot;No Snickering: That Road Sign Means Something Else&amp;quot;. With photos of signs for Butt Hole Road (South Yorkshire), Pratts Bottom (Kent), and Penistone (South Yorkshire again — no, it&amp;#39;s not pronounced the way you think), and mentions of a number of others. The story was filed from the village of Crapstone, in Devon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The height of silliness was reached in a reported directive from the Lewes District Council (East Sussex) against new "street names which could give offense", including Corfe Close. Lyall writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(What is wrong with Corfe Close, you might ask? The guidelines mention the hypothetical residents of No. 4, with their unfortunate hypothetical address, "4 Corfe Close." To find the naughty meaning, you have to repeat the first two words rapidly many times, preferably in the presence of your fifth-grade classmates.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably helps to do this in a non-rhotic accent. Even so, the story sounds contrived. (Surely there are some Corfu Roads, Streets, Lanes, etc. in the U.K.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, people who collect such undignified names. Like Ed Hurst and Rob Bailey, authors of &lt;em&gt;Rude Britain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rude UK&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;which list arguably offensive places names — some so arguably offensive that, unfortunately, they cannot be printed here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, just when you were experiencing a moment of delight at seeing &lt;em&gt;butt hole&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;titty&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;crap&lt;/em&gt; on the pages of the famously prudish &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, you discover that the paper will Go Only So Far, and draws the veil over stuff coarser than this — while ostentatiously drawing attention to its tough line on taboo vocabulary. It just makes you want to check out the Hurst/Bailey books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No mention, of course, of the great Scunthorpe scandal, which we've alluded to only in passing on Language Log, &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003427.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Thanks to Ben Zimmer for reminding me of the phenomenon.) This was an episode in the annals of automated searching. Automated searching works either on whole words or (much more dangerously) on substrings, and its consequences are either to replace putatively offensive material by an inoffensive substitute (some more neutral item, like &lt;em&gt;butt&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;ass&lt;/em&gt;, or a taboo-avoidance substitute, like &lt;em&gt;a*s&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;***&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;(bleep)&lt;/em&gt;) or to filter out the message containing the putatively offensive material. So it was, according to the story &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_Problem"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, that in 1996 AOL subscribers in the town of Scunthorpe (North Lincolnshire) were blocked for a while from web access, because of the &lt;em&gt;cunt&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Scunthorpe&lt;/em&gt;. (Many people have found the name Scunthorpe risible on independent grounds.) Some other entertaining substring-search examples up through 2007 can be found &lt;a href="http://viv.id.au/blog/?p=1205"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and note this plangent comment from a reader of Michael Quinion's &lt;em&gt;World Wide Words&lt;/em&gt;, in issue #606 of 9/27/08: &amp;quot;I work at Nipissing University [in Canada].

&lt;p&gt;This story is so sad, and what makes it worse is that it was preventable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58e0123a1.htm"&gt;Centers for Disease Control has put out an alert&lt;/a&gt;: in Minnesota in 2008, there were five confirmed cases of Haemophilus influenzae type b (or Hib) among children younger than five years old. Of these five cases, three of the children were unvaccinated, one had started the series of vaccines but did not complete the series due to shortages, and the fifth — who had been fully vaccinated — had an immune deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five cases may not sound like a lot… until you learn that one of the unvaccinated children died. This was a baby, just a seven-month-old infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can barely type that sentence out; my heart is aching so. I can only imagine what the parents are feeling. I literally have nightmares about such things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several things to note about this incidence of Hib: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) It’s the largest number of cases in one year since 1992 in Minnesota, &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58e0123a1.htm#fig1"&gt;when 10 cases were reported&lt;/a&gt;. In the intervening years, between 0 and 4 cases were reported per year (1994 saw four cases, the average is about 2). These are small number statistics, so 5 cases may just be a normal statistical fluctuation. But the stakes are very, very high here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) We do not know why three of the five children were unvaccinated. It may be due to the antivax crowd, or it may be due to any number of other factors; the report doesn’t say (however, see (5) below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Out of three unvaccinated children, &lt;em&gt;one died&lt;/em&gt;. The historical rate of death from Hib, once infected, is about 1 in 20, so this is something of a fluke. But 1 in 20 is still way, way too high… and of the ones who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; survive the infection, 1 in 5 will suffer deafness, blindness, or severe, permanent brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian roulette has better odds than 1 in 5; do you want to play that with your baby? If that sounds harsh, &lt;strong&gt;good.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;We’re dealing with babies’ lives here.&lt;/em&gt; The best thing you can do is make sure they don’t get the disease in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Getting a vaccine does not guarantee &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; getting the disease. We don’t know how many babies were vaccinated, and how many weren’t that didn’t get the disease. But with 1 in 20 odds, I know which way I fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) There is a shortage of Hib vaccines right now, and it’s expected to last for a few more months. However, according to the CDC report, there are adequate supplies to have infants inoculated and complete the primary three-dose infant series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were reviewed for 25,699 children born between November 1, 2007 and March 31, 2008… Among children aged 7 months, 3-dose primary Hib series coverage was 46.5%, which is lower than the age-appropriate coverage for children who had received pneumococcal conjugate or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccination. In contrast, data from the 2007 National Immunization Survey, conducted prior to the shortage, showed that Hib vaccination coverage among children in Minnesota aged 19 months to 35 months was high and did not differ from the national average, suggesting that coverage has declined as a result of the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there has been a decline in coverage due to the shortage, with roughly half the children in the survey being vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting this all together is difficult, with so many unknowns. But to belabor the obvious, we do know one thing: of the three unvaccinated children who got Hib, one died. The doctors from the CDC add this editorial comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before development of Hib conjugate vaccines, Hib was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children aged &amp;lt;5 years. Since implementation of the Hib conjugate vaccine immunization program in the United States in the early 1990s, the incidence of Hib disease has declined from a peak of 41 cases per 100,000 children aged &amp;lt;5 years in 1987 to approximately 0.11 cases per 100,000 in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;the infection rate among infants dropped by a factor of nearly &lt;strong&gt;400&lt;/strong&gt; after the Hib vaccination was developed.&lt;/em&gt; This recent increase may reflect a loss of herd immunity, meaning &lt;strong&gt;too many kids are not getting vaccinated&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks. Please. Vaccinate your children. The science is in, the tests have been done, the results are solid: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/08/22/antivaxxers-must-be-stopped-now/"&gt;vaccinations do not cause autism&lt;/a&gt;. What vaccines do is save the lives of thousands of children who would otherwise be suffering the effects of preventable diseases… and one of these effects can be death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save your kids’ lives. Take them to a doctor and get his or her advice on this. And if they recommend vaccinations, &lt;em&gt;then do it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I am pleased to report that the Kentucky Court of Appeals has &lt;a href="http://www.eff.org/files/kentuckyorder.pdf"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that domain names are not gambling devices and on this basis has issued an order of prohibition barring the trial court from enforcing its seizure order. The majority held that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…it stretches credulity to conclude that a series of numbers, or Internet address, can be said to constitute a &amp;quot;machine or any mechanical or other device…[sic] designed and manufactured primarily for use in connection with gambling.&amp;quot; We are thus convinced that the trial court clearly erred in concluding that the domain names can be construed to be gambling devices subject to forfeiture under KRS 528.100.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In his dissent, Judge Caperton argues as follows. First, that the user's home computer together with the gambling site's computer form a compound device; Second, that the IP address of the gambling site is a necessary part of this compound device, and therefore that the domain name is itself a device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that this argument fails for three reasons. First, it conflates domain names with IP addresses. An IP address is indeed necessary to connect to a computer, but a domain name is not. A domain name is an alias for an IP address, one that is useful because it is likely to be easier for human beings to remember, but quite unnecessary.  If you know the IP address of a computer, you can connect to it without knowing its domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem is that what the argument establishes, if anything, is that domain names are part of a device. Judge Caperton jumps from that proposition to the conclusion that domain names are themselves devices without argument.  This is not a valid syllogism. It is possible for something to be part of a device without itself being a device, assuming that "device" has its usual meaning of "machine designed for a purpose". A piece of sheet metal, for example, is a component of a computer case, but it is not itself a device as it is not a machine and is not designed for any particular purpose. Here, however, we encounter a potential problem, namely that Black's Law Dictionary, which Judge Caperton cites, defines "device" as "an apparatus or article of manufacture". This definition is much broader than the usual definition: a piece of cloth and a bar of soap are both articles of manufacture but we do not consider them to be "devices". If one accepts Black's definition, our piece of sheet metal is indeed a device since it is an article of manufacture. Even by Black's definition, however, I submit that a domain name is not a device because, though it may be manufactured (that is, created by human beings), it is not an article of manufacture since, by virtue of being immaterial, it is not an "article".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is necessary for the State of Kentucky to establish not merely that domain names are devices but that they are "gambling devices", that is, devices whose primary intended function is gambling. Here the argument from whole to part founders, since a component of a device designed for a particular purpose is not, in general, itself a device designed for that same purpose. A computer is a device designed for computing, but the capacitors in its power supply are not therefore computing devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore find Judge Caperton's defense of the State of Kentucky's claim flawed for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it improperly conflates IP addresses, which are necessary, with domain names, which are not;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it relies upon the inference from "X is a component of a device" to "X is a device", which is false under the usual definition of "device";&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it relies upon a false inference from "X is a component of a gambling device" to "X is a gambling device";&lt;/li&gt;

for faking the abduction of her nine year old daughter Shannon.  Matthews had arranged for a relative to kidnap and hold the little girl prisoner, drugged and bound, so that later the relative could “find” the little girl and claim the £50,000 ($68,000) reward money they would both share.  What a scumbag.  And well deserved jail sentences for both of them.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010536ea4d73970b-pi"&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="Joe Power" border="0" height="137" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010536f3e1b2970c-pi" style="border:0px none;margin:7px;display:inline" title="Joe Power" width="154"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But she wasn’t the only scumbag involved in this case.  Enter so called &lt;a href="http://www.skepticreport.com/psychicpowers/joepower.htm"&gt;psychic Joe Power&lt;/a&gt; (pictured right, with the mother), who gave a psychic reading to the mother and who now is claiming accuracy in his psychic predictions.  The  &lt;a href="http://paranormalreview.co.uk/News/tabid/59/newsid368/133/Psychic-predicted-missing-Shannon-was-alive/Default.aspx"&gt;Paranormal Review&lt;/a&gt; is typical of the credulous reporting:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;When psychic Joe Power gave a reading to the mother and stepfather of English schoolgirl Shannon Matthews, he made three statements that have since proved to be accurate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before I start to deconstruct in detail these so-called predictions, I should point out that the “psychic” missed what was without doubt the most important factor in this case, namely that &lt;strong&gt;the child’s abductor was sitting right in front of him!&lt;/strong&gt;  How anyone can report that this psychic was accurate or that he helped the police in any way, when he apparently couldn’t tell that the criminal responsible was sitting right opposite him, just beggars belief.  In my view that should be enough for any rational person to ignore anything else this bozo has to say, ever, but apparently it’s not.  In fact, Power is actually using this case as evidence that his psychic readings are genuine and that the police should consult him in future cases.  Seriously.  Here’s what he is now saying he got right:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporting the safe return of Shannon, The People (16 March) said he came up with vital clues “which could have led to her discovery”. It confirmed he had told the newspaper:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shannon knew her abductor, who was a relative possibly named Michael or Paul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She had sat on this man’s knee at a family funeral.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are mostly generic playing the odds guesses.  She “knew her abductor” is a reasonable statistical possibility.  Even the names Michael or Paul are not that impressive – fairly common names.  But from this report, we know that Power didn’t just give these names, he got them using a standard cold reading technique – ie &lt;strong&gt;he asked questions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I said to Karen, ‘Do you know a Mick or Michael?’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paging &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2007/11/john-edward-jam.html"&gt;John Edward&lt;/a&gt; to the house courtesy phone - an “M” name wants to talk to you.  Of course, we don’t know how many other names Power guessed that were wrong.  Or even if he really said “Mick or Michael”, or if he just guessed a series of letters and the mother or the stepfather jumped in to supply the missing name. Without this information the “Mick or Michael” would be useless even if these weren’t common names.  In any case, we know this is just standard cold reading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next bit is my favorite.  Or alternatively the sleaziest bit of rewriting history.  You decide.  It’s this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;An area named Batley is involved in her disappearance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The child was eventually found in a flat in the town of Batley, and so this would look like a hit.  The Batley connection was reported in numerous places, for example read this, dated March 16, 2008 - &lt;a href="http://www.people.co.uk/news/tm_headline=i-asked-if-they-knew-a-man-named-michael&amp;amp;method=full&amp;amp;objectid=20353179&amp;amp;siteid=93463-name_page.html"&gt;after the child was found&lt;/a&gt;.  However, if you check reports such as this one dated March 9, 2008 – ie &lt;a href="http://www.people.co.uk/news/news/tm_method=full&amp;amp;objectID=20345579&amp;amp;siteID=93463-name_page.html"&gt;before the child was found&lt;/a&gt;, the story is less impressive:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Joe Power] later identified the region as the &lt;strong&gt;Ossett and Batley area&lt;/strong&gt; in West Yorks. &amp;quot;Shannon was taken there,&amp;quot; he added.  [My bold.]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the map below (from Google maps) of the area.  The family is reported to be from Dewsbury.  I have marked Dewsbury on the map as well as both Ossett and Batley.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010536ea4d7d970b-pi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010536ea5087970b-pi" style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dewsbury, West Yorks, england - Google Maps_1232820691117 Towns Marked" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010536ea5087970b-800wi" title="Dewsbury, West Yorks, england - Google Maps_1232820691117 Towns Marked"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clearly “the Ossett and Batley area” would include most of this section of map – approximately 3 to 4 miles square.  So guessing this area is not especially impressive, and certainly of no use to the police (as Power claimed it would have been) who were already searching this area anyway.  But apart from the obvious guessing the nearest towns gambit, notice how the “Ossett and Batley area” guess before the child was found, became “Batley” &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the child was found in Batley.  Nice.  And if she had been found in Ossett, it would presumably have become &amp;quot;Ossett.&amp;quot;  Anywhere else on the map, and it would still have been a hit.  But I&amp;#39;m sure Power didn&amp;#39;t have access to Google so he must have obtained this information psychically.  How else could he have done it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were numerous other guesses that Power wants you to forget about too.  For example, this lot:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joe Power claimed the spirit world told him that the girl got into a car near her school. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And he told Karen, 32: &amp;quot;The car had a baby seat and a brown cushion in the back, and a religious card hanging from the rear-view mirror.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said it stopped near a church Shannon knew - and the driver used a Texaco garage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Power, who has appeared on Living TV&amp;#39;s Psychic Investigators and worked with police on the Sally Anne Bowman murder case, told Karen: &amp;quot;I can see a lay-by near farmland.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;None of which was true, as far as I can tell.  (Or is completely unverifiable anyway – eg “the driver used a Texaco garage.”)  The abductor’s car is described as a “silver Peugeot” – no mention of a baby seat, which would have been unlikely for this man who lived alone with no children.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;The Actuality&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;What we have here is a so called psychic sleazing his way into this unfortunate situation, applying his well honed cold reading techniques to an unsophisticated family, and making the usual vague guesses that can later be finessed and honed to agree with the actual circumstances.  Vague “Ossett and Batley area” guesses become “Batley.”  Wrong guesses are discarded, and are forgotten by the credulous media.  Apparently no one cares the psychic missed the mother as the perp.  The psychic uses the free publicity provided by a gullible press to further his own dishonest career.  And we know this isn’t the first time that Joe Power has used free publicity in this way.  He claimed to have contacted John Lennon&amp;#39;s dead spirit.  He claimed to have helped solve the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticreport.com/psychicpowers/joepower.htm"&gt;Lynsey Quy Murder&lt;/a&gt; case, although clearly he did no such thing, as the police Detective Superintendent involved in the case made clear:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish to state, categorically, that as the Senior Investigating Officer on the Lyndsey Quy murder, I made a policy decision not to use psychics on the investigation. Joe Power has allegedly made claims that he assisted the enquiry but this is not the case.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that the little girl was found not from psychic impressions or profiles, but as a result of &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article3556543.ece"&gt;routine police work&lt;/a&gt; – a neighbor told police that a child’s footsteps had been heard in the flat of Shannon&amp;#39;s captor, a man who lived alone with no children.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll say again, Joe Power had no idea the child&amp;#39;s mother, to whom he gave a reading, was also the child&amp;#39;s abductor.  He had no idea. Joe Power is not psychic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232838853154"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/cute_but_grossly_inaccurate.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/65bd9159dc0cc01b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Cute, but grossly inaccurate</title><published>2009-01-24T22:39:27Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T22:39:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/oncfm_khC0g/cute_but_grossly_inaccurate.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/cute_but_grossly_inaccurate.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gocomics.com/features/202/feature_items/407054"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/01/evolve.jpeg" width="400" height="338" alt="evolve.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, man, this gets so much wrong. Sentient life did not evolve 600 million years ago; that was roughly the time that true multicellularity arose. Unless you consider something spongelike to be sentient, it doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligent life did not first evolve 2.5 million years ago. Animal intelligence is something that has to be measured on a continuum. Molluscs are intelligent. It's just not the same kind or degree of intelligence that tool-using humans have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligent life hasn't evolved in Texas yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/cute_but_grossly_inaccurate.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/oncfm_khC0g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232838799363"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1060">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5b121bba17ae8760</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Administration"/><title type="html">Administrative note</title><published>2009-01-24T23:10:57Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T23:10:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1060" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the Comments Policy page here at Language Log:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#39;ve been enforcing this policy, but it&amp;#39;s way too time-consuming, so more of this untraceable stuff is getting through. The point is that the bloggers should be able to verify (if they wish) that commenters are who they say they are and to communicate with commenters on occasion. I resent the idea that Language Log should not only be expected to provide blogging space to everyone who wants to write — if you enable comments, then the space belongs to the commenters, not to you, as any number of people have explained to me now, contemptuously — but should also allow commenters to conceal their identity, even from the bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232836235047"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/americas_most_wired_cities_may.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/02591cb0887bf9ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">America's Most Wired Cities may be the small ones, under the radar</title><published>2009-01-24T20:27:31Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T20:27:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/m-xiMYIwHr4/americas_most_wired_cities_may.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/americas_most_wired_cities_may.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is one paragraph in &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/22/wired-cities-2009-tech-wire-cx_ew_0122wiredcities.html" title=""&gt;this Forbes article&lt;/a&gt; about America's Most Wired Cities that I really did not like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;North Carolina suffered the biggest drop, with Raleigh declining to No. 15 from No. 3 and Charlotte dropping to No. 20 from No. 7.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is really bad news and we need to do something about it. And while the list only looks at big cities, getting wired is much easier to implement in smaller places, for instance, we can do it &lt;a href="http://www.carrborocitizen.com/main/2009/01/15/high-speed-internet-must-be-a-part-of-carrboro%E2%80%99s-infrastructure/" title=""&gt;in Carrboro&lt;/a&gt; if we work on it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, with the example of small places to look at (and perhaps shamed by them), the big cities will follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/americas_most_wired_cities_may.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/m-xiMYIwHr4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232832563107"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/01/sf_chron_ignore_the_anti-abort.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dbb75ac53a6324c1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Wasting your time"/><title type="html">SF Chron: Ignore the Anti-Abortion Protestors</title><published>2009-01-24T19:56:49Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T19:56:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/jLgFRS_ylYI/sf_chron_ignore_the_anti-abort.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/01/sf_chron_ignore_the_anti-abort.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In good Denialism blog form, the San Francisco Chronicle's C. W. Nevius &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/24/BAKO15G3L8.DTL&amp;amp;tsp=1"&gt;has urged&lt;/a&gt; readers to just ignore this week's anti-abortion protest in San Francisco.  He makes a good point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the fifth year in San Francisco for the "Walk for Life." Bolstered by supporters who are bused in from all over - this year's bus schedule lists departures from Yuba City, Bakersfield, Fresno, Reno, Clovis and Chico, among other cities - the anti-abortion group stages a march in liberal San Francisco and then expresses shock and disappointment when they are jeered and booed.

&lt;p&gt;It's a scam and a setup. Nothing gets media attention like two groups facing off against each other. And, frankly, on the 36th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the anti-abortion groups are becoming a tired story. They claim huge numbers for this walk - their estimate last year was 25,000 walkers, although The Chronicle story had the total at 10,000 - but there isn't much of a news hook unless there's some controversy. They'd probably get more people if they marched in Indiana, but in San Francisco they can garner much more publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen!  Stay inside on this Bay Area rainy day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blog note: I apologize for the sparse blogging on Denialism Blog.  The semester has just started for me, and I am teaching a new course that is taking a huge amount of time.  MarkH is flying around the country interviewing.  This week he was in San Francisco, where instead of blogging, we ate at Chapeau and the Slanted Door, and went to the gun show.  Yes, the gun show.  It was hilarious.  We bought beef jerky there, considered getting a crossbow to shoot some Ligers, and stocked up on dental tools and compasses for survival post apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/01/sf_chron_ignore_the_anti-abort.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/jLgFRS_ylYI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232832424372"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/not_surprising_at_all.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/190580113fd2ef0e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">Not surprising at all</title><published>2009-01-24T20:50:05Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T20:50:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/k5aiN4pOXgM/not_surprising_at_all.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/not_surprising_at_all.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ted Haggard is in the news again — it seems he has been &lt;a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20090124/REL.Haggard.New.allegations/"&gt;involved in long term homosexual relationships, and has been abusing his power for sexual favors&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Yes! Now if only he could understand that &lt;i&gt;everyone's&lt;/i&gt; sexuality is complicated and difficult and personal, and that the real problem is people like him and his fellow evangelicals who insist that there is only one tolerable, one-size-fits-all box for us all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/not_surprising_at_all.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/k5aiN4pOXgM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232832424372"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/on_the_road_to_calgary.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2339fff4a3ee7262</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Administrative"/><title type="html">On the road to Calgary</title><published>2009-01-24T20:32:16Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T20:32:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/9At-YARi7S0/on_the_road_to_calgary.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/on_the_road_to_calgary.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a long traveling weekend for me — I&amp;#39;m on my way to Calgary/Edmonton for a lecture and a debate. That means my internet access may be a little spotty, and I&amp;#39;m a little concerned about some of the trends in the comments, so I&amp;#39;m laying down a few rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are too many trolls. I&amp;#39;m shutting off anonymous commenting for at least a little while — it won&amp;#39;t make them go away, but it will make it much easier for me to clean up their stinky little droppings afterwards. If it suddenly makes it impossible for you regulars to comment, let me know by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I may turn anonymous commenting back on when I get back, or I may leave it in place. Consider this an experiment. Aw, heck…I&amp;#39;ll definitely restore it for at least a few days when I&amp;#39;m back so everyone can discuss whether they hate it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another of those interminable back-and-forth threads where people insult others with slang terms for female genitalia, and others point out that that is demeaning to women, has begun again. I hate those. I am not about to start policing language here (I hate that, too), but I will point out that if you think it's disparagement to compare someone to any of the delightful features found in the sublime wonderland of a lady's garden of Venus, you are a sloppy anus with a faulty sphincter and a putrefying colon. So there. You can go ahead and use any slang terms for genitals that you desire, but henceforth they will all be regarded as expressions of endearment, love, and lust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that we've got quite a few readers here who feel a passionate desire for Ann Coulter. She should be flattered. You should be embarrassed that you are communicating your true feelings so poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments are getting a little too gratuitously snarly. I&amp;#39;m not going to censor your general cussedness, but think a bit — spitting out a swear word doesn&amp;#39;t make you witty. At least make an effort to be &lt;i&gt;creatively&lt;/i&gt; profane. I have high expectations for commenters here: you can be rude, I even encourage it, but force yourself to use your brain to a higher degree than is demanded by knee-jerk strings of expletives. Remember, I do have a rule about boring me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

She was talking about helping her son to seize strategic social opportunities (such as sitting near the cake at a birthday party) so he will be successful socially.  I completely understand the impulse to try to prevent your child going through the pains of being a social outcast, but at the same time, even though it completely sucked when it was happening, I value my outcast experience very highly.  I don’t think my life would be nearly as interesting if I hadn’t come through what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think about this?  Do you or will you try to steer you children socially?  Is the suffering worth the outcome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Kammy for inspiring this one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232828570897"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/obamas_stimulus_plan_a_down_payment_for_the_future">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b0fda7557eb87fe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Obama's Stimulus Plan: A "Down Payment" for the Future?</title><published>2009-01-24T22:40:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T22:40:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/obamas_stimulus_plan_a_down_payment_for_the_future" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Money photo by Jake Wasdin" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/2393137359_92c9d3c1dc_m.jpg" height="240" alt="" width="239"&gt;President Obama's $825 billion economic recovery package would temporarily increase Social Security benefits by $450 for 7.5 million disabled and elderly people, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/Documents/recovery_plan_metrics_report.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; providing details about the the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan. The President's further remarks on the plan can also be heard on the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/"&gt;White House website&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/economy/"&gt;full text&lt;/a&gt; of his plan can be read &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/economy/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temporary increase of SSI benefits to the disabled and elderly is included in the section "Supporting America’s Working Families," which also seeks to cut taxes, increase food stamp benefits, and extend and expand unemployment benefits. Specifically in regard to health care and education, the proposed package of spending programs and tax breaks also seeks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;	&lt;li&gt;to protect health care coverage for millions of people during the recession by increasing the Federal Medicaid Assistance Percentage "so that no state has to cut eligibility for Medicaid and &lt;a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/home/schip.asp"&gt;SCHIP&lt;/a&gt; because of budget shortfalls."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;to provide health care coverage for nearly 8.5 million Americans through a new tax credit for health insurance through COBRA and through a new option in Medicaid for low-income people who&lt;br&gt;
lack access to COBRA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;to provide more "quality preschool services" by doubling the Head Start Program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;to prevent teacher layoffs and education cuts, maintain "key reforms," and ensure that all schools have "advanced technology for the 21st century."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last-noted item, on preventing teachers from being laid off and cuts to educational programs and services, is of particular concern to us, school being so very important for Charlie's life now and in the future. I'm very curious for further clarification on what those "key reforms" are and hope that &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt;IDEA&lt;/a&gt; and the need for a "free and appropriate" education for all children is included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There's also a call to provide "evidence-based prevention to all American" with the flu vaccine specifically mentioned; I suppose that small note will raise eyebrows among anyone who has concerns about vaccines (and autism). )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's noted that the plan is taking the long view---that it's just a beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan is designed not only to jumpstart our economy and create jobs, but to lay the foundation for a more competitive 21st century economy. Through investments in clean energy, health care, education and other areas, the plan will address long- ignored national priorities and while making a down payment on our nation’s economic future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring quality education for children like my son who will be adults tomorrow is an essential part of a "down payment" for the future. But  we need as much to provide for those who need it today---need to make sure there's cash in the bank for those who need it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too bad it won’t bring back anyone Trudeau may have killed by telling them to ignore their doctors and eat coral instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s bad science, and then there is evil. Think I exaggerate? From the FTC article (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, the Commission charged Trudeau with violating the 1998 order by falsely claiming in infomercials that a product, Coral Calcium Supreme, &lt;strong&gt;could cure cancer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/09/kevintrudeau1.jpg" alt="Kevin Trudeau, convicted scam artist"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trudeau has been under court order, &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;, to stop lying. He violated that first order, which is why he’s being fined so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, good prevails. Let’s hope that every time this guy tries to make a buck off of lying to sick people and putting them at greater risk, the government is right there making sure he pays. I don’t think there is a fine high enough for Trudeau… but 37 million is a pretty good start.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232818986729"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/unacceptable_choices_for_service_cuts">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/be676421ac6194c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Unacceptable Choices for Service Cuts</title><published>2009-01-24T17:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T17:41:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/unacceptable_choices_for_service_cuts" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3003/2888980027_30751c6cf3_m.jpg" alt="scissors on a table spattered with blood colored paint" style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;Kristina and I have both been blogging about budget cuts to human services programs in the U.S., some impending, and some becoming an actuality.  The question of, "do we support the elderly or do we support children" literally came up at the town hall meeting I attended with my state officials earlier this month.  The &lt;a href="http://www.sltrib.com/News/ci_11516788"&gt;Salt Lake Tribune ran a story&lt;/a&gt; on exactly those choices being faced at a Department of Human Services meeting in Utah last Wednesday.  From the story it sounds like preschools for autistic children won renewed funding, but Adult Protective Services, an agency that helps protect autistic adults (and and many others) from abuse by caregivers may have lost funding completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choices like that--between educating children and keeping adults safe from abuse--are just... I can't even come up with words for how violating such choices are.  Who gets to pass judgement on human beings like that?  From the article, in the words of LouAnne Stevenson who is facing loss of necessary medical care, "You're cutting people's quality of life. We're real human beings here, we're not just another number."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if basic human rights are tossed out the window and financial costs alone are considered, cutting some programs may result in an even worse financial situation.  This issue of sacrificing long term benefit for short term gain was also touched on at the Utah meeting,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several speakers said the so-called savings would result in more costs in the future. For example, cutting 5,600 women from Medicaid-funded prenatal care could result in astronomical hospitalization costs, according to March of Dimes spokesman Stephen McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sacrifice of the long term for the short term is deeply troubling to me as it could be argued that such thinking has contributed substantially to why we're in this economic (and environmental, and every other sort of mess) mess in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has got to be a better way of dealing with the economic problems we face--a way that neither involves thrashing essential human rights nor ends up burying us deeper in the same mess we're already in.  How do we find that way?  How would things have been different at the Utah Meeting if the parents of autistic preschoolers and the self-advocates demanding freedom from abuse lobbied together to find a way to fund &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the preschools and protective services?

&lt;p&gt;It’s even labeled with a name that indicates what beetle it is: &lt;a href="http://www.barkbeetles.org/browse/subject.cfm?SUB=14338"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anoplophora malasiaca&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;One day after the occasion, USA Today offered as an analysis of [Obama's inaugural address] a list of the words most frequently used, words like &lt;em&gt;America, common, generation, nation, people, today, world&lt;/em&gt;. This is exactly the right kind of analysis to perform, for it identifies the location of the speech’s energy in the repetition of key words and the associations forged among them by virtue of that repetition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is odd, since Prof. Fish is known for attacking attempts to base literary analysis on counting things in texts (e.g. "&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sLkNAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA53&amp;amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;amp;cad=0_0"&gt;What is stylistics and why are they saying such terrible things about it?&lt;/a&gt;", in &lt;em&gt;Essays in Modern Stylistics&lt;/em&gt;, 1981). But he returns to type in his own analysis of the inaugural address, which relies on quantitatively unsupported assertions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;There are few transitions and those there are – “for,” “nor,” “as for,” “so,” “and so” – seem just stuck in, providing a pause, not a marker of logical progression. Obama doesn’t deposit us at a location he has in mind from the beginning; he carries us from meditative bead to meditative bead, and invites us to contemplate. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;There is a technical term for this kind of writing – parataxis, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as “the placing of propositions or clauses one after the other without indicating . . . the relation of co-ordination or subordination between them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The opposite of parataxis is hypotaxis, the marking of relations between propositions and clauses by connectives that point backward or forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, this analysis is quantitatively doubtful, as we'll see below: Obama's speech actually uses the relevant sort of connectives at a higher rate than George W. Bush's 2005 inaugural address did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish's analysis is also doubtful as a description of readers' responses: even in the paratactic parts of Obama's speech, it's clear that the reader is generally "deposited" at a series of discursive "locations" that are at least as  carefully calculated and logically related as in, say, George W. Bush's inaugural addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Fish's terminology is arguably misleading: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotaxis"&gt;hypotaxis&lt;/a&gt; is not crucially characterized by the use of connectives, but by the use of explicit grammatical embedding, hierarchical structuring that "places" (= &lt;em&gt;-taxis&lt;/em&gt;) some words or phrases "beneath" (= &lt;em&gt;hypo-&lt;/em&gt;) others.  (And Obama's inaugural involves significantly more hierarchical embedding than Bush's 2005 speech did.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look a little more closely into the issue of counting sentential connectives. George W. Bush&amp;#39;s 2005 inaugural contains 100 sentences, by my count, and 10 of them begin with &amp;quot;connectives that point backward or forward&amp;quot;. In comparison, Barack Obama&amp;#39;s 2009 inaugural contains 108 sentences, 14 of which involve sentence-initial connectives. I interpret this to mean that both addresses are written in a style that avoids explicit indications of discourse structure — but Obama&amp;#39;s address doesn&amp;#39;t have this property to any unusual extent. (To get agreement about the details of such an analysis, we&amp;#39;d have to spend some time deciding what counts as a &amp;quot;connective&amp;quot; of the appropriate sort, and discussing the interpretation of individual cases — but I&amp;#39;m very skeptical that any revision of this analysis is going to show a big difference between Obama&amp;#39;s text and other recent inaugural addresses. For example, feel free to divide the addresses into tensed clauses and count the types of connections among those — I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll find support for Fish there either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the alleged lack of any "logical progression" between the "meditative beads" of &lt;a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=44"&gt;Obama's 2009 inaugural address&lt;/a&gt;, I'm at a loss to understand what Prof. Fish has in mind. Here's the first sentence of the third paragraph, which is the real start of the speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the second sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no explicit connective or adverb indicating the discourse relation — no &lt;em&gt;and so&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;nevertheless&lt;/em&gt;. But "the words" refers back to "the presidential oath"; and the second sentence as a whole expands on the idea of the historical progression of presidencies that was introduced in the first sentence, evoking those that began in peace and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third sentence starts with the contrastive discourse-structural adverb "yet", and continues with a time-adverbial "every so often":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Yet, every so often, the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the subject, "the oath", again carries the thread of the discourse forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we, the people, have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fourth sentence starts with an adverbial "at these moments" that refers back to the just-discussed times of clouds and storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to go on through the speech in the same vein, and see if you can tell me whether it has any objective properties that Prof. Fish could have been responding to as "meditative beads" of parataxis. But before you tell me about your findings, please also figure out how your analysis distinguishes Obama's 2009 inaugural from (for example) &lt;a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=58745"&gt;Bush's 2005 address&lt;/a&gt;, which starts like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use but by the history we have seen together.&lt;br&gt;
For a half a century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders.&lt;br&gt;
After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical, and then there came a day of fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rhetorical approach is similar: the challenges of the moment are placed in historical context. The first sentence of Bush's paragraph tells us that "the history we have seen together" is crucial. The second and third sentences lay out three periods of that history: the cold war, the lull after the fall of the Soviet Union, and the aftermath of 9/11. However, this structure seems to me to be &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; explicitly signaled (by connectives, adverbs and anaphora) than the structure of Obama's paragraph was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both addresses, the phrases and sentences have a clear structure as a coherent discourse, easily accessible to any sentient reader. In neither case are we presented with the sequence of disconnected &amp;quot;meditative beads&amp;quot; that Prof. Fish claims to find in Obama&amp;#39;s speech. In both cases, much of the discourse structure is implicit, requiring us to understand the content in order to grasp the form — but Obama&amp;#39;s speech seems not at all unusual in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the interpretation of &lt;em&gt;parataxis&lt;/em&gt; as flat structure, contrasted with hierarchical embedding? Can we rescue Fish's response by looking at the speech from that perspective? I discussed the stylistic history of "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002465.html"&gt;Inaugural embedding&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; a few years ago (9/9/2005). In that post, I compared the &amp;quot;number of words at each level of embedding&amp;quot; in three inaugurals — George Washington&amp;#39;s, Abraham Lincoln&amp;#39;s second, and George W. Bush&amp;#39;s second. (See the post for how I operationalized &amp;quot;level of embedding&amp;quot;, and other details.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding the table from that post to include Obama's speech, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" width="400"&gt;

&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus by this measure, Obama 2009 was again &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; paratactic than Bush 2005 was. (In fact, his degree-of-embedding proportions are quite similar to those of Lincoln 1865.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion: under deadline pressure, Prof. Fish reached in his bag of analytical concepts and pulled one out, more or less at random, that expresses something about his response, but has little or no specific connection to Obama's text. In his interpretive community, the term &lt;em&gt;parataxis&lt;/em&gt; has some broader resonances that may help explain why it came to his hand. Thus Charles Bernstein ("&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/info/490038"&gt;What's Art Got to Do with It? The Status of the Subject of the Humanities in the Age of Cultural Studies&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;American Literary History&lt;/em&gt; 5(4): 597-615, 1993):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I agree with Fish and others that the new interpretive approach changes the objects of study. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The poetic — the aesthetic — the philosophic — the rhetorical: these intertwined figures dissolve into the art of everyday life, the multiple and particular decisions and revisions, recognitions and intuitions, that make up — constitute — our experiences of and in the world. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Such hypertextuality offers not a theory of frames — a supervening or hypotactic ordering principle — but an art of transition through and among frames. Call it the art of parataxis, where the elements set side by side are critical methods rather than images or ideas: an art of practice, which provides not answers but paths of reading and provisional connections among these paths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sympathize, but it seems to me that the analysis of Barack Obama's text as particularly paratactic is still, in the philosophical sense of the term, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit"&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I was reminded of the extent of this nonsense during a recent conversation with Dr Ben Goldcare of the Bad Science &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/series/badscience"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. He has spent years tirelessly fighting the perpetuators of misinformation (in his own time, for no money) who will often go to incredible extremes just to get a sensationalist story*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance, the reporter &lt;a href="http://au.todaytonight.yahoo.com/teambio/108811/laura-sparkes"&gt;Laura Sparkes&lt;/a&gt; has outdone herself by criticising the work of &lt;a href="http://www.acrf.com.au/page/bio_prof_ian_frazer.html"&gt;Professor Ian Frazer&lt;/a&gt;, a Queensland immunologist who’s team of researchers are responsible for developing the cervical cancer vaccine, marketed as &lt;a href="http://www.tga.gov.au/alerts/medicines/gardasil.htm"&gt;Gardasil &lt;/a&gt;and more recently a skin cancer vaccine. Laura reports on two cases of adverse reactions by teenage girls after receiving the vaccine. Now if this is true, then it needs to be treated with all seriousness. There are mechanisms in place in Australia for reporting adverse reactions to registered drugs and this is particularly important when a new drug is released. But there is no need to get hysterical Laura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had a headache, I was dizzy, I was nauseous, my right side was weak, my right fist was clenched and I was hallucinating,” Allie said. Gardasil has been hailed as a medical breakthrough, the first ever immunisation against cancer; but &lt;strong&gt;no-one was warned about this&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is just not true Laura. You can go to Gardasil’s own &lt;a href="http://www.gardasil.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where the side effects are listed on the front page and the&lt;a href="http://www.tga.gov.au/alerts/medicines/gardasil.htm"&gt; TGA&lt;/a&gt; also details a list of adverse effects. It’s a government requirement that all drugs come with warnings of even the most unlikely or rare adverse effects. Whether this information was passed onto the girls I do not know, but certainly this information is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s where Laura really should have done her research when reporting on a serious public health issue. She asks the opinion of one Bronwyn Hancock from the &lt;a href="http://www.vaccination.inoz.com"&gt;vaccination information service&lt;/a&gt;, who is cited in the article as a “scientist and health researcher”. Long bow Laura. According to their website, &lt;a href="http://www.vaccination.inoz.com/speakerprofiles.html#Bronwyn"&gt;Bronwyn&lt;/a&gt; has a BSc from Macquarie University obtained in 1981, which she never used - instead she went onto to work in computer programming for 14 years (which I don’t disparage, I just don’t think you can call yourself a scientist unless you have worked in the field). I hardly think you can call yourself a “scientist and health researcher” just because you have a BSc on paper. If I qualified as a hairdresser but never worked as one, then 14 years later offered to cut your hair, would you let me? She also has a certificate of nutrition which hardly qualifies you for anything particularly useful with respect to vaccines and immunology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this extract from her bio worries me even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…to bring to the awareness of the public what is well published in the depths of medical research about this procedure, but is generally not studied or at least brought to the attention of the public by doctors or the media, due, it would seem, to the heavy influence of the “health”, rather sickness, industry”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;depths&lt;/em&gt; of medical research? Hey Bronwyn, ever heard of the public database &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;? Oh who really cares, you lost me with the big pharma conspiracy stuff at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this little gem; &lt;em&gt;“The Gardasil vaccine has never been shown to be safe or effective in preventing cervical cancer,” &lt;/em&gt;Bronwyn said. &lt;em&gt;“There are so many limitations with the testing that they’ve done.&lt;/em&gt;” Okay so if you really are a scientist you would understand the structure of clinical trials, involving 4 phases of testing and millions of dollars and many, many years, (sometimes decades) before the drug is approved for human use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People like this infuriate me because they detract from the complex and intricate process that is science. They also contribute to the public misunderstanding of science by suggesting that we just design a drug, test it on a bunny a couple of times then throw it out to the public, meanwhile exclaiming “it’s alive!”. The drug development process is complex, extensive and expensive. It makes my blood boil that people this daft are given air time to undermine the brilliant and thorough work of scientists like Professor Frazer, who has since gone on to develop a &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/11/16/2420948.htm"&gt;skin cancer vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two strains of human papiloma virus (HPV) have been shown to cause cervical cancer. In 2006, the cancer council of New South Wales estimated there would be approximately 240 new cases and around 75 deaths attributable to cervical cancer in NSW. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women and it is estimated to result in over 470,000 new cases and cause 233,000 deaths per year worldwide.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in 2006, Professor Frazer was honoured with the &lt;a href="http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/pages/page58.asp"&gt;Australian of the year&lt;/a&gt; for his work on the cervical cancer vaccine. This later resulted in his research facility attracting a $500 million donation from a wealthy Taiwanese donor. High praise indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many lives Bronwyn and her cronies can claim to have saved by perpetuating misinformation and lies about the effectiveness and science behind vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations morons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council was established in 2008, using money from the Department of Health (£900 000) and the King’s Fund (£1 million) with the purpose “to enhance public protection by setting standards” in the area of alternative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a good idea to me. Regulation is something that has been sorely missing from the alternative medicine industry since inception. But wait, before we get too excited let’s examine the “legislation” in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First problem: A conflict of interest? The &lt;a href="http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm"&gt;CNHC&lt;/a&gt; was set-up by the Prince’s Foundation for Integrative Health, in other words, woo ruling on woo. For an hilarious take on this aspect of the policy see this &lt;a href="http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/health/complementary-therapists-to-be-regulated-by-witch-doctor-200901201522/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from the daily mash website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second and bigger problem: registering with the CNHC is &lt;strong&gt;voluntary&lt;/strong&gt;. (To add to the incentive, it also costs money). To get on to the government-register, therapists will have to show they have the qualifications and experience, abide by a code of conduct and ensure they have insurance in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But importantly, the efficacy of the therapies they are offering will not be addressed. Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter’s Medical School said, &lt;em&gt;“There does need to be more rigour in the regulation of complementary medicine as there will be cowboys out there. However, I have concerns that the regulator does not have mandatory powers and is not looking at the efficacy of these therapies.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely this is just arse-about. Whilst I don’t disagree with the idea of alternative therapists adhering to a code of conduct, I do object to them acquiring some official looking stamp just because they can produce a certificate of attendance for turning up to homeopathy school and pouring water into a little jar. A nod from the government with the addition of a regulator logo to promotional material and shopfronts just adds legitimacy to an industry that sells magic water and farcical “cures”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeopathy is water or sugar pills. Therapeutic touch is made up shit debunked by an 11 year old girl as part of her school science project and &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/279/13/1005"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of America Medical Association. Ear candles &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8849790?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;do more harm than good&lt;/a&gt;, and are based on lies about the creation of a vacuum and the removal of cerumen or ear wax from the ear canals. Detox can kill you, or give you &lt;a href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Health/The-Amazing-Hydration-Diet-Detox-Victim-Dawn-Page-Awarded-800000-Damages-After-Brain-Damage/Article/200807415050806?lpos=Health_Third_Home_Page_Feature_Teaser_Region_3&amp;amp;lid=ARTICLE_15050806_The_Amazing_Hydration_Diet%3A_Detox_Victim_Dawn_Page_Awarded_%3F800%2C000_Damages_After_Brain_Damage"&gt;brain damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s not worry about that, as long as you have a certificate in “making-shit-up” we are fine with you chanting or holding your hands over someone’s head to channel energy into their aura. Just as long as you don’t do anything weird like have sex with your patient whilst you align their chakras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main plank of the council’s work will be to operate a register of practitioners. It will not judge clinics on whether therapies are effective, but rather on whether they operate a professional and safe business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maggie Dunn*, co-chair of the CNHC said the regulator would clean up the industry used by one in five people and she estimated thousands of clinics may go out of business in the process. As applying to the register is voluntary, Ms Dunn accepted that some therapists might not put themselves forward. Ms Dunn said: &lt;em&gt;“It won’t take long for customers to start asking whether a practitioner is registered or  searching on our website for ones that are. They will then vote with their feet.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst some people think those stupid enough to use alternative therapies get what they deserve, I believe governments have some responsibility to protect the public from harm. Especially since (in Australia at least) these “medicines” are approved for sale in pharmacies and drug stores, alongside the science-based medicine, thereby lending them legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one expects (and neither they should) Mr Jo Public to take responsibility for establishing whether these things work or not. If the government is going to set up regulatory bodies at least use them for good, not to give the stamp of approval to magic water and other collective bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#808080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Interestingly, the board of the CNHC is occupied by woo and lay people. Maggie Dunn was lay Chair of the General Council for Massage Therapy until June 2008; the co-chair Maggie Wallace was lay Chair of the Council of Organisations Registering Homeopaths; Jenny Gordon completed her PhD in 2007 which focussed on the use of reflexology as an adjunct to care in the management of childhood idiopathic constipation. The other members appear to be lay people (solicitors), “consumer champions” and a physiotherapist. Medical doctors are conspicuous by their absence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Maggie</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/</id><title type="html">The Skeptics&amp;#39; Book of Pooh-Pooh</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232812895700"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/president_obama_and_technology.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/85bf147fb5481e23</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Computers"/><title type="html">President Obama and technology</title><published>2009-01-24T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/GEemo5JbdBc/president_obama_and_technology.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/president_obama_and_technology.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that I'm a Mac geek, at least not to any of my readers, family, or friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither is it a secret at my job that I'm a Mac geek, mainly because, although the university where I'm faculty is perfectly fine with Macs, the cancer center where my laboratory, clinic, and office are housed is not. Indeed, one might even say it goes beyond that in that it borders on being Mac-hostile. Oh, the IT department doesn't actually forbid Macs (although until a recent change in organization it was clear to me that they would clearly very much like to do so), but, until the recent hire of one woman who actually uses and likes Macs, it didn't really support them (although it did and does deign to let us hook them up to the network and Internet). Moreover, even now, its personnel still seem to make every lame excuse imaginable to try to forestall faculty or staff getting a Mac. I sometimes think the only reason they permitted a Mac to be purchased for me was that I managed somehow to slip through the door when I first arrived as new faculty, for whom they were (temporarily) willing to bend over backwards to make happy. Since then, I've observed one person who's been there a while trying to get a new Mac Pro to do some fairly heavy duty genomics calculations go through unbelievable numbers of contortions trying to get IT to actually purchase and deliver what he needed, even though he had plenty of funding for it and its lack slowed down his output enormously. It makes me wonder what will happen when the time comes for me to need to replace the Macs I now use. I'm no longer new faculty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about Linux?&lt;/em&gt; I hear &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/technology/linux/"&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt; (and others) saying. Forget it. If Macs are tolerated among a few, Linux boxes are pretty much completely &lt;em&gt;verboten&lt;/em&gt;. This same person wanted to set up a Linux-based server, and he might as well have been asking to set up an underground lair from which to launch spy operations on the entire state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is because the IT folks at our place are bad people or incompetent (one possible exception with whom I dealt is possible), but rather because of the way IT seems to operate. IT training and culture seems to inculcate budding young new IT people with two things: a knowledge of Windows and the perceived need to be in control. Macs and Linux boxes don't fit in to either characteristic. Both at my current institution and the one where I started my career fresh out of training, Windows boxes were set up with users completely unable to install software--or even software updates. No administrator privileges for you, dude. Indeed, at my previous institution, the IT head even tried to control what was put on Macs by requiring that all software purchased with institutional funds be delivered to him, that only an IT person could install it, and that IT keep the discs. When I bought Adobe Photoshop for my lab, IT installed it. Later, I found that IT had installed it on another computer on the network. When I tried to fire up my copy of Photoshop, I got an error message saying that another copy of the software was in use on the network, and my copy of Photoshop shut down. I was not pleased and raised more than a little hell about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, IT departments tend to be unrelentingly cautious and conservative. To some extent, I can understand why, given that it's a huge deal to upgrade hundreds of computers when a major new software update comes out, and dealing with the headaches such headaches bring can be expensive and time-consuming, especially when many IT departments are understaffed. However, such conservatism has lead our institution to have computers running Windows XP (not necessarily that bad in an of itself, given the problems with Vista), with Office 2003 and using for its mail servers Exchange 2003. That's right, we're using six year old software for almost, not just Microsoft Products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds, oddly enough, better than &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/21/AR2009012104249.html"&gt;what the Obama Administration faced its first day on the job in the White House&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/president_obama_and_technology.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/president_obama_and_technology.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/GEemo5JbdBc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232812269827"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-5866378583249144691">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/63dcd155182cfe82</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Journalism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Good Science Writing</title><published>2009-01-24T15:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T21:00:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/good-science-writing.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/5866378583249144691/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=5866378583249144691" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Good Science WritingDavid SuzukiHelena CurtisDavid RaupNiles EldredgeRichard LewontinSteven VogelJacques MonodG.

The best ones made it to her blog [Music this week].</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232809760243"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/never_say_please_to_mother.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/811347b5e1d6f989</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language"/><title type="html">Never Say Please To Mother</title><published>2009-01-24T13:20:04Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T13:20:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/vVlO2gGZ0EE/never_say_please_to_mother.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/never_say_please_to_mother.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My lovely Chinese wife came to Sweden with her family at age seven and grew up here. This has given her an unusual level of bicultural competence. I like to quip, lewdly, that she's a dual boot machine with two operating systems and the most awesome hardware, man. She's like this typical bright Swedish middle-class chick who somehow happens to know everything about China and looks like an Imperial princess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can't really say that we have grappled with and overcome our cultural differences. She pretty much does that for me on her own. But there are some details where our different upbringings do show. Having read Vinlusen's &lt;a href="http://vinlusen.blogspot.com/2009/01/20095-tack-del-tv.html"&gt;recent blog entry&lt;/a&gt;, my wife encouraged me to write a few words about manners in the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An American acquaintance with a Chinese wife once complained to us, "I really wish she would quit ordering me around". That made me laugh. What this is really about is that the Chinese don't use polite figures of speech with their families. Indeed, they may be offended by them as such phrases mark an unwanted &lt;i&gt;distance&lt;/i&gt;. You don't say "Please pass me the salt" to your mom, you say "Pass the salt". My wife does that all the time with me, straight imperatives, and I often complete the sentence for her with a joke to soften the impact of what I can't help but perceive as rudeness. She'll say "Pass the salt" and I'll pass it, replying "...or I will cut your balls off". Then we'll laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife once made the mistake of translating a Swedish figure of polite speech when talking to her mom in Chinese. She said, "Could you pass me the salt?" (OK, maybe it wasn't the salt that one time.) Her mother reacted really badly, as the connotations of such a question in Chinese, when directed at your mom, is basically "Tell me, are you at all capable of passing me the salt, or are you an invalid?".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the kitchen, my wife really doesn't like it when I apologise for pushing her to the side when I need to get something out of the sauce pan cupboard. The correct way to do this in the intimacy of a Chinese family situation is to shove her gently out of the way without as much as a grunt. Apologising puts her on the level of a cleaning lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she tries to remember my Swedish manners, and usually she gets it right. She knows I really need to hear please, thanks and sorry sometimes or I'll feel mistreated. But every now and then she gets it backwards to comic effect. Once she tried a half-remembered "Would you be so good as to pass me the salt?". It came out as "You may pass me the salt..." Then she hesitated, clearly feeling that she'd dropped some part of the phrase. So she finished it, " ...  if you're good".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 9, the &lt;a href="http://www.americandialect.org/index.php/amerdial/P3/"&gt;American Dialect Society&lt;/a&gt; held its annual convention where its main order of business was to choose the top words and phrases of 2008. ADS members gathered to debate which American English vocabulary items — not just words but phrases — were not only newly prominent, but also notable and impactful in the past year. The staff at the Airport Motor Lodge (or where ever they actually met) kept them supplied with coffee and danish as they the discussed the merits of contenders like “Palinesque,” “skadoosh,” “bromance” and “thought showers” before voting for an overall winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I’m still digging one of 2007’s contenders, which was ”Googleganger”. According to the society, “Googleganger” is a play on “doppelganger”. A Googleganger is a person with your name who shows up when you Google yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go try it, and see if you have any cool Googlegangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually have a couple of Googlegangers, but the most prominent seems to be a fairly well-received photographer. Heck, this blog is listed fourth when I Google “Sam Ogden”. Maybe I’m gaining on my Googleganger. Perhaps one day I’ll be at the top of the Sam Ogden list and the other Sam Ogdens will look up to me as the Sam Ogden Googleganger Extraordinaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, one can dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the words for 2008 are just as fun, as you’ll see after the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, from the American Dialect Society website, here are the words chosen as 2008’s best words or phrases. There are several different categories, and I’ve included the runners up the society considered in addition to the winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORD OF THE YEAR WINNER: bailout&lt;/strong&gt;, the rescue by the government of companies on the brink of failure, including large players in the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other nominees for word of the year:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt;: Both names as combining forms in a large number of new words. A combining form is a word or part of a word that can be used as the root or basis of other words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;change&lt;/strong&gt;: Not so much a buzzword as political wallpaper, background noise, and ambient energy rolled into one. The idea of discarding old ideas and methods seemed to underlie everything said by national political candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;shovel-ready&lt;/strong&gt;: Used to describe infrastructure projects that can be started quickly when funds become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;game-changer&lt;/strong&gt;: In business and politics, something that alters the nature of a marketplace, relationship, or campaign. From sports ‘something that changes a match or contest.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—MOST USEFUL—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: Barack Obama&lt;/strong&gt;: Both names as combining forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;text(ing)&lt;/strong&gt;, in &lt;strong&gt;driving while texting (DWT)&lt;/strong&gt;, the sending of text messages while conducting and automobile, and &lt;strong&gt;textwalker&lt;/strong&gt;, a person who texts while walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bailout&lt;/strong&gt;: The rescue by the government of companies on the brink of failure, including large players in the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palinesque&lt;/strong&gt;: Pertaining to a person who has extended themselves beyond their expertise, thereby bringing ridicule upon a serious matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: terrorist fist jab&lt;/strong&gt;: A knuckle-to-knuckle fist bump, or “dap,” traditionally performed between two black people as a sign of friendship, celebration or agreement. It was called the “terrorist fist jab” by the newscaster E. D. Hill, formerly of Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;body-snarking&lt;/strong&gt;: Posting pictures and commenting negatively on the bodies of the people in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phelpsian&lt;/strong&gt;: Excellent in the fashion of swimmer Michael Phelps, who won eight medals and set seven world records in the 2008 Summer Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: maverick&lt;/strong&gt;: A person who is beholden to no one. Widely used by the Republican Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates, John McCain and Sarah Palin.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lipstick on a pig&lt;/strong&gt;: An adornment of something that can’t be made pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

But "detox" isn't only an autism treatment: Everyone's doing it, according to a recent &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/fashion/22skin.html?ref=fashion"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; article about                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      "the thousands of Americans who regularly 'detox' in an effort to rid the gastrointestinal system of unsavory substances that proponents believe build up and can cause allergies, exhaustion and certain cancers." Various combinations of supplements (including cranberry juice and ground flaxseeds) to chelation therapy can be part of a "detox" regimen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of herbal formulas for cleansing, detoxification and organ support among natural food retailers were more than $27 million from Dec. 2, 2007, to Nov. 29, 2008. A survey by Mintel International, a Chicago-based research firm, found that 54 food and drink products were launched in 2008 with the word “detox” in their descriptions — up from 15 in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thinking goes that by avoiding certain foods, adding nutritional and herbal supplements and cleansing your innards, you can cure the body of all sorts of evils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess it's hardly a surprise that detoxification has become &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/on-autism-detox/"&gt;another alternative autism treatment&lt;/a&gt;. Detoxification for autistic children is based on the belief that exposure to environmental toxins is one factor behind the increase in the number of children diagnosed with autism in the past decade; that "something bad" has gotten into a child's system and must needs be expelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not only are detox regiments unproven as effective (for anyone). Saying that there's something---heavy metals, toxins not otherwise specified---that must be purged from a child's body suggests that there's something you can put into an autistic child to "take the autism out" of her or him and, too, that there's something poisonous about being autistic. When, in reality, there's nothing specific to autism that calls for detoxification by whatever means, for kids on the spectrum---or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High time to detox from detox---or, at the very least, to let go of detox having something to do with autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Mature Moso bamboo, around 2 years old, is used in the Bamboo notebooks. This aligns with the natural lifespan of the bamboo, and the manufacturing process uses less energy than traditional metal alloys that are refined from petrol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1053"&gt;Pomegranate&lt;/a&gt;, the Asus bamboo is an actual product — I saw one in use just a couple of days ago. But this leaves the question of whether the ad page is a hip joke, or was produced by copy writers who paid less attention in science class than they did to environmentalist clichés.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later we learn something new about bamboo's superordinate category as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Users will have a highly individual and personal experience with the Bamboo notebook where every touch on the touch pad will be reflected by color and surface change over time and use, as only a natural fiber like bamboo can demonstrate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same question arises in this case: hip joke or mindless rhetoric?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other advertising pages for this product makes an intriguing claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And underneath the beauty of the surface is a feat of engineering, boasting an incredible resilience that has been testing to its limit successfully on the unforgiving conditions of Mount Everest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm tentatively voting for the "copy writers on automatic pilot" theory; but maybe the jokes are going over my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The bamboo in question seems to come from &lt;a href="http://www.dmvpbamboo.com/production/2-different-styles"&gt;this company&lt;/a&gt;. A key part of the process involves glue — &amp;quot;The bamboo strips are pressed against each other vertically and glued under high pressure&amp;quot; — and I wonder whether the glue is a traditional animal glue, or a more modern type made from petrochemicals, say urea-formaldehyde glue (where both urea and formaldehyde are now typically produced from coal, natural gas, or other fossil hydrocarbons).]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232793623449"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/01/reindeer-herding-indigenous-people-and-climate-change/langswitch_lang/in">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c90cc683e8e205b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Science"/><title type="html">Reindeer herding, indigenous people and climate change</title><published>2009-01-24T10:40:08Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T10:40:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/01/reindeer-herding-indigenous-people-and-climate-change/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/lavo.JPG" title="Lavo"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/lavo.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Lavo" align="left" width="120" style="padding-right:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_people"&gt;Sámi&lt;/a&gt; are keenly aware about climate change, and are thus concerned about their future. Hence, the existence of the&lt;a href="http://www.ipy.org"&gt; International Polar Year&lt;/a&gt; (IPY) project called&lt;a href="http://www.arcticportal.org/en/icr/ealat"&gt; EALÁT&lt;/a&gt; involving scientists, Sámi from Norway/Sweden/Finland, as well as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nenets_people"&gt;Nenets&lt;/a&gt; from Russia. The indigenous people in the Arctic are closely tuned to the weather and the climate. I was told that the Sámi have about 300 words for snow, each with a very precise meaning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important get a fusion of traditional knowledge and modern science and adopt a holistic approach. The indigenous people often have a different world view, in addition to having invaluable knowledge and experience about nature. Furthermore, if the end results are to be of any value beyond academic, then the stakeholders must be involved on equal terms. For instance, remote sensing data from NASA - for better understanding of land-vegetation - can be combined with traditional knowledge through the use of geographical information system (GIS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big challenge facing &lt;a href="http://icr.arcticportal.org/"&gt;reindeer herding peoples&lt;/a&gt; in the Arctic is the ability to adapt to a climate change, according to a recent EALÁT workshop that was held in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kautokeino"&gt;Guovdageaidnu&lt;/a&gt; (Kautokeino), with representatives from the US, Russia, Sweden, Finland as well as Norway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Russia, however, climate change was not perceived as the major concern, according to the reports from the work shop, but rather industrial development constraining their use of land. Climate change should nevertheless be a&lt;a href="http://www.arcticpeoples.org/"&gt; concern&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional adaption strategy amongst the nomadic indigenous people have involved a migration and moving the reindeer herd from one pasture to another, when exposed to  climatic fluctuations. In addition, they aim to keep a well-balanced and robust herd structure. But today there are more severe land constraints, such as obstructing infrastructure, fences, and national borders, limiting the ability to move to regions where the grazing is good. Furthermore, projections for the Arctic suggest changes well beyond the range of observed variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reindeer herds are &lt;a href="http://www.arcticpeoples.org/2007/08/20/reindeer-herders-prepare-for-climate-change/"&gt;affected by climatic swings&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when hard icy layers are formed on snow (or within the snow layer) making the food underneath unreachable. Warm summers may also cause problems, and insects (pests), forest fires, and the melting of permafrost can be additional stress factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been really thinking hard for the past couple of days about anything in my life that I’ve been accepting or believing that doesn’t have grounds in fact or logic and I’ve been surprised to find way more things than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing what one can come to believe over time if they aren’t being strict with what they take in. I was one of these conspiracy theorists that believe in the new world order and in 2012 doomsday views. After some very critical logical thought I’ve decided that there is no evidence backing this up…just a lot of theories based off of loose evidence. I’m sure that there are secret societies with powerful people in them but I don’t think that they have sweeping control like Alex Jones likes to think. I do think that there is going to be a galactic event in or around 2012 that could have some effects on earth (such as a pole shift) but it’s not something I’m basing my choices or thoughts on as if it were real. I’m talking about the science that exists on the subject. We will be crossing the galactic equator and it is theorized by the scientists that study this (not crazy 2012 nuts) that it could cause a massive shift in our poles causing some very serious problems on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve delete Alex Jones and a lot of his crazy followers from my myspace and I can feel the crazy slipping away from my mind. It was funny, I posted a little comment on one of his bulletins saying that I don’t believe all this doom and gloom shit that Alex is selling (and boy is he SELLING it) and this guy sent me a message. I’m going to show it in it’s entirety.. I think you will get a nice laugh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw your pathetic post on Alex’s page, now put his money grubbing fear mongering aside for just a second. Your “George Carlin” stance is absolutely uneducated and stupid !! First, they have ruled for FAR longer than 400 years, as I have NO idea where that bogus date comes from. Second, that is what you little television watching celebrity worshipping peasants are suppose to believe, which is that you have NO power…&lt;br&gt;
Truth is, all the armies of the world are NOT stronger than an idea who’s time has come. That idea is change and revolution, NO not Obama type of change, but REAL change. Stop being another uneducated pussy in depression, that is EXACTLY what they want from you… go stand up BOY and then you might be somewhat of a man… or you let another wealthy celenrity shit like Carlin get into your simple mind…&lt;br&gt;
Education and Rebellion BOY, that is what we have…. Go live in your simple minded depression and be too gutless to stand and be a part of the REAL change that is coming SOONER than later…. It will be because of the people, NOT the so called “leaders.” Time marches on and ages change, we are about to leave Pisces and enter Aquarius, the age of deceit is being lifted for the age of truth and enlightenment… Now go be a part of it, or sit on your depressed peasant ass saying “death means nothing to me.&lt;br&gt;
” FUCKIN’ PATHETIC BOY !!! STAND UP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucking hilarious! I went to the guys page and he is trying to deny evolution…it’s insane. Actually let me give you a link to his page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/georgia_cowboy_guy"&gt;www. myspace. com/georgia_cowboy_guy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has glitery rebel flags…believes in god and watches football and basketball (and accuses me of watching too much television). Fact is, I don’t own a television, not a single one. I haven’t watched one in over 5 years. I only download documentaries or watch them on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I’m sidetracked.  I just wanted to say thank you, I’m re-instating reality and it’s largely due to you and your posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, I still do not believe the official story of 9/11 and I would love to see a new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;br&gt;
Michael&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure he still has some ways to go but don’t we all. Anyway, I’m glad to have played even a small role in Michael’s move towards “re-instating reality” and wish him the best.&lt;/p&gt;

Now even though I agree that the brilliant Stephen J. Gould was wrong in declaring science and religion different magistia to avoid taking the kind of hard anti-religious stance that Richard Dawkins has, I’ve always given Ken Miller a pass because I like and respect him in addition to think that he is possibly the best critic against “Intelligent Design” that we have. But intellectually I agree with Coyne that science and religion just cannot be reconciled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a video of Ken Miller smoking creationists in a debate better than anyone I’ve ever seen and also later referencing his religious faith:&lt;/p&gt;

At the &lt;em&gt;New Republic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2009/01/20/a-hodgepodge.aspx"&gt;John Judis &lt;/a&gt;called it a "disappointing muddle" that "got no style points," while &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=c96cbed1-cec4-4c7c-8465-6dcd1f82e9cd"&gt;John McWhorter&lt;/a&gt;, moonlighting from his Language Log day job, called the speech "worthy of marble" and pointed in particular to Black English influences on Obama's cadences, though he didn't develop the point in detail. And &lt;a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/barack-obamas-prose-style/"&gt;Stanley Fish&lt;/a&gt; pronounced the speech a paradigm of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parataxis"&gt;paratactic&lt;/a&gt; prose, which in its nature "lends itself to leisurely and loving study," and having duly allowed himself to "linger over each alliteration [and] parse each emphasis," predicted that it would be studied in a thousand classrooms: "canonization has already arrived."&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/declamations.jpg" alt="declamations" width="175" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the criteria people always bring to this sort of address: Was it memorable? Marmorealizable? Did he stick the landing? It's understandable, a way of flattering ourselves that ritual oratory still matters. But I have the feeling Obama and his writers knew better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it was a very memorable event, on a historic, make that epochal, occasion. And the speech is sure to be memorialized — in fact Penguin Books is &lt;a href="http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594488931,00.html"&gt;already on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the speech was well turned, it wasn't memorable. What's more, it didn't need to be memorable. It couldn't have been memorable. And my guess is that nobody tried too hard to make it memorable. As I put the point in a "Fresh Air" piece that aired today [full text &lt;a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/inaugural.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; ]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Obama’s speech made all the required moves: it was grave but not doleful; resolute but not belligerent, eloquent but not grandiloquent. Its acknowledgments were eclectic: Biblical allusions, a nod to Tom Paine, a shout-out to Jerome Kern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;But it wasn’t especially memorable. If we still lived in an age when people compiled collections of great speeches for pupils to memorize and declaim on national holidays, the editor would more likely go with the moving &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jll5baCAaQU"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; that Obama made in Grant Park on the night of the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that isn't necessarily a weakness of the speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Ceremonial speechmaking is an unnatural, anachronistic exercise, and I’m not sure whether anybody will ever again give an address as memorable as Kennedy’s in 1961 or Roosevelt’s in 1933 — or that it&amp;#39;s a good idea to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;When you reread Roosevelt and Kennedy’s speeches you realize how rhetorically distant their age was. Take the famous sentence from &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres56.html"&gt;Kennedy’s inaugural &lt;/a&gt;that begins: “Now the trumpet summons us again—not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are, but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;It’s still a stirring line, but you can’t imagine any recent president trying to get away with it. Kennedy was the last president who could comfortably dip into the rich stew of classical figures of speech. “Not as a call to battle, though embattled we are” — that would be both &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiasmus"&gt;chiasmus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/P/polyptoton.htm"&gt;polyptoton&lt;/a&gt;. Rhetoricians have been botanizing this stuff for millennia, and by now there's no way to put two words together that doesn't have a Greek label, kept alive by a thin line of English department pedants. There are 67 people in America who live for this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;The medieval scholars called those figures of speech the rhetorical colors, from a Latin term for ornament. They flourished over the centuries when the proper role of literature and oration was the decorous ornamentation of thought, and when politicians and poets drew from the same rhetorical well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;You can still turn up moves like those if you rummage around in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MyWjtOwCs1sC&amp;amp;pg=PA148&amp;amp;lpg=PA148&amp;amp;dq=%22withering+of+withered+flowers%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=BH3yMIX0wF&amp;amp;sig=45V5IN5zgN-25EjSclzBD73Mbvk&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=17&amp;amp;ct=result"&gt;T. S. Eliot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/%7Eafilreis/88/stevens-snowman.html"&gt;Wallace Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, but rhetorical ornament is alien to the spirit of modern literature. It still survives in some religious traditions; those flourishes come naturally to a Jesse Jackson or Joseph Lowery, though they sound a bit more forced coming from the energetically affable Rick Warren. But for the most part, the figures are reserved nowadays for advertising slogans, bumper stickers, and the titles of country songs — they’re the linguistic equivalent of stunt riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Take the figure in Kennedy’s "ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country” and "we must never negotiate out of fear, but we must never fear to negotiate." The classical rhetoricians called it antimetabole, though modern speechwriters prefer to refer to it as the reversible raincoat. Politicians are still irresistibly drawn to it. Bill Clinton had his "People are more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power." John McCain had "We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us." And Hillary Clinton went with "The true test is not the speeches a president delivers, it's whether the president delivers on the speeches” (an example not just of antimetabole but of &lt;a href="http://rhetoric.byu.edu/figures/A/antanaclasis.htm"&gt;antanaclasis&lt;/a&gt;, where the same word is used twice in different senses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;The figure has its roots in Shakespeare and Milton. It&amp;#39;s in Blake’s &amp;quot;Never seek to tell your love/Love that told can never be” and Kipling’s &amp;quot;What should they know of England who only England know?&amp;quot; Frederick Douglas used it when he said “You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man.&amp;quot;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;But to modern listeners, the pattern is more likely to bring to mind the syntactic two-step of slogans like "When guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns" and "I am stuck on Band-Aid, and Band-Aid's stuck on me.” Or in its pure classical form:"Starkist doesn't want tuna with good taste, Starkist wants tuna that tastes good." It’s as catchy as ever, but it can’t be the vessel for a deep idea anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Of course Obama’s speech was dotted with some of the other turns and  figures that ceremonial addresses require. &amp;quot;A nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous” — that was polyptoton, where a word is used in two different ways, as in FDR’s “nothing to fear but fear itself.” It’s a tidy aphothegm; you had the sense somebody fought hard to keep it in there. And there was a soupçon of &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7emyl/languagelog/archives/003294.html"&gt;catachresis&lt;/a&gt; in &amp;quot;the bitter swill of civil war and segregation,&amp;quot; in a passage that Obama read with rising intonations that I heard as an evocation of the language of Martin Luther King. But Obama didn’t do a lot of rhetorical overreaching — he did just what he needed to do to nail the event. No, it wasn’t a speech for the ages. But I found it reassuring that he kept his coat on right side out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was preparing to tape this piece on Wednesday, when everybody had moved on to the Guantanamo closing and the Clinton and Geithner hearings, a friend said to me, &amp;quot;Was there ever an inaugural address that became old news so quickly?&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know. But paratactic or no, nobody seemed to have much interest in lingering over it by then — Obama least of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoff Nunberg</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232776990971"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/20249f15626b7a09</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">It's Not Just US</title><published>2009-01-24T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/404-its-not-just-us.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was in Canada recently. I live in Vermont and Montreal is a short drive north, but even though we're right next door, Vermonters talk about how things are better in Canada. Affordable health care, less crime, less bigotry, more accessible higher education, more progressive politics, etc. Even their football fields are longer. All of those opinions are debatable, but I did notice a few things of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Canada really does seem more advanced. I'll give you one concrete example: traffic signals. All around Montreal, the familiar red, yellow and green traffic lights have been replaced with lights that have red squares, yellow triangles, and green circles. It looks like this (if they were all on):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="background-color:#000000;height:30px" border="0" width="72"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists, apparently familiar with the Discovery Institute’s desperate attempts after the Dover failure, observed that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 800 scientists in Texas have signed a statement to “encourage valid critical thinking and scientific reasoning by leaving out all references to ‘strengths and weaknesses’” of evolution - references, they say, that politicians “have used to introduce supernatural explanations into science courses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our friends at the &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/01/weaknesses-removed-from-texas-science-standards-004231" rel="external "&gt;NCSE&lt;/a&gt; reports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Board took a sizable step backward, says Dr. Scott. Last-minute amendments to the Earth and Space Science standards and the Biology standards could allow creationists to smuggle their views back into the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/education/24texas.html?ref=us" rel="external "&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; how the amendments make no sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amendment “makes no sense to me,” said David M. Hillis, a prominent professor of biology at the University of Texas, adding, “It’s a clear indication that the chairman of the state school board doesn’t understand the science.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we thus be surprised to find out that the Discover Institute is touting these last minute amendments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignorance knows no bounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out who &lt;a href="http://www.texasscientists.org/sign.html" rel="external "&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt;
Present count:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;588 Texas Science Faculty &lt;br&gt;
777 Other Texas Scientists&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists for a Responsible Curriculum in
Texas Public Schools&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong science curriculum is an essential part of a 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century education and should be based on established peer-reviewed empirical research. In 2008-09 the State Board of Education is revising the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) curriculum standards for the sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientifically sound curriculum standards must:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acknowledge that instruction on evolution is vital to understanding all the biological sciences;&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;make clear that evolution is an easily observable phenomenon that has been documented beyond any reasonable doubt;&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;be based on the latest, peer-reviewed scholarship;&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;encourage valid critical thinking and scientific reasoning by leaving out all references to “strengths and weaknesses,” which politicians have used to introduce supernatural explanations into science courses; and&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;recognize that all students are best served when matters of faith are left to families and houses of worship.&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, therefore, call on the Texas State Board of Education to approve science curriculum standards that prepare Texas students to succeed in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

WE DO NOT BELIEVE! I find it humorous that I must continually state the obvious to Christians who fail to grasp this simple fact. Again, WE DO NOT BELIEVE!&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some Christians tell us to have faith, others quote "Scripture" to us, and still others tell us that when we die we'll know the truth. As far as I can tell these Christians are merely venting. None of this affects us at all. Again, WE DO NOT BELIEVE! Get it? No amount of quoting the Bible or telling us to have faith or that we'll know when we die makes a bit of sense to us. When I believed I at least understood this. &lt;strong&gt;You must reason with us.&lt;/strong&gt; That's right. You must reason with us. Show us why we should believe the Bible, for instance, don't just quote it to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next time you think of telling us to have faith just picture an orthodox Jew saying that same thing to you, okay? Does this do any good to you as an outsider? The next time you think of quoting the Bible just picture a Mormon quoting a passage from the Book of Mormon, okay? How does that feel? Does it do any good? And the next time you think to tell us we'll know the truth when we die just picture a Muslim saying the same thing to you, okay? Saying these kinds of things has no affect whatsoever on you as an outsider, so why do you try that with us?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[As an aside, if there is no afterlife then no one will ever know we were right about it when they die because in order to know we were right they would have to regain consciousness, which, if we're right cannot happen.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_friday_lab_t.php" title=""&gt;Museum tour&lt;/a&gt; and dropping by Radisson briefly to see who else has arrived in the meantime, I went home to see the family and walk the reconvalesecent dog for a few minutes (thus choosing to miss &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/the_friday_fermentable/" title=""&gt;Friday Fermentable&lt;/a&gt; except for the last few minutes), then back to &lt;a href="http://www.sigmaxi.org/index.shtml" title=""&gt;Sigma Xi&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="http://www.duke.edu/web/wise/jannetworkingevent.html" title=""&gt;WiSE networking event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="WiSE 1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/WiSE%201.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="WiSE 4.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/WiSE%204.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="WiSE 5 Erica.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/WiSE%205%20Erica.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place was packed (my estimate - 300 people) with women in science and engineering from local universities (Duke, NCSU, UNC, NCCU and others) as well as many participants of &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline09&lt;/a&gt;.  This was an opportunity for local women in science not just to meet and network with each other (they can do that often as they are all local), but also to meet some of their superstar heroes they know only from the online world and who, just so happens, were in town that night. And in some cases, it was in reverse - guests from far away getting to meet their Triangle heroes, for instance when Erik, one of &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/" title=""&gt;Miss Baker's students&lt;/a&gt; sought out and found his hero - &lt;a href="http://lemurhealth.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Meredith Barrett&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stacysflickr/3203062122/" title=""&gt;picture by&lt;/a&gt; Miss Baker) - hard to tell which one of them was more excited about the meeting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Erik meets Meredith.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Erik%20meets%20Meredith.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high point of the evening was the talk by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish/" title=""&gt;Rebecca Skloot&lt;/a&gt; about the origin of HeLa cells, ubiqutous tools in cell biology and cancer research, and the difficult process of writing &lt;a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~rskloot/index_HeLa.htm" title=""&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; about this. The talk was edge-of-the-seat gripping and quite thought-provoking with several layers of ethical issues involved: the ethics of the doctors who took the cells from Henrietta Lacks, the ethics of scientists who started using the cells, the ethics of business that produce and sell the HeLa cells, the ethics of interviewing the family and writing her book, and the ethical question of what to do with the proceeds and whatever moral obligation the scientific community may have towards the descendants of Henrietta Lacks. It is a mind-boggling case for legal scholars and ethicists to ponder, and quite an eye-opener for the biomedical research community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="WiSE 2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/WiSE%202.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="WiSE 3.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/WiSE%203.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the talk, and schmoozing over delicious chocolate cake a little more, we went over to the hotel, where Ocean Bloggers, with funny hats, were singing shanties....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Radisson Friday 3.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Radisson%20Friday%203.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Nature Network bloggers meetup, with guests, was at the next table - it just looks serene because of the contrast with the marine rambunctiousness next door...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Radisson Friday 4.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Radisson%20Friday%204.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Blog_and_Media_Coverage/" title=""&gt;blog/media coverage linkfest&lt;/a&gt; is growing fast (perhaps start at the bottom and work your way up, posting comments on the way), there are ongoing discussions on &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/scienceonline09" title=""&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; and new pictures on &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/scio09/" title=""&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_friday_morni.php" title=""&gt;coffee cupping&lt;/a&gt;, still pretty frozen, we went back to Radisson to see who else has arrived for &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline09&lt;/a&gt; in the meantime. I set up my temporary field Headquarters in the lobby (photo by &lt;a href="http://eronel.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Lenore&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="My Radisson HQ.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/My%20Radisson%20HQ.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick lunch, it was time for &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Lab_Tours/" title=""&gt;Lab Tours&lt;/a&gt; (check &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Blog_and_Media_Coverage/" title=""&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/scio09/" title=""&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; for other people's experiences).  A bunch of us went to the &lt;a href="http://naturalsciences.org/" title=""&gt;NC Museum of Natural Sciences&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href="http://www.naturalsciences.org/cgi-bin/staffd_read.pl?order_by=last&amp;amp;order=abc&amp;amp;page=1" title=""&gt;Roy Campbell, the Director of Exhibits&lt;/a&gt;, gave us a fantastic whirlwind tour through the Museum and the vaults, the secret basement chambers that general public cannot access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="NCMNS - 2 Roy on map.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/NCMNS%20-%202%20Roy%20on%20map.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="NCMNS - 1 map.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/NCMNS%20-%201%20map.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been going to the Museum for 17 years now, pretty regularly (I used to volunteer there when it was still in the old building), yet I always notice something new, some new detail or improvement they made since the last time I visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="NCMNS - 3.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/NCMNS%20-%203.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="NCMNS - 4.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/NCMNS%20-%204.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty big group - if I remember correctly (and it's all a blur now), we had &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/ord/" title=""&gt;Melissa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lablogatorios.com.br/rastrodecarbono/" title=""&gt;Paula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://access.aasd.k12.wi.us/Staff/Hoffman/Wpress/" title=""&gt;Elissa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/news/" title=""&gt;Robyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://carpenterlibraryknowledgesharing.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Molly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.radford.edu/~kgainer/" title=""&gt;Kim&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://www.nr.edu/" title=""&gt;Patty&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://biochemicalsoul.com/" title=""&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.osti.gov/ostiblog/home/" title=""&gt;Sol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://medialab.sissa.it/index_en.htm" title=""&gt;Enrico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lablogatorios.com.br/brontossauros/" title=""&gt;Carlos&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the entire contingent from &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/" title=""&gt;Miss Baker's class&lt;/a&gt; - eight students, two parents and Miss Baker &lt;a href="http://blogging4biology.edublogs.org/" title=""&gt;herself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="NCMNS - 5.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/NCMNS%20-%205.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="NCMNS - 6.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/NCMNS%20-%206.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is no group big enough or rowdy enough to get Roy off his game.  The Museum is enormous, and I don't think there is anyone in the world but Roy who is capable of giving a tour of it in just two hours and covering everything and going everywhere and saying so much interesting stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure that the visit to the palaeontology lab (where an amazingly well preserved and &lt;b&gt;complete&lt;/b&gt; skeleton of a bipedal crocodile was being cleaned) and the vaults was the greatest hit with the group:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="NCMNS - 7.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/NCMNS%20-%207.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me, the most exciting was a brief look through one of the windows, onto the lot next door, where the bulldozers were hard at work digging a big hole - for the new wing of the Museum, as big as the main building, or so it appearrs.  And that new wing - now THAT'S going to be exciting and unique, but you will have to read this blog for some time in the future until you get to hear the entire story once it becomes public....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_friday_lab_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/wnzQyD_7HuI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232771583754"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/what_is_sciences_rightful_plac.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0ec4b805c6810406</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Society"/><title type="html">What is science's rightful place?</title><published>2009-01-23T03:07:04Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T03:07:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/ygq_Ms8XKxY/what_is_sciences_rightful_plac.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/what_is_sciences_rightful_plac.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/rightfulplace.php" title=""&gt;the question&lt;/a&gt; that Seed is asking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Restoring science to its rightful place in government and in society will be no simple task: it will demand fresh ideas, the engagement of America's scientists and engineers, the re-engagement of the public, and the collaboration of other cultural and social communities. It will not happen overnight, but we will witness in 2009 a U-turn back to the future. History will call this the birth of our scientific renaissance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you are all encouraged to respond, in any format you like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Seed and SEEDMAGAZINE.COM have invited responses to the question from friends and contributors around the country. Here on ScienceBlogs, we seek to involve the entire scientific community in the United States. We want scientists and engineers from coast to coast to respond to the question:

&lt;p&gt;What is science's rightful place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responses can be submitted in any format (text, audio, video, or image) and will be displayed here, at www.scienceblogs.com/rightfulplace.php. Please send them to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;responses@rightfulplace.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking about my own response, to be posted on this blog in the near future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/what_is_sciences_rightful_plac.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ygq_Ms8XKxY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232771583754"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/bruce_alberts_next_friday_at_d.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/62cc609bd10b9fe9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academia"/><title type="html">Bruce Alberts, next Friday at Duke</title><published>2009-01-23T02:44:22Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T02:44:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/gVcfgc1JzIY/bruce_alberts_next_friday_at_d.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/bruce_alberts_next_friday_at_d.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.scied.duke.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=15" title=""&gt;Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

And then I want to promote, promote, promote until everybody and their mother reads that blog. Here is the latest brilliant discovery I made - &lt;a href="http://fyiscience.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;FYI: Science!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out some of the first posts, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://fyiscience.wordpress.com/2009/01/19/of-pedigrees-and-people/" title=""&gt;Of pedigrees and people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;....But those mutations have to come from somewhere... specifically, my parents.

&lt;p&gt;So my parents had to know about all of this. I sat them down and explained everything to them.  I drew them a pedigree of our family history.  And, for the first time that I can remember, my mom looked at me and said, "So this is why that biology degree is useful."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, my dad is a carrier of a mutated gene (meaning he has 1 copy) and my mom also has two copies of the mutated gene.  She's being treated for some of the issues that go along with hemochromatosis and is doing well.  I explained everything to my sister, who promptly went to her doctor's office bearing a copy of the pedigree I'd drawn.  (He loved it - he said it was the first time a patient had ever brought him a pedigree.) She, like my dad, is a carrier - she has 1 copy of the gene. Neither my dad nor my sister will have issues with the disease.  My mom and I will be monitored, and hopefully that will be enough to let us lead long, healthy lives....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://fyiscience.wordpress.com/2009/01/21/throw-another-maggot-on-the-barbie-mate/" title=""&gt;Throw another maggot on the barbie, mate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;.....Their hamburgers arrived, and as they were chatting, Brad noticed a large fly some distance away.  (Being an entomologist, he noticed these things.) They continued to chat and eat, and he found his eyes darting back to the fly every few seconds.  The fly was heading towards them, and as it neared, he found himself impressed by the size of the fly.  It was large even for Australian standards.  As he lifted the hamburger to his mouth for another bite, the fly flew straight towards him.  When it was about a meter away, the fly actually turned around midair - and a giant stream of maggots shot out of the fly's rear end towards his hamburger.

&lt;p&gt;Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian scientist was amused, but not as startled as Brad! He explained that this species of fly needed meat in which to lay its eggs.  If it did not find meat in time, the eggs would hatch inside the mother's abdomen and begin eating her from the inside out.  This resulted in a certain desperation on the mother's part, so she'd aim them at anything that gave off the scent of meat.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://fyiscience.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/pcr-when-you-need-to-find-out-who-the-daddy-is/" title=""&gt;PCR - when you need to find out who the daddy is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;.....In this era of "CSI" and other crime investigation shows, many people think that forensic science is easy, fast, and available for every crime.  Of course, this isn't the case.  Forensic science is neither easy nor fast, and DNA evidence just is not always possible... there aren't always nice neat bits of bodily evidence that can be used to track down a suspect or victim.

&lt;p&gt;When there is bodily evidence, though, what exactly is it that investigators do with it? Sometimes there is just a tiny bit of blood, DNA, or hair - certainly not enough for investigation, and it's certainly not as if you can just run to Target to get more DNA!....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, go there, look around, bookmark and subscribe. It looks like great fun!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/blogrolling_fyi_science.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/w7so43nxJv4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232771583753"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/the_super_secret_strategy_for.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ff1d2e657757f3ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Time"/><title type="html">The super secret strategy for science blogging around the clock</title><published>2009-01-23T01:12:02Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T01:12:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/IGVxocDOefM/the_super_secret_strategy_for.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/the_super_secret_strategy_for.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You need &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?ref=sr_gallery_11&amp;amp;listing_id=18304459" title=""&gt;this clock&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In college, one lecture class has about 250 students in it and the information goes by really fast. We would cover about 3 chapters in an hour, about three days a week. At first it took me a while to get used to the speed and the way the professors taught. In high school, the teachers are very careful about making sure the students understand and take in the subject but in college, the professors don't really care whether you're in class or not. This realization hit me like a ton of bricks because finally, after years of supervision from teachers and parents, it was all up to me (and only me) to make sure I do well.

&lt;p&gt;The freedom to do whatever I wanted was quite overwhelming. I had to learn to discipline myself to keep up with the readings and to make sure that I knew the information and to not spend too much time playing. However, if you go to lecture and take good notes, it's not that hard (Duh). At first the fact that the responsibility is ALL yours scares the heck out of you, but eventually you'll learn to deal with it and have fun in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful for college professors to know how freshmen feel! While many faculty are experimenting with &lt;a href="http://cit.duke.edu/blog/2009/01/13/active-learning/" title=""&gt;better methods&lt;/a&gt;, the typical large class, one-to-many lecture is still the dominant mode of interaction between faculty and freshmen, who could easily fall through the cracks without anyone noticing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the rest of the post as well for some fun, and more positive stuff, including the appearance of a researcher I know and whose research I value highly.... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/great_advice_for_incoming_coll.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/g5qBD97Nq1Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232771583752"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_friday_morni.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc27e83f964c653a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SO'09"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline'09 - Friday Morning Coffee Cupping</title><published>2009-01-22T18:36:28Z</published><updated>2009-01-22T18:36:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/_nXsJMMhWp4/scienceonline09_-_friday_morni.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_friday_morni.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="scienceonline09.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scienceonline09.jpg" width="355" height="175"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday morning was really, really cold (for North Carolina), so what better way to start off &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline09&lt;/a&gt; than at &lt;a href="http://www.counterculturecoffee.com/" title=""&gt;Counter Culture Coffee&lt;/a&gt; where about 25 or so participants (and several other people - this is an open event) showed up bright and early to learn about the science (and business) of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%201.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 6 - Henry and Janet.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%206%20-%20Henry%20and%20Janet.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 9 - Viktor, Bob and Cameron.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%209%20-%20Viktor%2C%20Bob%20and%20Cameron.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee is one of those things that you just drink, unthinkingly, at the time of the morning when it is hard to think anyway. So this was quite an eye-opener - learning what happens between the moment the coffee plant is planted and the moment when you taste the coffee.  And there are many steps in-between, and each step involves hard decisions as to how to do it as everything can affect the taste of coffee in the end: where to plant, how to plant, when and how to harvest, how to process it after harvesting, how to ship and store the beans, how to roast it, how to prepare the coffee. And we saw the process as well as learned about the effects of different geographies and practices on the final experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 7.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%207.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 8.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%208.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 10 - Diana.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2010%20-%20Diana.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hosts presented us with three different 'mystery' coffees. First, we smelled the dry, freshly ground beans. Then we smelled it as soon as the hot water was poured over it.  Then we smelled it at the exact moment when we broke the layer of foam that formed on the surface (and that can be a STRONG burst of aroma!). Then we tasted one spoonful of coffee.  Then we waited about half-a-minute and evaluated the aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 12 - Paul sniffing.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2012%20-%20Paul%20sniffing.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 5 - Paul Jones.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%205%20-%20Paul%20Jones.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 11 - Danielle, Enrico, Brazilians.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2011%20-%20Danielle%2C%20Enrico%2C%20Brazilians.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each of those steps we tried to do what is probably the hardest part of the exercise - translate the olfactory associations into words. Smell, the oldest sense, the only one that does not get pre-processed in the thalamus before getting processed in the cortex, is incredibly difficult to describe with language - it affects our emotions more than our rationality. It is hard to 'classify' smells in any meaningful way. So, it is not a surprise that some of the descriptions of coffee aromas spoken in the room on Friday took quite a flight of fancy, e.g., "barbequing in the forest", "dirty baby diapers" and "deflated inflatable kid's toys heated by the Sun out in the yard"....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 4 - Arikia.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%204%20-%20Arikia.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 3 - cat herder.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%203%20-%20cat%20herder.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 13 - Henry.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2013%20-%20Henry.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tasting, we were shown the rest of facility, including the stacks of bags of coffee, from all around the world, all of it either certified organic, or uncertified but known to be organic anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 17 - storehouse.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2017%20-%20storehouse.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 16 - bag of coffee.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2016%20-%20bag%20of%20coffee.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we were shown the process of coffee roasting. You start with a barrel of unroasted coffee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 18 - unroasted.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2018%20-%20unroasted.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after testing a small batch, decide which one of the three different roasting machines to use, at which temperature, etc.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 19 - roasting machine.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2019%20-%20roasting%20machine.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 20 - roasting machine 2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2020%20-%20roasting%20machine%202.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What comes out is a barrel of roasted coffee, ready for grinding and turning into delicious liquid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 21 - roasted.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2021%20-%20roasted.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have to admit, I came to this event with a whole set of handicaps.  First, I am, unlike some other bloggers, incapable of writing poetry or even creative fiction.  Thus, my verbal descriptions of coffee smells were quite technical and prosaic, unlike some I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 14 - Cameron and Anton.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2014%20-%20Cameron%20and%20Anton.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, where I come from, the only liquid that can be called coffee is Turkish coffee.  Espresso is frowned upon as "too quick", thin and weak. Everything else is derogatorily called "instant coffee", to be served only in hospitals.  I have never heard of a concept of decaf before I came to the USA.  So, for me, the American coffee is just a very rarely used caffeine delivery device, when I need a really fast, strong and short-lived boost of the drug and nothing else is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Counter Culture 15.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Counter%20Culture%2015.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I want to enjoy the taste coffee, I fix myself a Turkish coffee (OK, French Roast will do in a pinch), or have a coffee cake, or get a Mocca. So, trying to figure out the differences between three types of liquids that I barely ever drink was not easy - I was quite a novice.  Not that I could not make distinctions between them, but it just not do for me what it did to regular American coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, after two hours of talking, thinking, smelling and tasting coffee on a very chilly morning, it would have been nice to actually drink a cup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/01/28/19autism.h28.html?tmp=2140693104"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; is about the recent resignation of now-former executive vice president for communications and outreach for &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt; Alison Tepper Singer from that organization. Singer &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_curious_incident_of_the_iacc_vaccines_and_autism_speaks"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; the night before she was to cast a vote concerning the recommendations for research on autism spectrum disorders in the Strategic Plan of the &lt;a href="http://iacc.hhs.gov/"&gt;Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee&lt;/a&gt;. Noting her "concerns" about Autism Speaks' policy towards research on vaccines and citing the numerous studies that have refuted a vaccine-autism link, Singer stated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe we must devote limited funding to more promising areas of autism research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't too long ago that it was widely believed that autism was caused by bad parenting, by "&lt;a href="http://www.fanlight.com/catalog/films/346_rm.php"&gt;refrigerator mothers&lt;/a&gt;" who withdrew from their children and failed to bond with them. Today, so many seem to think, or say they think, that vaccines or something in vaccines is linked to autism: Sometimes it seems that you can already hear future generations saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now how in the world could people believe that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While I agree with some of its points, the overall conclusion that &amp;quot;Building a business exclusively on top of another service is irresponsible and naïve.&amp;quot; is flat out wrong. I always laugh when I hear stuff like that and think &amp;quot;tell it to &lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/08/26/mob-wars-the-million-dollar-a-month-independent-facebook-app-may-legally-belong-to-sgn/"&gt;the guy who made Mob Wars&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; He’s making (irresponsibly and naively I guess) millions per year exclusively on top of another service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in the Facebook App business now, I sort of know what the author is talking about. You do have to be ever-mindful of the fact that you’re playing in somebody else’s back yard. You’re playing by their rules, and are totally at their mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it can be worth it because there are a few mitigating factors. For one, their interest and yours are usually at least somewhat aligned. Facebook’s success is in no small part due to their platform. It’s expanded the utility of what would otherwise be little more than a place to cyberstalk people (which granted, is popular in its own right) into what is now a place to cyberstalk people and play games. It’s doubled in usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An application platform doesn’t want to run off all of its developers. Even though they sometimes seem capricious and arbitrary, you can be reasonably certain they’re not going to screw you for no good reason. They can, of course, or they can screw you for a good reason, so it’s a risk factor you certainly should be mindful of. But it’s not as bad as it sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that risk factor, in the case of some of the more popular platforms, is made up for overwhelmingly by the platform itself. With Facebook or Myspace, you have the ability to grow rapidly and virally, much more easily than you would on the net. Our most recent game, Football Tycoon, has grown to over 50,000 users in about two months, and is gaining a significant chunk of new ones each day. That’s something that just wouldn’t have been doable as a standalone website due to the lack of a compelling invite system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An iPhone app can take advantage of the app store’s distribution network to sell or give away millions of copies in no time. A Twitter app can leverage the intense engagement users have with the service to quickly build a product that thousands of people will love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just a matter of risk and reward. You’re taking the risk of your overlord making changes that aversely affect you, but you’re gaining the reward of virality, distribution, or engagement. It’s a tradeoff to be sure, but not one that isn’t sometimes worth making, or that is patently irresponsible or naïve, so long as you’re mindful of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232758408123"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/23/m-o-o-n-that-spells-tattoo/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/00aa3b599f072942</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">M-O-O-N, that spells tattoo</title><published>2009-01-24T00:43:57Z</published><updated>2009-01-24T00:43:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/23/m-o-o-n-that-spells-tattoo/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any tattoos, but if I were to get one, this would be tempting:&lt;/p&gt;

It's a short and shallow (but relatively broad) look at the recent history of the disability rights movement in the U.S.  From the exhibit description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing struggle by people with disabilities to gain full citizenship is an important part of our American heritage. The disability rights movement shares many similarities with other 20th-century civil rights struggles by those who have been denied equality, independence, autonomy, and full access to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibition looks at the efforts - far from over - of people with disabilities, and their families and friends, to secure the civil rights guaranteed to all Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism is not referenced specifically (intellectual disability is), but many of the themes in exhibit are shared by the autistic rights movement.  Issues of identity, of human rights, of civil disobedience, of institutionalization, of eugenics, of right to access and the role of assistive technology, and yes even the work done by parents to demand an education for their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt this exhibit will be very enlightening to those of us who are currently living the work "exhibited" (yes indeed, those efforts are "far from over") but it is, I feel, a good sign that the exhibit is there at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web pages are pretty accessible with clear descriptions of images and audio playback on many of the pages, but I felt the user interface was rather confusing.  I recommend just using the "next" buttons to navigate through the whole exhibit if you find the rest of the user interface clunky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010624_2045"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3299/3220080755_5fef9ddcf8.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crater is about 300 meters across (as usual, click the picture to embiggenatrize it), and is covered with boulders. That indicates it’s pretty fresh, because after time the boulders get eroded or blown away (though some are 10 meters across!). You see the splash pattern around it too, again indicating relative youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I zoomed in on the crater, though, and took a look, I was surprised to see it looking back at me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3220932302/in/photostream"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3220932302_0c91bdd0e9_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it’s my mind playing tricks on me, because it doesn’t look like Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up with HiRISE and all the amazing pictures it takes, your best bet is &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/HiRISE"&gt;to follow it on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.

He has a &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/booksarts/story.html?id=1e3851a3-bdf7-438a-ac2a-a5e381a70472"&gt;substantial piece in The New Republic&lt;/a&gt; that is both a review of two recent books by theistic scientists, Karl Giberson (who really &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/karl_giberson_strikes_back.php"&gt;detests me&lt;/a&gt;) and Ken Miller, and a definite warning shot across the bows of those who believe science and religion can be reconciled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s consider the reviews of the two books — they&amp;#39;re less interesting, not because they&amp;#39;re poorly done, but because Coyne&amp;#39;s opinion is almost identical to mine. The main point is that both books shine when they&amp;#39;re taking on the misconceptions of the creationists, but are weak and unconvincing whenever they move on to religious apologetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giberson and Miller are thoughtful men of good will. Reading them, you get a sense of conviction and sincerity absent from the writings of many creationists, who blatantly deny the most obvious facts about nature in the cause of their faith. Both of their books are worth reading: Giberson for the history of the creation/ evolution debate, and Miller for his lucid arguments against intelligent design. Yet in the end they fail to achieve their longed-for union between faith and evolution. And they fail for the same reason that people always fail: a true harmony between science and religion requires either doing away with most people's religion and replacing it with a watered-down deism, or polluting science with unnecessary, untestable, and unreasonable spiritual claims.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Although Giberson and Miller see themselves as opponents of creationism, in devising a compatibility between science and religion they finally converge with their opponents. In fact, they exhibit at least three of the four distinguishing traits of creationists: belief in God, the intervention of God in nature, and a special role for God in the evolution of humans. They may even show the fourth trait, a belief in irreducible complexity, by proposing that a soul could not have evolved, but was inserted by God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last paragraph in particular sounds like &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/"&gt;Larry Moran&lt;/a&gt;, who puts the &lt;a href="http://bioinfo.med.utoronto.ca/Evolution_by_Accident/Theistic_Evolution.html"&gt;theistic evolutionists on the same non-science side as the creationists&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s going to grate on the authors, I&amp;#39;m sure, because both have clearly been strongly outspoken against creationism, and I don&amp;#39;t doubt the sincerity or honesty of either in their repudiation of creationism in any of its Intelligent Design, young earth, or old earth flavors, but they are both pushing a different flavor, a kind of weak tea flavored brand of theistic babble that is notable only its reliance on a diffuse vagueness instead of strong claims about the nature of the universe. They are equivalent in being equally unsupportable. They are equivalent in requiring their proponents to walk away from evidence and rigor in order to suggest that a peculiar entity was critical in creating the universe, life, and humanity — while at the same time, Miller and Giberson at least declaim the importance of scientific thinking honestly (the creationists who are a real problem also declaim the importance of science &lt;i&gt;dishonestly&lt;/i&gt;, as they are doing their best to consciously undermine it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also thought their unfortunate praise for superstitious dogma was the key flaw in both books — and their attempts to pin the blame for creationism on secularism instead of religion was disingenuous at best. The same could be said for another author with excellent scientific credentials, Francis Collins, who was even more outrageous in the way his logic lapsed whenever he introduced his deity into the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criticizing an unfortunate turn in their books is one thing, but Coyne wins his New Atheist oak leaf cluster for taking it one step further, and making the case that religion and science are antagonistic. Readers here will know that this is also a view I share, and that I also think this pattern of trotting out yet more scientists who go to church is growing old. It does not argue that science and religion are compatible at all — all the coincidence of these ideas in single individuals tells us is that human beings are entirely capable of holding mutually incompatible ideas in their heads at the same time. The question is not whether a person is capable of swiveling between the church pew and the lab bench, but whether religion can tolerate scientific scrutiny, and whether science can thrive under dogma. I say the answer is no. Coyne agrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would appear, then, that one cannot be coherently religious and scientific at the same time. That alleged synthesis requires that with one part of your brain you accept only those things that are tested and supported by agreed-upon evidence, logic, and reason, while with the other part of your brain you accept things that are unsupportable or even falsified. In other words, the price of philosophical harmony is cognitive dissonance. Accepting both science and conventional faith leaves you with a double standard: rational on the origin of blood clotting, irrational on the Resurrection; rational on dinosaurs, irrational on virgin births. Without good cause, Giberson and Miller pick and choose what they believe. At least the young-earth creationists are consistent, for they embrace supernatural causation across the board. With his usual flair, the physicist Richard Feynman characterized this difference: "Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." With religion, there is just no way to know if you are fooling yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So the most important conflict—the one ignored by Giberson and Miller—is not between religion and science. It is between religion and secular reason. Secular reason includes science, but also embraces moral and political philosophy, mathematics, logic, history, journalism, and social science—every area that requires us to have good reasons for what we believe. Now I am not claiming that all faith is incompatible with science and secular reason—only those faiths whose claims about the nature of the universe flatly contradict scientific observations. Pantheism and some forms of Buddhism seem to pass the test. But the vast majority of the faithful—those 90 percent of Americans who believe in a personal God, most Muslims, Jews, and Hindus, and adherents to hundreds of other faiths—fall into the &amp;quot;incompatible&amp;quot; category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coyne is admitting something that most of the scientists I've talked to (and I'll openly confess that that is definitely a biased sample) agree on: &lt;i&gt;we don't believe, and we find no virtue in faith&lt;/i&gt;. At the same time, we&amp;#39;re struggling with an under- and mis-educated population that believes faith is far more important than reason. So what most scientists do is keep as quiet as possible about it all, or fall under the spell of &amp;#39;framing&amp;#39;…that is, lying about their position. That is changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disharmony is a dirty little secret in scientific circles. It is in our personal and professional interest to proclaim that science and religion are perfectly harmonious. After all, we want our grants funded by the government, and our schoolchildren exposed to real science instead of creationism. Liberal religious people have been important allies in our struggle against creationism, and it is not pleasant to alienate them by declaring how we feel. This is why, as a tactical matter, groups such as the National Academy of Sciences claim that religion and science do not conflict. But their main evidence—the existence of religious scientists—is wearing thin as scientists grow ever more vociferous about their lack of faith. Now Darwin Year is upon us, and we can expect more books like those by Kenneth Miller and Karl Giberson. Attempts to reconcile God and evolution keep rolling off the intellectual assembly line. It never stops, because the reconciliation never works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a way to make it stop, though…at least I believe it will work. And that is to stop hiding the facts, and show people that secular reasoning works and is far superior to faith-based delusions. Science will not and cannot adopt religious thinking without being destroyed, but citizens can learn about the power of secular reasoning, and become stronger and better people for it. That&amp;#39;s where our attention should be focused, not on trying to reconcile science with its antithesis, but on getting everyone to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do have one quibble with the article. In it, Coyne defines four common traits of all creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But regardless of their views, all creationists share four traits. First, they devoutly believe in God. No surprise there, except to those who think that ID has a secular basis. Second, they claim that God miraculously intervened in the development of life, either creating every species from scratch or intruding from time to time in an otherwise Darwinian process. Third, they agree that one of these interventions was the creation of humans, who could not have evolved from apelike ancestors. This, of course, reflects the Judeo-Christian view that humans were created in God's image. Fourth, they all adhere to a particular argument called "irreducible complexity." This is the idea that some species, or some features of some species, are too complex to have evolved in a Darwinian manner, and must therefore have been designed by God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true for the vast majority of creationists, but it isn't quite universal. I know a few &lt;i&gt;atheist&lt;/i&gt; creationists, and they are just as incoherent as the necessary conflict between the two terms in that phrase implies. They do exist, however. There is a subset of creationists who are more like radical denialists: they reject evolution &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; the majority of scientists accept it, or in some cases because they are so egotistical that they reject anything they didn't think of first, or because they have some other wild hypothesis that they have seized upon, or because, frankly, they're nuts. Coyne's generalization may be accurate in 99% of all cases, and is certainly true for the leadership of the creationist movements in the US, but saying "all" opens up the idea to trivial refutation when the DI makes a sweep of the local insane asylums or trots out David Berlinski to pontificate supinely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/coyne_on_the_compatibility_of.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/fRqHOSDlA4Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232745001962"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/say_hello_with_a_sneer_and_an.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/32b51d20629fd3a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weblogs"/><title type="html">Say hello with a sneer and an attitude…</title><published>2009-01-23T20:47:45Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T20:47:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/FWfOUy6AgWc/say_hello_with_a_sneer_and_an.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/say_hello_with_a_sneer_and_an.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;…to our new colleague, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/"&gt;Science Punk&lt;/a&gt;.

Incidentally, and probably not coincidentally, Jekyll was written by Steven Moffat, the new show runner for the good Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

I discovered to my surprise that the article is online, but, probably because almost no one reads creationist articles, no one had commented on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wise basically gives away the whole game by conceding that the fossil record does contain numerous examples of transitional series bridging major transitions.  His only qualm is in the very small species-to-species transitions where (like Gould, his PhD advisor) he says the fossil record has a more punctuated pattern. (As far as I’ve heard, scientific meta-analyses are about split 50-50 across various groups about whether the fossil record is punctuated or smooth at this level; at any rate, these small differences between species should be irrelevant to creationists, since this level of change is well within the “microevolution within a kind” (usually a taxonomic family or so) which creationists readily accept.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A scanned PDF of the article is &lt;a href="http://www.bryancore.org/anniversary/building.html" rel="external "&gt;online here&lt;/a&gt;.  Click the “Ape-men, bird-lizards, and walking whales” circle and a link to the article comes up.  After reading the article, one can’t help saying, “Why don’t you just GIVE UP already!!”  Of course, we know the reason why: Kurt Wise has forthrightly stated that his adherence to Biblical literalism comes first, and if the physical evidence is against creationism, so much the worse for the evidence.  This is why Richard Dawkins dubbed Wise “&lt;a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/dawkins_21_4.html" rel="external "&gt;an honest creationist&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A passage from the article below the fold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[p. 218]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In various macroevolutionary models, stratomorphic intermediates might be expected to be any one or more of several different forms: –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) &lt;strong&gt;inter-specific stratomorphic intermediates;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) &lt;strong&gt;stratomorphic intermediate species;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(c} &lt;strong&gt;higher-taxon stratomorphic intermediates;&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(d) &lt;strong&gt;stratomorphic [intermediate] series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example (and to provide informal definitions), if predictions from Darwin’s theory were re-stated in these terms, one would expect to find: –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) numerous stratomorphic intermediates between any ancestor-descendent species pair (numerous interspecific stratomorphic intermediates);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) species which were stratomorphic intermediates between larger groups (stratomorphic intermediate species);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(c} taxonomic groups above the level of species which were stratomorphic intermediates between other pairs of groups (higher-taxon stratomorphic intermediates); and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(d) a sequence of species or higher taxa in a sequence where each taxon is a stratomorphic intermediate between the taxa stratigraphically below and above it (stratomorphic series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this vocabulary as a beginning, the traditional transitional forms issue can be gradually transformed into a non-traditional form, more suitable to the creationist
researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is a Very Good Evolutionary Argument&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Darwinism’s four stratomorphic intermediate expectations, that of the commonness of inter-specific stratomorphic intermediates has been the most disappointing for classical Darwinists. The current lack of any certain inter-specific stratomorphic intermediates has, of course, led to the development and increased acceptance of punctuated equilibrium theory. Evidences for Darwin’s second expectation - of stratomorphic intermediate species - include such species as &lt;em&gt;Baragwanathia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; (between rhyniophytes and lycopods), &lt;em&gt;Pikaia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; (between echinoderms and chordates), &lt;em&gt;Purgatorius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; (between the tree shrews and the primates), and &lt;em&gt;Proconsul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; (between the non-hominoid primates and the hominoids). Darwin’s third expectation - of higher-taxon stratomorphic intermediates - has been confirmed by such examples as the mammal-like reptile groups&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; between the reptiles and the mammals, and the phenacdontids&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; between the horses and their presumed ancestors. Darwin’s fourth expectation - of stratomorphic series - has been confirmed by such examples as the early bird series,&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; the tetrapod series,&lt;sup&gt;34,35&lt;/sup&gt; the whale series,&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; the various mammal series of the Cenozoic&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; (for example, the horse series, the camel series, the elephant series, the pig series, the titanothere series, etc.), the &lt;em&gt;Cantius&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[p. 219]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plesiadapus&lt;/em&gt; primate series,&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; and the hominid series.&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; Evidence for not just one but for all three of the species level and above types of stratomorphic intermediates expected by macroevolutionary theory is surely strong evidence for macroevolutionary theory. Creationists therefore need to accept this fact. It certainly CANNOT said that traditional creation theory expected (predicted) any of these fossil finds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fairness, Wise goes on to claim that this evidence is “explainable” under the creation model, postulating as an alternative the scientific model that “God created organisms according to His nature” (p. 219), which apparently leads to the expectation of “high homoplasy” – because God, I assume, likes homoplasy.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, from an archaeologist's point of view, there is one area of US law where science is sorely lacking. And in this case, it's not the second Bush administration's fault. Actually, this is an area where US law has lagged behind that of the rest of the developed world for as long as there has been a developed world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is science's rightful place in US cultural heritage management law? It should be &lt;i&gt;everywhere&lt;/i&gt;, while at present it is only really there on federally owned land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US constitution emphasises the rights and freedoms of the individual and of each state in the Union. Unfortunately, this means that in the US, the fate of an archaeological site threatened by land development depends, quite haphazardly, on who owns the land it's sitting on and in which state that land is located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the US needs, from the perspective of the science of archaeology, is a set of simple federal blanket laws to the effect that if someone wants to develop a piece of land with the slightest potential for an archaeological site on it, then the developer must pay for archaeological evaluation and possibly a rescue dig. This is how it works in most of Europe. Surely the mightiest country in the world can have no problem in attaining a similar level of protection for its cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/towards_strengthened_legal_pro.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/vH94lgkj5Ls" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232739624553"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/kuhnian_huns.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7e865d79d2e17139</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Kuhnian Huns</title><published>2009-01-21T13:20:25Z</published><updated>2009-01-21T13:20:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/YLSPoh--eeI/kuhnian_huns.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/01/kuhnian_huns.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in August I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/08/hardup_debater_appeals_to_kuhn.php"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about a manuscript where a scholar appealed to Thomas Kuhn's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift"&gt;old theory of paradigm shifts&lt;/a&gt; in order to evade criticism of their work. At the time I couldn't give the real details as I had received the manuscript in my capacity as journal editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/05/archaeological_fist_fights_in.php"&gt;said before&lt;/a&gt; that I consider it an editor's duty to correct muddle in debates, both in the interests of scientific advancement and to help contributors avoid looking silly. So I wrote to the scholar in question and asked her to work some more on her contribution, specifically to address more of her opponent's substantive arguments. I also suggested that her reference to Kuhnian paradigm shifts was a poor argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This author doesn't share my view on the matter, and &lt;ins&gt;I don't have editorial veto,&lt;/ins&gt; so the current issue of &lt;i&gt;Fornvännen&lt;/i&gt; (2008:4) contains a largely unaltered version of the original manuscript by &lt;a href="http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/om-instituttet/ansatte/vit/lotteh.xml"&gt;Lotte Hedeager&lt;/a&gt;, Chair of archaeology in Oslo, titled "Paradigm exposed: reply to Ulf Näsman". The issue at hand is not of course tomatoes in Neolithic Ireland: it's whether the Huns are likely to have ruled southern Scandinavia in the Migration Period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'However, &lt;a href="http://www2.hik.se/applikationer/forskningspresentation/researcher.aspx?culture=sv&amp;amp;personid=4757&amp;amp;PublicationListPageSize=0"&gt;Näsman&lt;/a&gt; makes a simple equation between data and historical fact by ruling out theory. A reply to his critique therefore requires an exposition of the two different academic approaches - or paradigms - involved, his and mine.'

&lt;p&gt;'Such a change of research paradigm took place in Scandinavian archaeology during the 1970s with forerunners in the 1960s, when a new so-called "processual", theoretical archaeology replaced, or rather supplemented, an empiricist, non-theoretical positivistic research tradition [...]. With the addition of a so-called "post-processual" paradigm from the 1980s onwards, we are now in a situation where practitioners of three different research paradigms still work side by side. This situation leads to competing and sometimes incommensurable interpretations of the past, and Ulf Näsman's critical comments on my article exemplify just that.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Ulf Näsman's critique of my &lt;em&gt;NAR&lt;/em&gt; paper exemplifies this paradigmatic difference of interpretation. This is already evident from the title, where he keeps "Scandinavia and the Huns", but replaces my subtitle with "A Source-Critical Approach to an Old Problem". It clearly signals two different paradigms: an objective, positivistic source-criticism is applied in order to deconstruct a theoretical, interdisciplinary interpretation combining history and archaeology. Näsman's paradigm demands that such bold, theory-based (and thus subjective) interpretations be confronted by restrained, objective source criticism. As a result we now have two completely different interpretations of the same data. One may ask, how wrong is it possible to be? Or is it the very concept of "right or wrong" that should be discussed?'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'To summarize: all of Näsman's "neutral" and "objective" interpretations of the empirical evidence are as solidly anchored in a subjective historical research paradigm as are mine. The main difference between us is his lack of theoretical reflection (or consciousness), and consequently his lack of insight into his own theoretical paradigm. While we share a fundamental respect for and knowledge of the empirical data base of the Iron Age, we approach the interpretation of that very same database in a fundamentally different way. In this our discussion highlights and exemplifies basic mechanisms of Kuhn's concept of research paradigms, not least their incommensurability.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat after me, please: "Poe. Moe.".&lt;/p&gt;

It is meant to point out some ways that people disempower self-advocates, as well as parent and professional advocates (by making similar statements about a parent's child or a professional's clients--while the writing takes the self-advocate's point of view, it can also be taken from the parent or professional's perspective).  Disempowering advocates is a practice  I strongly disapprove of.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BEGIN SATIRE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a pesky self-advocate (or parent or professional advocate) in your life who you really wish would just shut up?  Interested in making sure the needs and opinions of self-advocates are disregarded in policy and the community?  Then this is the guidebook for you!  You will find five excellent strategies for disempowering autistic self-advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy 1: &lt;br&gt;
Note how because of social or communication impairments, there's no way the self-advocate (or parent or professional) could know what they (or their child or client) are talking about.  Two wonderful ways of working this strategy are 1) telling the self-advocate they are too "low functioning" or "impaired" to understand what they are saying, and/or 2) pointing out how the self-advocate is missing critical social information and therefore can't possibly understand what is "really" going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy 2: &lt;br&gt;
Note how because the self-advocate is able to advocate for their needs at all, they are not "really" autistic.  This one is easy, "the fact that you [did advocacy thing] means you are obviously very 'high functioning.'  You couldn't possibly understand the needs of people who are really affected by autism."  This is particularly effective for invalidating the experiences of self-advocates who struggle considerably in their day to day life.  Feel free to copy and paste!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy 3: &lt;br&gt;
Resort to pity.  If the first two strategies don't work, tell others how sad the self-advocate is.  Be sure to highlight that any self-worth the self-advocate appears to possess is merely a lie they tell themselves in order to feel better about the tragedy of their suffering.  It's so sad.  You're only trying to help, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy 4:&lt;br&gt;
Redirect the conversation, or focus on irrelevant details.  If you want to not only disempower the self-advocate but drive them completely nuts as well, this is the strategy for you!  Don't respond to what the self-advocate has communicated; instead respond to something they didn't communicate, or focus on something that was obviously not the point they made but serves your goals much better.  This is great for those self-advocates who don't rattle easily.  As some people on the spectrum have difficulty with indirect communication, this strategy could leave them in a state of acute upset and confusion for days!  During which time they won't be doing any pesky self-advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy 5:&lt;br&gt;
Mix and match!  Sometimes just one strategy alone isn't enough.  If you can invalidate someone's experience by both pointing out their severe social impairment and their obvious lack of disability in the same sentence, you can provoke almost as much confusion and upset as responding to something the self-advocate never said.  If the self-advocate communicated something especially reasonable, don't be shy about redirecting your response to something the self-advocate didn't communicate.  Bonus points for adding pity language--the thesaurus is your friend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;END SATIRE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those of you out there who are self-advocates, parent, or professional advocates, be aware that people may use these, or similar, tactics to try to silence you.  Don't let them do it.  Your experience IS valid, your needs ARE important, your voice IS heard, and your work IS important to us all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232735067225"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/23/spotty-conclusions-about-2012/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0c53cf3e6e373eb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Debunking"/><title type="html">Spotty conclusions about 2012</title><published>2009-01-23T18:01:50Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T18:01:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/23/spotty-conclusions-about-2012/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Via &lt;a href="http://www.astroengine.com/?p=3253"&gt;AstroEngine&lt;/a&gt; I just learned of something that is totally cool: &lt;a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/glossary/sunspotplotter.htm"&gt;an interactive sunspot tool&lt;/a&gt; that gives you a sunspot graph for any date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It queries a table of sunspot numbers on the Sun’s face (averaged over one month) and then plots it, with a time range of 5.5 years on either side, so you see one full 11 year sunspot cycle. The obvious thing to do is input your birthdate. I put in mine, and it’s smack dab in the middle of that particular cycle’s minimum. I mean right on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what this says about me. I’m guessing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have an interesting idea for this. A lot of people are all panicky over &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/category/2012/"&gt;December 2012&lt;/a&gt;, because a whole lot of folks are out there lying about it to make money (OK, some are honest, but still wrong, wrong wrong).  Some of these doomsayers are claiming the Sun will be blasting out flares at that time, and that could spell trouble on Earth. And yes, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a lot of flare activity around sunspot peak… but in general the largest and more energetic events happen well after the peak, by as much as a couple of years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest flares ever seen &lt;a href="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/hotshots/2003_11_04/"&gt;was on November 4, 2003&lt;/a&gt;. Put &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; date in the sunspot grapher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/01/sunspotgraph_nov42003.jpg" alt="Sunspots on Nov 4 2003"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s halfway down to the minimum! In fact, the Sun belched out numerous huge events that month, shocking solar astronomers. So while chances are good there will be plenty of solar activity at the peak of the next cycle, predicted to be in 2012, the real fun happens later than the doomcriers would have you think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the next few years, anytime you hear of a big flare, or people trying to tie earthquake activity to the Sun, or whatever, check out that graphing tool and get the actual information for yourself. You may find — gasp — that some people tend to exaggerate reality to promote non-reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232734963333"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/who_knew_the_job_would_be_so_e.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fd004ca4af4d7ce3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Who knew the job would be so easy?</title><published>2009-01-23T16:47:19Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T16:47:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Z_jFPVQWd_s/who_knew_the_job_would_be_so_e.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/who_knew_the_job_would_be_so_e.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Obama is about to &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28812519/"&gt;lift the gag order that prohibited federal funds going to international groups that performed abortions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has ordered a &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE50J88L20090121"&gt;review of all of Bush's last-minute policy acts&lt;/a&gt;, stopping them cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Obama is expected to loosen the restrictions [on stem cell research], which many researchers and advocates have complained severely set back work toward curing disease such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Okarma said Geron did not use any federal funding for its research, and that the Bush restrictions had "devastated the field."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something else, when an incoming president can, in his first week, simply say "no" to all the bad policies of the prior White House occupant and achieve great good. It's as if any idiot could do this job better than George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine it will get harder, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/who_knew_the_job_would_be_so_e.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Z_jFPVQWd_s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232734780907"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-3712318770119602309">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/db6e890fd124ef12</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">It took Ricky Gervais only one hour to become an atheist</title><published>2009-01-23T18:10:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T18:20:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/it-took-ricky-gervais-only-one-hour-to.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/3712318770119602309/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=3712318770119602309" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Watch the full story in this clip from Inside the Actors Studio, which, incidentally, is one of my favorite shows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good bit comes at four and a half minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Hat Tip: Friendly Atheist]</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232733874996"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/01/lottery_probabilities_and_clue.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/86629db923893264</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Bad Probability"/><title type="html">Lottery Probabilities and Clueless Reporters</title><published>2009-01-23T16:44:09Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T16:44:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/QbPw-jKjPxA/lottery_probabilities_and_clue.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/01/lottery_probabilities_and_clue.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; A simple, silly, but entertaining example of mathematical illiteracy by way of &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ippppa34Kqz8Ju3j7xI7_yQSt21wD95SDR8O0"&gt;the Associated Press:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- The odds are against something this odd. But a Nebraska Lottery official says there was no mistake: The same three numbers in Nebraska's Pick 3 lottery were drawn two nights in a row this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lottery spokesman Brian Rockey said one of two lottery computers that randomly generate numbers produced the numbers 1, 9 and 6 -- in that order -- for Monday night's Pick 3 drawing. Rockey says the next night, the lottery's other computer produced the same three numbers in the same sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The odds of such an occurrence? One in a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Close... Only off by three orders of magnitude...&lt;/p&gt;

They are excited to be among people who seem to think like they do, but often the newer members are not yet familiar with what skepticism is exactly. Not having been immersed in it long, they may lack the language to describe it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So I wrote this item, which is published on the &lt;a href="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/"&gt;Space City Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; blog, specifically for those Houstonians who may be new to skepticism, and who may not yet have a firm grasp of what exactly it’s all about. But as I was writing, I realized the possibility that not all Skepchick readers were old hats at this either. So I decided to cross-post the item here, just as a general reference for those who may be new to skepticism and new to Skepchick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is skepticism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy answer is, skepticism is doubt. Printed dictionaries and Internet dictionaries alike all define skepticism as something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . an attitude of doubt or a disposition to incredulity either in general or toward a particular object. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I suppose for a quicky definition that’s as good as any. I mean, it’s true skeptics tend not to believe things just because. They’re usually the ones saying things like, “Hold on a minute. I don’t think that’s right.” There very well seems to be a high level of doubt among skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is more to skepticism than having doubts about something. Doubt doesn’t imply any curiosity. It doesn’t address a desire to know, to be as certain as possible about a given idea or claim. It doesn’t hint at a process by which one can determine efficacy, accuracy, or even reality. At best, doubt can be said to be an element of skepticism, though if we say that, we must understand that doubt is not a &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; element of skepticism. One can certainly use skepticism without harboring any doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So skepticism is not just doubt. But what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine defines skepticism as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . . a provisional approach to claims. It is the application of reason to any and all ideas — no sacred cows allowed. In other words, skepticism is a method, not a position. . . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s the last part of that definition that I find most useful. Like science, &lt;strong&gt;skepticism is a method&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why science and skepticism are intrinsically tied. This is why many people use the terms interchangeably. The two methods are members of the same family. And they work pretty much the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific method is a method of discovery. Researchers observe a particular event or phenomenon, and set to gathering observable, empirical, and measurable evidence that explains the particular phenomenon. They propose hypotheses as explanations for the observed phenomenon, and design experimental studies to test those hypotheses. Through this observation and experimentation, and through stringent analysis of the data, they determine what is most probably true about the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, these steps must be repeatable in order to dependably predict any future results. If the experiments are not repeatable, they are discarded for other hypotheses and tests until the scientists &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; come to a conclusion about the particular phenomenon that is most probably true. It takes time and effort, but the rewards are great, and our level of understanding rises dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the scientific method is the single most valuable tool ever conceived for understanding the universe around us. Not only are we able to figure out how things work and why, but through science, we can even manipulate our environment to better our lives. The conclusions we draw from doing good science are as honest and as accurate as anything can be. Science is that powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the scientific method is problematic; at least where regular folks are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just not practical to apply the scientific method fully to everyday claims and situations. I mean, there are phenomena we encounter on a daily basis that spark our curiosity, and our desire to discover. Perhaps strange things are happening at the old lake house, and we want to know if it’s haunted. Perhaps the claims of homeopathic medicines pique our interests, and we want to know if they really work. Perhaps our co-workers insist the bright lights in the sky last night were alien space craft, and we want to know if that’s true. Unfortunately, the majority of us simply don’t have the means to set up lab experiments, test hypotheses, repeat the tests, have peer groups study our data and scrutinize our tests and repeat them, and have independent lines of inquiry from all over the world repeat the process. The scientific method is just too bulky and cumbersome for us in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where skepticism comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can view skepticism as an express version of the scientific method; sort of a travel or pocket version that we can apply to everyday claims, ideas, and situations. It is a tool that basically does the same thing as the scientific method — it relies on evidence and the analysis of that evidence to draw conclusions that are most probably true — but it’s more practical for regular folks to use at any time, because it can be applied without the attendant “ceremony” of a scientific experiment. We basically become a one-person research team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we observe phenomena, or encounter outrageous claims, or hear seemingly amazing ideas in our everyday lives, we can deploy our pocket scientific method. Without the formality of a full-on scientific review, we can examine any related evidence that may be present. We can leave any biases we may have behind and rely on a critical analysis of the evidence to discover what is most probably true about the phenomena; the lake house is just old and creaky, homeopathic medicines are basically just water, and the lights in the sky were probably just the Goodyear Blimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the good critical thinker will use the qualifier “most probably true” because he or she knows the strength of his or her conclusion is a function of the strength and proper analysis of the evidence. He or she also knows that new evidence can be introduced at any given time, and if warranted by the new evidence, the initial conclusion must be altered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good scientists and good skeptics go where the evidence leads them, but they do not deal in absolutes. They are always ALWAYS looking for stronger, possibly even subversive, evidence. This is precisely how we know the conclusions drawn through science and skepticism are so strong. Sound scientific principles and sound skeptical proposals must take all comers and stand up to the scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is an integral part of the method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cannot close the door to new evidence and call oneself a scientist or a skeptic. Even if it looks as though an idea is invincible, even if it looks as though there is nothing in the universe that can challenge a conclusion of science or skepticism, the method must remain open to new evidence. Always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, the good scientist and the good skeptic leave absolutes out of the equation, but they can be confident their conclusions are most probably true, because they have looked at all of the evidence with a critical eye and without any biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the beauty of all this is, we are not obligated by anything other than curiosity and a personal desire to know and understand things to apply skepticism. We are free to use it or not use it as we wish. And that brings me to the message I like to leave with people when talking about skepticism and what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I regularly tell people, “I am not so much a skeptic as skepticism is what I do”. I have a skill set. I have a method of examination that I apply to things that are important to me, but I am free to be tied to an idea, a claim, or a situation by nothing but my emotions, if I so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for understanding those important things, I find skepticism to be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232732693748"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3783">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/adf506c298428287</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="hospitals"/><category term="incentives"/><title type="html">Hospitals as Hotels</title><published>2009-01-26T04:17:28Z</published><updated>2009-01-26T04:17:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/TIjTQupWzMU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/hospitals-as-hotels/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Hospitals may be more recession-proof than many other industries, but they are hardly immune.

Today's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/feedarticle/8312599"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; reports that McKinnon can now start a new High Court challenge concerning his extradition case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;His supporters said he acted through "naivety" as a result of his Asperger's Syndrome - a form of autism - and should not be considered a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lawyers argued his medical condition - diagnosed last August - was likely to give rise to psychosis or suicide if removed to the US, far away from his family, and should be tried in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKinnon has already signed a signed a statement in which he acknowledged that his hacking is an offence under the UK's Computer Misuse Act 1990. If tried in Britain, his legal team believes he would "receive a much shorter sentence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKinnon was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome in August of 2008; his mother, Janis Sharp, clearly argues that this is why he should not be extradited in a September 2008 &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/22/hacking.usa"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;. A post on the &lt;a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/28/aspergers-added-to-british-hackers-defense/?scp=3&amp;amp;sq=gary%20mckinnon&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;New York Times' Lede blog&lt;/a&gt; in August suggested that " If the British government is not swayed by the Asperger’s diagnosis, an American judge may be," and cited the case of a 20-year-old Pittsburgh man who was convicted of building about two dozen pipe bombs.

Hold on to your beanie hats with the propellers on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists may have actually detected the grain or pixels of the universe. This may mean that our reality, everything we see and do, our entire universe in fact, is like a 3-dimensional holographic image of sorts projected from somewhere else. Talk about a one-two punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story starts at a German-British gravity wave detector called &lt;a href="http://geo600.aei.mpg.de/"&gt;GEO600&lt;/a&gt; in northern Germany. They’ve been trying to find Einstein’s theorized gravity waves for 7 years. It is believed these waves in space-time itself are created by titanic events in the universe like supernovae or collisions of black holes or neutron stars. The detectors work by splitting a beam of light and sending it in two directions perpendicular to each other, bouncing the light off of mirrors, and then recombining it to look for any changes in the interference pattern. If this pattern shifts, if might have been caused by one of the perpendicular pathways being stretched or squeezed by a passing gravity wave. The group that detects these waves first will be the first gravitational wave astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These researchers ran into a problem though. Their detectors kept getting this background noise that would not go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Craig Hogan, physicist at the Fermilab particle physics lab in Batavia, Illinois and recent appointee as director of Fermilab’s Center for Particle Astrophysics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d been thinking long and hard about what’s called the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle"&gt;Holographic Principle&lt;/a&gt;. The idea here is that the total amount of information or entropy a space can contain depends on its surface or the boundary of that space and not its volume as you might suppose. So as an analogy,  the amount of plastic used in a beach ball would be directly related to the amount of information that there can be on the inside of the ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds counterintuitive but this mathematical principle actually works when calculating the entropy of a black hole. In 1972, Physicist Jacob Bekenstein discovered that a black hole’s entropy or information content, is proportional to the surface area of its event horizon. The progenitor star that exploded and became the black hole then could have all the information about its 3D structure encoded in the 2D event horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 90’s, physicists Leonard Susskind and Gerard ‘t Hooft extrapolated the holographic principle from a black hole’s event horizon to the cosmological horizon which is essentially the boundaries of the observable universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would mean that the universe could essentially be described as a 2-dimensional construct embedded in boundaries of the cosmological horizon (observable universe). Our visible universe could then be seen as a 3-dimensional representation of processes happening on that distant 2-dimensional surface. The analogy with a hologram is not perfect but it does help a bit. A normal hologram on your credit card is a piece of plastic with a 2D pattern etched into it. When light shines on it a 3D pattern emerges.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogImages/holographicuniverse.jpg" alt="" width="397" height="324"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ok, back to Hogan. He realized that if this principle could be applied to the universe, then each tiny bit of our horizon would be linked or mapped to our reality somewhere inside. The tiniest bit of anything allowed by quantum theory is called a planck length which is 1.6 x 10 -36 meters. That’s  a hundred billion billion times smaller than a proton. This is as small as small can get folks. This is the fundamental unit of length or grain allowed in space-time. Any fraction of it therefore has no meaning. Half of a planck length makes no physical sense. It would be like half of an electron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this is so unimaginably small that there’s no conceivable way to examine the universe at this scale. We may, though, have a workaround…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, in general, surface area is less than its associated volume, each grain in the surface of our horizon must correspond to a bigger grain in our world. Imagine dots on our beach ball. Each dot would map to a much bigger dot inside the ball in order for the 1 to 1 relation to hold. That’s the key concept right there. This is what Hogan realized. He figured, that if we had a measuring instrument detailed enough, we could potentially see the pixels or grain or planck length of space-time because the holographic version of them in the universe would have to be much bigger than they really are on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hogan even predicted that GEO600 would be sensitive enough to detect the grain of the universe. He approached the company before he knew they were getting noise. When they sent Hogan a plot of the noise it matched his &lt;a href="http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;amp;id=PRVDAQ000077000010104031000001&amp;amp;idtype=cvips&amp;amp;gifs=yes"&gt;prediction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looks like GEO600 is being buffeted by the microscopic quantum convulsions of space-time,” says Hogan.&lt;br&gt;
The other bit of intriguing evidence supporting this idea comes from theorist &lt;a href="http://www.weeklyscientist.com/ws/firsts/New%20Scientist042702.htm"&gt;Juan Maldacena.&lt;/a&gt; He actually showed that a hypothetical universe of 5 dimensions has physics inside it that match the physics on its 4 dimensional boundary. I don’t know how he did it but the particles that interact on the surface corresponded exactly with the interacting strings on the interior. The trick now of course is to apply this to our non-hypothetical universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As compelling as some of this evidence is, keep in mind that no one knows if it is true yet. Most scientists consider this more of an idea or hypothesis than a theory.&lt;br&gt;
If it’s true it’s a double-edged sword. It would mean we may never see gravity waves because the resolution of the universe is too low. Gravity waves have great potential and I’d hate to see them impossible to verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side of that sword is pretty cool though. What if all this is true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hogan has said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Forget Quantum of Solace, we would have directly observed the quantum of time…It’s the smallest possible interval of time - the Planck length divided by the speed of light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elusive theory of everything (quantum gravity) could also get quite a boost from this. Certain approaches to string theory tie in nicely to this theory and some don’t. Cutting away some of the non-holographic trash would aid greatly in this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

In both of the accounts, Obama was said to handle conventional Indonesian greeting routines with aplomb. Now thanks to &lt;a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2009/01/obama-speaks-ve.html"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; we have the video evidence, from an exchange that President Obama had with  State Department staffer Charles Silver on Thursday as the president worked the State Department rope-line. Silver has been stationed in Jakarta at various times since 1969 and now works in the State Department's Office of Inspector General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Silver initiates the conversation by saying &lt;em&gt;Selamat siang, Bapak&lt;/em&gt; ("Good afternoon, sir"). Obama responds with &lt;em&gt;Terima kasih&lt;/em&gt; ("Thank you") and then follows up with &lt;em&gt;Apa kabar?&lt;/em&gt; ("How are you?" lit. "What's the news?"), the same standard greeting that Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said Obama used when they had a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1025"&gt;phone conversation&lt;/a&gt; last November. Silver responds with the equally standard &lt;em&gt;Baik-baik saja&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;quot;Just fine&amp;quot;), and then Obama code-switches out of Indonesian and into English with &amp;quot;Are you, uh…&amp;quot; Silver responds in English, explaining, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve served in Indonesia many times.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama compliments Silver on his "flawless" accent, and they go on to discuss Menteng, the Jakarta neighborhood where they both lived. Obama says he didn't live in the rich section of Menteng, but rather in the subdivision known as "Menteng Dalam," which he glosses as "below Menteng." I'd translate it as "inner Menteng," but perhaps Obama was thinking in terms of the status hierarchy of the neighborhood rather than strict geographical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this conversation, like the previously reported ones, doesn't rise above basic pleasantries, the readiness of Obama to engage in Indonesian chitchat is still  remarkable. Indonesians call such exchanges &lt;em&gt;basa-basi&lt;/em&gt;, and the ability to deploy them is seen as central to establishing the pragmatics of polite interaction. Of course, one could say much the same thing about routines of courtesy in any language. But now we know for sure that Obama is, if not bilingual, at least bi-courteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[One pet peeve: the &lt;a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2009/01/obama-speaks-ve.html"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; report refers to Obama's proficiency in "Bahasa Indonesian." The language is called &lt;em&gt;Indonesian&lt;/em&gt; in English and &lt;em&gt;Bahasa Indonesia&lt;/em&gt; in Indonesian. "Bahasa Indonesian" is a mix-up of the two terms. This confusion could be avoided by simply referring to the language, in English, as &lt;em&gt;Indonesian&lt;/em&gt;, but the imprecise use of the term &lt;em&gt;Bahasa&lt;/em&gt; on its own (which simply means "language") by expats and journalists has apparently led to further misunderstanding about the name of the language.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232724624838"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1050">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2fac88a44d40dfc1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Computational Linguistics"/><category term="Linguistic history"/><title type="html">New results on Austronesian linguistic phylogeny</title><published>2009-01-23T14:55:21Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T14:55:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1050" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/GrayAustronesian.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/GrayAustronesian1.png" align="right" title="Click for a larger version"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Published today: R.

The abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Debates about human prehistory often center on the role that population expansions play in shaping biological and cultural diversity. Hypotheses on the origin of the Austronesian settlers of the Pacific are divided between a recent "pulse-pause" expansion from Taiwan and an older "slow-boat" diffusion from Wallacea. We used lexical data and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to construct a phylogeny of 400 languages. In agreement with the pulse-pause scenario, the language trees place the Austronesian origin in Taiwan approximately 5230 years ago and reveal a series of settlement pauses and expansion pulses linked to technological and social innovations. These results are robust to assumptions about the rooting and calibration of the trees and demonstrate the combined power of linguistic scholarship, database technologies, and computational phylogenetic methods for resolving questions about human prehistory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unusually clear explanation of the project, along with a great deal of background information, is available on the web &lt;a href="http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/research.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work follows up on a preliminary study published in 2000 (R.D. Gray and F.M. Jordan, "&lt;a href="http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/publications/index.php?pub=Gray_and_Jordan2000Nature"&gt;Language trees support the express-train sequence of Austronesian expansion&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 405:1052-1055), as well as earlier work on Indo-European (Russell Gray and Quentin Anderson, "&lt;a href="http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/publications/index.php?pub=Gray_and_Atkinson2003Nature"&gt;Language Tree Divergence Times Support the Anatolian Theory of Indo-European Origin&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 426: 435-439, 2003).&lt;/p&gt;

An especially interesting recent paper discusses the web-accessible database that underlies today's &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; paper: S.J. Greenhill, R. Blust, and R.D. Gray, "&lt;a href="http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/publications/index.php?pub=Greenhill_et_al2008"&gt;The Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database: From Bioinformatics to Lexomics&lt;/a&gt;", Evolutionary Bioinformatics 4:271-283, 2008. The abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Phylogenetic methods have revolutionised evolutionary biology and have recently been applied to studies of linguistic and cultural evolution. However, the basic comparative data on the languages of the world required for these analyses is often widely dispersed in hard to obtain sources. Here we outline how our Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database (ABVD) helps remedy this situation by collating wordlists from over 500 languages into one web-accessible database. We describe the technology underlying the ABVD and discuss the benefits that an evolutionary bioinformatic approach can provide. These include facilitating computational comparative linguistic research, answering questions about human prehistory, enabling syntheses with genetic data, and safe-guarding fragile linguistic information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LL discussions of the 2003 work include "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000208.html"&gt;Dating Indo-European&lt;/a&gt;" 12/10/2003; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000819.html"&gt;Glottochronology revisted, very carefully&lt;/a&gt;" 4/25/2004;  "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000830.html"&gt;More on Gray and Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;" 4/28/2004; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000832.html"&gt;Gray and Atkinson - Use of binary characters&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly four years ago, when Arianna Huffington's vanity group political blog went live, I was the first one to notice a most disturbing trend about it. As far as I knew at the time (or know now), I was the only one to have noticed that &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/05/antivaccination-rhetoric-running.html"&gt;had become a hotbed of antivaccine propaganda&lt;/a&gt; a mere three weeks after its launch. It was home to David Kirby, author of that paean to the mercury militia &lt;a href="http://www.evidenceofharm.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Evidence of Harm: Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic, A Medical Controversy&lt;/a&gt; and now antivaccine blogger on both &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;; Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/robert_f_kennedy_jr_has_declared_a_crank_1.php"&gt;antivaccine &lt;em&gt;über&lt;/em&gt;-crank supreme&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_warrior.php"&gt; antivaccine pediatrician &lt;/a&gt;to the stars &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/run_dont_walk_from_these_doctors.php"&gt;known to show up on television&lt;/a&gt; and who is ever so offended whenever it is pointed out to him that he is an apologist for the antivaccine fringe and so deluded that he thinks himself to be "not antivaccine but pro-safe vaccine." Since then, with only occasional exceptions, HuffPo has remained staunchly antivaccine, adding &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/12/deirdre_imus_gives_everyone_some_stupid.php"&gt;Deirdre Imus&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/the_huffington_post_adds_another_antivac.php"&gt;Kim Stagliano&lt;/a&gt;, also of &lt;em&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/em&gt;. Even Rachel Sklar, Media &amp;amp; Special Projects Editor of &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;, is a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/the_huffington_post_and_vaccines.php"&gt;total antivaccine crank&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, HuffPo is so bad that I ruthlessly &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/a_science_section_for_the_huffington_pos.php"&gt;mocked the very idea of its starting a science section&lt;/a&gt;, given that it has done so well with its pseudoscience section, including not just antivaccinationists but woo-philes like Deepak Chopra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why, on those rare occasions when HuffPo allows a voice of science and reason a chance to write, it's an amazing event. It's even more amazing when that voice of science and reason is Dr. Paul Offit, the man whom the antivaccine fringe considers the Darth Vader of vaccines, the Mouth of Sauron, and the pharma shill to destroy all pharma shills. Even more amazing is when actual peer-reviewed science is cited by said Darth Vader, peer reviewed science like this study in the December issue of the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt; entitled &lt;a href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/168/12/1389"&gt;Geographic Clustering of Nonmedical Exemptions to School Immunization Requirements and Associations With Geographic Clustering of Pertussis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The most significant result of the review was that published studies show no difference between “real” acupuncture and “sham” acupuncture. This is the part of trials that can be blinded - well, single-blinded at least (the subject does not know which is real vs sham, but the acupuncturist does). This blinded data is negative, indicating that it does not matter where you stick the needles, which is a strong indication that the underlying philosophy of acupuncture is false. Further, now that acupuncture studies are being done with placebo acupuncture - opaque sheaths and dull needles that do not penetrate the skin, allowing for double-blind studies - these are also coming out negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I think it is reasonable to conclude from the literature that it does not matter where you stick acupuncture needles, or even if you stick them. Therefore, any observed benefit must be either: 1) an artifact of the study design (i.e. placebo effects); or 2) a result of other things that are happening in association with the acupuncture treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several points were raised in the comments I want to address in some detail. Further, there are many questions about migraines, and since migraines make up a significant portion of my clinical practice I can clear up some of the confusion as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migraines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First some background on migraines.   Migraines are a specific kind of primary headache, meaning that the headache is the disorder and is not secondary to an underlying problem, like a brain tumor. Migraine are variable in their presentation, and so are defined as having &lt;a href="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/Migraine/IHScrit.html"&gt;some of a list of symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. These include unilateral (one-sided), throbbing, can be triggered by various things, and associated with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, and strong odors. Migraines can also occur with an aura, which is a neurological symptom occuring before or during the headache, most commonly visual changes like dark spots (scotoma) or flashing lights (visual fortifications).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there is no objective laboratory diagnostic test for migraines - the standard headache workup will be negative - the diagnosis can be reliably made in many cases based upon a very typical clinical presentation. Of course, the edges are blurry, and some patients overlap with tension or other types of headache. Despite the lack of an objective test, there are documented physiological changes that occur during migraines. There is a vasocontrictive phase which is associated with  a wave of decreased electrical activity (called spreading depression) across the cortex. This is followed by a vasodilation phase. It was originally thought that these vascular changes were what caused the migraine, but now it seems as if this is just one consequence of the deeper physiological mechanisms of migraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current synthesis is that a migraine is an attack, not unlike a seizure, in the trigeminovascular reflex which is mediated in the brainstem. The trigeminal nucleus, which mediates sensation to the face and part of the scalp, becomes hypersensitive, causing a cascade of effects. There is still much we do not understand about migraine physiology, but I am just giving a superficial overview of what we do know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more interesting bit - there is a genetic condition known as familial hemiplegic migraine which results in frequent severe migraines associated with stroke-like neurological deficits. The mutation is in a gene for a calcium channel, which is evidence that calcium regulation may play a role in migraine in some patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of migraine that is important to understand is that it is probably not one discrete entity but a collection of physiological entities that all lead to a final common pathway of trigeminovascular activation. Therefore, different patients with migraine may have significant physiological differences in terms of their triggers and which treatments they are likely to respond to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that migraines are very treatable. There are a number of strategies which have to be individualized to the patient. The first consideration is migraine frequency. If a patient is having one migraine every 3-4 months than preventive treatments are not likely to be worth it. You can focus on acute treatments (called abortive therapy, because they are aimed at aborting the migraine in progress).  If, however, someone is having 3-5 migraines per week then abortive therapy has to be minimized and the focus should be on preventive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevention takes several forms. The first preventive therapy to try is always removal of triggers, because they are the safest, easiest, and most effective. The most common trigger is caffeine - which can trigger a migraine when used, or when one is withdrawing from the caffeine. Caffeine withdrawal can cause headaches in non-migraineurs as well, but that is distinct from a caffeine-withdrawal triggered migraine. Either way - remove caffeine, wait a couple of months, and then reassess migraine frequency. Other triggers include bright light, strong odors, lack of sleep (very important and often overlooked) and various kinds of foods.  Therefore step one is removal of triggers and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these measures are not sufficient and headaches remain frequent, then there are a number of supplements and medications that can be effective. Vitamin B2, magnesium, and Coenzyme Q10 have all been shown to be effective for migraine prophylaxis. These can be used as initial prophylaxis for milder cases, in patients who want to avoid medications, or as adjuctive therapy with a prescription medication. The medications that have shown to be effective include verapamil, some antidepressants like amitryptyline, and anti-seizure medications like topiramate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although controversial for a while, recent large controlled trials support the use of botulinum injections (Botox) for migraine prevention.  There are several possible mechanisms for this, including the obvious muscle relaxation. But also, the botulinum is known to be taken up by the nerve endings and is transported to the cell body. Therefore it may act in the trigeminal nucleus to inhibit activity and increase the threshold for a migraine attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the only way to know which treatment will be most effective for which patient is trial and error. I do anticipate the day, however, when a genetic profile might greatly enhance our ability to predict response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abortive therapy involves adequate hydration, treating nausea if present, and treating the migraine attack itself (not just the pain). The two components of the attack that are targetted are inflammation (usually with NSAIDS or aspirin-like drugs), and changes in serotonin. Triptans (like sumatriptan, brand-name Imitrex) target serotonin receptors. For some patients rest is often a critical component as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acupuncture for migraine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice I did not add acupuncture to the list, for the reasons I stated above. The research clearly indicates, in my opinion, that there is no mechanism and no added value to acupuncture needles - whatever you do with them. In response to my post yesterday, Sonic wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. N- I understand what you are saying about the unblinded and sham acupunture.  But-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001218.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001218.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“In the four trials in which acupuncture was compared to a proven prophylactic drug treatment, patients receiving acupuncture tended to report more improvement and fewer side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that statement is true, then the ‘rituals’ of acupunture work better than the ‘proven prophylactic drug treatment.’&lt;br&gt;
So wouldn’t it be wise to do what works? That is the actual question, right? If a ritual is a better pain reliever than a chemical- why not use the ritual? (I’ll bet there is less liver damage from the ritual…)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “liver damage” comment refers to one drug, valproic acid, that can cause liver toxicity. This is an older drug and, although it is one of only two drugs actually FDA approved for migraine prevention, it is rarely used for this reason.  I personally never use it. There are many newer drugs with no organ toxicity to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonic’s assumption is that, of the two possibilities for a recorded effect that I mentioned above, artifact vs non-specific effects, it is the non-specific effects that are important. I disagree with this. Although we cannot say for sure, the fact that the difference between acupuncture and no acupuncture is unblinded opens the door wide for artifacts. Typically, the people doing these studies are acupuncture proponents. We know from reviews of the literature that if proponents fund studies (let alone actually carry them out) they are much more likely to be favorable. It is probable that subjects who would volunteer for such a study are also open to acupuncture, and may have strong beliefs in it. Therefore most of the people involved in these studies want them to work, and therefore I put very little faith in any unblinded results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only tight protocols are of any value in such situations, and the tight protocols are negative. The simplest explanation for that is that acupuncture does not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second - the degree to which the effect is real but due to non-specific effects also does not justify using acupuncture. These non-specific effects include relaxation, palpation of the muscles prior to needle insertion, positive therapeutic attention, expectation, conditioning, and the temporary effect of introducing a novel component into therapy (all proven to have a measurable effect). It is unscientific to conclude that a specific intervention (acupuncture in this case) works because of non-specific effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my reviews of these studies the control group getting standard medical treatment is inadequate as a control. Typically they give a single drug, often underdosed or for too short a period, and not comprehensive migraine treatment as I outlined above. This leaves the door wide open for non-medical interventions that are known to work and which can ride along with the acupuncture to give the appearance of an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that we should eliminate acupuncture entirely from the equation. Any benefit from the ritual of acupuncture can be derived by using the non-specific elements stripped away from the pseudoscience of acupuncture itself. This already is done - with massage, relaxation therapy, biofeedback, stress reduction, or just plain exercise - all of which improve migraines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me back to the original reason for my post yesterday - it is highly deceptive to conclude from this recent review that “acupuncture works.” That is a lie, or a gross misinterpration of the science. Rather, we can conclude from these reviews the exact oppostive - that acupuncture does not work. We need to finally set aside the needles (which, btw, have their own complications) and all the pseudoscientific claims that come with them. They are a distraction, they are insidious in that they instill unscientific and bizarre beliefs in the public that will cause mischief downstream, and they are a scientific dead-end.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a procedure related to bleeding, in which suction is used to draw blood to the surface. It's absolutely useless, an artifact of old, discarded theories about humors, and it's not something I ever thought I'd see practiced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modern twist on an ancient procedure promises big results in the treatment of pain. Tracy, 36, suffers from chronic back pain and writes The Doctors for help.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Acupuncturist Dr. Michael Yang performs a cupping procedure on Tracy, which, he explains, works on the same principles as a deep massage or physical therapy. The placement of heated glass cups on a person's bare back serves to separate connective tissue, muscle and fascia, which subsequently increases circulation and decreases inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Chinese medicine purports that cupping moves "stagnant blood," or stuck chi, or energy, as well as detoxifies the blood. "It's been around for thousands of years," Dr. Yang notes. "It's really a tried and true therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;i&gt;acupuncturist&lt;/i&gt; throws around a lot of jargon, but it's all a put-on, and he's a quack. His therapy certainly has been tried, tried for a long, long time with no therapeutic effect (other than, perhaps, the placebo effect). Lots of things have been around for a long time, but that doesn't make them correct. What's he going to do next, sacrifice a goat, do a magic dance around the patient, and make her drink a potion made from mouse dung and boiled roots? People did that kind of thing for thousands of years, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would probably make for good TV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/what_is_this_the_17th_century.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/9UB252qRYME" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232708697370"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-1514578400522606826">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/093f6c53c230739f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Link Love" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Literacy" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Action Reviews" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Action Review: Death From The Skies!</title><published>2009-01-23T08:36:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T08:36:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/01/action-review-death-from-skies.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">I know I'm months late with this one, but I have to do it anyway. The book was simply too good to go unpimped. I've been reading &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com"&gt;Phil Plait's&lt;/a&gt; stuff before I was even aware there was a blogosphere much less a skeptical one, and anything I can do to talk him up is something I will do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The short version: go buy &lt;i&gt;Death From The Skies&lt;/i&gt; by Dr. Phillip Plait, Ph.D. Do it now. Hop in your TARDIS and do it last week. You will not be disappointed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, understand that I could have written this review months ago. It's just that I have a giant "to-read" pile that I work through semi-systematically, and &lt;i&gt;Death From The Skies!&lt;/i&gt; was near the bottom when I bought it. Atop it were Michael Moorcock's first two Elric novels, Neil Gaiman's (at the time) newly-released &lt;i&gt;The Graveyard Book&lt;/i&gt; (something else everyone owes themselves to read), and, most daunting of all, &lt;i&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last fall I got a wild hair up my ass and said "I think I'm gonna read &lt;i&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/i&gt;." I've been reading it since last fall. It was smooth going at first, until Ishmael and his cannibal buddy Queequeg actually &lt;i&gt;got on&lt;/i&gt; the Pequod, after which it becomes a tedious exercise in unnecessary and inaccurate 19th century cetology, unimportant tangential narrative, and general commentary on the whaling profession. I think since they got on the Pequod, there have been maybe four chapters that actually dealt with the plot. And I'm about halfway through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, to tide myself over, I've been reading other things in the midst of &lt;i&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/i&gt;. I keep telling myself I'm going to go back any day now, because I have vowed that the book will not defeat me, but anymore I'm not so sure. It's still on my nightstand, but only time will tell how long it remains there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, that's why I hadn't read &lt;i&gt;Death From The Skies&lt;/i&gt; until last week. After after months of waiting, however, it only took me a few days to tear through it, cover to cover, and I'm especially busy these days what with full-time work &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; full-time school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book, I think, was an improvement over Phil's first book, &lt;i&gt;Bad Astronomy&lt;/i&gt; in that it was more immediately accessible. He's grown as a writer since then and it shows. He can take very complicated concepts and breaks them down to something any idiot can understand (which is good, because there are some places where I'm any idiot) and does it engagingly, which is no mean feat. A good amount of popular science writing may be technically well-done, it may make the science understandable to the layperson, but often it simply reads drily, and, like with &lt;i&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/i&gt;, it's hard to read something that isn't engaging no matter how interesting or well-explained it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phil doesn't have that problem. His own enthusiasm for the material comes through in his writing and it, in turn, keeps the reader enthusiastic, even when the subject-matter gets kind of technical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily for Phil, his "cosmic disasters" hook doesn't require him to get nearly as technical as, say &lt;i&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/i&gt;. For my money, stellar fusion and black hole formation is a lot more easily understood than four-dimensional light cones. Perhaps the most technical and most counterintuitive section of the book was his chapter on black holes, which are, by nature, weird and counterintuitive. Even there he communicates clearly and enables the reader to understand, at least on a basic level, some truly complicated weirdness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hook also provides the book with a fantastic leaping-off point. The things Phil is describing are simply so spectacular that it's hard not to get excited about them. Black holes, gamma-ray bursts, and supernovae are humongous and destructive and awesome, in the old-fashioned sense of the word (and the modern one, too). His "destruction of earth" frame allows him to give these otherwise distant cosmic events a human face by showing just how quickly any one of them would break the earth down into its component molecules after vaporizing all life. Putting these disasters into a terrestrial context like that makes it easier to relate to them and easier to understand them, because it gives us a common reference-point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think of it this way: we can give you a raw number for the energy released in a GRB, say 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; joules. That's a lot, but generally we have a hard time appreciating raw numbers, especially when they're so gigantic. We can take a step closer to relevance by comparing the GRB to a generally-understood reference point like the sun and say that a GRB, in a few seconds, expels the same amount of energy as 1000 sunlike stars do in their entire lifetimes. That helps us understand the sheer amount of energy blasted into space by these objects. The sun is huge, and has a lot of energy, and has a very long lifespan by our timescale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Phil takes it one closer and really brings it home: a GRB at a distance of thousands of light-years, if it was pointed directly at the earth, could &lt;i&gt;set the surface of the planet on fire&lt;/i&gt;. From further away, it could do only minimal surface damage, but strip the earth of its atmosphere and mess up its magnetic field, leaving most species on earth open to massive amounts of radiation from the solar wind, driving most life extinct in a very short time. And they can do this from across the galaxy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This really allows us lowly humans to appreciate the sheer power of a gamma-ray burst. It puts it into a context that makes it relatable to us on an everyday level. Phil does this with every topic in his book, at least as far as he can; the far-future of the universe is difficult to put in any human perspective, but it was one of my favorite chapters nonetheless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found it striking that even during the very tail-end of the stelliferous era, sun-like stars could be formed here and there, and potentially have planets, and these stars could live long enough (a few billion years) to evolve life of their own, life on a planet in a dying universe, a planet with no stars in its night sky thanks to the ever-receding horizon. This life would have no way of knowing anything about the rest of the cosmos. What a strange existence they would have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all, &lt;i&gt;Death From The Skies&lt;/i&gt; was a spectacular piece of popular science writing. I learned a lot from it, and it was most definitely a page-turner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do have one minor criticism, though: Phil uses the word "literally" &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt;. A whole lot. To put it into human perspective, Phil's output of the word "literally" in this single book is equivalent to the output of 100 other science writers over their entire careers. Literally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, it's not that bad. But he uses it as an emphatic adjective often enough that it's quite glaring and actually began to irk me a bit, and I'm kind of surprised his editor didn't give him a good knuckle-rapping for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than that stylistic quirk, I can't recommend &lt;i&gt;Death From The Skies&lt;/i&gt; enough. It's an exciting, informative, and engaging read that will teach you about some of the biggest (and weirdest) events to happen in the expanding bubble of spacetime we call the Universe. Phil Plait is, no hyperbole, simply one of the best popular science writers out there, and there's no excuse not to buy his new book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-1514578400522606826?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232702383746"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=2781">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/43530e223ae47807</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="advertising"/><category term="ants"/><category term="funny"/><category term="photo"/><title type="html">Ant Protesters!</title><published>2009-01-23T09:18:44Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T09:18:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/01/23/ant-protesters/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent yesterday afternoon chasing &lt;a href="http://www.dnr.state.md.us/wildlife/muteswans.html"&gt;mute swans&lt;/a&gt; around in 2 foot deep snow, on a frozen pond, in waders, with a giant net on a pole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how about an amusing photo, instead of a thoughtful post?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo was apparently  a sticker on the floor in front of a display for insecticides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very clever!&lt;/p&gt;

Jesus Arose From the Dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. St. Raymond of Penyafort Had a Sailing Cloak. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is the account of St. Raymond and the sinful prince / king:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;This prince was an accomplished soldier and statesman, and a sincere lover of religion, but his great qualities were sullied by a base passion for women. He received the admonitions of the saint with respect, and promised amendment of life, and a faithful compliance with the saint's injunctions in every particular; but without effect. St.Raymund, upon discovering that he entertained a lady at his court with whom he was suspected to have criminal conversation, made the strongest instances to have her dismissed, which the king promised should be done, but postponed the execution. The saint, dissatisfied with the delay, begged leave to retire to his convent at Barcelona. The king not only refused him leave, but threatened to punish with death any person that should undertake to convey him out of the island. The saint, full of confidence in God, said to his companion, "A king of the earth endeavors to deprive us of the means of retiring; but the King of heaven will supply them." &lt;strong&gt;He then walked boldly to the waters, spread his cloak upon them, tied up one corner of it to a staff for a sail, and having made the sign of the cross, stepped upon it without fear, while his timorous companion stood trembling and wondering on the shore. On this new kind of vessel the saint was wafted with such rapidity, that in six hours he reached the harbor of Barcelona, sixty leagues distant from Majorca. Those who saw him arrive in this manner met him with acclamations. &lt;/strong&gt;But he, gathering up his cloak dry, put it on, stole through the crowd, and entered his monastery. A chapel and a tower, built on the place where he landed, have transmitted the memory of this miracle to posterity. This relation is taken from the bull of his canonization, and the earliest historians of his life. The king became a sincere convert, and governed his conscience, and even his kingdoms, by the advice of St. Raymund from that time till the death of the saint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both miracles are venerated by honest sincere Christian faith as having factually happened&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Form the view of an outsider; how does a non-Christian tell which of the above miracles (if any) are factually true? Why are both stories not just recorded examples wishful thinking?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. How does one Christian faith (Catholicism) know historical truth by faith; while another Christian faith (Protestantism) knows the same historical truth to be a pious religious fraud? {How can Protestants attack with faith miracles (which Catholics believe to be true) as pious lies (St. Raymond via Negative Criticism), but immediately reverse themselves and claim to know historical truth with the same faith (Jesus’ Resurrection via Positive Criticism)?}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Restraints like the basket hold, in which a child's arms are crossed over his midsection and held behind his back, were used by staff at a public school my son attended a couple of years ago. He was banging his head and the basket hold, as we were later told, was the procedure to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't know our rights then. From the first time the head-banging occurred, we should have (and this is what we do now) called a meeting with the teacher, case manager, behavior consultant, and other members of Charlie's Child Study Team. We should have called for a &lt;a href="http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/discipl.index.htm"&gt;Behavior Intervention Plan&lt;/a&gt; to be developed, after careful observation and evaluation of Charlie and of all possible reasons for him banging his head, via a Functional Behavior Assessment. We should have specified what kinds of procedures we gave our consent for the school district's staff to use. We should have insisted that all of this get written into Charlie's IEP and that we be informed, in writing, whenever any practices like restraints were used on Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what we do now when Charlie starts having trouble at school. When he was seven, we were frantic to stop the head-banging, understandably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And &lt;em&gt;stopping&lt;/em&gt; it was what the basket hold was intended to do and eventually it did, but not until after Charlie had strained and twisted and back-arched. While the holds stopped the head-banging, eventually, they ultimately led to Charlie's head-banging increasing and worsening, and in November of 2005 we took Charlie out of that classroom and out of that school district, forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since then, Charlie has been in school, and sometimes had a home program, that relied on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). I recognize that there are serious ethical issues with ABA and behavior therapy themselves----the history of behavior modification is not pretty---Charlie's always responded well to ABA teaching, from the time that he was 2 and a couple of months and in his home ABA program. He liked the sometimes excessive structure, the use of discrete trial teaching that "broke down" tasks into small components, and most of all he liked the therapists, energetic young people who made it fun and with whom Charlie truly developed a relationship.  In contrast, the behavior therapy used in the school district that authorized the basket holds, was more like an outdated sort of behavior modification that saw Charlie as a bunch of "problem behaviors," not a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's current and most recent teachers focus first of all on understanding what leads up to head-banging and then seek to change what happens before Charlie does something like head-banging. They're pro-active in making changes and adjustments and teaching Charlie to signal his distress and, when he feels the anxiety coming, to ask to do things that can calm him, like wearing headphones and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_playlist_for_the_sound-sensitive"&gt;listening to music&lt;/a&gt;. (Apparently Charlie has a liking for---no surprise---the sounds of the ocean and---!!!---Coldplay.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely takes planning, careful teaching, and teachers and therapists trained to know how to do all of this. We've been back having lots of conversations and email exchanges with Charlie's teacher since 2009 started; ever since our &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_transition"&gt;trip to California&lt;/a&gt;, Charlie has been struggling. Combined with a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/doctor_day"&gt;visit to his pediatric neurologist&lt;/a&gt; and a change in his medication, and a lot of efforts by his teacher and the aides, things have been getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head-banging was something Charlie did, though only rarely, when he was very young. I wonder often, could things have gone differently for him if there had never been any basket holds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I wish I knew than what I knew now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's why I just blogged about it.&lt;/p&gt;

Just pretend nothing can happen by chance or coincidence and make a suspicious-sounding question out of everything like a bad Seinfeld routine: What’s the deal with birds taking out the engines? What’s the deal with the banana served to passenger 57 being slightly brown? Then just make up a ridiculous story like Cloverfield did it and insist that all the lack of evidence proves a sinister cover-up. It’s just that easy.&lt;/p&gt;

There is much debate over Einstein's beliefs, and though it seems clear from his writings that he was not a Christian or practicing Jew, he did proffer &lt;a href="http://www.ctinquiry.org/publications/reflections_volume_1/torrance.htm"&gt;quotes about "God"&lt;/a&gt; fairly often, and these are widely used by religious groups today. The full quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element; I want to know his thoughts; the rest are details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular quote is intriguing, because I cannot find a definitive source for it. He supposedly said it to a young student, in the context of some experiment or other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what did he mean by it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einstein claimed to believe in &lt;a href="http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090114/OPINION02/301149997/-1/RSS02"&gt;Spinoza's God&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically "nature." This is an impersonal God, who has no more regard for humans than for birds, bacteria, or boulders. For Einstein though, this "god" was a puzzle for him to figure out. He wanted to learn what nature was, take it apart, determine how it was put together and why. Taken in this light, he was simply saying something akin to "I don't care about rainbows, I care about why they exist."&lt;/p&gt;

The results? Mixed, with some good stuff and some really, really bad stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt; The creationists on the board failed to get a &amp;quot;strengths and weaknesses&amp;quot; statement in the standards. This phrase is creationist camouflage to insert doubt into evolution. It’s really just a bald-faced lie: they are trying to let creationist-leaning teachers say things about evolution that aren’t true, and create confusion in the minds of students. This failed to pass, so the phrase most likely won’t be in the standards. That’s a huge victory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me note: one person who spoke out against putting the phrase in was a Republican, Bob Craig (see the 1:23 entry on the TFN blog). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad:&lt;/strong&gt; At the last moment, dyed-in-the-wool creationist — and head of the BOE — Don McLeroy was able to insert a statement into the standards calling into question common descent, the linchpin of evolution. McLeroy is among the worst of the worst when it comes to creationism; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy?s=mcleroy"&gt;search this blog for quite a bit about his mucking about with science&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ugly:&lt;/strong&gt; This is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; not over. There will be another vote tomorrow, the formal one, and a final one in March to set the standards in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as creationists have some control on the board — and remember, McLeroy is the head of the BOE — then this will never be over. They will continue to totally deny reality and the totality of scientific research, and instead bully their way and their narrow religious views into the textbooks of Texas, and from there all of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the TFN blog in your feed reader so you can keep up with these shenanigans. Stay informed (the &lt;a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/012309dntexevolution.1d0cd401.html"&gt;Dallas Morning News&lt;/a&gt; has been covering this as well). Because these people will not stop, ever, until…&lt;/p&gt;

In some ways he has done for the average person what I have done in my book for the college student, and for that I can only congratulate him. His book begins by taking a good hard look at why people believe and what believers must do in order to defend their beliefs. This encompasses the first half of the book, or 94 pages (5 chapters). The second half of his book (5 chapters) through to page 248 deals with answering a wide range of specific Christian objections, most of which came from believers who emailed him about his previous book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Biblical-Nonsense-Review-Doubting-Christians/dp/0595341829/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1232655166&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Biblical Nonsense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I like his approach very much. In the second half of his book Long’s answers to Christian objections are solid and convincing for the most part (which provides many specific examples of what Long claims in the first half about how Christians reason). If you’ve read his first book you need to read this one just to see how he effectively deals with the many objections Christians have made against it. Even if you haven't read his first book this is a good read with intelligent answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the first half of Long’s book intrigued me personally the most, especially since I was very familiar with the objections Christians make to our arguments. In this first half Long gives us many examples of how people come to believe strange things and how they in turn defend them, from Virgin Mary healings to UFO sightings to ghost hunters to Mormons to Muslims. Here he includes Christian beliefs as well, since people who adopt a religious faith usually do so based on when and where they were born. One of the lessons of this first part of his book is that “Human beings are unbelievably gullible and illogical creatures. The ability to think skeptically is not innate; it requires practice.” (p. 84). In this first part I believe Long made this point very effectively and it should cause all believers to question their faith, subject it to scrutiny and demand hard evidence to believe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what usually happens is that rather than “initiating an honest and impartial analysis” of any new evidence, believers “simply bury their heads in the sand and continue to observe whatever beliefs…their ancestors thought they needed thousands of years ago.” (p. 12). When looking at new evidence believers get into a defense mode where they seek to defend what they believe rather than trying to impartially weigh it, Long rightly charges. Impartiality might be an elusive goal, of course, but we should at least try to look at the evidence. Consider this example from Long: “If you wanted safety information on a used car, would it be wiser to trust the word of a used car salesman or the findings of a consumer report?” (p. 23). I think the answer is obvious. But Christians routinely will only trust other Christians for their information. They don’t trust outsiders. Why? If I were interested in car safety information I want an outsider’s perspective to get a different, more objective opinion. Sometimes I’ll even get a second opinion from doctors or dentists. Why is it that Christians will not read Long's book or mine for a second opinion? I challenge them to do so, even if they might eventually disagree. At least they would be honestly looking at the other side. That’s why I’ve initiated the &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/11/take-debunking-christianity-challenge.html"&gt;Debunking Christianity Challenge&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. Start with Long’s book if you will. It’s as good of a place to start as any, especially if you are an average reader and you think you have impartially weighed the available evidence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this first half of his book Long clearly articulates concepts like “Cognitive Dissonance,” “Impression Management Theory,” and "Psychological Reactance Theory” and shows how believers defend their beliefs when faced with evidence to the contrary. One story he tells from the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; is about an evangelical group who believed there was going to be a nuclear attack so they went into a bomb shelter for 42 days before coming out to find no nuclear attack had happened. So what did they conclude? Not that they were wrong. No sirree Bob. “Rather than accepting the obvious conclusion that they had erred in their prediction, group members proclaimed that their beliefs had been instrumental in stopping the nuclear attack.” (p. 48).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Citing from the most authoritative books on persuasive psychology, one written by Robert B. Cialdini, titled &lt;em&gt;Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion&lt;/em&gt;, and another one written by Richard E. Petty and John Cacioppo, titled &lt;em&gt;Attitudes and Persuasion: Classic and Contemporary Approaches&lt;/em&gt;, Long proffers several other examples of this kind of thinking among people who do the same thing with regard to everyday examples. Human beings truly are “unbelievably gullible and illogical creatures.” We’re more likely to buy unusual items when priced higher; we’re more likely to buy items that offer coupons even though there is no price advantage; we’re more likely to agree to absurd requests if preceded by ones of greater absurdity; we’re more likely to consider attractive people to be more intelligent; and we’re more likely to agree with the crowd we hang around because we want to fit in; and so on, and so on. (pp. 84, 88-89)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All believers must do is look at these things to realize that as humans we &lt;strong&gt;MUST&lt;/strong&gt; be skeptical about what we believe! In my opinion these studies reinforce my claim that the default position is skepticism. To embrace this default position is to be an adult mature thinker with regard to what we believe. Instead of being mature, Long shows us that Christians do not seek to be skeptical about what they have been taught from their parents. They seek rather to defend what they believe. They are resistant to any contrary evidence. They seek to ignore it or look for any answer that might solve the cognitive dissonance this new evidence creates just to maintain their comfort zone, even if it is a non-answer, a glib answer, a far fetched answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long tells us that we believe both because of emotional reasons and because of logical reasons and he illustrates this with two people, one who has the fear of heights and another who thinks old skyscrapers are not as safe as newer ones. (pp. 76-77). The latter person has intellectual doubt about the older skyscrapers and must be given reasons to think otherwise. But the former person who has a fear of heights has an emotional problem. He knows people go up to the top of the skyscraper and come down safely. So we cannot convince him by showing him the steel beams, or the safety ratings of that building. He must face his fears. He must get to the first floor and look around. When he’s comfortable on the first floor he must then go up to the second floor, and so on until he gets to the top. This may take a long time and he must be willing to face his fears. This, Long argues, is the plight of the believer, since he thinks there isn’t any good evidence to believe in the first place, and I agree. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believers think we’re wrong about this but I challenge them to consider the possibility they are wrong for a moment. Consider a more objective perspective coming from two former believers who have investigated the reasons to believe and found them seriously wanting. Given the overwhelming psychological data Long presents you’ve got to at least consider this as a real possibility, and if that’s the case then Long says that to free you from your religious indoctrination “we must delve into the history of the individual’s beliefs to find the avenue from which they originate.” (p. 77) This echoes what I've said about the &lt;em&gt;Outsider Test for Faith&lt;/em&gt;. When testing your beliefs as an outsider you need to revisit what the reasons were for adopting your faith in the first place. What were they? Most of them were clearly emotional, weren't they? Were they intellectual? If so, when looking back on these reasons do you now consider those initial reasons less than persuasive? Would those same reasons convince you to believe today or are they much too simplistic? What I argue is that you initially adopted your faith for less than good reasons but from that moment onward you see the world through colored glasses by which you now analyze and examine the evidence. &lt;strong&gt;YOU NEED TO TAKE THEM OFF&lt;/strong&gt;, is what Long and I argue, as best as you can. Then do what Julia Sweeney told us she did. She put on her “No God Glasses” for just a few seconds and looked around at the world as if God did not exist. Then she put them on for a minute and then put them on for an hour, and then a day. To me this would be just like climbing up that skyscraper Long wrote about. That’s one way to face your fears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But fears they are, Long says, especially since believers think they have a “mind-reading god” always present who monitors their every thought. (p. 74). With such a mind-reading God, believers are just too fearful of being honest with themselves about their doubt. So they refuse to truly look at the evidence to the contrary. To such people Long suggests telling God you are sincerely going to look at the evidence “to determine if the Bible is really his word. Ask forgiveness in advance if you feel you must…” This is great advice. If God really cares he should allow you to be intellectually honest with yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all, as I said, I really liked this book and I highly recommend it. It is unusual to other comparable works because it seeks to articulate the real reasons why people believe and reveals the mental gymnastic contortions needed to defend ignorant and comfortable beliefs. This type of book just may go a long way to help Christians be honest about their delusional beliefs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and if you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;want to test whether petitionary prayer works, and not just play games, Long offers a unique test that should surely go down in the books (something about arsenic and prayer, but I don't think any Christian should try it. pp. 86-87)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

But there's another extreme as well, which is thinking it's OK to use autistic adults as living reference guides, or putting too much emphasis on the experience of a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Sinclair coined the phrase &lt;a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1404508"&gt;"self-narrating zoo exhibit"&lt;/a&gt;, and in her book &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IiMGAAAACAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Like+Color+to+the+Blind&amp;amp;ei=7r54Sbn7IoqUkQToh5HgBg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Color to the Blind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Donna Williams uses the phrase "walking autie textbook."  From the everything2 entry on &lt;a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1404508"&gt;"self-narrating zoo exhibit"&lt;/a&gt; which I highly encourage you to read in full,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common reactions to an autistic person is to ask questions about autism, including extremely personal questions. While most of us understand this reaction, we also perceive it as treating an autistic person not as a person but as a dehumanized information source or a "walking autie textbook."[ed., Williams]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the curiosity most autistic people object to. It is the expectation that we are obligated to answer, and the constant -- and sometimes impossible -- nature of the questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autistic people have lamented the tendency for others to interrupt our discussions of human rights or other political topics, in order to ask us about our toilet training or sexual histories. This aspect of the self-narrating zoo exhibit phenomenon has caused many autistics to give up mentioning our autism altogether in some contexts, to avoid the inevitable barrage of questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related danger to this is people who, on querying a single autistic person, then generalize that one experience to the entire population.  How many times have I had people assume I must be a highly logic-driven entity just because that's what Temple Grandin has talked about!  (I am in fact most driven by the fluidity of my intuitions, shhhhh...).  No single autistic person could possibly ever have identical experiences to any other; outside of meeting certain diagnostic (behavioral) criteria, we are as diverse as non-autistics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I was fortunate enough to get into the speaking-about-autism business after others had alerted me to these dangers, I've been very cautious.  I do speak about perspectives of autism from the inside, particularly to social service workers, but I have extremely strong boundaries about what I am willing to disclose, when, and why.  I also emphasize human rights, challenge assumptions and bias, hammer on the need to take multiple perspectives.  And I make it clear that while my expertise as an autistic person is relevant, my expertise in technical communications, systems thinking, and domain knowledge is the reason why they hired me.  Even so, otherwise perfectly nice people I train badger me with requests for more details about my love-life, childhood, and meltdowns, and I then have to decide whether it's worth it to me to explain why the request is deeply offensive or just simply decline and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in between being invalidated as irrelevant and being set on a pedestal inside a zoo cage is a balance point of equal exchange between human beings.  Ultimately it's about equality and respect.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232671686771"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/texas_is_doing_ok.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/36d4308e5c13a7a1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Texas is doing OK</title><published>2009-01-23T00:17:32Z</published><updated>2009-01-23T00:17:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/n5LUquBAGhE/texas_is_doing_ok.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/texas_is_doing_ok.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://timpanogos.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/science-wins-strengths-and-weaknesses-stripped-from-texas-science-standards-7-8/"&gt;latest news&lt;/a&gt;: in a vote on whether to keep the silly "strengths and weaknesses" phrasing in the Texas state science standards, the forces of light on the board of education have defeated the goblins of the darkness by a one vote margin.

This movie is based on the epic superhero graphic novel (comic book series to you) by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. I read it, and it’s pretty good. I had some problems with the ending, but I’ll save my comments for when the movie comes out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a new image was just released by the producers of the movie, and it shows a picture of Neil Armstrong on the Moon… taken by Dr. Manhattan, an ex-human who, through an atomic accident, became a glowing blue being of pure energy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thenewfrontiersman/3215367982/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3429/3215367982_9bbe9448de.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, eh? Yeah, but the debunker in me just has to point something out…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the out-of-focus Earth on the left side of the picture? From the Moon, the Earth is about 2 degrees across, roughly four times the size of the Moon as seen from Earth. In the picture you can see the Earth is only a degree or two off the lunar horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s wrong! The Moon always shows one face as seen from the Earth, and that means the Earth is always in roughly the same part of the sky from a spot on the Moon. To see the Earth that close to the horizon means the Apollo 11 landing would have to have been very close to the Moon’s north or south pole (hard to tell which; the features on the Earth are too blurred to get a direction). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/imagery/apollo/AS11/a11landsite.htm"&gt;However, Apollo 11 landed almost exactly on the Moon’s Equator.&lt;/a&gt; To Buzz and Neil, the Earth was high overhead, difficult to see at all from inside the spacesuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the Watchmen picture is faked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/22/watchmen-they-need-my-help/#comment-150451"&gt;Max Fagin in the comments&lt;/a&gt; makes a good point: there is a circle around the Moon where the Earth would be near the horizon, the divider between the near and far side of the Moon. But landing near there would be dangerous; for your first landing you want to be sure you are in direct visual contact with Earth, otherwise you can’t communicate. That means landing near the center of the Moon’s face. &lt;del&gt;Assuming this was Apollo 17 (see below) changes that, but then why would Manhattan be there to take a picture of the 11th or 12th guy on the Moon? I don’t buy it.&lt;/del&gt; And, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/22/watchmen-they-need-my-help/#comment-150608"&gt;as Brian Schlosser points out in the comments&lt;/a&gt;, this is definitely Apollo 11.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice touch is the code on the side of the picture: AS17-137-20990. That’s the coding NASA used for the pictures taken on the Moon. But… AS17 was used for Apollo &lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt;, not 11. In fact, there is an Apollo picture taken with that code, and &lt;a href="http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS17/10075961.jpg"&gt;it’s a famous one&lt;/a&gt;, showing orange dust on the Moon. The orange color is from &lt;a href="http://www.solarviews.com/cap/moon/moondust.htm"&gt;tiny glass particles that are volcanic in origin&lt;/a&gt; (the story of them finding the orange dust is pretty cool, and &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.sta4.html"&gt;you can read about it on the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if the movie guys put that particular number there on purpose or not, but they screwed up the code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure if I analyzed the picture more I’d find more stuff, but my geekery does have limits. Of course, if someone wants to examine the geometry of Dr. Manhattan holding the camera waist-high and the resulting tilt and angles of the picture, be my guest. I’ll just wait for the movie and think it’s cool either way.&lt;/p&gt;

As a case in point, consider &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126921.600-why-darwin-was-wrong-about-the-tree-of-life.html?page=1"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, from the current issue of &lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magazine&amp;#39;s cover depicts a plush, green tree bearing the words “Darwin Was Wrong.”  As P.Z. Myers &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/speaking_of_media_mangling.php"&gt;has noted&lt;/a&gt;, it is an annoying sign of creationist influence that revisions in a 150 year old theory are considered cover-worthy.  Larry Moran makes a similar point &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/darwin-was-wrong.html"&gt;in this post.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things get worse, oh so much worse, when you read the awful article itself.  Never have you seen a science writer try so hard to make so big a deal from such meager materials.  It turns out the breathaking news is that horizontal gene transfer among single-celled organisms means that the tree metaphor of evolution does not work so well for the earliest stages of life's history.  The article does point to a few reasons why the tree metaphor may be problematic for certain aspects of plant and animal evolution as well, but this too is mostly familiar stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

It reflects a poor understanding of the science and of history, in that it confuses long-standing recognition of the importance of environmental factors in gene expression with a sudden reinstatement of Lamarckian inheritance, and it simply isn&amp;#39;t — she&amp;#39;s missed the point of the science and she has caricatured Lamarck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some water fleas sport a spiny helmet that deters predators; others, with identical DNA sequences, have bare heads. What differs between the two is not their genes but their mothers' experiences. If mom had a run-in with predators, her offspring have helmets, an effect one wag called "bite the mother, fight the daughter." If mom lived her life unthreatened, her offspring have no helmets. Same DNA, different traits. Somehow, the experience of the mother, not only her DNA sequences, has been transmitted to her offspring.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That gives strict Darwinians heart palpitations, for it reeks of the discredited theory of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829). The French naturalist argued that the reason giraffes have long necks, for instance, is that their parents stretched their (shorter) necks to reach the treetops. Offspring, Lamarck said, inherit traits their parents acquired. With the success of Darwin's theory of random variation and natural selection, Lamarck was left on the ash heap of history. But new discoveries of what looks like the inheritance of traits acquired by parents--lab animals as well as people--are forcing biologists to reconsider Lamarckism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She's describing real and interesting phenomena, but it isn't new and it isn't revolutionary. These are results of plasticity and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/epigenetics.php"&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt;, and we aren't having heart palpitations over them (you're also going to have a difficult time finding any "strict Darwinians" in the science community who are even &lt;i&gt;surprised&lt;/i&gt; by this stuff). We load up pregnant women with folate and maternal vitamins and recommendations to eat well, and we tell them not to get drunk or smoke crack for a few months, because it is common sense and common knowledge that extra-genetic factors influence the health and development of the next generation. Genes don&amp;#39;t execute rigid, predetermined programs of development — they are responsive to the environment and can express radically different patterns in different contexts. The same genes build a caterpillar and a butterfly, the difference is in the hormonal environment that selects which genes will be active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the same story with the water fleas. Stressed and unstressed mothers switch on different genes in their offspring epigenetically, which lead to the expression of different morphology. It's very cool stuff, but evolutionary biologists are about as shocked by this as they are by the idea that malnourished mothers have underweight babies. That environmental influences can have multi-generational effects, and that developmental programs can cue off of the history of the germ line, is not a new idea, especially among developmental biologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just wrong on evolution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water fleas pop out helmets immediately if mom lived in a world of predators; by Darwin's lights, a population of helmeted fleas would take many generations to emerge through random variation and natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It misses the whole point. The population of water fleas have a genetic attribute that allows the formation of spines under one set of conditions, and suppresses them under others. This gene regulatory network did not pop into existence in a single generation! If it did, then Begley would have a big story, evolution would have experienced a serious blow, and we'd all be looking a little more carefully into this 'intelligent design' stuff. The pattern of gene regulation &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the product of many generations of variation and selection; only the way it was expressed in a phenotype experienced a shift within a single generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also not Lamarckism. It&amp;#39;s another of those short and simple-minded myths perpetuated by high-school textbooks that Lamarck and Darwin had competing explanations for the same phenomena. They did not. This story of giraffes stretching their necks is an example of the purported inheritance of acquired characteristics … and here&amp;#39;s some headline news, Darwin proposed exactly the same thing! Darwin did not have a solid theory of heredity, and he himself proposed a mechanism of pangenesis which permitted the inheritance of characters by use and disuse and by injury or malformation. The key difference is that Darwin proposed that these variations could lead to the formation of new species; Lamarck believed in the fixity of species, and thought that a species would merely express a constrained range of forms in differing environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both were wrong. A concept called the Weismann barrier emerged in the late 19th century, which suggested that the only influences that can be transmitted across generations are those that affect the germ line, the cells that give rise to sperm and egg, and that modification of the somatic tissues alone would not propagate. This is correct, and it's still true: nothing in these reports suggest anything but that when perturbed by environmental stressors, gametes can switch on different genetic programs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think epigenetics and plasticity are important and play a role in evolution, certainly, but these kinds of elaborations on how cells interact do not imply in any way that there is a revolution in evolution, or that evolutionary biology has had it all wrong, or that this is heresy in progress. It&amp;#39;s also annoying to see all the vague handwaving about discrediting a &amp;quot;Darwinian model&amp;quot; — what Darwinian model? These discoveries are about mechanisms of genetic inheritance, and Darwin didn&amp;#39;t have a valid mechanism in the first place. In that sense, the only real heresy that counted was Mendel&amp;#39;s. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/sharon_begley_how_could_you.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/xqWreNJRG7c" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232661902947"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/more_on_autism_whitehousegov">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f3aa05ae658539fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">More on Autism @ Whitehouse.gov</title><published>2009-01-22T22:03:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-22T22:03:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/more_on_autism_whitehousegov" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Long Road ahead by dmyze11" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/145924953_8f2bc0241b_m.jpg" height="180" alt="" width="240"&gt;In yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/joepublic/2009/jan/21/uk-autism-bill"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, Mark Lever, chief executive of the &lt;a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt;, writes about a new autism bill that has been chosen to be taken forward for parliamentary debate. The bill calls for the need to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;	&lt;li&gt;strengthen information about the numbers of people with autism and their needs, in order to improve local planning of services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;improve inter-agency working to secure effective transition for young people with autism who are moving from child to adult services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;ensure access to appropriate support and services for people with autism in adult life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The autism bill is focused on services, on access to those services and on assisting individuals on the spectrum in transitioning among programs as they age. This is a much needed focus in discussions about autism issues which have tended to be primarily about children (and quite young children at that), and how early detection and early intervention might best serve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tendency to focus on autism in (young) children is apparent in an article in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/on-parenting/2009/01/21/autism-screening-tops-obamas-medical-to-do-list.html"&gt;US News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt; about the section about autism at &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/"&gt;Whitehouse.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The autism section is under the agenda item of &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/disabilities/"&gt;Disabilities&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/"&gt;Whitehouse.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora has already noted the "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_social_todo_about_the_medical_to-do"&gt;social todo about the medical to-do&lt;/a&gt;" and I was a bit perplexed to read in &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/on-parenting/2009/01/21/autism-screening-tops-obamas-medical-to-do-list.html"&gt;US News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;

Autism is the only &lt;em&gt;disorder or disease &lt;/em&gt;mentioned explicitly in Obama's 24-point agenda.&lt;em&gt;[my emphases]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the "four hefty bullet points" on autism, "Universal screening for all infants for autism disorders, as well as re-screening for all 2-year-olds" is point #4, though &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/on-parenting/2009/01/21/autism-screening-tops-obamas-medical-to-do-list.html"&gt;US News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt; writer Nancy Shute refers to it as "the biggie." If children are diagnosed earlier, she writes, they can then start treatment which will be "more effective";  a national screening program would, it is said, "help reduce the number of kids falling through the cracks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/9-years-ago-charlie-was-diagnosed/"&gt;My own son was diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; just as he was turning two years old in 1999 and getting him started at a young age in educational therapies and treatments was crucial----and just as, if not more, important are support services (noted in item #1 at &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/disabilities/"&gt;Whitehouse.gov on autism&lt;/a&gt;) and in particular life-long services for children and adults with ASD (noted in item #2 at &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/disabilities/"&gt;Whitehouse.gov on autism&lt;/a&gt;). There's much that Charlie has learned, and continues to learn, as he has gotten older. He's got a whole life ahead of him to live: Getting diagnosed was an important first step, but just the very, very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to focus not only on autism as something affecting children and young children in particular, but as a lifelong disability. Different individuals on the spectrum will need different levels of support throughout their lives, but a focus on the road ahead---a long-term view----on the needs of adolescents, teenagers, and adults is absolutely necessary, and starting right now.&lt;/p&gt;

HOWEVER, for those who HAVE NOT SEEN THE SHOW: YOU CAN STILL ENTER THE CONTEST.

So, if you have never watched the show you may want to go ahead and rent the DVDs rather than tune in now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The series was created by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Abrams"&gt;J.J.

I assume the whole group dropped acid a few moments prior to the show's creation, because that's the only way I assume a person could fathom of genetically altered &lt;a href="http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Polar_bear"&gt;polar bears&lt;/a&gt; that hang out on a tropical island and a &lt;a href="http://lost.wikia.com/wiki/The_Monster"&gt;smoke monster&lt;/a&gt; that shows you your past, judges you, and then either kills you or apparently gives you superpowers – or, at the very least, an uncanny ability to tell when it's going to rain, and an irrepressible urge to hold your hands skyward when you're right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232659677871"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=1908">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e7b7515d6e8ddaf6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="anti-vaccine lunacy"/><category term="autism"/><category term="vaccines"/><category term="Riverdale"/><category term="New Jersey"/><category term="William Budesheim"/><title type="html">Small town mayor vs. science</title><published>2009-01-22T21:26:52Z</published><updated>2009-01-22T21:26:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/01/22/small-town-mayor-vs-science/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2008/10/06/riverdale-nj-home-of-anti-scientific-propaganda/?preview=true&amp;amp;preview_id=711&amp;amp;preview_nonce=2970032fad"&gt;Back in October, I blogged&lt;/a&gt; about Mayor William Budesheim of Riverdale, NJ because of the anti-vaccine propaganda being perpetuated on the town’s official website. I’d emailed the mayor and hadn’t heard a response from him until now, not a reply to my email but in the comments section of the original blog linked to above. The mayor wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I received only one complaint about the website’s balanced vaccine information. I extended to this person, a resident of Riverdale, the opportunity to include her pro-vaccine information on the website. In addition, I also offered an invitation to assist in any way that she could to make the website better. To date (January 18, 2009) she has not even acknowledged my invitations to her. Parental rights are supreme! As George Washington warned us, “Government is not eloquence; it is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous and a fearful master.” Don’t give such a master the power of preemptive medication of our children, especially treatments that are not, in spite of your assertions, universally accepted as efficacious and/or safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a word was left out of Washington’s quote.  It should read: dangerous servant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I responded to the mayor again both by email and in the comments section of the orginal blog below his comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I received only one complaint about the website’s balanced vaccine information.”&lt;br&gt;
It’s still factually incorrect whether you received one complaint, zero complaints, or 1 million complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To date (January 18, 2009) she has not even acknowledged my invitations to her.”&lt;br&gt;
Well that’s too bad. I’d happily take up the offer and provide you with access to REAL scientific information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Parental rights are supreme! ”&lt;br&gt;
Then why do tax-payer dollars go towards child protective services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As George Washington warned us, ‘Government is not eloquence; it is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous and a fearful master.’ ”&lt;br&gt;
George Washington also owned slaves; times change and Washington didn’t even know what a vaccine was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course all of this talk about the politics of whether or not vaccines should be mandated is totally irrelevant to the fact that the data on your website is still completely wrong. And I’ve already provided you with a list of reputable sources, including the most reputable medical institutions in the country to back up my position. All this has been compiled here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dangeroustalk.net/a-team/Vaccines"&gt;http://www.dangeroustalk.net/a-team/Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recommend specifically consulting with the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Medical Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and U.S. Dept. of Health &amp;amp; Human Resources. Ask them if they think vaccines aren’t universally accepted as efficacious and/or safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or visit Every Child By Two:  &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ecbt.org/"&gt;http://www.ecbt.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or my own website: &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.stopjenny.com/"&gt;http://www.stopjenny.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you find any fact on the Stop Jenny site that is inaccurate or flat-out wrong and you let us know about it along with a reputable scientific source that backs it up, we will make the correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would expect nothing less from a government website. In fact, I would expect a government website to never have made such poor quality misinformation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the claims on the Riverdale, NJ town website, there remains no real medical controversy over vaccine safety and vaccines remain the most effective and successful means of disease provention the human species has ever produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I await the Mayor’s response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a good scientist always looks to the contrapositive: what about other familiar shapes that are not easy to make? How common are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/12/27/350-accidental-cartography-between-cartocacoethes-and-blatant-pareidolia/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/01/america_naan.jpg" alt="America in naan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, pretty common. The fun website &lt;a href="http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/12/27/350-accidental-cartography-between-cartocacoethes-and-blatant-pareidolia/"&gt;Strange Maps&lt;/a&gt; has some good examples of countries and continents appearing in bread, rocks, and clouds. My favorite is Australia in a puddle. What are the odds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d say pretty good. It’s what our brains do. We should use those very same brains to understand that the brain tricks us sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simple. It’s thought-provoking. It’s revealing. And besides, I couldn’t think of anything else to ask you all today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So . . . . Newcomb’s Paradox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly superior being presents you with two boxes, one open and one closed. In the open box there is a thousand-dollar bill. In the closed box there is either one million dollars or there is nothing. You are to choose between taking both boxes or taking the closed box only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The being claims that he is able to predict what any human being will decide to do. If he predicted you would take only the closed box, then he placed a million dollars in it. But if he predicted you would take both boxes, he left the closed box empty. Furthermore, he has run this experiment with 9999 people before, and has been right every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem like an easy problem, but there is a lot going on here. Let’s see you wrap your brain around it.

I was not  there, but my colleague and friend Rob Roser at Fermilab was there, and sent me a very nice bulleted summary.  So, you are getting this second hand, and people who were there can add nuances in the comments, but here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Energy is the defining issue of our time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addressing the environment is the major reason Chu took on this job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These problems provide a tremendous opportunity for the DOE, but it comes with a burden: we can not fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DOE is the principal supporter of physical sciences in the US, and the physical sciences are the conernstone of prosperity for the US future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was part of the message of the “&lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/html/11463/11463_revisions.pdf"&gt;Rising Above the Gathering Storm&lt;/a&gt;” report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DOE should endeavor to replace the great industrial labs that no longer exist as they once did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DOE will be the “go to” organization for a multitude of key problems — will depend on all labs to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DOE can quite literally “save the world” by developing a sound energy policy going forward, and invent new science that will provide new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our current use of energy not sustainable — have to move forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are facing something society has never been asked to do before: to deal with ominous problems with climate change. If half of the things climate science tells us are half true, we have a huge problem on our hands and the DOE has to work to provide those solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Obama administration is creating a new Energy and Climate Change Council which will serve as a coordinating body including all stake holders in this arena.  DOE is first and formost in this but Interior, Agriculture, Treasury and Defense etc. all play a role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DOE is the science and technology “arm of energy”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a core of truly oustanding scientists at the national labs, and these labs have trained many successful scientists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The national labs are “crown jewels that the US doesn’t want to lose”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restimulation of the economy is #1 on the priority list.  DOE will get considerable funds in the stimulus package, not just to get the economy going but to provide a long term path for the US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can’t be completely overwhelmed by the short term economic woes; we need to still find a path to solve our long term problems.  The DOE has to invent transformative technologies that will allow us to get to the next level of energy independence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chu sees a lot of young and middle age scientists shifting careers to deal with energy, and the DOE is optimistic to capture the best and brightest to work on these issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am truly awed by the vision presented by Chu here, and so hopeful that we can get our country back on a path to long term prosperity by supporting research in the physical sciences.  At least half of our present economy relies on the knowledge gained in the 20th century about our physical world…one can only imagine the revolutions to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several employees were in the building at the time, said Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Kathi Di Nicola. She said the SUV hit the front door of the clinic two or three times, damaging the clinic's front door and surrounding stonework.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When Di Nicola arrived at the clinic, she said the man had gotten out of the SUV and was pacing around it, holding a crucifix and chanting. "He was agitated and he was saying, 'shut down this Auschwitz,' " she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violent, unthinking, incoherent, and flaunting his piety. Typical.&lt;/p&gt;

Got on a train. Then stood in line for over three hours in below-freezing weather, shoulder to shoulder with millions of my fellow citizens. All to see this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/bush_leaving.jpg" title="Bush leaves the Capitol"&gt;&lt;img width="100%" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/bush_leaving.jpg" alt="Bush leaves the Capitol"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a photo of Bush leaving the building, a few minutes after Obama was sworn in. The transition is surprisingly emphatic. I managed to clamber on top of a raised platform meant for TV cameras, leaving me with an essentially direct and unobstructed view of Obama taking the oath of office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to describe the feeling of participating in such a historic moment. The general camaraderie and good feeling and excitement was like nothing I have ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long afternoon trying to restore feeling in my toes, I put on a tux (which is by no means a familiar sartorial choice), and joined in congratulating Obama in the somewhat more intimate confines of the Midwestern Inaugural Ball.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/obamas_dance.jpg" title="Barack &amp;amp; Michelle Obama dance"&gt;&lt;img width="100%" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/01/obamas_dance.jpg" alt="Barack &amp;amp; Michelle Obama dance"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Doesn’t he look happy and relaxed? It was an historic and magical day. But, as Obama tells us, now it is time to remake America. And it won’t be easy.&lt;/p&gt;

Not so interesting as &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/disabilities/"&gt;the plan&lt;/a&gt; has been sitting out there for months first on change.gov, and now has been transferred over to whitehouse.gov.  Most of you have probably read it.  But--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is the discrepancy between how this plan is portrayed by U.S. News as being on the "medical to-do list" with the medical aspects emphasized and how this plan is portrayed on the actual government site.  The autism plan does not appear under the Health Care Agenda, nor is there a medical agenda listed.  The president's autism plan is a sub-category of his &lt;em&gt;Disabilities&lt;/em&gt; plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a subtle but critical difference.  The Disabilities Agenda is a &lt;em&gt;social to-do list&lt;/em&gt; not a medical one.  It's about equal access and human rights.  Is the placement of the autism plan into the same category as other disabilities, rather than into a medical category, an indication of autism's relevance to &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt;, not a medical, issues?  And what does the discrepancy say about the bias of  the U.S. News reporter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a side note, I do agree with U.S. news in calling early screening for everyone "a tall order," if only because the diagnostic process (and diagnostic criteria) remains subjective.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1232644865094"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/22/when-belief-kills/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f7c4f06b3c2b654</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">When belief kills</title><published>2009-01-22T17:07:42Z</published><updated>2009-01-22T17:07:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/22/when-belief-kills/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Where does religious freedom end? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important question, a vital one. At times, a matter literally of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin, the parents of Madeline Kara Neumann are going to stand trial soon for killing their child. &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/21/us/21faith.html?_r=4&amp;amp;pagewanted=1"&gt;She had juvenile diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Her parents did not take her to get medically treated, but instead prayed over her. &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/DiabetesResource/story?id=4536593"&gt;Last March, she died of diabetic ketoacidosis&lt;/a&gt;: she dehydrated, and her body basically shut down. She was 11 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs in people with diabetes who don’t get insulin. It is almost completely preventable with regular insulin shots, a simple medical procedure. In other words, had Kara been diagnosed with diabetes — and that’s a relatively easy disease to diagnose in children during routine medical checkups — she would almost certainly be alive today. Medical science provides children with diabetes the ability to live a relatively normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so, so sad; the death of a child, especially one that was almost certainly completely preventable, is an awful thing to contemplate. But we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to think about it, because it appears that Kara’s death was her parents’ fault. From the New York Times article linked above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Neumanns… are known locally as followers of an online faith outreach group called Unleavened Bread Ministries, run by a preacher, David Eells. The site shares stories of faith healing and talks about the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear from the news reports (for example &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,341574,00.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgxTPwjj9vo"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=733033"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that the religious beliefs of the parents were to blame for this little girl’s death. I won’t beleaguer you with the details of knowing that faith healing doesn’t work beyond the placebo effect, and in the case of diabetes doesn’t work at all. What’s important to think about here is, if religion is behind Kara’s death — and we know that fringe religious beliefs of parents &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/faithhealing.html"&gt;have caused countless cases of children becoming sick or even dying&lt;/a&gt; — then what recourse does the justice system have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no doubts that many religious people would claim that they have the right to do as they see fit to take care of their children. A case can be made for that; I personally don’t want the government telling me what I can and cannot do to raise my child. But then, we already acknowledge that laws exist that govern this very thing. I cannot sell my child, or abuse her, or do any number of other things that violate her rights as a human. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, causing the death of a person takes away their human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this country, we have a right to believe what we want. I agree with that idea. However, we do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have the right to necessarily &lt;strong&gt;act&lt;/strong&gt; on those beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if my religion says I must pray by screaming at the top of my lungs at funerals? Or if it says I have to commit genocide to bring about the Rapture? Or if I can only get into Paradise by flying planes into buildings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these are not rhetorical or even hypothetical questions. Clearly, &lt;em&gt;religious rights have limits&lt;/em&gt;. According to the NYT article, the laws on the books about belief-related deaths vary from state to state, and the outcome of this trial may set precedents across the country. If it is indeed shown that the parents of this young girl caused her death due to their religious beliefs, then I sincerely hope they are locked away for a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the right to believe what you want. But you don’t have the right to allow that belief to cause harm to come to children under your care. And diabetes doesn’t care what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Not long. Via &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/01/22/the-us-airways-hudson-river-conspiracy/"&gt;SkepticBlog&lt;/a&gt; comes news of a conspiracy theorist claiming that the ditching doesn't make any sense. Brian Dunning at SkepticBlog does a good
job explaining what's so stupid about this, but there were two things about
it that I thought were particularly interesting from the point of view of a math and computer science geek.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately for me, for the most part my studies are straightforward and don't provoke much in the way of angst over whether what I am doing is ethical or whether I'm approaching a line I shouldn't approach or crossing a line I shouldn't cross. However, there's lots of research that flirts with the unethical and sometimes even crosses the line. Institutional review boards are there to oversee the ethics of clinical trials and protect the human subjects who participate in them, but they don't always function as they should. Moreover, even clinical trials that are not at all unethical can be compromised if the investigators cross the line in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ways such as using their own children for research subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

John, an unbeliever, and Craig, a Christian, have been working together on a project called “Purple State of Mind.” They have &lt;a href="http://www.purplestateofmind.com/home.php"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.purplestateofmind.com/video.php"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http://www.purplestateofmind.com/readit.php"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; (by Craig) with that title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Purple-State-Mind-Craig-Detweiler/dp/B0013V3MQE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dvd&amp;amp;qid=1232633808&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ra%2BN08Z3L._SL500_AA240_.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Purple State of Mind&lt;/em&gt; is all about the American culture wars, about people in red states and blue states getting along, about cooperation instead of competition, and about discussion instead of debate. It goes “beyond the politcal” according to the cover of the DVD, to where “it gets personal.” The subtitle of Craig’s book is “Finding Middle Ground in a Divided Culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Obama’s inauguration and message of hope and inclusiveness, it seems that these two guys have been onto something. Perhaps Americans are tired of fighting and being angry (I know I am), perhaps it’s actually possible for believers and unbelievers to be friends and to work together to make the world better for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I’ve invited John Marks and Craig Detweiler to talk to us about the topic of their choice. I asked them to each address the topic from their own perspective, and to give us some food for thought. Their articles are below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LET THEM EAT PURPLE CAKE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by John Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, in the giddy days right after the election victory of Barack Obama,  I walked into my favorite local café and encountered a baked and frosted miracle of political symbolism. It was a perfectly purple ‘Obama cake’, flavored and colored by beet juice, mixed with chocolate, served up in squares. Not only did I swallow the symbolism. I ate the cake, and it was delicious. I thought to myself, ‘Hunh, beets for dessert. It is a new day.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such were the whimsical tides of November 2008, when even the little things had a touch of the magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still happy that Obama won and feel confident that he was the only man for the job in the race. When his dessert shows up at the café, I still enjoy the frisson of a seemingly impossible dessert, a caloric analogy to the seeming improbability of his win. The moment of self-indulgent whimsy has passed, however, and I can’t help feeling my own triviality called to account as I pick up my newspaper and read about the latest nightmare in Gaza. Palestinians are “trapped, some among rotting corpses in a nightmarish landscape of deprivation”, says The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s more like it. That’s the world I thought I lived in, the one in which seasons of unmitigated joy come few and far between, in which guiltless whimsy is as rare as peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Mumbai, now Gaza, the inevitable return to the wars of absolute dichotomy, where two sides come to blows over differences about land, history, faith and culture. In the case of Gaza, most of the underlying reasons are now beside the point. Recently spilled blood serves as the principle argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over here, meanwhile, the bliss of transformation feels harder and harder to sustain, as everyone prepares to survive the downturn or armor up for political battle or both. The fight over Rick Warren’s invocation is only the first of many conflicts to come. I personally look forward to that first Supreme Court appointment, when Obama will have to dodge incoming mortar from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I hold out the hope that something has, in fact, changed. It’s not really about being “purple”, whatever that means. In retrospect, I see a preciousness in the idea of the “purple state”, that happy land where neither red nor blue exist, where the mellow in-betweeners, the so-called “real” people, get together and love each other up. In that scenario, purple becomes a gimmick, a version of that beet-frosted cake, because it trivializes an unavoidable truth. Our differences are real, and in some cases, blood-stained. Purple, at its worst, ignores the darkness as a child ignores death. At its best, its hue nods to a history of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to live with death, and we have to face our differences. As we go into this next phase, then, that is the key point in having a conversation across enemy lines. It’s not about being nice or striking the proper tone, not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s about taking ourselves and our concerns seriously enough to demand the utmost of ourselves and our political and cultural opponents, the utmost in moral and intellectual rigor, the utmost in compassion and decency. Part of the problem for the last two decades has been a curious tendency to treat our great national debates as a cross between a game and a comedy routine. Oh, we insisted that our issues were matters of life and death, whether abortion or gay marriage, whether freedom of speech or the right to bear arms, but we hired huge numbers of professionals to fight those battles for us, our proxies, our mercenaries, our lobbyists, our activists, and their handiwork often enough turned the entire public discourse into a freak show fueled by the rage virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our national conversation became a version of American Idol, the emphasis on empty gestures of cruelty, vapid sentiment and specious notions of achievement. We allowed ourselves to see this massively complex and mysteriousness country in the broadest of show biz clichés. Whether gay or straight, Christian or skeptic, black or white, we were either going to Hollywood or going home. As we now know, there is  a price to be paid for triviality in bitterness, frustration and self-disgust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sham dialogues on cable news network, the Hannity and Colmes effect, were as deceptive in their own way as Wall Street practices that hid the truth about the markets. Now that our eyes are open, it is time to walk away from the game. It is time to despise the trivialization of those who have different worldviews, time to stop believing that reality has anything to do with television, and time to entertain the possibility that our divisions can take us to some very dark places, even Gaza and Mumbai, if we don’t wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is everyone aware that high unemployment is one of the indispensable keys to homegrown terrorism in places like Pakistan and Palestine? Has anyone seen our unemployment stats lately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that we’re headed for that kind of violence quite yet. I am saying that we flirt with disaster if we ignore the presence of true division and pretend that we can joke or jive our way past it. In December, I traveled to Gettysburg and registered the presence of 675,000 hungry ghosts in the winter fields of south central Pennsylvania. The memory of that violence lives on, just as the hope of the Gettysburg Address does in the election of Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget the cake. Barack’s the real thing. You can hear it in his speeches, when he invokes Abraham Lincoln. You can sense it in the gravity with which he addresses the economy.  He knows what lies underneath. He knows the cost to be paid for negligence. Do we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTER THE INAUGURATION:   EMBRACING DISSENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Craig Detweiler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Spring, barnstorming across America with my atheist college roommate and our dialogical documentary &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.purplestateofmind.com"&gt;Purple State of Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we felt a bit like presidential candidates.   We engaged in heated debates on college campuses.   We stopped by churches and synagogues to rally the faithful.   We answered phone calls on local radio shows.  While Barack and Hillary were swiping at each other, John Marks and I were taking heat from animated audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics wondered why John seemed so negative, almost acting like a bully.   Christians wondered why I took so much abuse from John without punching back.    Both sides were disappointed that their representative failed to champion their side with more authority.   The crowds wanted a bloody boxing match.   Instead, we offered a perverse bit of peace, love and understanding.   Tired of the gridlock created by the culture wars, we offered a different way of being, promoting a purple state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era of red state and blue states, who proved the most purple candidate?   John and I pulled for Obama in the primaries.   He emerged as the candidate most likely to inspire substantive change.   His conciliatory, bridge-building speeches pushed past the divisive politics that preceded him.   Every previous election in my lifetime felt like a referendum on the past—the responsibilities of the 1950s versus the freedom of the 1960s.   Your opinion of Vietnam, Woodstock and Haight-Ashbury was reflected in your voting record.   But Barack came of age after that tumultuous era.   His approach to governing felt pragmatic rather than ideological.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief moment, Sarah Palin managed to reignite her party’s faithful.  She dusted off the old divide-and-conquer script, begun by Patrick Buchanan, polished by Lee Atwater, perfected by Karl Rove.   Palin put a positive spin on negativism.   Her candidacy was an entertaining sideshow.   John McCain even abandoned his own principles by embracing racism and scare tactics.    But the depths of the economic depression trumped their appeal to our worst instincts.   A majority of Americans chose hope over fear, the future over the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, even before the inauguration, the culture war reared its decidedly ugly head.   By inviting Pastor Rick Warren to deliver the opening invocation, Obama stepped into the firestorm swirling around gay marriage and California’s Proposition 8.   Reaching across the aisle only resulted in more flames coming his way.   Those who viewed the Warren invocation as a political maneuver found equal calculation in the late addition of Episcopal bishop Gene Robinson to inauguration week.   While SkepChick readers may disdain all prayers in such a public setting, Robinson vowed to offer an inclusive invocation, crafting “a message that everyone in the nation can identify with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thrilled that Obama made room for people who not only disagree with each other, but possibly even with him.   We desperately need a leader who can listen to his critics, who can bring people together across the ir/religious, political and cultural divide.   I embarked on the Purple State project because I need a voice of dissent in my life.   The doubts of John Marks make me a better believer.  He keeps me honest, keeps me questioning, keeps from getting comfortable.    Can we continue to make room for the loyal opposition, even when it causes complications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I join John Marks in a call for more than a new found cooperation.   We don’t expect people to abandon their principles, to set aside significant differences.   But the gravity of our current crisis surely forces us to subsume our agendas for the sake of the greater good.  There will be plenty of time to argue after we’ve gotten out of this mess.   Until then, I desperately need to come alongside those who want to forge a future for America.  We can no longer afford to be entertained by surface distances or ideological divides.  It is time to be adults–to work with skeptical neighbors, faithful friends, and disbelieving college roommates.&lt;/p&gt;
