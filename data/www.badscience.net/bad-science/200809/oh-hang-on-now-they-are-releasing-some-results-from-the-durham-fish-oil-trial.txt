Oh, hang on, now they are releasing some results from the Durham fish
oil"trial"?

September 25th, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in bad science |

I think it’s clear now that Madeleine Portwood and Dave Ford, the
leading figures behind the Durham fish oil"trial", will be providing
us with comedy and teaching opportunities for many years to come.

First they said they were doing a"trial".

Then when everyone pointed out it was incompetent research, they said
that didnt matter, because it wasn’t a"trial", it was an"initiative"
(and even retrospectively changed the wording of their press release
online…).

Then when people asked for details of what they were doing, how they
were going to measure success, they refused to say, even when hundreds
of people asked, using the freedom of information act.

Then when the GCSE results came out, everyone could see a slowing in
the rate of improvement.

Then Durham announced that they weren’t going to release the results
after all, and claimed - defying all reason - that they’d never said
they were doing to, and it was never their intention to analyse the
results, or tell anyone what they were.

Now they have released the results.

You really, seriously, couldn’t make this up.

Initially they said they were going to measure GCSE performance of
individual children against what they predicted the children should
have attained (ingenious!). Their current analysis is even more
incompetent. I’ve got to run out of the door, will add links later.
Below is what I sent to the Northern Echo, and Barry Nelson, after he
sent me their press release. I’m posting it so you can see what
happens behind the news. After receiving it he wrote these two
articles:

SCHOOL FISH OIL STUDY GIVES SCIENTISTS FOOD FOR THOUGHT

A north east council’s study into the effects of a fish oil dietary
supplement on pupils’ GCSE exam results may have given scientists food
for thought.

Detailed analysis of the outcome of the initiative, launched by Durham
County Council in advance of last year’s GCSE exams, shows that pupils
who took the Omega-3 supplement did better than those who did not.

First they said they were doing a trial, then when it was over they
refused to release the results, and claimed – in defiance of
everything they’d already said at the time - that it was never their
intention to do a trial. Now they claim to have some results. This is
extraordinarily irresponsible and unprofessional, Durham Council have
performed an experiment giving 6 capsules a day to thousands of
children, and they have a responsibility to behave ethically and
transparently. They have failed in this regard.

And the council’s education chiefs believe that although the results
of the study are not definitive, they could now justify more
clinically-based scientific trials

This is a meaningless term, a revealingly incompetent"jargony" misuse
of basic scientific terminology.

to determine once and for all whether fish oil supplements can and do
boost educational attainment among young people.

They could easily have determined if fish oil capsules are beneficial
in this"trial", if they had performed it competently, which they chose
not to, despite all offers of help and criticism at the time.

Dave Ford, Head of Achievement for Durham County Council’s Children
and Young People’s Services said:" We have always maintained that if
the outcome was positive, it would then be for the scientists to
examine in more detail.

Dave Ford said he knew the results would be positive before it even
began. I’m not surprised: this"trial" was flawed by design from the
outset.

" The findings of our study suggest it may now be worth them following
it up in more depth through proper clinical trials."

Durham could very easily have performed a proper trial were it not for
the incompetence of Dave Ford and Madeleine Portwood.

Initially, just over 3,000 Year 11 pupils began the study, taking the
Omega-3 tablets at school and at home.

By the time GCSE examinations came around, 832 pupils had 80 per cent
or greater compliance.

This is appalling. 2,168 of their subjects dropped out of the trial.
They must count these people in the results. It is incompetent not to
do so. This makes the rest of their claimed results even more
meaningless.

Mr Ford and his colleagues then sought to identify the same number of
Year 11pupils who had not taken the supplement and match them to those
who had, according to school, gender, prior attainment and social
background.

This is completely different to what they claimed they were going to
do and measure two years ago.

Mr Ford and his colleagues repeatedly refused all requests from myself
and dozens of other academics and interested members of the public,
including under the freedom of information act in exasperation, where
we simply asked what they were planning to do and what they were going
to measure in their experiment on thousands of Durham children. They
refused to tell us.

It is vitally important that people performing experiments on children
are clear what they are doing to them, and what they are measuring,
before they begin, otherwise they can move the goalposts and get a
false positive result afterwards, simply by measuring things lots of
different ways until they get the positive result that they want.

We gave them every opportunity to do the right thing and describe what
they were going to do, and what they were going to measure. They
refused to tell us, entirely as predicted, they have moved the
goalposts and are measuring a"positive result" in a completely new
way. Perhaps they have done this because the way they initially said
they were going to measure outcomes did not give them the result they
want?

This is incompetent and means that the results are entirely
meaningless.

The GCSE results of 629 ‘matched pairs’ – fish oil takers and non-fish
oil takers - were then analysed.

In selectively only looking at the results from pupils who were highly
adherent to the capsules regime, they have skewed their sample, and
are simply measuring children who are likely to be more adherent to
work at school, harder working, better performing, different
backgrounds, from completely different families, and so on. This is
laughably incompetent science, in an experiment performed on thousands
of Durham children.

" To reach comparative levels of their attainment prior to the study,
we used a nationally accepted system which took into account the
results for each pupil at Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3," said Mr Ford.

" At both stages, the difference in predicted GCSE outcomes between
the groups was on average less than three points.

" However, following the fish oil initiative, the difference in Key
Stage 4 (GCSE) results between those who had taken the supplement and
those who had not rose

to 17.7 points.

They are not comparing like with like, so their results are
meaningless in any case, but it is impossible to understand from this
statement what they have measured, how they have matched samples, and
so on. That is the problem with incompetent people doing science as
PR, and communicating their results in press releases. I will be
contacting them to clarify.

" If there had been no difference in attainment between the two
groups, we would be tempted to dismiss the benefits of Omega-3," said
Mr Ford.

I very much doubt that Mr Ford will ever dismiss the benefits of
omega-3.

" However there seem to be some very clear indications that pupils
taking the supplement do significantly better."

Rubbish. Mr Ford has produced meaningless data from an incompetent
"trial" performed on thousands of children. I believe it is unethical
to perform incompetent research on children, as it wastes goodwill,
exposes people to risks unnecessarily, and misleads parents and
children into believing that they are participating in a project which
will produce useful information for everyone. In reality this was
nothing more than a marketing project for some pills and, I’m sorry to
say, a vanity project for some people in Durham council. It is
scientifically worse than worthless, because it has been used, and
will be used, to mislead the public.

Mr Ford said the Council made no claim that the results of its GCSE
study could be attributed only to Omega-3 supplementation.

This is laughable. Everything Mr Ford has said in public for several
years now has been to promote the use of Omega-3 supplementation.

" Other factors may be responsible for the difference in performance -
for instance, the benefit may be a placebo effect, or it may be that
those students who achieved 80 per cent compliance were better
organised and had families who provided support at home and so might
have done better anyway," he added.

Glad to see he acknowledges this. Then why did he decide to perform
his experiment on thousands of Durham children incompetently in this
way? He was told before he began that this experiment was wasteful and
scientifically meaningless. He could have done a proper study for no
more money, he chose not to. Why?

" But taking all this into account, it is our view that this study has
produced some interesting and possibly exciting issues for further
investigation that could be the basis for future scientific trials,
and that is all we ever set out to achieve.

" The road to determining whether there are education benefits to be
had from taking fish oil supplements was always going to be a long
one, but I hope the findings of our study have taken the journey one
step further."

Glancing (only 5 minutes) at Durham’s Overview & Scrutiny Committee

The key stage 4 document (bottom of webpage) is singularly unhelpful
on the subject.

Here is a report to the venerable committee in Sept 2007 - again no
fish oils….but it does say (talking about KS4 results): “John Dellar
pointed out the improvements that had been made were so good
that it was now difficult to make further significant improvements. He
explained that in addition to the hard work by pupils and parents
these
improvements were down to the investment by the County Council in key
stage 4 over the last 4/5 years, the focus from the BETT Team, and the
unique approach of schools in working together.
The Chairman expressed his delight at the results, and members
recognised
the improvements that have been”

Most so-called “studies” in nutrition that I have read would not get a
passing grade in any science class that I taught. The vast majority of
them completely ignore two fundamental rules of science, namely:

1) If you aren’t measuring, you are guessing.

2) If you are measuring the wrong thing(s), the answer(s) you get will
be meaningless.

The study of nutrition seems to be more closely related to religion
than to science.

Good work. There was an interesting piece on Radio 4 the other day
(PM, I think) in which someone was proposing an experiment with fish
oil supplements for young prisoners. A woman from the Howard League
came on and said very robustly that a pill wasn’t a solution and what
young prisoners needed was not to be locked up all day but to have
some decent food (prison food for young people is appalling,
apparently), fresh air, exercise etc.

Blimey - I had not noticed that DCC were actually ‘advertising’ eye q
in their uber-positive press releases back in September, 2006:

At least Newcastle CC, watching their near neighbours closely, were
more circumspect about fish oils (1st Nov, 2006)

WRITTEN 3 From Councillor Lambert: Question
“Nearby Durham County Council has recently brought in fish oil
supplements for 5,000 GCSE pupils with the aim of boosting
concentration levels and educational performance. Given the promising
results of this experiment will Newcastle City Council (LEAS) consider
a similar scheme for the city’s GCSE students?”

Written Reply from Councillor Cott, Executive Member for Children and
Young People:
“The City Council is greatly interested in ways in which outcomes can
be improved for children and young people and we have watched with
interest the initiative which has been put in place by Durham County
Council. However, professional opinion seems to be divided as to
whether fish oil supplements do in fact help to improve outcomes and
it would therefore be sensible to wait until evaluation can take place
before looking at this further.
It goes without saying that any discussion around providing fish oil
supplements would require consultation and working in partnership with
health services, schools, parents and students (probably through the
Food in Schools Group). This is not an initiative which the City
Council could pursue without widespread consensus.”

BTW what happened to the Norfolk Fish Oil Study?

Oddly, in April Durham Council said that “it was never intended that
there would be scientific analysis of the data. All that was being
sought was the number of children taking up the offer of capsules and
a comparison of GCSE results from the previous year.”

I wonder how they got from this to an approach where “[t]o reach
comparative levels of their attainment prior to the study, we used a
nationally accepted system which took into account the results for
each pupil at Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3″.

What happened to the 200 pupils who achieved 80% compliance, but
weren’t used in the analysis? Couldn’t they find good matches for a
quarter of their pupils?

Lemonade Lily - Glancing (only 5 minutes) at Durham’s Overview &
Scrutiny Committee papers (infact the Scrutiny Sub-Committee for the
Development Lifelong Learning) -I am clearly a few fish oil tablets
short myself - ‘cos I can’t see fish oils mentioned - won’t find any
scrutiny of this trial/study/initiative (delete as currently
applicable) because the DD (Durham Defence) is:

“This initiative was planned by Officers of the Authority as an
opportunity for our autonomous schools and as such did not require
formal council approval.”

So, the centrally planned, implemented and managed “Brainchild” of
David Ford, involving 3,000 pupils and £1m (allegedly at retail
value)worth of fish oil caspsules, with press releases and subsequent
(flawed and laughable) statistical work by DCC, required no scrutiny
by members.

And we trust this lot to run education for our children in Durham?

DCC should publish David Ford’s original plan - he must have surely
had one, even if it was never scrutinised by members - musn’t he??????

Only by comparing what his intentions were in the form of the
project’s aims, objectives, methodology and evaluation criteria, will
we ever understand what actually went on here.

At the moment, we are playing intellectual tennis without a net. Our
critical serves are being made with the net of rational scrutiny up.
DCC’s returns of serve are with that net down!

They say what is politically expedient for them and expect to be
believed.

Show us the plan and let us judge!

Well Ben, it looks like they skim-read your book and have tried to
retro-shoehorn in some panache. Or at least some terms that made it
sound more like a trial and less like a total farce.

But what can be done to counter the moronic miracle fish oil pill
stories that will appear in the Telegraph now?

I think everyone hates seeing councils wasting money (damn council tax
rises to pay for joke science using kids a guinea pigs etc etc),
especially money that should be spent on textbooks for our kids that
want to learn. Quick, someone get in a scathing piece that hangs on
that premise into the papers…

Durham’s position has changed so many times now that I’m not sure what
they were (or were not) planning. Nor am I sure what they have
released and what they have hung onto. Maybe that was the plan once
you’d got hold of the story? Release enough contradictory public
statements to ensure that no-one can tell what their position actually
is. Or was.

Did it go something like this?

‘We’re running a trial. And we’re going to analyse the results to see
if fish oil pills solve complex social problems.’
“This trial hasn’t been planned properly - you won’t get any
meaningful results”
‘No, wait - it is not a trial, it’s an initiative.’
“What are you doing and how are you doing it?”
‘Not telling you.’
“What are you going to measure?”
‘Pupils’ scores compared with their expected grades’

“The GCSE results are out. How well did the fish oil pills work?”
‘Not telling you. We never planned to tell anyone what the results
were. Equazen supplied us with thousands of capsules purely so we
could have a look at their effects for ourselves. Secretly. In
private.’
‘No, wait - don’t go away. We’ve changed our minds and we are going to
release the results.’
“Did you measure children’s actual grades against their predicted
grades like you said you were going to?”
‘Uh, no. For some reason (which we are not disclosing at this time) we
measured something completely different.’
“Where’s the data?”
‘Erm.’

Which means it both is and is not a trial. The results are being
published and are not being published. They always and never meant to
analyse the data (which they aren’t going to show you). The
measurement was actual versus predicted grades - except when it wasn’t
and they changed it to measuring the performance of pupils who took
the pills versus the performance of those who didn’t. [Which made me
think of an article by Gary Taubes which referred to the Bias of
Compliance - NYT.

Let me get this right. Children who received what we might term a more
“homeopathic dose” of fish oil did significantly worse than those who
swallowed the pseudoscientific cobblers (and\or fish oil). We can
therefore make several conclusions:

1) GCSE results appear not to measure intelligence and\or
susceptibility to woo.

2) Homeopathic quantities of fish oil reduce academic achievement by
17.7 points on average

3) Ford and Portwood seem to think that GCSEs are measured in “points”
instead of being graded - or are arbitrarily assigning “points” to
grades. Am I cynical enough to think it’s possible to assign 1,000,000
points per grade and then tease out a tiny difference to something
that sounds huge? You bet I am.

4) Furthermore, as there is no evidence that fish oil improves
academic performance (Durham’s GCSE results were no better than the
national average, and below a simple extrapolation of previous trends)
it seems clear that whilst fish oil does not improve exam results,
being involved in a psuedo-scientific “trial” is genuinely bad for
your performance. Portwood and Ford should resign for their disastrous
effect upon Durham’s GCSE results forthwith.

Whilst I have performed no statistical analysis upon the results - nor
had any idea what the hell the methodology was meant to be - I believe
the same is true of Portwood and Ford. Therefore my analysis deserves
at least equal credence - eg print it out and wipe your arse on it.

Maybe the children thought they didnt need to revise as they had a
magic pill that would make them intelligent.

Medicalising non-medical issues will have negative effects.

It is no coincidence that this press release comes only a few days
after the announcement of the fish oil study funded by the Wellcome
Trust which hit the news about a week ago.

I assume that Portwood and Ford had been reluctant to attract more
adverse publicity for their effort. However, the involvement of the
Wellcome Trust - in a trial with completely different design and
objectives - gives them an opportunity to bathe in reflected limelight
and duck criticism.

I would be fascinated to know how the wheels turn in Durham Education
Department. If I was a native of Durham I would be asking tough
questions about what Ford and Portwood have been doing during company
time.

I assume that they will now release complete details of their
methodology on the website and publish their work in a peer reviewed
journal?

Ooh, near miss from flying pig!

I reckon they’ve fooled us all. If, as used to be jdc says, this both
is and is not a trial then what Durham have really been undertaking is
an experiment to test the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory.
Yes folks, this is their attempt to actually carry out a variation on
Schrodinger’s thought experiment on his cat but without using a cat
and thus avoiding the attention of the moggy lobby. Unfortunately, the
results have been confusing (it both has and hasn’t worked) and they
are attempting to obscure the real purpose of the experiment by making
us all thoroughly confused.

of 6th September 2006 refers to the trial/study/initiative - delete as
politically expediently applicable - as such) he was the Chief
Inspector of Schools in the Education Department of Durham County
Council and he would no doubt be aware of the fact that his department
and that of Social services were to be merged into a new department
called Children and Young People’s Services, under a new Corporate
Director. Having embarked on his “Brainchild” centrally planned,
implemented and managed trial/study/initiative (delete as applicable),
involving most of the county’s secondary schools, thousands of
children and a deal with a certain manufacturer of food supplements
amounting to (allegedly) £1m at retail values for free fish oil
capsules, Mr Ford was appointed to the post of Head of Achievement
Services in the new department. He says there are no plans to continue
to give fish oil capsules to children in Durham’s schools.

Found the link to Norfolk CC fish oil ‘trial’ in Eaton Hall Special
School in 2006

“Results of Fish Oil and Healthy Diet Study Revealed”

http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=182885

http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/fish_oil_study.shtml

The BBC article does say that the trial is not a scientific study as
there was no control group….

This is clearly just marketing for the fish oil company and councils
are the dupes.

Council officers are under huge pressure to hit targets. That is their
primary aim - the performance data - nothing else matters.

I was surprised and interested when this popped up on Look North local
news after BBC1 10pm News. The headline carried Durham’s claim that
the trial was a success, so I feared the worst. But then up popped a
clip of Dr Ben saying how useless the trial was and how it was
unethical. This was followed with clear explanation of three reasons
why the trial could be biased (as per Mr Ford’s comments above).

There was a clip of (I think) Mr Ford, trying to explain how they’ve
not been incompetent and how it was never meant to be a scientific
trial. But overall, I was thinking the report was pretty well balanced
and informative….until the very last comment of the reporter - “it’s
now down to parents to decide who to believe”!!! Noooooo.

This is the whole point! This isn’t a debate, Durham have made a claim
about the efficacy of fish oil, they’ve tested it (incompetently &
maybe unethically) and haven’t come up with anything like the standard
of proof required. To claim a positive outcome is therefore plain
wrong.

Equally, the ’scientists’ on the other side can’t say definitively
that fish oil doesn’t offer a benefit - it’s just that nothing Durham
have done supports their claim.

The Look North report had done pretty well in explaining part of the
complex issue but then ruined it by reducing it to a nice black and
white, Durham vs ’scientists’ popularity poll.

@ Kim and BobP

I mentioned the planned Welcome Trust Omega 3 trial on young offenders
to Ben a couple of weeks ago, and he is aware of it. I daresay he will
cast his critical eye over any progress as it emerges - early days
yet.

It does seem to be better planned (double blind, placebos, etc) than
the Durham mess. The only thing that worried me was the degree of
belief in a positive outcome by the organiser (John Stein, an academic
at Oxford but also the brother of the famous TV chef, Rick!).

Of course every experimenter must have some reason for believing
something positive would come from a study or you wouldn’t bother in
the first place but I do worry that there is a danger that a
rationally based belief in a positive outcome could become faith! And
that’s when the integrity of a trial may come under pressure as at
Durham.

So something to keep an eye on for the future though some years away
yet.

David Ford has made quite a few statements during this farce of the
“I/we believe” variety. In some cases he has qualified these with “and
many of our parents believe.”
The BBC Look North feature misled to some extent with all their
footage of primary school children and shot themselves in the foot by
saying that in the end it all came down to who you believe. That is
bad journalism, because it completely trivialises the important
substantive issue - the appropriate use of science and rational
thinking.

David Ford has on many occasions sounded, to me, rather like the
creationists. He seems to think that if he and enough other people
believe something to be the case, then that’s it sorted!

BBC Look North transmitted two different video clips of David Ford in
their lunchtime and evening editions. If you want to see cynicism
personified, check out the lunchtime clip!

“David Ford has on many occasions sounded, to me, rather like the

That reminds me of something I heard on television last night (some
programme about American girls vowing to remain virgins until
marriage, I happened on it while channel surfing and watched for a few
minutes, mostly in horror). The father of one of the girls in question
said:

“It’s not about what I believe, it’s about what God has told us”.

I almost choked on the glass of water I was drinking at the time.

Back on subject, following this whole saga, I’ve been furious about
what those responsible for children have been able to get away with,
all for the benefit of commercial enterprise. That alone would be bad
enough, but to claim it all as being done in the name of science and
for the benefit of the children concerned is even more outrageous.
Keep up the good work, Ben.

PS, finally got round to buying THE book and looking forward to
several hours of enlightening reading over the weekend.

McCruiskeen (post 7)

If David Ford had an original plan, he never showed it to Councillors.
In my FOI request to Durham (the saga can be found at various points
on http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/) I asked for copies of sreports
to senior officers and elected members.

They claimed that it would be too burdensome to comply with this
request. When I appealed to the Information Commissioner’s Office,
they claimed that no such reports were ever written. Obviously, they
would not lie to or otherwise mislead the ICO so obviously elected
members never saw any such reports.

The impression Durham appear to be trying to give is that the idea
just growed in Ford and Portwood’s minds.

I wonder what the Durham electorate think about unelected officials
deciding to experiment on their children?

WILL NOBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN?

Good work dr ben, and completely agree with boro_dave and the other
comments above.

dunno if you’re touchy about this kind of thing dr ben, but the
reporter on look north last night referred to you as mr goldacre.

If you swallow fish oil capsules you suffer stale fishy burps for a
few hours. Yuk. I therefore think the drop-out was higher than
recorded, and some docile pupils pretended to take it ans spat it out
later.

BBC link to the Proffesor Stein trial on Fish Oil

“One thousand young offenders from three prisons in England and
Scotland are being recruited for a major trial to see if nutritional
supplements can improve behaviour.

The study is being organised by neuroscientist Professor John Stein,
of the University of Oxford, whose brother is the chef Rick Stein.

Professor Stein believes that food supplements - Omega 3 fish oils in
particular - can improve reduce the anti-social behaviour of
prisoners”

I have a rather serious question about this. I perhaps haven’t been
following this closely enough however their is one aspect of the
experimental design that concerns me. Did they at the very least check
the “subjects’” (for subjects read children’s) for interactions with
other medicines?

I realise that it’s not as common for children to be on Warfren as
adults however Evening Primrose Oil does interact with Warfren for
example. Even doctors frequently struggle to spot interactions,
resulting in Pharmacists spending much of their time pointing out
interactions in drug regimes that patients are already on when they
arrive in hospital.

Anyway, my question is did they design the experiment to ensure
interactions were avoided? Was this picked up during ethics approval
for the study?

Thanks,
Ossian

McCruiskeen said,

Ossian, you clearly haven’t been following this and you certainly
don’t understand David Ford and Durham County Council. Ethics? To
Ford, that’s a county near London.
This travesty of an experiment was never put before county councillors
for scrutiny. Whether this was to avoid that scrutiny or they simply
didn’t bother (I subscribe to the latter) remains to be seen. They
would not have dared involved the local Health Trust’s ethics
committee, because they would have encountered people who knew what
they were talking about and that would have ruined the show!
There is a simple truth behind all of this. If you are upfront and
have played something straight, you have nothing to hide. If you know
that you are vulnerable because what you have done is unethical,
incompetent or worse, then you cover up, dissemble, obfuscate and
stonewall. But the more you continue to do those things, the more
people ask “what have you got to hide?” It seems to me there is a
great deal to hide here and that what has actually emerged (generally
dragged out of them) is only the tip of the iceberg. They are not even
any good at information control. For example, I have documentary
evidence of David Ford and his Boss contradicting each other in this
affair!
I think another aspect is that certain people have been a law unto
themselves for so long and treated sycophantically, that they were
taken by surprise when this one actually blew up in their faces. I
suppose that there is always a time when people like that get too
confident or greedy and go one step too far. That’s what I think
happened here. David Ford has been, proudly, toughing it out ever
since (and smiling!)
Check out the end of the clip:

The comments on the next post from this one talk about ethics
committie approval, it appears that there was no ethics committie
approval. The ‘trial’ appears to just be give pupils fish oil tablets
then look at pass rate for exams. I highly doubt anyone considered
interactions with pharmaceuticals or even thought about any other
adverse effects that some pupils might have to fish oil.

This tale is going to last for a long time as how NOT to do a study.

As soon as I read peterd102’s title for Episode II, I thought

Bad Science II: The Khan of Rath

And once that was in my head…

Bad Science III: The Search for Statistical Significance
Bad Science IV: The Voyage Homeopathy
Bad Science V: The Fish Oil Frontier
Bad Science VI: The Undiscovered Evidence

And then I thought of turning “Generations” into “Gillians” (as in
McKeith) but decided that was pushing it.
