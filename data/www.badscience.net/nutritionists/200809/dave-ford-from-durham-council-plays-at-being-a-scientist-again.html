<p><a href="http://www.badscience.net/wp-content/uploads/image41.png"><img src="http://www.badscience.net/wp-content/uploads/image-thumb28.png" style="border: 0px none ; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px" alt="image" width="259" align="right" border="0" height="359" /></a> You’ll remember the Durham <a href="http://www.badscience.net/category/fish-oil/">fish oil “trial”</a> story, possibly the greatest example of scientific incompetence ever documented from a local authority.</p>
<p>Initially they said - to blanket media coverage – that they were <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2006/09/the-trial-that-ate-itself/">running a trial</a> on fish oils, giving pills to 3,000 children to see if it improved GCSE performance. I pointed out, along with several academics, that their experiment was incompetently designed, for no good reason, and so would only produce false positive results. They responded that this was okay, as they hadn’t called it a “trial”. This was very simply <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2006/09/the-trial-that-ate-itself/">untrue</a>: <span id="more-807"></span>they had, repeatedly, in press releases, and interviews, and who cared anyway, because whatever you called it, this was still a stupid experiment. Durham’s response was to edit the online version of their press release to remove the word “trial”.</p>
<p>Then I asked what they were going to do in this experiment, how they were going to measure results, and more. They refused to give me this information – for an experiment by a public body performed on thousands of children - <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2006/11/just-show-me-the-data/">so I used the Freedom of Information act</a>. They still refused. Then hundreds of you wrote to their information commissioner, using the FoI, and they refused again, <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2006/11/you-vexatious-troublemakers/">accusing us of running a “vexacious campaign”</a>.</p>
<p>Then the GCSE results for Durham came out: <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2007/09/the-fishy-reckoning/">they weren’t too great</a>, so I asked for the results of the “trial”. Durham refused to give me this information. Then they announced, bizarrely, untruthfully, in <a href="http://www.durham.gov.uk/durhamcc/usp.nsf/pws/Meetings+-+Fish+Oil+Initiative">a formal response to a written question</a>: “It was never intended, and the county council never suggested, that it would use this initiative to draw conclusions about the effectiveness or otherwise of using fish oil to boost exam results.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/03/ding-dong-the-fish-is-dead/">This was, once again, very untrue</a>. Durham’s <a href="http://www.durham.gov.uk/durhamcc%5Cpressrel.nsf/Web+Releases/6BA0B5675DBD5671802571E20033B592?OpenDocument">own press release</a> had clearly said they were giving out the pills “to see whether the proven benefits it has already brought children and young people in earlier trials can boost exam performances too”. All the press coverage said the same. The council’s chief schools inspector Dave Ford said “the county-wide trial will continue until the pupils complete their GCSE examinations next June, and the first test of the supplement’s effectiveness will be when they sit their ‘mock’ exams this December.” Suddenly this trial did not exist.</p>
<p>Now, bafflingly, suddenly, in defiance of their previous denials, Durham have <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/09/oh-hang-on-now-they-are-releasing-some-results-from-the-durham-fish-oil-trial/">released some results</a>. “Detailed analysis of the outcome of the initiative,” they say “shows that pupils who took the Omega-3 supplement did better than those who did not.” Hardly. Let’s try to disentangle what they think they’ve done.</p>
<p>“Initially, just over 3,000 Year 11 pupils began the study, taking the Omega-3 tablets at school and at home. By the time GCSE examinations came around, 832 pupils had 80 per cent or greater compliance.” This is appalling. 2,168 of their subjects dropped out of the trial: they must count these people in the results. They do not. This makes the rest of their claimed results even more meaningless.</p>
<p>“Mr Ford and his colleagues then sought to identify the same number of Year 11 pupils who had not taken the supplement and match them to those who had, according to school, gender, prior attainment and social background.” They originally said they were going to compare childrens’ predicted GCSE performance (whatever on earth that means) against actual performance. Of course, they refused to say how they would analyse this, despite hundreds of requests: and it is vitally important that people performing experiments are clear what they are measuring, and how they will analyse it, <em>before they begin</em>, otherwise they can <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/01/the-data-belongs-to-the-patients-who-gave-it-to-you/">move the goalposts and get a false positive result</a> afterwards, by slicing the cake a dozen different ways.</p>
<p>“The GCSE results of 629 ‘matched pairs’ – fish oil takers and non-fish oil takers - were then analysed.” Who are these 629? I thought it was 832? But more importantly, by selectively only looking at the results from the pupils who were most highly adherent to the capsules regime, they have skewed their sample, entirely unnecessarily. They have, in fact, simply discovered that school performance is better in children who are more highly adherent to a school regime involving pills, and who are, in all probability, also more adherent to everything at school, harder working, better performing, from completely different families, with higher aspirations, and so on. If you wanted to design an experiment to produce a spurious false positive result, you could not do any better than this.</p>
<p>This result has nothing to do with the pills, it is laughably incompetent science, in an experiment performed on thousands of Durham children. It has been widely reported in the local press, and in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/health/3083228/Fish-oil-makes-children-smarter-study-claims.html">Telegraph</a> (doubtless with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1062335/Why-daily-dose-fish-oils-boost-GCSE-grades.html">more to come</a>) as “perhaps there is something in this preliminary stuff”. Every journalist is baffled by the details. Some report that there is “controversy”, in the classic style of journalists who simply report “two sides”.</p>
<p>But there are not two sides here: there is nothing in this work. It is not “controversial”. A crap unpublished result presented in a press release from an incompetent experiment analysed incompetently in god knows how many different ways by incompetent people who have shrouded themselves in secrecy and demonstrated themselves to be incapable of making reliable true statements about their own research – or even whether it exists - is not a “maybe”.</p>
<p>Fish oil pills are now the biggest selling food supplement product in the UK, with a market size of £110m. Nobody has ever tested them. Most damningly of all, Durham council had the children, and the pills, necessary to perform a decent piece of research. The only thing they were missing was the rigour, and help was offered. The only real question now is this: why has Dave Ford performed a incompetent experiment on thousands of children? And more importantly, why has Durham Council let him?</p>

   <p>We can all speculate the reasons why. Was he paid, were they desperate, was he incompetent, or was he told that the pills worked and so didnt think a trial was needed. </p>
<p>Mad study that really should have been thought through a bit more. Theres conflicting reports and i dont think anyone knows whats going on, all we do know is that it isnt going to give us any particulary useful information.</p>
<p>Well done for persisiting Ben. hopefully people wont be persuaded into thinking that this was a proper Trial.</p>

   <p>Unfortunately, journalists, in their desire to appear fair and write a balanced article, tend to offer two opposing views on a situation and leave the reader to draw a conclusion. In this case, it&#8217;s a bit like the creationist versus evolution debate. The former is superstitious drivel, the latter is logical, rational and testable. A way I have used to describe David Ford&#8217;s and DCC&#8217;s behaviour in this affair is to call it intellectual tennis without a net. Whatever people &#8220;serve&#8221; to DCC in the form of questions or justifiable criticism, it is done with the net of rational scrutiny up. David Ford and DCC however, give their &#8220;returns of serve&#8221; and indeed their &#8220;serves&#8221; with that net down. In other words, they say what they like, change the story to fit their current needs and expect to be believed. And because of their refusal to reveal any of their plan or methodology, they cannot be challenged. David Ford has clearly displayed incompetence in this affair, despite his claims that he never intended it to be a study. The evidence indicates otherwise. All of this could be quickly settled if he were to publish his trial/study/initiative (delete as politically expedient) online. Of course that assumes that he had a written plan.<br />
DCC&#8217;s resident expert in this field, Dr Madeleine Portwood seems to be mysteriously absent these days. One would have expected her to at least say something, however slight, in support. I should think being associated with this particular &#8220;turkey&#8221; will not have done her credibility for any future research into the possible effects of Omega 3 supplement on children&#8217;s academic performance, much good and so she may be attempting to distance herself from it. Unfortunately for her, she was fully involved at the start, as an e-mail from her to all Durham secondary schools, headed &#8220;Omega 3 Fish Oil Trials&#8221; in which she refers to &#8220;this initiative&#8221; and &#8220;the study&#8221; (thereby using the full range of DCC&#8217;s shifting terminology in one go!)shows.</p>

   <p>Presenting both sides is good, but trying to equalize them when they are issues of science is not going to work.</p>
<p>Lol just watching Live at the Apollo as i was writing this and the guy is saying about Gillian McKeith:<br />
&#8220;She presents that show &#8216;you are what you eat&#8217; so at some point in her life she has eaten a proper miserable bitch&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She says &#8216;ive looked at your poo, and it stinks&#8217;, and you think out of the two of them who needs to reasess their life the most&#8221;</p>
<p>Just thought id cheer you all up</p>

   <p>Sarah Kennedy mentioned it on radio 2 a few days ago on her &#8216;reading stuff from papers&#8221; section. It made me issue stink. But, I mean, I&#8217;m not a listener or anything, it was coincidence that the radio was on.</p>

   <p>Obviously Dave Ford and some people around him at Durham Council are clueless, but what irks me most is that they managed to twist the Freedom of Imformation (FOI) Act to do exactly the opposite of what it was indended for.</p>

   <p>Posted this elsewhere by mistake:</p>
<p>There is one thing that really concerns me about this piece of experimentation. I’m a health researcher. If I want to do research involving either adults on children, I need to get full ethical clearance from an ethics committee. In the past, when I have been involved in research involving children in schools, it has had to have explicit ethical approval from the ethics committee of the relevant education department, and also by a separate University ethics committee. This is as it should be. If I didn’t do this, I would probably be severly disciplined and possibly lose my job. It would also be in violation of the Delaration of Helsinki, which among other things covers medical experimentation - which giving children fishy tablets surely is - whether or not it is physicians giving out the pills. In any case the Declaration also covers human experiments (like htis one) conducted by non-medics. But here we have experimenters doling out drugs to children, apparently with the blessing of the council, head teachers and so on. So the key questions are: 1) what ethics committee, if any, agreed to this study, and if they did, can we see the minutes of the relevant meeting; and 2) if this was not passed by any ethics committee, why were the experimenters allowed to conduct medical experiments (whether methodically rigorous or not) on schoolchildren? Or have I missed something…</p>

   <p>Thanks, Ben for keeping up the pressure on this.  I agree with Evidencekagoul.  How do they get away with this?  I&#8217;ve had to get multiple ethics and R&amp;D approval to interview doctors and nurses for research projects.  Durham County Council appears to have been carrying out invalid and therefore unethical experiments on children. Where is the scrutiny?</p>

   <p>Yes, Evidencekagoul, what you have missed is the slipperiness of the Fish Oil Farce team at DCC. Their &#8220;defence&#8221; on this one (no laughter, please!)was given one month after I asked the relevant question in the council chamber on 7th february 2007, as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;A recommendation to use Omega 3 supplement was made by officers in line with the normal advisory relationship between the county council and its schools. In that sense, members were not directly involved in the decision, although key members were made aware of and supported providing this opportunity to schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there was no member scrutiny, as JQH discovered when he asked under a FOI request and was told that no plan was submitted to members for scrutiny. Presumably they will use the same &#8220;defence&#8221; when it comes to liaising with the Health Authorities and their ethics committee. </p>
<p>But all of the very strong evidence clearly indicates that the trial/study/initiative was centrally planned, led and managed by one David Ford. </p>
<p>This defence, produced a month late (they studiously ignored my question initially, clearly hoping it would all go away!)was, in my opinion a back-tracked, cobbled together necessity to get them out of that particular hole. </p>
<p>What kind of officers undertake a project of that size, without appropriate member scrutiny?</p>
<p>And what bunch of dozy councillors allowed them to do it.</p>
<p>My letter to Councillor Claire Vasey (then DCC Lead member for Children&#8217;s Services) of 31st October 2006, asking very pertinent questions, (which she simply ducked by passing it to David Ford to answer, obviously not having a clue herself)is available for scrutiny. It contains, among other things, the following questions:</p>
<p>Did DCC approach Equazen or vice-versa?</p>
<p>Have there been any financial or other inducements from Equazen, in cash or in kind?</p>
<p>Who planned the &#8220;trial&#8221; or initiative?</p>
<p>What are its stated aims and objectives?</p>
<p>have they been changed following the recent events in the national media?</p>
<p>Who sanctioned its implementation in schools?</p>
<p>Was a written plan for the &#8220;trial&#8221; or initiative prepared?</p>
<p>If so, who wrote it?</p>
<p>What supporting documentation, if any, was given to the participating schools?</p>
<p>Were briefing meetings held for the participating schools?</p>
<p>Was a coherent evaluation strategy for the &#8220;trial&#8221; or initiative prepared as part of the &#8220;trial&#8221; plan?</p>
<p>Is so, how was the &#8220;trial&#8221; to be evaluated?</p>
<p>Who is leading the &#8220;trial&#8221; or initiative?</p>
<p>Who is responsible for its evaluation?</p>
<p>Who prepared the material for the DCC press releases on the &#8220;trial&#8221; or initiative?</p>
<p>Why was it that nobody, including Dr Portwood, Senior Educational Psychologist, and David Ford, Chief Education Inspector (whose main subject in his teacher training was science) could see that without some form of &#8220;control&#8221; in the &#8220;trial,&#8221; the results will be absolutely worthless?</p>
<p>Why did David Ford, following ridicule of the &#8220;trial&#8221; by Ben Goldacre in the Bad Science column, suddenly declare to him that it was not a &#8220;trial,&#8221; but an &#8220;initiative&#8221;?<br />
Why is it reported by the &#8220;You and Yours&#8221; team that the &#8220;trial&#8221; or &#8220;initiative&#8221; has the full backing of county councillors?</p>
<p>Has the &#8220;trial&#8221; been discussed and agreed in any committee of members of DCC?</p>
<p>If so, what briefing papers were provided and was the &#8220;initiative&#8221; described as a trial?</p>
<p>Were the methodological implications of the &#8220;trial&#8221; or &#8220;initiative&#8221; explained to members?</p>
<p>Were the evaluation implications of the &#8220;trial&#8221; (i.e. that any results would be meaningless) explained to members?</p>
<p>Did members raise any questions or doubts and if so, how were these dealt with?</p>
<p>If so, what discussion, if any, took place regarding the ethical considerations of becoming involved with a company such as Equazen, which has a clear commercial imperative?</p>
<p>Who signed the &#8220;deal&#8221; with Equazen?</p>
<p>Do members actually realise the damage that has been done to DCC through being pilloried in this way in the national press?</p>
<p>Why has no-one in DCC realised that what eleven year-old children in science in the authority&#8217;s primary schools are taught concerning controls in experiments and fair testing, would enable those very children to understand why the &#8220;trial&#8221; was not only fatally flawed, but worse than that, a travesty of scientific method?</p>
<p>Students in Year Eleven, being given fish oil capsules and studying science, will be more than capable of understanding the glaring flaws in the methodology of the &#8220;trial&#8221; in which they are participating as part of the study cohort. Does a scientist like David Ford, who presumably inspects science teaching, or indeed anyone else in his department, not appreciate the inherent irony here, that the students could certainly have designed a proper trial, yielding significant data? </p>
<p>I also have david Ford&#8217;s reply.</p>

   <p>Have you noticed how far back Equazen have stepped in this? Now that the excrement has well and truly hit the fan, they are keeping well out of sight. I doubt they wish the product they gave so generously and philanthropically to be sullied by any of this criticism. Meanwhile, David Ford is left to keep smiling, while attempting to defend the indefensible. But then he is not bound by commercial considerations and has the backing of Durham County Council.</p>

   <p>Nick Davies was right about journalists confusing neutrality for objectivity, when one side of the argument is clearly rubbish.  They either do so because they&#8217;re too thick to understand the science, because they can&#8217;t be bothered to investigate the science by asking experts and making an informed opinion (which they have the option to, and their readers don&#8217;t), or because they&#8217;re just covering they&#8217;re backs and think sitting on a fence is the safest option.</p>

   <p>What evidence kagoul and Mccruiskeen said, and what has been discussed in threads passim.</p>
<p>These guys have tried to wriggle out of their ethical responsiblities by doging around the semantics of &#8220;trial&#8221; and &#8220;initiative.&#8221; The fact remains they performed an experiment on children. OK, most informed folks probably believe the fish oil has no effect at all. However, for the sake of argument, what if the fish oil were to have a detrimental effect on performance: these children could have been disadvantaged by taking part. By not measuring outcomes scrupulously and in a statistically rigorous fashion, Durham council has abused its responsiblity to the children under its care.</p>
<p>This is quite apart from whether the trial conformed to Good Clinical Practice. </p>
<p>The Durham Fish Oil Trial is not exactly Tuskegee, but the Principle Investigator needs to answer some quite serious questions.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to press charges against Ford and Portwood? It seems clear that they&#8217;re in breach of the Helsinki Declaration and as such presumably English Law.</p>

   <p>I think most would agree that fish oil does have *some* effects in a suitable dose, even if these are not the effects that Durham may have hoped for.  For example, fish oil supplements can cause GI disturbances, cause fishy burps, increase bleeding time, etc.</p>
<p>I wonder if the parents and children were given information on potential adverse effects from the pills, to allow them to give informed consent to their participating the the trial?  Cough, sorry, the initiative.  Seeing the relatively poor compliance rates (especially poor given that the pills were handed out in school) I also wonder if adverse effects played a significant role in the low compliance?  It would be nice to think that Durham had asked those who gave up on the pills about why, and that they would make these data public&#8230;</p>

   <p>&#8220;About bleeding time&#8221;&#8230; So, given that there is (real) trial-based evidence that fish oils increase bleeding time in adults, and in healthy young adults (e.g. Mundal et al, 1994), one would be entitled to ask DCC/Ford whether children at any risk of bleeding/GI disturbance were identified and excluded from the study in advance. Of course Ford and Portwood would have done this. Wouldn&#8217;t they?<br />
Anyway&#8230; bloody well done McCruiskeen. Just thinking about the sheer dishonesty of all this gives me &#8220;GI disturbance&#8221;.</p>

   <p>The sad thing is that this form of pill-pushing is becoming widespread in UK schools - solely due the the lack of DoE direction for headteachers when approached by any Adam, Madeleine or Patrick. </p>
<p>Head teachers become &#8216;rabbits in the headlight&#8217; of smooth talking pseuds who claim nutrition/psychologist backgrounds (ie health scienciness that they admire but lack any real knowledge of). </p>
<p>Tentative forays such as &#8216;healthy eating for school lunch&#8217; PTA events are well received, and everyone basks in the pro-active stance. In fact, healthy eating DOES improve kids development - thats all is needed. Honestly. Research supports this. Some may benefit from a kiddie one-a-day multivit/min - easily and cheaply purchased on 3-4-2 offers on the high street. </p>
<p>Fast forward 3-6 months then the grooming of intelligent parents/ SEN kids begins for the &#8216;diagnostic tests for food allergy&#8217;, the pill-pushing fish oil/ optimum nutrition for your kiddies Key stage 1/2/3/4 supplements, the clinically irrelevant blood tests and the availability of the pseud for &#8216;private nutrition consultations&#8217;- and voila/ ker-ching! Your pseud has reaped their financial rewards for minimum outlay!</p>
<p>Eventually it comes to the attention of someone with &#8216;real&#8217; qualifications in the area - who perform an &#8216;Emperors new clothes&#8217; denudement of the nutrition-lite approach. Headteacher quietly drops organisation from extra-curricular activities, after all its a bit embarrassing to acknowledge you were duped, being the educational lead for the school, after all &#8230;</p>
<p>But never mind, the money has been made, the kids/parents exploited. Another day, another school head to schmooze. </p>
<p>Only in Durhams case, even the Education Authority was duped. </p>
<p>never mind - would make a good piece of critical evaluation coursework for A level statistics, or biology.</p>

   <p>Honestly, does anyone really believe they really intended this to be a real trial?<br />
In the words of General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett, to Captain Blackadder, perhaps &#8220;the cover story was&#8230; just a cover story&#8221;. A ruse, as it were. A marketing exercise crudely disguised, for the benefit of sports writers masquerading as medical journalists, as a trial of fish oil capsule to discover their efficacy for a particular purpose.<br />
From that point of view they can regard it as a success. From the point of view of actually discovering anything at all it seems to have been a resounding failure. But then the format rather indicates that discovery of anything useful (apart from public gullibility) wasn&#8217;t on high their &#8220;to-do&#8221; or &#8220;must-have&#8221; lists.</p>

   <p>My MP, sent me a standard letter through the post asking if he could count on my support for the Labour candidates in the May County Council elections.</p>
<p>I replied telling him that I would not be votong for them, because I conisidered Labour controlled Durham County Council to be morally bankrupt because of their handling of the Fish Oil Farce.</p>
<p>He replied to me sayinhg that he had written to the Chief executive of Durham County Council, requesting an explanation.</p>
<p>Some time later, he replied again, enclosing the explanation he had received from David Williams, DCC Corporate Director of Children and Young People&#8217;s Services. he also enclosed a complaint form for the Local Government Ombusdsman, explaining that whilst he could not force DCC to change anything, I might wish to submit a complaint to the Ombudsman. At the time, I felt that such a complaint would be a waste of time. Now, after the release of their truly pathetic matched pair statistics, think it may be necessary to do so and as a citizen of County Durham, I intend to submit a complaint on the grounds of unethical and incompetent behaviour on the part of Officers and incompetence on the part of Members for their lack of appropriate scrutiny.</p>
<p>The letter from the Director of Children and Young People&#8217;s Services that the MP sent me contained an explanation that was a travesty of the truth. I replied to the MP, &#8220;Unfortunately, far from being useful in explaining the situation, David Williams&#8217; explanation to you actually continues the county council&#8217;s apparent practice of obfuscation in this affair by &#8220;rewriting the script&#8221; whilst being economical with the truth. His account is in contradiction with the evidence, minimises and omits key features, is at best misleading and at worst, untrue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that I have my Blog page opened, I hope to start posting some of the vast amount of correspondence I have on this matter, together with annotation and commentary upon it (after an online tutorial from JQH!!)</p>
<p>So take heart from the fact that it&#8217;s not just us poor concerned people that Labour-controlled Durham County Council stonewalls, misleads and treats with contempt. They bullshit the Honourable Labour Member for North Durham too!!</p>

   <p>PV has raised an interesting issue. Ben Goldacre ened his piece with,&#8221;The only real question now is this: why has Dave Ford performed a incompetent experiment on thousands of children? And more importantly, why has Durham Council let him?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answers to PV&#8217;s and Ben&#8217;s questions, in my opinion, lie in a complicated tangle of dynamics involving, at least, the following factors:</p>
<p>1. The social, corporate and political dynamics of Durham County Council and in particular of its then Education Department. </p>
<p>2. David Ford&#8217;s rise through the hierarchy of the latter.</p>
<p>3. David Ford&#8217;s influence within that department.</p>
<p>4. The Education Department&#8217;s relationship with its schools (a fascinating study in itself as they gradually became &#8220;autonmous,&#8221; but were assiduously cultivated to remain &#8220;onside!&#8221;</p>
<p>5.  David Ford&#8217;s relationship with those schools, their staffs, but particularly their head teachers.</p>
<p>6. The target-led, assessment-driven curriculum and the constant scrutiny by the government of performance.</p>
<p>7. Durham&#8217;s problem with failing schools and the Ofsted inspection regime.</p>
<p>8. GCSE results</p>
<p>9. The retirement of Keith Mitchell, Director of Education&#8217; leading to the merging of departments to form Children and Young people&#8217;s Services.</p>
<p>10. The appointment of David Williams as Corporate Director of the new Service.</p>
<p>11. The appointment of individuals to &#8220;new&#8221; key senior posts within this new service.</p>
<p>12. GCSE results (I know I&#8217;ve already mentioned them!)</p>
<p>13. GCSE results!!</p>
<p>14. The post of Head of Achievemnt Services in the new structure.</p>
<p>15. The soliciting of £1m worth of &#8220;free&#8221; fish oil capsules by DCC from a certain supplier of those products.</p>
<p>16. Dr Madeleine Portwood</p>
<p>17. David Ford</p>
<p>18. A plan!</p>
<p>19. Ambition</p>
<p>20. Arrogance</p>
<p>21. Vanity</p>
<p>22. Subterfuge</p>
<p>23. Denial</p>
<p>24. Incompetence</p>
<p>25. Cover up</p>
<p>26. Lack of appropriate scrutiny by council Members</p>
<p>27. Lack of appropriate knowledge of council members</p>
<p>28. Tail wagging the dog!</p>
<p>I think all of these factors played, to a greater or lesser extent, a part in the David Ford&#8217;s Fish Oil Farce. I wonder if any one can think of others?</p>

   <p>Glad to hear McCruiskeen is setting up a blog to post the material. Do we have the URL yet, McC?</p>
<p>I have added my (not very original) thoughts on the re-risen Fish Oil Zombie <a href="http://draust.wordpress.com/2008/09/27/i-smell-something-iffy-or-should-that-be-fishy/" rel="nofollow">here</a> (Conflicting Interest: shameless self-plug).</p>
<p>PS  I have the first verse of a Durham Fish-ditty derived from <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=utkMQJeiK50&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">&#8220;When The Boat Comes In&#8221;:</a></p>
<p>“I smell something iffy</p>
<p>Quite distinctly fishy</p>
<p>Durham’s special trial ishy*</p>
<p>When nurr vote got done**”</p>
<p>* short for initiative - couldn&#8217;t think of a rhyme</p>
<p>** as in &#8220;the Council never voted on this&#8221;</p>
<p>- so if anyone else is feeling lyrical&#8230; feel free to contribute more verses.</p>

   <p>This bloody fish oil scam caused a HUGE argument between my wife and I ! she wanted to dose our eldest with this c*** and I said there was no evidence to back-up their claims (showed her your excellent blog btw). She bought one bottle, gave a few doses and quietly dropped it, so good sense prevailed !

   <p>Very interesting about the Evening Primrose Oil.</p>
<p>There are also known side-effects of taking Evening Primrose Oil (EPO) - as someone with epilepsy, when I was diagnosed many years ago I was told to avoid EPO as it could increase the frequency of seizures. Apparently it lowers the seizure threshold - see Epilepsy Action website: <a href="http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/epo" rel="nofollow">http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/epo</a></p>
<p>Approx. 1 in 131 people in the UK have epilepsy, so in a group of 3000+ teenagers you might expect over 20 to have the condition. Were they screened out before hand? Was there further screening for the known effects of other ingredients that are known to be biologically active?</p>

   <p>Ben, you ask about the &#8216;predicted&#8217; results, and I’m not sure if you are being tongue in cheek when you say, ‘what ever on earth that means’.</p>
<p>As a governor at a local school, I was surprised to see the results for every named child from an organisation called the Fisher Family Trust (<a href="http://www.fischertrust.org/" title="http://www.fischertrust.org/" target="_blank">www.fischertrust.org/</a>) which gave their predicted results from key stage one to two. I would imagine these exist for KS two to three, and three to GCSE’s. I would also be surprised if they didn’t exist for AS and A’ Levels. </p>
<p>For those of you who are banging on about Ethics Committee approval, have you read Iain Chalmers work in the BMJ about how unethical Ethics Committees are?</p>
<p>Based on the principle that if you want to kill all of your patients by giving them something, you can, but if you want to test if you are killing your patients by giving it to half of them and a control to the other half, you have to apply to an ethics committee and stand the chance of being rejected.</p>

   <p>A quick google search seems to bring up a number of pages suggesting a possible link between taking evening primrose oil, and an increased risk of seizures in people who have epilepsy.  The only paper I can find that says that this link is spurious is one written by B.K.Puri (a name familiar from some of the previous fish oil articles), and published AFTER the trial/initiative had started, and refering to two earlier papers from the 80s which seemed to show a link.  Given this, I wonder what steps were taken to exclude epileptic pupils from this study.</p>

<p>Either the exam result improvment rate was going to go down regardless or, my hypothesis is that the children got over confident as they were being given a pill that improved their test scores and so didn&#8217;t revise as much. The placebo effect was in the childrens confidence, this had a nocebo effect on the amount of revision they would do.</p>

   <p>That&#8217;s possible, though i suspect that healthy teenagers are naturally more skeptical (of meddling adults) than anxious adults (are of homeopathy) and so are less susceptible to the placebo effect. It would be interesting to look at placebo trials before, during and after the pernicious effects of a modern education.</p>
<p>And fish oil capsules give you fishy burps, which i&#8217;ve been informed by teenagers unfortunate enough to have been force-fed them (only old people take them willingly) so that might have contributed to the nocebo theory @peterd102</p>

   <p>Yes, I think the coincidence in timing between all this and the upcoming FFTB conference is, er, not a coincidence. I have written about this on the blog. The conference is in large part a fish-oil love-fest, if you check out the sponsors (inc Equa£en) and speakers.</p>
<p>We have also been talking about the fishy burp problem and consequent problem of non-blind of blinding even in placebo-controlled trials. If you wanted to do a proper large scale human trial one would think solving the &#8220;appropriate placebo&#8221; problem would be an important thing to do.</p>
<p>Of course, Durham avoided this by having no control group, let alone no placebo arm..!</p>

   <p>Sorry if this has been posted before, but the Press Association put out <a href="http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hJ7qcxSeGeW9KwvXdEVjv1SJreSg" rel="nofollow">a press release</a> which contains this line:</p>
<p>Dave Ford, of Durham County Council&#8217;s Children and Young People&#8217;s Services, said there was no plan to continue providing children with the fish oil capsules now that the donated pills had run out.</p>
<p>He said he had been &#8220;upset&#8221; by the level of criticism the project had attracted from the scientific community. But he said the council had never set out to conduct a scientific experiment. </p>

<p>Is that not a tad disingenuous?</p>
<p>If it wasn&#8217;t supposed to be a scientific trial (&#8221;experiment&#8221; has Dr Mengele overtones here), the only other thing that could possibly have been intended was a marketing exercise for the company that supplied the product. After all they were mentioned enough in press releases and the national press.<br />
It does prompt a couple of questions:<br />
Is it really the job of David Ford on behalf of DCC to conduct a product placement exercise on behalf of a commercial entity?<br />
And, is this a case of corruption or rank incompetence?</p>

   <p>If it was never a &#8220;Trial&#8221; or &#8220;Study&#8221; then David Ford and DCC should have been much more circumspect in their press releases and quotations to the media. If David Ford reents the criticism he has received, he only has himslef to blame, it seems to me, and he continues to be evasive in his repsonses.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that this was in part a gigantic marketing exercise for a certain company who mentioned Durham County Council in their advertising. Commercial reality  dictates that the company would hardly supply supply £1m worth of &#8220;free&#8221; capsules to DCC for a properly conducted study, the results of which could have been indifferent or even negative. That would have been expensive commercial suicide.</p>
<p>Desperation may also have played a part. There is tremendous pressure on local authorities such as Durham to raise their game in their schools, as measured by GCSE scores. David Ford may well have thought that the capsules may have had some effect and so there was nothing to be lost in promoting his &#8220;Brainchild.&#8221;</p>
<p>Equally, he may have felt that the Hawthorn effect might have assisted even if the capsules themselves did not.</p>
<p>In any event, one cannot fault his desire to assist some of the most socially disadvantaged children in the country (with the government breathing down his neck!) by rolling out his &#8220;Brainchild.&#8221; In my opinion, where he went wrong was in seeking publicity for it!</p>
<p>It was not necessary, so why did he do it? Pressure from Equazen who clearly needed it and were footing the bill? Raising his own and DCC&#8217;s profile?</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons, it all went disastrously pear shaped and attracted all kinds of legitimate criticism, which David Ford now resents.</p>
<p>Things have changed at Durham County Council. It now has a leader with a brain, in Councillor Simon Henig. Hopefully scrutiny by members will improve. How can you ask appropriate questions about something you do not understand?<br />
I doubt that David Ford will ever get away with another &#8220;wheeze&#8221; like this!</p>

<p>It would be rather nice if he wasn&#8217;t allowed to get away with this one.</p>

   <p>I agree. There are a lot of questions that a decent full-time investigative journalist should be sniffing out answers for. I reckon there is a cracking scoop still to be had.</p>
<p>Stinks like fish.</p>

   <p>There is and it&#8217;s to do with what was going on in DCC&#8217;s then Education Department, now Children and Young People&#8217;s Services and what the role of Council Members was. Unless or until there are Members on scrutiny committees who actually understand some of the complex issues involved, then appropriate questions will never be asked and scrutiny will be a joke, which I think it was in this case. The final admission on why there had been no scrutiny (or as DCC claim, why scrutiny was not necessary) was dragged out of them eventually, by asking a question in the council chamber at the Public Questions session in February 2007. DCC studiously avoided answering it. (I asked three; they answered two!) It took them a month to think about it and popst a supplemental answer on their Public Questions website as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;A recommendation to use Omega 3 supplement was made by officers in line with the normal advisory relationship between the county council and its schools. In that sense, members were not directly involved in the decision, although key members were made aware of and supported providing this opportunity to schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was this always part of David Ford&#8217;s plan or was this &#8220;explanation&#8221; put together following my question. My own view is that they simply tried ignoring my question, but when I immediately wrote to Councillor Vasey (who had given the answers in the chamber) saying that she had not answered my important question in the chamber, she was continuing to avoid answering it, she  was clearly avoiding having an answer put on the public record and that her actions were morally reprehensible. A couple of weeks later, the above answer appeared!</p>
<p>One year later, in February 2008, I submitted my three questions to the Public Questions session in the council chamber, as Ben mentions on page 149 of his excellent book, and dragged out of them the response that Ben notes. </p>
<p>The really fascinating thing is the version of this whole affair given by the DCC Corporate Director of Children and Young People&#8217;s Services (David Ford&#8217;s new boss) to the Honourable Member for North Durham (Labour) Kevan JOnes MP, which is not congruent with DCC&#8217;s own official version of events. </p>
<p>As I replied to Kevan Jones MP, having received a copy of this &#8220;explanation&#8221; from him, &#8220;Unfortunately,far from being useful in explaining the situation, David Williams explanation to you actually continues the county council&#8217;s apparent practice of obfuscation in this affair by &#8220;rewriting the script&#8221; whilst being economical with the truth. His account is in contradiction with the evidence, minimises and omits key features, is at best misleading and at worst, untrue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevan Jones replied saying there was basically nothing he could do and suggested I complain to the Local Government Ombudsman, helpfully enclosing a complaint form.</p>
<p>As I said in an earlier post, what chance do we concerned people stand if DCC is quite prepared to &#8220;bullshit&#8221; a Labour MP?</p>

   <p>There are a number of options on pursuing this:</p>
<p>The local safeguarding children board could be asked to investigate how children were exploited in an exercise that essentially told them they would get better results if they took the fish oil capsules. The board has some independence from the council and could set in place clear guidance on the way children should be used in studies in the future.</p>
<p>I think it is definitely worth referring the Mr Ford to the Standards Committee. What does anyone else think?</p>

   <p>Robshorrock - I, for one, had not considered that option. Referral to the Local Government Ombudsman must be made within one year of the event about which one complains. The Director of DCC Children and Young People&#8217;s Services &#8220;bullshits&#8221; an enquiring MP and David Ford is interviewed on BBC NE television, coming across as aggrieved about being misunderstood and defending his actions - even smiling. They obviously think they have it &#8220;sewn up&#8221; and they probably have. Some one has to be respomsib;e for education (if it can be called that) in County Durham; it is just a pity that integrity and an ethical conscience do not appear to be among the criteria required for the role.</p>

   <p>Thank you, bob sterman.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve partly misunderstood what the HD is, and partly expressed myself badly.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> some kind of provision in the law against experimentation on people (and for that matter animals) without ethical approval, isn&#8217;t there?</p>
<p>Or is it nothing but guidelines and professional contracts? I know Wakefield stands before the GMC and not a court, but still &#8230; Does this mean that it&#8217;s only a problem if a registered doctor does it, while Joe Q. Public can go ahead and do as he pleases?</p>

   <p>Just thought I&#8217;d share a bit of similar test improvement foolishness from across the pond.  Today I was given a package of mint chewing gum to share with my students to &#8216;improve their performance&#8217; on their NECAP tests required under the NCLB mandates.  </p>
<p>This evening, while searching for other examples of &#8216;Dumbo&#8217;s feather&#8217; in education, I stumbled on an on-line study run by the Univ. of Northumbria psychology department to assess the effect of Omega 3/Fish Oil on memory performance.<br />
(Link is: <a href="http://www.omega3research.org.uk" rel="nofollow">www.omega3research.org.uk</a> )<br />
I decided to participate in the study, playing both parent and child roles. I proceeded to the end, wondering when I would be asked for some type of validating information.  I know you&#8217;ll never guess - there was none!  The only potential trap might have been when I selected a weight and height for my 14 year old child - couldn&#8217;t remember what a stone was equal to in pounds - had to spend a moment looking it up.</p>
<p>In any case, I&#8217;m sure this study&#8217;s results will someday be publicized, yet it&#8217;s results are totally bogus.  Any idiot, including this 62 year old Vermont chemistry teacher, can participate!</p>
<p>Keep up the great work exposing bad science!</p>
