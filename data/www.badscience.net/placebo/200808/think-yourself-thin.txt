Think yourself thin…

August 23rd, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in placebo, bad science |

Ben Goldacre
The Guardian,
Saturday August 23 2008

What I particularly enjoy is the spectacle of fat people – ideally
drinking beer – watching television, while somewhere on the other side
of the world citizens of all nations are getting some nice exercise in
the Olympics (throwing javelins, jumping over metal bars, climbing
lamp posts with banners, and running away from the water cannon).
These are the people I imagine paying for gyms they never visit, while
I am cheerfully cycling to work and carrying the shopping up the
stairs.

But can obsessing over sport actually improve your health? Slightly,
possibly, if you’ve got something to work with.

Alia Crum and Ellen Langer from Harvard psychology department took 84
female hotel attendants in 7 hotels. They were cleaning an average of
15 rooms a day, each requiring half an hour of walking, bending,
pushing, lifting, and carrying. These women were clearly getting a lot
of good exercise, but they didn’t believe it: 66.6% of them reported
not exercising regularly, and 36.8% said they didn’t get any exercise
at all.

Their health, measured by things like weight, body fat, body mass
index, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure, was related to their
perceived amount of exercise, rather than the actual amount of
exercise they got, and this, so far, isn’t very unusual. A classic
study of 7,000 adults found that that perceived health is a better
predictor of death than actual health, and another looking at elderly
people found that those who perceive their health to be poor are 6
times more likely to die than those who perceive their health to be
excellent, regardless of how healthy they actually are. Once again
this goes to show the danger of relying on self-report data for health
research.

But it gets better. Crum and Langer then divided the hotel workers
into two groups (by hotel). One group got a one hour presentation on
what a fabulous amount of exercise they were getting, how they were
meeting and clearly exceeding the Surgeon General’s recommendations
for an active lifestyle. They were given information sheets, in
English and Spanish, showing the calorie burn for activities like
vacuuming, or cleaning a bathroom, and the researchers even put
notices up in communal areas explaining what excellently healthy
exercise their work was.

The other group was left alone.

Four weeks later the researchers measured everything again. The group
who had been tutored about the health benefits of their work now
perceived that they did more exercise than before – unsurprisingly -
while the group who were left alone didn’t change. Neither group had
changed their actual levels of activity.

But amazingly, despite no change in actual exercise levels, in the
intervention group, simply being told about the value of what they
were already doing caused a significant change for the better on every
single one of the objective health measures recorded: weight, body
fat, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure.

It’s an outrage. Maybe mindset alone can influence metabolism and the
benefits of exercise: perhaps this experiment shows, essentially, the
placebo benefits of exercise. Maybe the cleaners changed their
behaviour, or their diets, in ways that the researchers didn’t pick
up, perhaps they had more spring in their step, tipping the scales in
their favour. And maybe it doesn’t actually matter what caused the
change, as long as we can exploit it: because the links between body
and mind are far more fascinating than any pill peddler would ever
have you believe.

If anything, I should have thought that it would show the opposite.

Fascinating.

Could it all be in the mind, or at least the brain? The brain uses
about 25% of our total metabolic energy. An active brain more than a
depressed brain. Could the improvements be the result of one group
being mentally stimulated by all the positive attention?

For this reason, I’m not very impressed by the choice of control
group! They should have had a third control group who were given
lectures on how good their work was, or something equally stimulating
but unrelated to exercise.

It would be awesome if there was a LTFU– 4 weeks is fine, but my
mental kick for losing weight– a new year’s resolution lasted until
April. Then I stopped jogging again. It would have been far more
informative to have tracked the duration of the effect, dagnammit!

Galen said,

August 23, 2008 at 10:31 am

Oh, come on now, Doctor.

Neither group had changed their actual levels of activity.

Are we sure? How do we know? Did anything else change apart from
levels of activity? Diet for example.
One group had an intensive presentation on health and then had
reminders posted up around the workplace. Could this have had no
effect; in decisions to use the stairs, rather than the lifts or to
choose fruit instead of ice cream, for example?
How was the presentation understood (not all the audience were English
speakers)? Did a subtle message go out that the hotel prided itself in
the fitness of its staff, and that any cleaner who did not lose weight
would be sacked? More to the point, do we know how the presentation
was received?

despite no change in actual exercise levels, in the intervention
group, simply being told about the value of what they were already
doing caused a significant change for the better on every single one
of the objective health measures recorded: weight, body fat, body mass
index, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure.

So something must have changed, mustn’t it? Something very significant
too, to be measurable within four weeks.

Fascinating post!

Just a slight correction. The percentage of elderly people who die is
the same, everywhere. So you should really put a time frame on that
study you quote in the third paragraph.

In just four weeks *significant* changes in weight, body fat, body
mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure??

I joined a gym in May and since then have gone exercising on average
every second or third day and while I noticed I’m a bit fitter it’s
not what I had hoped for. I’d also like to get some of the placebo
effect, looks like a lot less work to me!

Interesting. I bet they changed their diets slightly. There’s nothing
like feeling that you’re getting a decent amount of exercise to give
you pure thoughts, resulting in choosing an apple over a chocolate
bar.

Comfort eating, population of women. Need I really say any more?

Thinking about it after watching my wife and daughters obsess about,
agonise over then finally make and consume a chocolate brownie (with
mixed nuts and white chocolate bits). This was two days after I made
the youngest a shepherd’s pie as comfort food when she was feeling
poorly.

No change in metabolic activity is really necessary, though I’m sure
happy people are more incedentally active than depressed people.

muscleman said,

projektleiterin, you and I are clearly different. I have two
distinctly different modes: couch potato and athlete. The former is
characterised by lassitude, snacking. backache, digestive upset.
motivation problems. After two runs (gyms? pah!) with two days in
between my waking pulse will have dropped 10bpm, I will be more alert
and find myself wondering what I can do and my appetite reduces. I
also have a greater taste for tea (black) and my coffee consumption
decreases.

I have done this experiment numerous times and it is perfectly
reproducible. It is like a switch is thrown and I am literally in a
different mode. Most of the changes are fairly subjective, except for
the pulse, that one is the freakiest. I only need run every 4th day on
average to maintain this state.

Since the paper is closed access, I’m going to have to join the
skeptics. In addition to the issues raised in #2, #4, #7 and #9, I’d
note that, having been told that walking, bending, pushing and lifting
are good for you, they may well be doing more of it, without reporting
(perhaps not even noticing) that they are doing it.

It would be nice to know how they measured and controlled for these
things. Perhaps we should invite the authors into this discussion.

My grandfather, used to really worry about his blood pressure and was
taking a lot of medicine, and still it didn’t stabilize normally,
etc.(though earlier in his life he worked in nature, and expeditions,
and was of perfect health), until they found a tumor in his belly,
then he had health problems related to that(infection after surgery
and so on), but his blood pressure staid at 120/80 all the time.

I’m no scientist but I’d have thought the chance in both cases was
identical - 100%

Just to be fair to our esteemed columnist, I think that Ben
acknowledged the potential confounding factors

“Maybe the cleaners changed their behaviour, or their diets, in ways
that the researchers didn’t pick up”

Still makes for an interesting exercise worthy of further
investigation.

as we can exploit it: because the links between body and mind are far
more fascinating than any pill peddler would ever have you believe.”

Precisely. Well almost, obviously it does matter, we need a far more
sophisticated understanding of what’s going on. In Ben’s case above,
informing the cleaners about what they were already achieving gave
them hope in a situation that they percieved to be hopeless and hence
triggered other changes.

I’m looking forward to the development of the placebo discussions and
research to find ways of making modern medicine more effective than
’simple’ NICE approved, evidence based prescribing

DSThomas said,

I think that its likely there was a change in diet that wasnt picked
up here.

To give an example i do alot of cardio based exercise (i.e. the stuff
that makes u lose weight, running swimming etc) yet generally eat a
crappy diet so my weight stays constant. However if i get it in my
mind to try n eat healthy n ditch the pizza’s for a week or so i know
from experiance that i can drop around half a stone in weight without
too much effort. this will generally happen after someone points out
im looking less fat than normal:p I know i wont keep the weight off
for more then a month or two but the push is enough to make me do it
and thats what i think is happening here

I will admit i was too tired to read the actual article before posting
this so if im missing the point ignore me

It’s not just that people are better at determining their own level of
health than scientists and doctors? How can you control for this?

Since Ben liked this paper enough to write about it, I’m going to
trust in his authority and assume that it is not a lot of bollocks
with gaping holes iin the method, although strictly this is the wrong
thing to do. Of course it could be entirely made up, peer review
doesn’t test for that; it’s hard to tell but apparently not
impossible. But if it’s not that, then something changed, even if they
didn’t detect a physical cause; perhaps thinking of yourself as an
athlete has physiological effects. Thinking of yourself as someone who
has just missed a bus because it left two minutes early, does have
short-term physiological effects!

For that matter, thinking that you’re about to undertake a day of paid
aerobics may set you up to get the benefit of it, or to avoid being
damaged by it. I suppose our ancestors had behaviours of leiisurely
gathering of fruit and nuts, and running like heck when the
sabre-tooth tger wants to join the party. No doubt each has its own
metabolic mode, but perhaps actually takes its cue from the mind.

Ben Goldacre said,

August 25, 2008 at 1:52 am

evening all. i did mention the possibility that people might have
changed their health behaviour in a way that wasn’t picked up by the
researchers, but there is actually another flaw which someone emailed
in and which i didn’t spot, which is that the researchers seem not to
have corrected for clustering in their data. i explain what that means
in this older column here on cocaine use “doubling” in the playground:

http://www.badscience.net/?p=230

to my late sunday skim this looks like a pretty valid criticism, and
might reduce the statistical significance of the findings, without the
raw data nobody can tell by how much. i’ll be interested to see if
this gets taken up in the journal with the authors.

rogerhyam said,

August 25, 2008 at 11:49 am

What makes this and the placebo stuff interesting is our
oversimplification. We draw an imaginary line through a complex system
to divide body from mind then we are amazed that things occurring on
one side of that line appear to be related to things occurring on the
other side of the line.

The amazement is caused by drawing the line not the observable facts.

I am naive in this area but I can’t think of a falsifiable experiment
to demonstrate the existence of mind in a subject so perhaps we should
never, within science, talk of a relationship between mind and body
any more than we should talk of a relationship between body and soul
or soul and God.

rogerhyam said,

I do of course mean a “falsifiable hypothesis” rather than
“falsifiable experiment” in my last post.

curlyfries said,

I don’t have a copy of the paper yet but I should at least point out
that Ellen Langer believes that all health conditions, including AIDs
and Cancer, are caused entirely by our belief in them. She got into
trouble for reusing needles in an experiment:

http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=505277

To her, this wasn’t an issue as blood diseases don’t really exist. She
is generally regarded as a complete crackpot at Harvard.

1.

Jamie Horder said,

August 25, 2008 at 9:45 pm

curlyfries: Do you have a reference for her beliefs on AIDS and cancer
etc.?

I found this article:
http://psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=20000701-000028&page=1

In which she says that our beliefs about disease, such as breast
cancer, can (directly or indirectly) affect our health. But she never
says that disease is caused by our belief in it. It looks like fairly
standard “Think positive!” advice to me.

This is a really interesting story, thanks Ben.

I have seen the behavioural pattern below in family and friends:

After doing exercise, many tend to stay off the sugary foods/deserts
for fear of undoing the good work of exercise.
But perversely, at times when they feel that they are not getting
enough exercise are more likely to indulge perhaps in the belief that
their health drive will start the following week.

Convincing workers that they are exercising vigorously is likely to
influence self esteem and dietary choices(small changes such as
putting less food on the plate might be hard to detect).

The other factor is how it changes the workers’ attitude to their job.
A worker who sees an extra benefit from the job in the form of
exercise may ‘work out’ more effectively - modify how they do their
job (e.g hoover more vigorously).

And finally, a worker who feels knackered and sore after a shift,
instead of feeling achy and in need of a sofa and comfort food, may
when informed feel a sense of reward from the aches and take better
care of their diet and maybe take other forms of exercise (such as
walking to shop rather than taking the car).

healthydistrust said,

August 26, 2008 at 12:19 pm

The researchers did ask about diet:
‘ …the subjects reported their habits had not changed over the past 30
days with respect to how much they ate (including servings of sugary
foods and vegetables) and how much they drank (caffeine, alcohol, and
water)…neither increased exercise nor decreased caloric intake was
reported by the subjects.’
And they also cautioned:
‘Of course, it is possible that the room attendants actually did
change their behavior—actually did cut back on calories, improve the
quality of the food they ate, or work harder or more energetically—but
did not report such changes. However, previous research has found it
very difficult to change behavior of this sort (Deutschman, 2005).
Thus, even if these behavioral changes did occur as a result of the
intervention, that too would make these results interesting’, and it
would, too, no?

Comment 27:

Firstly, you were beaten to your hi-fucking-larious point by eyalbd at
number 5.

Secondly, it’s pretty clear that Ben meant ‘likely to die during the
period studied’.

Perhaps your crusade for accurate writing would be better directed
against those who deliberately fudge numbers in order to mislead
people and not against the author of a web blog which is, well… on
your side.

Other observations:

1) Dietary recall is notoriously poor. So much so that unless you have
detailed contemporaneous diet logs, dietary recall is essentially
worthless. Even contemporaneous diet logs are only reliable if they
are kept by somebody *watching* the subject, and not by the subject.
If you are not weighing and measuring, you are guessing, and your
guess is no better than anyone else’s.

2) Most of the ’studies’ I have read on nutrition would not get a
passing grade in a rigorous science course. My favorite along that
line was a study (in a peer-reviewed journal, no less) in which the
‘researchers’ removed the sugar from the diet of one group, and
concluded from the observed health improvements that animal protein
was bad for diabetics. I kid thee not. Modern nutritional education is
not far enough removed from religion, and generally suffers from
massive confirmation bias.

perceive their health to be excellent, regardless of how healthy they
actually are. Once again this goes to show the danger of relying on
self-report data for health research.

Soooo…

People’s perceptions of their own state of health are a better
prediction of their risk of death than whatever collection of
surrogate markers are being used by the study to determine ‘health’.
And yet, somehow it’s the people who are wrong, not the markers? I
know that when a model fails to match reality, normal practise is for
scientists to blame reality, but mostly they manage to be a little
less blatant about it.

(And, in passing, I tend to regard any study which uses a lower BMI as
a marker for ‘health’ as automatically suspect. Overweight/obese BMI
categories are consistently associated with a lower risk of death. I
hope that Bad Science knows better than to buy into the trend for
aesthetics-based medicine.)

It would be interesting to find out if moves were taken to eliminate
the Hawthorne Effect - (i.e. management takes an interest so moral
improves) or was the control group just ignored.

After all the Hawthorne Effect generally results in an improvement in
productivity which in this case would be more thorough and hence more
vigorous cleaning.

e.g. 1) advertising healthy eating and the other factors which would
ideally be eliminated - in both environments.
2) pointing out the wonderful safety is in the hotel
3) (to go for the classic Hawthorne observation) taking equal care to
explain a wonderous lighting levels initiative.

As an aspiring psychologist, the last sentence of that article made me
shed a little tear of joy. There’s hope yet. Thank you!

Why bother to think yourself thin when you can buy and use the ‘pink
patch’? This novel snake oil contains magic substances (bladderwrack,
eye of newt etc) which when placed on yout skin will make you lose
weight painlessly. It is being marketed to gullible women via hotmail
accounts.

@Diotima -
Ooh, ooh, I’ve heard of those pink patch things. A blogger got their
ads taken off myspace. Apparently, they’ve been banned from facebook
too.

TBtAM

and here

I’ve also seen a page advertising a dietary supplement as a cancer
drug on myspace.

I’m a bit surprised there was no improvement in the control group: if
I was weighed, quizzed about my poor diet/alcohol consumption/lack of
exercise, and told I would be weighed again in a month, I’d probably
try to cut down my fried mars bars (if only for that month).

I also don’t understand how the initial observation is “not unusual”.
Isn’t it effectively saying either that they’re burning more calories
than they’re eating, or that the measurements or model are seriously
flawed?

I don’t watch much telly. When I do I don’t watch sport. I don’t care
for beer. I don’t subscribe to a gym. I would like to cycle — or
better yet, walk — to work but I expect I would be run over as there
are no bike paths around here.

Does that mean I am not fat or that I am not a person?

Get a good bike rear view mirror - with a gentle convex curve, but not
like the back of a spoon - and I reckon you’ll be all right. Lights
essential, fluorescent vest optional, Poundland sell ‘em I think.

Last night I was reading about the Electra “Townie” bike design, an
American cruiser modified to provide the convenience of resting the
foot flat on the ground while stationary. On a normal correctly
adjusted bike it’s tip-toe. But I was doing this because under 220
pounds weight plus backpack, the frame of my Electra Cruiser snapped
away where the seat-post is gripped, after several years of good
service. In fact, I’m assured that it has a “lifetime guarantee” and
will be replaced free, leaving only the cost of paying someone to put
every other piece of the bike onto the new frame.
