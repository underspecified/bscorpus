Part two of my Radio 4 show on the placebo effect, 9pm tonight
(Monday)

August 25th, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in podcast, onanism, placebo, bad
science |

So tonight at 9pm on BBC Radio 4 (Monday) you can hear the second
episode of my two-part miniseries on the placebo effect, one of the
most effective and neglected evidence based treatments known to man.

In this show we look at the ethical and practical implications of
research into the placebo effect, and discuss whether it’s okay - or
even necessary - to lie to patients. The answer, from me at any rate,
is “no”.

You can listen to it after 9pm from the listen again link here:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/rams/sci9_mon_20080825.ram

And for those of you who don’t want to install Realplayer, a
thoroughly stupid piece of proprietary software that messes with your
computer and has the arrogance to put the “Real.com Message Centre” in
your taskbar to harrass you with stupid pointless adverts about
celebrities (the BBC, of all people, what on earth are they thinking…)
then I will illegally record my own programme off the radio and post a
proper normal mp3 file on this page once it’s been broadcast, unless
someone important reads this and tells me not to.

Here it is.

www.badscience.net/files/Placebo%20BBC%20Radio%204%20Ben%20Goldacre%20-%20Part%202.mp3

Oh, and part one got the radio equivalent of linky love from Pick of
the Week, which you can hear here:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4_aod.shtml?radio4/potw

I genuinely love radio 4 science, as I’ve said before. It takes days
and days and days to make a programme, and there’s absolutely bugger
all money in it, but they really are the only place in the media where
you can find clever people to generate and broadcast intelligent
science content (Matt Silver, the producer, was brilliant, and is off
to do a PhD in bioinformatics now). I’ve been trying to get them to
let me do a short series on the crimes of the pharmaceutical industry,
which is what I teach medical students and doctors, and it’s riddled
with interesting bits of science and anger-provoking badness. The
pitch is in for this round I think, so fingers crossed and all that.

Oh, and my book is out next Monday. It really is. And it’s actually
pretty good. I should start going on about it soon.

Ive thought it might be best if patients could opt in to have placebos
perscribed to them if the doctor felt it was necessary. This would
hopefully avoid the ethical issues whilst making use of the placebo
effect.

Realplayer seems fine btw, just tell it not to display messages.

Gratz on the book being out as well.

MP3 is stupid and proprietary too, you know?

I’d appreciate Ogg Vorbis if it’s not too much hassle.

Well, I’m probably going to buy the book but - key question - does it
cover any ground you haven’t already covered in your columns? I think
I’ve read pretty much all your columns since the first one, so I’m
expecting something new and wonderful.

Incidentally, Amazon says you’re 31. I reckon you’ve been 31 for about
three years now. A miracle of modern science.

Pro reason, you have to wait until after the program has aired
tonight. That is why it is called listen *again*.

Seems to be flavour of the month, New Scientist this week has a big
piece on the placebo effect. For those with login access it is here:
http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19926700.300-the-power-of-the-placebo-effect-.html

Interesting points that some bioactive compounds only work when the
patient is aware of taking them and they may not work directly only
trigger endorphin cascades through association. Not true placebo since
sugar pills are not bioactive in that way. Some funky stuff to come
from this, provided we can ethically do the experiments…

gazza said,

Just some ‘thinking out loud’ views on the placebo info coming from
Ben’s radio programmes - and I have no medical background either, so
bear with me!

Firstly, it seems obvious to me that placebo, in any of its pill-like
or other forms, would be of use to patients who have illnesses where,
dare I say, psychomatic effects are present, or at least where ‘mood’
is playing a role in a illness which normally be controlled in a
normally healthy person. That doesn’t surprise me at all. And any
supposed immorality arising from deliberate use of placebo in such
circumstances by a GP, treating a cold, or sore throat, for example,
seems to me to be of no importance - just the equivalent of soothing
words.

Secondly, the big surprise is that placebos can induce bio-chemical
changes in the body, and that this may help in the treatment of some
more serious illnesses. This was the fascinating aspect to me. As Ben
indicates, the moral aspect of using placebos here seems a minefield
and isn’t clear to me.

Thirdly, no comment was really made in the programmes on the limits of
placebo for ’serious’ illnesses (let’s say most cancers, heart
disease, HIV, etc). In these cases I can imagine placebos having no
important biochemical impact - I cannot believe there’s a placebo
contribution to chemotherapy, for example. But possibly they could
help induce a ‘positive mental outlook’ in the patient on the basis of
false hope which could improve quality of life for a time anyway. I’m
not recommending it as it’s immoral certainly, and of no long term
benefit but arguably an alternative approach for those who can’t face
a terminal diagnosis. It’s this hope via placebo that quack therapies
are offering to the seriously ill and why they can claim to offer some
benefits in such circumstances.

Anyway, just some thoughts stimulated in me by these fascinating
programmes which I thought I’d share!

It is a little known fact that the pills in the first Matrix film were
a placebo. Keanu Reeves only had to be acknowledge the existence of
reality to himself - he didn’t need a drug. (This may be ruined by the
sequels which I never saw on the grounds I have never met anyone who
thought they were worth watching).

If anyone’s after an alternative to Real Player to listen to Ben’s
prog, I’ve had great success with “Real Alternative” (google it). Does
everything you would want (i.e. makes sounds when you click the link)
without the unnecessary “features” like the “Real.com Message
Centre”….

ephemera said,

August 26, 2008 at 8:27 pm

Hmmm..

As a clinical hypnotherapist and NLP Master Practitioner and Trainer,
I have come across the placebo effect and have some theories about how
it works.

The mind and body are the same system, and a change in the body will
cause changes in the mind, and vice versa. Simply changing your
physiological state (for example sitting hunched over, looking down,
will tend to depress your mood. In contrast, try to be unhappy whilst
looking up and sitting or standing tall. There will always be
exceptions to this ‘rule’, however!

From the standpoint of drugs, however, it does get a little more
complex. (I will say here that I am not medically trained and these
are my own musings!) Using the example of Pavlovian response training,
is it possible that the body can replicate the effects of some drugs
merely by taking a similarly shaped and tasting pill, and in the full
belief that it is the pill the body has taken in the past? And taking
this further, even to the point of telling the pill recipient that the
pill is even stronger than the expected medication, without the side
effects, if any, of the old pill…

Of course, the moral arguments still remain, and if the patient knows
the pill is a placebo does it have the same effect? I guess I’ll have
to listen to the podcasts to find out…!

Whats goes against a holistic view of health in which the cultural,
economic, psychological, physiological (etc) are integrated, is not
allopathic bio-medicine per se. but politics, specifically a
contemporary political agenda that seeks to atomise health by breaking
it down into measurable parts for economic measurement and profitable
gain. As Atul Gawande has pointed out (i don’t have the reference to
hand but you could start here http://www.gawande.com/articles.htm),
the most effective way to improve healthcare is by allowing clinicians
to spend more time with their patients, not by doing more
investigations and procedures.

Most doctors and other health workers will recognise patients who are
aware that they are as they are because of their life experiences and
circumstances. They need ‘care’ in as full a sense as is possible
(women’s hour today gave a fine example of the Iceni project in
Ipswich http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/)

In these cases (as in much of General Practice) care extends far
beyond drugs and placebos.

Ben Goldacre sez:
“otherwise realaudio’s not THAT bad…”

Heck it isn’t!

It’s like taking a casual stroll through the ru-TLD with your pants
down and your skirt up, possibly both at the same time. And these
funny reboots many of my acquaintances experience on their Windows
machines are actually BSODs—when the Real Player tries to phone home
in ways it’s so not supposed to. (I’m a certified computer technician,
as a pastime.)

So pleeaaaze somebody post this in a digestable format, I’m starving
to listen to the second part!

Still, it would be great to have it stored on harddisk as an mp3/ogg

@Gazza: “Thirdly, no comment was really made in the programmes on the

heart disease, HIV, etc).”
Yes, that’s something I thought about too. For example, a fair few
homeopaths have healer fantasies about curing serious diseases (like
those you have named) with their sugar pills and magic water. I find
the discussion about the ethics of lying to patients interesting, but
surely it is something that could not even be considered in cases such
as cancer etc.

I’ve just listened to the 2nd program and what struck me was the bind
a placebo puts a knowledgable patient in…. You’ve had the placebo (and
good doctor patient relations) and you havn’t been able to persuade
your body to respond, so it is all your fault that you are not getting
better…..

For those who need to use real media files, and are fed up with real
player, an alternative is Real Alternative available from
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/real_Alternative.htm

It works a treat and leaves no adverts or associated crud on your
system. I’m listening to part 2 of Ben’s programme now and it works
fine.

Cheers.

Getonyerbike said,

August 28, 2008 at 2:29 pm

Clearly placebo effects are limited, but if you have heart disease or
cancer you won’t recover with anti-hypertensives or chemotherapy
alone; you need empathy, hope, motivation and encouragement -all
apparently components of the ‘placebo effect’

What Ben’s progammes have demonstrated is that placebo effects are
real and complex and involve a patient expectation, the doctor’s
behaviour and social factors (and more)

Placebo effect is too simple a term to adequately describe this range
of processes, so we/you/ Ben(!) need(s) urgently to develop the
necessary lexicon so that when we say ’snake oil’ we’re not talking
about good communication skills.

25MB? That’s a bit much. The size of the whole Realaudio stream is
only 14MB. There’s no point trying to re-encode it at such a high
bitrate. You’re trying to encode data that ain’t there.

I’ve re-encoded it as Ogg Vorbis, with a low, variable bitrate. You
can hear the compression, but it’s worth it for the file size. I could
add a few MB and make it sound perfect.

Does anyone know the effect of paying for treatment?

Has anyone done a trial for example, of paying Gillian Mckeith either
nothing, a lot, or an awful lot for the same ‘treatment’ and then
measuring the outcome?

If paying more for a treatment makes it more effective, how do we
determine which patient and which treatments are influenced (or not)
by this?

Lemonade Lily said,

August 28, 2008 at 5:14 pm

Thanks for mp3 JB - will now enjoy Placebo train journey tomorrow am.
Am not sure what to do with Oggs but they sound nice.

Ian - agree - can intelligent, reasoning sceptics benefit from the
placebo effect?

1.

Getonyerbike said,

August 28, 2008 at 6:13 pm

Yes Lemonade, definately. A couple of centuries back in the
philosophers believed that intelligent, reasoning sceptics had
separate centers for emotion and reasoning but now scientists believe
that the separation of reason and emotion is not only futile, but
impossible.

That said, there’s a vast amount of ignorance about science and
scientific method, statistical analysis and psychology that all
contribute to the wonders of advertising, consumerism and new-age
evangelicalism that rightly raise indignant heckles and Ben has to be
cheered for trying to help us battle those who would exploit us with
their false promises and dodgy marketing.

We should be grateful that we’re better educated, less anxious, less
narcissistic (and hence less vulnerable to exploitation) than others,
and do our (Christian) moral duty by protecting those who are.

Lily, if you haven’t yet installed the Vorbis codec, then here it is:

MP3 is lower-quality, and patent-encumbered.

By the way, Ben, I thought you did a good job of grilling those
doctors. They all seemed to want to twist words to make out that they
weren’t lying to patients. You were consistently open and frank about
it.

Ben

Off the thread I know, but related to your high BBC media profile.

Good chat on the breakfast sofa this morning on superfoods.

I’m not sure how far rational persuasion is going to get on a
programme where one of the main headlines is ‘Line-up on Strictly Come
Dancing announced’.

Are Richard and Judy still going?

Getonyerbike said,

August 29, 2008 at 5:45 pm

hmm
i just tried using the phrase “the published evidence doesn’t support
specialist referral because there is no evidence that it confers any
benefit”
and the patient said, “i don’t care!”
The irony is that the specialist is keen for referrals despite the
absence of evidence because that’s how they get paid and the patient
wants a referral because they don’t believe that their problem could
be of a self-limiting type that can resolve without a ’specialist’
intervention.
In this case the placebo is the ’specialist’ (being special)

HypnoSynthesis said,

August 30, 2008 at 10:36 am

There already is a non-deceptive placebo intervention, in a sense.
Various forms of psychological therapy which employ autosuggestion can
be seen in this light. Of course, hypnosis would be the most obvious
example, although CBT (which evolved out of hypnotherapy in some
respects) also employs self-talk as a means of self-regulating
emotional responses which may have an effect upon physical health.

Now, as I mentioned in another post, as a hypnotherapist myself, even
I would admit that it’s accrued a great deal of flakeyness. But the
basic concept introduced by James Braid in the 1840s was dead simple…
If you help people to focus their attention for a while on a dominant
idea, to the exclusion of anything else, and raise expectation, then
there’s an increased effect of the imagination upon the body’s
responses, and this can be used to deliberately (non-deceptively)
replicate the placebo effect using suggestion. Irving Kirsch therefore
calls hypnosis a “non-deceptive mega-placebo.”

Proper research in the field of hypnosis, tends to suggest certain
areas where it’s more effective, and these can be compared to the
sphere in which the placebo effect operates.

By the way, you should also consider Emile Coue in this respect. He
was the French pharmacist who popularised autosuggestion as a form of
self-help in the 1920s. He was very famous in his day. I’ll look for a
snippet to post.

principle of movement. Imagination, indeed, governs all the forces of
sensibility, while the latter, in its turn, controls the beating of
the heart, and through it sets in motion all vital functions; thus the
entire organism may be rapidly modified. Nevertheless, however vivid
the imagination, it cannot change the form of a hand or foot or other
bodily member.” (Aristotle, cited by Coué, My Method, 1923: 4)

Autosuggestion, Coue stressed, does some things but not others. It’s
sphere of effect is probably virtually the same as the placebo effect.
Stress, anxiety, pain, and depression seem to be particularly
responsive to autosuggestion, and to some extent physical illness,
which is sometimes exacerbated by stress. As Coue long ago said, in
his seminars,

“For instance, if you have a leg cut off, and you imagine the leg will
grow again, it is positive it will not grow again, because till now we
are not able to produce such miracles; but if we have sad ideas, if we
have organs which do not work well, if we have pain in a part of our
body and we imagine that the sad ideas will be replaced by pink [sic.]
ideas, that our organs will, little by little, function better; that
the pain we have, in whatever part of the body, will disappear, it
takes place, because it is possible.” (Coué, 1923: 111)

Each alternate survey on the effect of mental attitude on cancer
outcome reverses the previous published conclusion, turn about, it
helps, it doesn’t. I don’t think there’s been one to say that being
terrified and certain that you will die in agony improves the chance
that you won’t, it’s positive thinking that is supposed to be the
medicine.

I think we have discussed a psychology experiment where the perceived
value of financial advice in an investment simulation depended on the
price charged for the advice, or somethiing like that. This probably
maps to the abstract psychological element of placebo effect - someone
is doing something nice for you - but that isn’t necessarily the whole
story.

Haere’s a thought: placebo vaccine. Bad iea, yes?

Very interesting as usual. I am writing my MA project on ‘Placebo’
(cultural aspects …things like belief, role of religion and authority
etc…) Dylan Evans has an interesting theory on placebo called the
‘acute phase response’ (you can download the pdf from his site). I
like his idea that placebos largely ‘work’ with ‘defensive’ biological
problems (this was Patrick Wall’s opinion with pain interventions).
Dylan looks at conditions such as depression/anxiety/pain and some
types of inflammation as amenable to ‘meaning responses’(Dan Moremans
idea) As these problems contribute to a considerable amount of
suffering in general society than the factors that enhance placebo
reactions are probably worthwhile studying and attempting to enhance
in clinical practice.
For anyone that is interested Anne Harrington has a very interesting
book out called the Cure Within - A History of Mind-Body Medicine
which is relevant to the debate.

I accidentally listened to Radio 3 but it was still a fantastic
programme.

A suggested definition to help:
Placebo: A intervention designed to mirror a trial intervention except
for that aspect of the trial intervention under investigation.

So for example in testing homeopathy to test whether the pills are
active you would use the homeopathic consultation but with sugar
pills.

A placebo therefore can ONLY exist as a mirror intervention, it cannot
exist in its own right. This helps clear the dillemna, ‘what is a
placebo effect?’ because instead we can say, ‘what is the effect of
sugar pills, or pink lights on a physiotherapy machine, or confident
friendly consultation skills etc. i.e. calling these things what they
are instead of lumping them under the catch-all, ‘placebo’

Additionally it can help doctors to be more aware of the complex way
in which they are healers and not simply evidence-based prescribing
machines.

See the December BMJ for a quirky look at the requirements of evidence
based science…

Re 39: a placebo doesn’t have to imitate a realistic non-placebo
therapy except in the mind of the patient. For instance, mumbo-jumbo
with a crystal swung on a string over your body could be a placebo
process. And placebo isn’t only relevant to trials. The placebo effect
may be all that a patient needs to relieve, say, chronic back pain,
psychologically at least: so why do anything else? To avoid placebo
side-effects perhaps - so we -do- need those trials.
