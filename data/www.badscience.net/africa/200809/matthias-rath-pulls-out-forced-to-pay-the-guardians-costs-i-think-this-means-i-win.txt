Matthias Rath drops his million pound legal case against me and the
Guardian.

September 12th, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in matthias rath, africa |

It’s just been publicly announced that the vitamin pill magnate
Matthias Rath has pulled out of his gruelling legal case against me
and the Guardian. He bought full page adverts denouncing Aids drugs
while promoting his vitamin pills in South Africa, a country where
hundreds of thousands die every year from Aids under an HIV denialist
president and the population is ripe for miracle cures. I said his
actions were highly worrying, in no uncertain terms. I believe I was
right to do so.

This libel case has drawn on for over a year, with the writ hanging
both in my toilet, and over my head. Although fighting it has been
fascinating, and in many respects a great pleasure, it has also taken
a phenomenal amount of my time, entirely unpaid, to deal with it. For
the duration of the case I have also been silenced on the serious
issues that Rath’s activities raise, the chapter on his work was
pulled from my book, and I have been unable to comment on his further
movements around the world.

This will now change, and I hope that other newspapers will have the
sense to step outside of commercial allegiances and write about his
activities, despite this single incident being one newspaper’s tussle.
I genuinely believe that the madness of the South African government’s
approach to Aids is one of the most important stories of our time.

Usefully, it seems that Rath will now be responsible for the
Guardian’s legal costs. Interim costs were awarded this afternoon at
just shy of a quarter of a million, and we are seeking the full half a
million pounds the paper has spent. For my part, I will probably now
write a swift book on Rath and South Africa, as a way to make all the
fascinating extra information I’ve had to dredge through useful to
others, and to try and recoup something so that my time was not
wasted. It will be meticulously well referenced and carefully written.

I trust that this episode will act as a very strong cautionary note to
the more vicious UK figures from the very corporate $50bn food
supplement industry some of whom have used bullying, smears, and legal
threats in their desperate bid to prevent people from examining their
ideas: this goes to the very top of the industry, you should know by
now that it will not work, and unless you change tack rapidly, some of
you will have some very interesting surprises to come. Play nicely
now, they’re only ideas.

I should also mention that I am extremely pleased and - cheesily -
proud that the Guardian fought this case. It’s exactly the kind of
thing I’d have expected from them, it’s the paper my grandparents
bought, blah blah blah, and to me today everything they stand for is
still very good indeed. I don’t think many other papers would tolerate
a column as childish and wilfully geeky as mine, and for all the
hassle, in a funny twist of reputation judo, the various corporate
complaints about my work over the past few years have done me a world
of good. I was just some nerd who emailed in a column once a week, but
once I was being chased by millionaires it was lagers with the bosses.
The editor txted me the other day. To me that is some slightly weird
shit.

So, more to follow no doubt, but here is my comment piece for
tomorrow’s paper, and below that, links to the triumphant Guardian
coverage. I recommend buying the paper on Saturday just so that you
can stroke it and reward their valour. It’s good on Saturdays anyway,
and the leader is particularly excellent. Newspapers can be very good
things, and today the Guardian is a very good one indeed.

With their money, myopia and abuses, these pill makers match big
pharma

The food supplement industry likes to style itself as people’s
medicine, but the way it stifles debate is far from democratic

Ben Goldacre
guardian.co.uk,
Friday September 12 2008 19:00 BST
Matthias Rath today pulled out of a legal case against the Guardian
which has cost the organisation £500,000 to defend. I am proud that we
fought it. Rath is an example of the worst excesses of the alternative
therapy industry; UK nutritionists make foolish claims on poor
evidence – they can make your child a genius with fish oils, or
prevent heart attacks in the distant future – but Rath transplanted
these practices into the world of HIV/Aids, where evidence really
matters.

The potential consequences of his actions are outrageous, but he is by
no means untypical. This sector has engineered a beneficent public
image for itself, a warm and friendly cottage industry; but that
fantasy is not borne out by the facts.

First, despite claims about the true evils of “big pharma”, presented
as if they were evidence that vitamin pills are effective, there is
little difference between the vitamin and pharmaceutical industries.
Key players in both include multinationals such as Roche and Aventis;
BioCare, the vitamin pill producer that media nutritionist Patrick
Holford works for, is part-owned by Elder Pharmaceuticals, and so on.

The food supplement market, comprising products like vitamin pills and
herbal supplements, is worth $50bn worldwide (against $600bn for
pharmaceuticals). It has lobbied angrily and successfully against
safety regulation, and the vitamin industry is also legendary in the
world of economics as the setting of the most outrageous price-fixing
cartel ever documented: during the 1990s the main offenders pleaded
guilty and had to pay $1.5bn, the largest criminal fine levied in
legal history.

That’s quite some cottage industry, and it is tightly linked to the
“nutritional therapists” community. Bant, their UK membership
organisation, recently changed its code of conduct in accordance with
the wishes of pill manufacturers, so that members can now take
undisclosed financial kickbacks for the pills they prescribe to
patients. Doctors are struck off the GMC register for this activity,
and rightly so.

Last year I went to a public meeting hosted by Matthias Rath in east
London. He spoke for three gruelling hours, and every time he
mentioned the side-effects of a treatment prescribed by doctors, the
people in the seats behind me growled the word “murderers” in a
venomous tone. Their hatred was intense, and it was unnerving to sit
near them.

How do people become so extreme in their views? How have they been
isolated from the realities of the miracle cure industries? A
combination of wishful thinking, successful PR, and legal muscle.

When I attempted simply to write that the Dore miracle cure for
dyslexia had not cured three people, we received several legal warning
letters, delaying the piece by a month. An academic who dared to
criticise the evidence base for the programme received a threatening
legal letter delivered by hand to her home address.

Gillian McKeith has made repeated legal threats against websites who
have dared to discuss her work, and her lawyer husband has threatened
an academic who suggested testing her ideas. She also has a legal case
hanging over the Sun that has seen little movement in three years.

When chiropractors had their practices challenged in the New Zealand
Medical Journal they simply sent a threatening legal letter (”Let’s
hear your evidence,” said the editorial in response, “not your legal
muscle”). A herbal pill entrepreneur – and academic – had Professor
David Colquhoun’s website removed from UCL servers after he dared to
question her evidence. The Society of Homeopaths had a blogger
silenced by threatening his web host.

I could go on. And of course, deterring dissent goes wider than the
use of libel law. There is also the bizarre smear operation against
critics of the food supplement industry, and an elaborate campaign
conducted by homeopaths against Professor Edzard Ernst, an academic
who has simply dared to examine the evidence for their claims, which
ended up with his employers at Exeter University being harassed to
silence him.

Meanwhile the alternative therapists who run university BSc courses
refuse to release their lecture notes, or let anyone see their exam
papers, in a desperate attempt not to engage with critical appraisal
from the worlds of scientific evidence of which they purport to be a
part.

This is not just unpleasant, it is also unhealthy. Ideas improve when
they are challenged and questioned. I am a doctor, journalist and
academic. I criticise the activities of doctors, journalists and
academics in each of my jobs, and I welcome other people criticising
my ideas.

Nothing could be more anti-democratic or stifling to debate than using
money, law and power to regulate what can be discussed, and yet those
who do it have the gall to represent themselves as the outsider, the
little man, concerned with the medicine of the people. In reality they
behave like nothing more than commercial entities.

The food supplement pill industry is phenomenally powerful, extremely
lucrative and incredibly influential, but it has shown itself to be
philosophically and commercially incapable of critical self-appraisal.
Rath is its product. It is inconceivable that any individual within
that industry would be brave enough to stand up and criticise his
activities – and for that, more than anything else, it should be
condemned.

Congratulations Ben, I shall head out tomorrow to get myself a copy. I

“[Gillian McKeith] also has a legal case hanging over the Sun that has

Wow, the Sun holding the moral high ground…

Truly Excellent news.

I shall look forward to a headline about Herr Doktor Rath to stand
with the Grauniad’s famous “A Liar and a cheat” for Messrs Hamilton
and Aitken.

And similarly delighted about the Gruan. Ditto as you for “family”
paper, parents read it, daily reader since I could read and all that…
delighted to have the faith repaid.

Ben - I note that you recommend buying the paper just as the price is
increased. That can’t be just coincidence.

ctc5 - Charlie Brooker usually does the screen burn column just before
the Televison listings in the guide.

I would say something like ‘keep up the good work’ but I think,

Well done to the Guardian too, I expected nothing less.

So, beers on you Ben?

Absolutely bloody marvellous. Congratulations to you and to Rusbridger

they aren’t interested in scientific arguments, just making money.

Moaning about bad science is not just about feeling agrieved about the
dominance of nonsense in society. This is an example of where clearly
stating the facts can save lives.

The University of Cape Town estimated that 340,000 deaths could have
been saved if the South African government had not delayed the roll
out of ARVs. Rath should have this on his conscience - if he has one.
The fact that he prefers to sue suggests not.

Yes peterd102. I posted and then thought “that was a bit serious”.
What I meant was - U-da-man Ben. Maybe you can hang some much more
pleasant pictures of flowers or seagulls in your loo rather than the
writ from rath.

sophiedb said,

September 13, 2008 at 1:08 am

Nicely done

I’ll probably sound like a kook here, but the most frustrating food
supplement industry has to be that for baby milk. They barrel their
way through advertising regulation loop holes with the ease and grace
of a 5-tonne elephant, but the government doesn’t seem to notice.

I know formula doesn’t kill indiscriminately, but even the NHS is full
of stats declaring how much money they could save treating babies with
GE, kids with asthma, etc if only bf rates increased (or proper bottle
hygiene was followed!). Then there’s the increase in breast cancer,
which mums get a perfectly good chance to protect themselves from.

But it can’t be down to a silly/disgusting/inconvenient thing like
breastfeeding now, can it? Nooooo.. Don’t mind me, nothing to see
here..

So farewell then, Dr Matthias Rath,
You said you could cure shit,
With stuff that wasn’t cures.

That he could fly.

Congrats Ben on the fantastic news. It’s a wonderful vindication for
honest journalism, good science and basic common sense.
Now, the next question is who will play you in the movie… I can
picture another Erin Brockovich.

By the way, I see the victory has put your price up - your book is now
available from Multumbooks (through the link to Amazon on your site)
for £1,219.99.
Shameless profiteering I say…:)

Brilliant, absolutely brilliant, and great to see the Grauniad
gloating over a supremely justified court victory in a way I haven’t
seen since the glory days of Hamilton, Aitken and the like. Many
congratulations, and you’re forgiven for not answering your b3ta
questions…

Great piece as well, giving the context that this isn’t just one rogue
arsehole, it’s an entire big business system co-opting the language of
hippies to push its non-products on the unfortunate.

Please institute some kind of system where you will regularly be in a
predictable pub, and we can just come along and buy you beers at
reasonable, frequent intervals. Because bloody hell, you deserve it.

Anybody wanna send a copy of today’s paper to me in China? I can read

down nicely too …though I have demanded it for my birthday next month…

I’ll have the beers on your behalf tonight Ben!

Well done Ben. What are you going to do with all your ‘free’ time now?
Congratulations to you and the Guardian. The litany of illegal
actions, harrassment, bullying, deception, amorality, secretiveness,
and suppression of ideas by the supplements/CAM industry detailed
above make for some slightly depressing reading, but it’s good to hear
of a victory.

Here in South Africa there is a LOT of bogus medicine men, Sangomas

Reading both this piece and the editorial have made my morning.
Any chance of the publishers restoring the Rath chapter somewhere down
the line, or making it available as an online extra? Save you having
to write an entire book on the sod and it’d get the info out there
quickly.
Again, congratulations and keep on fighting the good fight.

Best of luck with the book, article and grants.

So nice to read this today. Can’t buy beers from China but did buy 3
copies of the book! Hopefully get it soon via a mule heading out this
way!

I just hope some PR firm (one with no interest in ever having a
pharma/nutrient client) offers to publicise this win in big
Rath/vitamin markets worldwide, for free. Or other great papers
syndicate all the dirty detail in recognition of how dangerous his
actions were.

Get drunk for a week and get publicising the week after!

你真棒！

Well done - that was very brave of you. It’s one thing to know that
the facts support your position, it’s another to have to justify them
in court, not least having to worry about the crazy sums of money
spent on legal fees that may come back to hit you if things break
against you. After all there is a risk in court - we’ve all seen that
the truth and a court verdict are not always the same thing.

And good to see that The Guardian supported one of its columnists in
this manner too. I’ll make sure I up my weekly read from now on (and
not just Saturday for your column).

I’m sure some jerk complained on this site the other day about any
money you may make out of your recent book - given the pressure you’ve
been under and the time you’ve had to take on this issue you deserve
at least something back from your campaigning in this field. So I’m
making sure that my default Xmas present this year to whoever is on my
list is your book…..

Legendary.

And many thanks for all the columns and the stubborn digging. When you
are old and grey you can comfort yourself with the knowledge that, as
well as achieving everything else, you played a fairly major role in
convincing a humanities-soaked twenty-something to start taking stats
and evidence and method very seriously.

So cheers.

wOOt indeed…

Given this verdict and the evidence presented against Rath:

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/13/matthiasrath.aids

Shouldn’t he be tried for manslaughter or something?

He is clearly an accessory factor in the deaths of people he had
convinced not to take their meds.

String him up!

1.

gadgeezer said,

September 13, 2008 at 2:48 pm

Nanny Ogg’s songs are pertinent to wide variety of situations or all
pertinent to the same occasion. Both songs must be sung at a
Valhalla-scale celebration in which key figures are sitting in tin
baths.

It’s really good to see the Grauniad giving front page coverage to Bad

Seriously, though, I’m even more impressed with the Guardian than

outdated and too hard on the defendant.

Fantastic, best story I’ve had through my RSS reader. Caught the front
of the Guardian in town today and gave a bit of a cheer to the
headline, but didn’t quite put two and two together.

A huge thank you for helping take on these charlatans, its just such a
shame that most journalists seem to swallow it all hook, line, sinker,
rod and fisherman.

to know that if they want to support Zackie Achmat’s work, they can

Firstly, brilliant result. Well done that man!

Secondly, I love that the google-ads on the Guardian story are still
true to form - ads for vitamin supplements and how to treat HIV with
“Silver Therapy” ( http://www.firehit.com/hiv/). And I quote - “IT IS
NOT A MAGICAL CURE AT ALL- IT IS INFORMATIVE WEBSITE” (methinks the
website doth protest too much).

I was only sorry to see that the BBC News website chose to ignore this

Lungs”‘.

Ah well.

Hooray! That’s fantastic news.
Spent most of yesterday looking though his many websites. I can’t
comment on any of the science but it made an interesting study -
blaming the holocaust on a pharmaceutical company, predicting a
nuclear war before Nov 4th, proposing a new EU constitution…

Congratulations Ben– I’d have had a stroke with rage and frustration
if that was done to me.

And almost maximum kudos to the Guardian, if it wasn’t for the
editorial bit– in praise of your [you + the paper] fight against this
nonsense… then the next item was “in praise of broccoli”

Now, I was at a wedding so I missed the super-health giving properties
that must have made the news, but I thought some of the claims made in
that editorial pressed my dubiousness button! Ah, sweet editorial
juxtapositional irony!

Important court case and congrats, but I had a quick look on
Googlenews and… surprisingly few stories. Sure, fire in the
blogosphere, but I want to see more coverage in mainstream media.
Maybe there is, and Googlenews doesn’t show it to me… Ah, but it only
delivers news in English.

Does anyone know what sort of coverage this story got in South Africa?
Is the coverage reaching those who Rath reached with his advertising
campaigns? And what about the other countries he operates in?

1.

suntzu said,

September 15, 2008 at 12:19 am

This is great, great stuff.

Well done Ben and well done The Guardian.

I’ve been a Guardian reader ever since I can remember. It’s reassuring
to know that they’re willing to put their money where there mouth is
and make a stand for rationality when it counts.

(Makes up - just about - for all the flakey lifestyle/wellness stuff
in the Saturday magazine supplement. Though, to be fair, they have a
lot less of it than the other major papers)

Just to add to the large number of well-deserved congratulatory

@ Warhelmet
Haven’t seen much over here in his native Germany, but it turns out
that Die Zeit wrote about his operation in South Africa back in May
2005 -
http://www.zeit.de/2005/21/Glosse_21
- also reminding readers about the ‘Dominik’ trial in Hamburg. He’s
widely referred to as “controversial vitamin doctor”.
Quite a lot on him here too: http://www.agpf.de/Rath.htm (”Information
about sects, cults and the psycho-market”)
I’ll translate and add some of this to my previous blogpost as soon as
I get chance.

Nice McKeith pun there!!

Thought they’d at least put your pic with the main Rath item, but
since Bad Science got transmogrified into a comment piece with your
non-Mary Shelley persona on the byline, not bad going …

Just to add my little tuppence-worth - sincere congratulations, Ben.

Talk about inspiration - science-lovers of the world unite!

Jane Smith said,

September 15, 2008 at 8:16 pm

Late to the party as usual, but this is truly marvellous news. I was
stressed out when someone took me to the small claims court over some
peacocks I sold him and only the odd £50 was at risk there (I won, by
the way). How you felt with all this going on I can only imagine.

And to bring us all down again, someone commented upstream, “I’ll
probably sound like a kook here, but the most frustrating food
supplement industry has to be that for baby milk.” Just today I heard
that babies somewhere (sorry for the lack of detail) have been dying
because of contaminated baby milk powder, and hundreds (I think) more
are sickening. It’s criminal. Really. It’s probably not within the
remit of Bad Science: but who else could do something about this?

Bravo. But while I of course agree with you eulogies for the Guardian,
here are the ads that appeared to me at the bottom of the paper’s
webpage when I was reading the report on Rath:

Ads by Google

*Vitamin UK Health Site
Over 20,000 Top Brand Products Discount Prices - Next Day Despatch

*HIV saliva Test
£29 Fast Accurate Easy Home sample tested at Private Lab

*UK Colloidal Silver

The BBC has recently covered [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart] quite a
lot - Washington correspondent Matt Frei seems to be a fan, I think
it’s his reports that have Stewart’s clips in sometimes - gave him an
episode of Radio 4’s 15 minute [Profile] and got very excited when
Tony Blair appeared on the show. And I think NOT ONCE mentioned that
the BBC’s own main audience can see the show on one of Channel 4’s
digital options on Freeview. Except when I went on their message board
to go on about it at length. Mostly in conversation with someone who
thinks Stewart isn’t a patch on Stephen Colbert although I think he
has been won over since. Anyway… the BBC avoids mentioning other media
players’ triumphs like The Independent used to avoid mentioning the
Royal Family.

More good news - South Africa’s new president has moved the erstwhile
health minister, Manto Thshabalala-Msimang, out of the health ministry
and given her a new portfolio (minister in the office of the
president) where she can safely rant about beetroot and garlic to her
heart’s content without doing too much harm. Three cheers for Barbara
Hogan the new health minister - can’t wait to finally see some
sensible government policies regarding HIV.
Ben - if you haven’t already done so you might want to read Jonny
Steinberg’s “Three letter plague” - its a brilliant investigation of
the limits of SA’s AIDS treatment program - definitely one of the best
books I’ve read this year.
