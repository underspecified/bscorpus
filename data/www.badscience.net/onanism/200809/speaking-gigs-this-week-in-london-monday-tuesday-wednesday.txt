Talks this week in London, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday..

September 14th, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in onanism |

Sorry for the slightly late notice, I’m doing three talks this week in
London, Monday in Holborn in a pub, Tuesday in King’s Cross in a
Library, and Wednesday in Charing Cross Road in a bookshop.

Also I’ve been bullied into making a facebook page which is here:

http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/Ben-Goldacre-Bad-Science/26030473910

I’ll post upcoming events here, and in the miniblog, and on that page,
and will rig up an RSS feed to pipe a duplicate of the blog over there
too. There’s a “group” called badscience which already has about 700
members, but I think the facebook people are transferring all of it
over to the new “page”, because only a page can take an RSS feed. For
more on the differences between “groups” and “pages” on facebook you
might want to waste three hours of your life reading their fascinating
technical support documents.

Monday - Skeptics In The Pub

http://www.skeptic.org.uk/pub/

Hi All,
It will be a year since we moved to The Penderel’s Oak this September,
so to celebrate we have an extra special guest speaker.
Ben Goldacre is a Doctor of Chiropractic, gaining a First from Oxford
Brookes University and a Masters in aromatherapy from the Strand
Polytechnic.
He’s most famous for his column in The Grauniad, which can only be
described as a users guide to alternative therapies.
He will be giving a talk on “Bad Science”, which, by strange
coincidence, is also the name of his book which is currently in the
Amazon top 20 bestsellers list and #1 in the popular science list.*
I’m sure Ben will be happy to sign your copies of his book if you
bring one along to SitP next Monday after the talk - or until his hand
drops off
If you can’t make it down on Monday, Ben will be speaking again at
Foyles bookshop on Charing Cross road on Wednesday 17th.
* Some, or all of this biography may be inaccurate or fabricated.
In an age where so-called science is said to be the answer to
everything from weight loss to personal happiness and unlimited
wealth, join us as Ben Goldacre explains just what science won’t do
for you - and why this science craze may not have all the answers.
Monday 15 September @ 7pm
The Penderel’s Oak (The Cellar Bar)
283-288 High Holborn
London
WC1V 7HP
It will be packed so don’t be late and expect to see anything other
than maybe the top of his head.

Hi Ben,

Are you doing a book tour at all. Visiting Glasgow for any talks?

I’ll fund a stab vest for you lol

Loving the book so far. Just onto the homoeopathy chapter.

Regards

Steven

Hi Again,

Perhaps you can give me some advice. I recently got a smoothie making
device and I am now addicted too it. I make smoothies all the time and
drink like 1-2 pints of fruit a day(with some added milk or low fat
yoghurt). What I would like too know is this, am I losing any
nutritional content by smoothie-ing(not a word surely) the fruit?

Thanks

Regards

Steven

Will you be turning up on time for these then Ben or making a grand

there was a piece in then guardian on smoothies nutritional content a
few months ago - i’m sure a search will turn it up.

HowardW said,

September 15, 2008 at 1:15 pm

When nutritional content of a food is being analysed, I think it is
standard practice for the food to be blitzed into a pulp as the first
step. Given this fact, I think it’s safe to say that the nutritional
content of the whole fruit will be the same as the nutritional content
of the fruit-as-smoothie.

But, there are some related questions which are not as easy to answer:

If I eat the fruit as fruit, do I absorb the same things as when I eat
the fruit as a smoothie? Are the same things absorbed more
quickly/slowly? Do I absorb more of some things if they are eaten as
fruit vs. smoothie?

Don’t know the answers to these questions, but I expect there are some
differences here - possibly not enough to worry about though.

Howard is right scottish nat. When testing foods in most situations
you use a piece of equipment called a stomacher which is basically a
blender/masher/pulping device.
I doubt you lose any real nutritonal value as that is why nature
furnished us with things called teeth and a tongue

Picklish said,

getting off the topic here, but following on from sean.salvador scot
nat, howardw…..

does anyone know why i was told by my big (evil) pharma rep that
patients(for insomnia)at the lab where i work are unable to crush
their new insomnia pills before ingesting them, as, according to the
G**x*S**th**ine harridan, this would invalidate the study on the new
drug. Would it?

Soz Benjamin, i cannae afford to buy you London pints. You should
return to Scotland, Scottish Naturist and myself will put you up, im
sure.

For those of you who can get to see Ben speek I highly recommend it. I
saw him at the Big Chill and it was like Marcus Brigstock only with
far more amusing science and backround statistics. (And no gitwizard
of course).

While the rest of the Big Chill was burning people in wicker men (or
whateve they were doing on a Sunday night) Ben was talking to us about
double blind testing and the vitamin supplements biz. Faaaan tastic.
Go see him its great.

Hi All,

Thanks for the feedback. I didn’t think of

“When nutritional content of a food is being analysed, I think it is
standard practice for the food to be blitzed into a pulp as the first
step.”

and

“When testing foods in most situations you use a piece of equipment
called a stomacher which is basically a blender/masher/pulping
device.”

Ironically enough I am a currently in my honours year of a
microbiology degree and I have used a stomacher machine a few times.

My friend said the main thing I should worry about is the high amount
of fructose I could be getting if I drink too many smoothies. However
it is a quick way to get some tasty fruit and it makes me eat a lot
more fruit than normal.

@Picklish. I don’t know if it would invalidate the study but the pill
is given to you in that form as a specific dose and it will have a
specific time of effect. I imagine if you crush the pill up the effect
may happen quicker because of the larger surface area.

**ATTENTION ALL POSTERS**

MY NAME NATURALIST MEANS THE SAME AS MATERIALIST. Just so you don’t
think I am a nut naturopath or something lol.

Loving Ben’s book by the way. About half way through. Informative and
funny.

Totally different topic, apologies. Half way through the book, and saw
the first classic example today. There’s no background to this story
whatsoever. I’m *so* glad to see it took a specialist ‘Medical
Correspondent’ to write this:

Yeh the issue with smoothies is their ‘natural fruit sugar’ load in
liquid form - but without the cell matrix and fruit structure that
helps to regulate digestion and speed of absorption.
whilst eating a large fruit salad may take all of 10-15 mins and a bit
of chewing and swallowing a pulped fruit,the equivalent fruit smoothie
can be consumed within a couple of minutes. this high fructose load
can cause diarrhoea (esp true in toddlers) and can cause
hyperfructosaemia - high blood fructose levels. this has the same
negative health benefits of a high blood glucose level but doesn’t
show up on any standard blood glucose meter - so the ‘Low GI’ nature
of fruit smoothies does not mean anything - GI is irrelevant when the
main sugar content is fructose.
the large fructose load is also metabolised differently to glucose and
generates uric acid - if you have a tendency to gout then this
drinking more than 2 glasses of juice/smoothies a day is associated
with a higher risk of gout attacks as your uric acid levels peak with
fructose loads.
bear in mind also that fructose has the same calorie content as
glucose - 4kcal/g - so these are not low calorie drink options.
Your fresh smoothies are slightly better for you than the pasteurised/
UHT smoothies - they retain more of the plant chemicals in the form
that you would have had if you’d just chewed the fruit and swallowed!
enjoy!
(and why not add some veggies in there - carrot adds in very easily
and is a lower sugar, lower calorie inclusion)

Damn, damn, damn. There are no more places left for the Foyles event.
When is the next one? I want to buy two more copies to give away and
have them - and the copy I already have - signed.

Ben Goldacre said,

v kind, there’ll be more but i can’t organise things (constitutionally
incapable) and i only really like doing free events, if anyone ever
wants to organise a big room in a pub in london (or nearby) and a
microphone i’ll happily speak into it.

I can’t make 9.30 in Swiss Cottage, so I’ll just have to buy the extra
copies and forge the signatures.

Apparently homeopaths, nutritionists and magnet therapists have been
infiltrating Ben’s talks. You can spot them by buying my Crystal Crank
Detector (CCD). Its quite simple; you wear it somewhere conspicuous
(around your neck) and if anyone looks impressed then they’ve been
detected. Only £799.99 or slightly cheaper here:

Accordiing to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomacher
that is a sort of feminine equivalent of the tuxedo shirt front.

If you’re sure of your version then they want sorting out, maybe. A
stub article at least. Or they probably have the thing with a
different name.

Presumably you can just print out the Crystal Crank Detector on a
colour printer onto photo paper or card and it’ll work. Let’s see one
with an eye tracking camera though.

Enjoyed the Foyles event and have read the book with great pleasure -
well, you know, some pleasure, some rage and disbelief, but great
avidity.
Just thought I’d answer your query in the book as to how long it takes
to find someone who knows the difference between mean, median and
mode: no time, really, as it was the other person in the room at the
time. (I knew too, of course, but then I’m the kind of person that
visits this website.) The third person in the house knew that one was
‘when you add all the numbers up and divide’, but couldn’t remember
whether that was the mean or the median, and that another was ‘the
number that occurs most frequently’, but wasn’t sure which that was,
and couldn’t remember the third way.
He, incidentally, is the only one of us with a BSc (an electrical
engineer); I’m as humanities-graduate as you get (Classics); the other
one in the know read Law, but has since done a Masters in Research
including a quantitative analysis paper.
