Ohh look I’m on the One Show on BBC One

September 9th, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in book, onanism, bad science |

Slightly tiggerish and lacking in gravitas but that’s roughly what
you’d expect from a 12 year old delivering a 100,000 word thesis on
mainstream television in 3 minutes.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00dcy6n/

It starts 8 minutes in. As you can see the presenters really engaged
with the film, they loved the book, and it triggered a
thought-provoking discussion of the issues raised.

Also of note: for one day only, and brilliantly captured on film, my
curls seem to be spontaneously producing both a quiff and a side
parting. Well hello ladies.

Picture nicked from here.

Good slot, no doubt immediately forgotten by the vast majority
audience.

You should have asked for your money back though, they didn’t really
push your book. They didn’t mention the name or show the cover, just
waved it about a bit and mentioned “his book”.

Then again maybe they did, I had to turn it off to avoid hearing some
bloke dispensing “common sense” about anything in moderation.

Good slot though. I can see you getting a lot of TV work. You’re
engaging and down-to-earth seeming but with just enough
crazy-scientist (credit to the hair) to be believable.

Absolutely mindblowing that you can air your thoughts on some of your
usual bugbears on prime time TV. Shame it was only 3-4 minutes; as
said elsewhere it starts about 8 mins into the show. Surely a series
to follow? Heaven knows you’ve got enough material to call on….

Regarding image, you came across great - tons of energy. I wouldn’t
worry about the hair - it’s compulsory for TV scientists to have a
weird hairstyle! But that size 0 figure doesn’t fill enough of the
screen - eat more. And the voice pitch could be lowered a tad - try
taking up smoking. In other words, get a bit more unhealthy!

I was mostly distracted by your very lively eyebrows…

Good coup though, The One Show is watched by people like my mum who
once bought fish oil capsules for my 5 year old neice.

Fantastic. Though i can’t believe you said that ‘distraught parents
were pitted against foggy scientists in corduroy’ whilst wearing a
tank top and trousers that looked suspiciously (on my low-res screen)
like corduroy. Most scientists (that i know) spend very antisocial
hours in labs doing complicated manipulations with very small things
so are oblivious to fashion /popular culture, though they aren’t old
or foggy.
You’ve boldly stuck your nose where the public sticks theirs (popular
press) -Congratulations!

There is nothing in the wide world web that gets me more annoyed than
finding that clips and programs posted on the net are restricted to
those residing within the country. WHY!!??!!

Please use your immense clout and influence with the BBC to make them
revise this stupid insular and reprehensible position Ben.

Good job, and great coverage in exactly the place it’s needed.

You came across superbly well, but perhaps ease off a little on the
eyebrows…

1.

Getonyerbike said,

September 9, 2008 at 2:50 pm

4 copies of your book arrived a few minutes ago. The plan was to give
them away as presents, but i might loan them to patients instead. I
think your entrance into the popular media is an auspicious event in
these superstitious times, and will do wonders for raising public
consciousness. Your message; “I want to help YOU not to get conned by
THEM” is a winner.

Excellent congrats Ben. That was very animated; Did you get coaching
on lively facial expressions and larger than life hand gestures?

Maybe you could be The Thinking Woman’s Crumpet, I’m not qualified to

Thinking Man’s Crumpet, Dr Alice Roberts.

Aargh, tell your eyebrows to chill out.

Toenex said,

Do you operate your own eyebrows or was there someone off camera,
remotely controlling them? I just couldn’t get Animal from the muppets
out of my mind whilst I watched you.

Nice, upbeat presentation. Interesting that when your report about how
to evaluate science in the media ended, they cut back to Len Goodman
who quickly give his beliefs on the secret to a long life. What is a
guy to do?

1.

Getonyerbike said,

September 9, 2008 at 5:27 pm

WOoo hoo!!!
I just lent the first (of 4) copy of your book (338 pages) to a
patient who gave me an article about Dr Barry Durrant-Peatfield (3
pages) She thought it was only fair that i should get my own back
(share reading material), so i gave a copy of How to Read a Paper by
Trisha Greenhalgh as well,
Thanks Ben!

Informative but brief, but a good start nonetheless. I’m expecting the
quackery to respond with a pots and kettles laden diatribe as your
book did get a plug (albeit a vague one). Where is the money going
from sales of your tome? This could be viewed as profiteering from the
same sphere of ignorance the snake oil sellers leech off.

Mags- Trellick Tower could be an excellent work of art if left empty
and abandoned as a stark warning of what could happen to our buildings
if aesthetics are ignored and design was left to committees. Or was
that Goldfingers intention?

mrmuz said,

September 10, 2008 at 2:23 pm

Relax you lot. Seasoned boxers swing, soldiers duck. Mr Goldacre’s
feeling of wide eyed disbelief is so worn it’s on a hair trigger.
That’s all it is.

Good segment. Every time I hear about that MMR business on this blog I
wonder when the questions in the house are coming. My sister was
nannying in the UK right in the middle of the measles outbreak and she
recounts it with horror fairly regularly. It’s so startling I always
think something must come of it all, though I’m not entirely sure
what.

ScottishNaturalist said,

September 11, 2008 at 3:40 am

After your 3-4 minute clip the show went like this.

“He has a good point”

“Don’t drink 5 bottles of red wine.”

“Now lets talk about a stupid ugly eye sore of a building”

You did well in the time allotted to get the message out Ben. I know
it is hard. Well done.

1.

Pro-reason said,

Thanks, I ripped the YouTube video and put it on my iRiver media
player.

Did anyone else get queasy with all the zooming in and out of the
camera (not to mention the eyebrows on E)?

1.

peterd102 said,

September 11, 2008 at 5:55 pm

I did! It was worse the camera for some cookery shows. I just got the
Book to and the hype is, in immense irony, actually true.

Sadly SPORE came same time so i might not have a lot of time to read
it!

DTM said,

September 12, 2008 at 8:13 pm

Is the cameraman drunk or suffering from a degenerative muscular
disease?

I though the first 30 seconds was good but then the motion sickness
kicked in and I couldn’t concentrate.

Congratulations!

SubMoron said,

September 13, 2008 at 1:24 pm

Great stuff… but please be careful Ben; they’ll market you as the
successor to Magnus Pyke.

Yes, the book’s lovely I’ll be giving away copies too… and I work for
BigPharma so money from them is going (indirectly) to further your
book. How long do we wait for the 2nd Edn. with Rath back in please?

1.

Robert Carnegie said,

September 13, 2008 at 3:04 pm

The new book will be Bad Science II: The Canning of Rath. Perhaps.

(If that’s too American, well, that’s where the money is. And the
people who give the money to chancers.)

1.

Delster said,

September 14, 2008 at 1:32 am

SubMoron… at least old Magnus got a lot of air time and got a lot of
stuff out to a lot of people. Maybe you should aim for that Ben…. go
wiggle the eyebrows at the BBC and see if you can get a series out of
them

1.

Robert Carnegie said,

September 14, 2008 at 2:53 am

Now I’m stuck on the [Have I Got News For You] episode, I think it’s
been repeated on digital channel Dave and is presented by Ronni
Ancona, where in discussing some church or political controversy she
says “The Archbishop of Canterbury has raised eyebrows” and then shows
a picture of him…

1.

SubMoron said,

September 14, 2008 at 1:49 pm

Deister… True enough maybe Ben should try something to make his
eyebrows grow; maybe TAPL could recommend a product. My favourite
Magnus Moment though was a letter to a paper responding to an article
about “declining death rates” pointing out that they’d never shift
from 100% in the long run.

Now going to e-mail my local bookshop to order more copies of the
book.

Alfster said,

September 14, 2008 at 2:18 pm

For ‘The One Show’ a good piece of proper science ruined of course by
pathetic camera work.

Luckily, I wathced the Youtube version on this page and so was able to
just listen to it rather than watch it.

Ben, a question: Did you have any say in the camera work or did the
director and cameraman tell you what the camera work was going to be
like?

Does anyone ever refuse to have their pieces to camera filmed in that
way and suggest a nice simple old-fashioned watchable steady shot?

1.

Ben Goldacre said,

September 14, 2008 at 2:22 pm

haha i had no idea what he was doing for the most part. i have to say
the person i made that film with was the least cock-like of almost
anyone i’ve ever met in telly and i think we might be able to do
something again, ideally with more actual nerdy science in it.

1.

Alfster said,

September 14, 2008 at 3:45 pm

Really!

It always struck me as though one would notice the camera being swung
round from some non-descript bit of the room to face you and then you
start talking which would take some co-ordination.

I am sure many of the people are not cock-like at all, they just seem
to enjoy making the camera-work overshadow the subject and turn people
off.

We want more Morse style camera work! Though that might mean Colin
Dexter being in every programme which might tire the old fella out.

If ‘your’ director can stop titting about the camera he certainly
would be an asset to more geeky science on TV along with yourself!

1.

thatgingerscouser said,

September 14, 2008 at 5:11 pm

Alfster, as a camera op myself I fear you’re being a big meanie.

Most people instantly think of science as something boring and nerdy.
So if your curly-bonced doc decides it’s a good day to wear a tanktop,
I think it’s only fair that the cameraman slap on a pair of skating
wellies and spin us around WHSmith like a dancing teacup for five
minutes.

Talking of WHSmith, I just went to the one in Liverpool city centre to
try and buy a copy of Bad Science (seeing as our one and only bookshop
was Sunday closed)…

ME: Excuse me, do you have a copy of ‘Bad Science’ by Ben Goldacre?

WHS: Yerwha?

ME: ‘Bad Science’ by Doctor Ben Goldacre…?

WHS: Is that about football?

ME: …

one of my patients told me he was a TV producer this morning and i was
going to offer him a copy of your book from my lending library, but
having got down to my last copy, and he being so enthusiastic and
having a vested interest (he’s volunteered for a trial to test
antivirals for RSV) he seemed very happy to go and purchase a copy
himself!
I have a hunch that working in Shorditch might enable me to infiltrate
the media…

“i have to say the person i made that film with was the least
cock-like of almost anyone i’ve ever met in telly” - that obviously
excludes the cameraman … the cock of the local farm hens moves its
head backwards & forwards violently as it walks - as do all hens
actually.

hm102 said,

September 20, 2008 at 1:19 pm

I am the director / cameraman who made the film with Ben and I can
confirm that I am not cock-like and that I also enjoy shooting fast,
punchy, interesting television in a style that makes it a great deal
more interesting to watch than the dreary “Open University Wierd-Beard
standing at a black board” that some of you seem to be so nostalgic
for.

Wheee! At last! Not only can I post comments, but this TV slot is what
I have been PRAYING FOR on telly. Looks like even journalists are
getting sick of their own writing … or perhaps its years of thinking
“Hmmm this isnt right.. someone should say something…”. Please please
please do one of these on SSRI’s and psychiatry as a whole please
please please
