My Placebo programme on BBC Radio 4

August 18th, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in onanism, placebo, bad science |

I’ve been so busy I completely failed to spot that this show went out
earlier this evening. It’s a smashing programme I made with Matt
Silver from the BBC Radio 4 Science Unit on the placebo effect.

We charge through some of the most fun experiments in the field, and
in part two we get all philosophical about what it means for mankind.
Here’s the blurb from the BBC:

Placebo

Our beliefs and expectations about treatments can have a dramatic
effect on our health – the so-called ‘placebo effect’. Doctor and
writer Ben Goldacre presents a two part series.

Programme 1: The Placebo Effect
When a new drug or treatment is dismissed as being ‘no better than
placebo’, we all get the message: any benefits are probably ‘all in
the mind’, it’s ineffective, not worth pursuing. Yet studies suggest
that the placebo effect can have a significant impact on the course of
a wide range of illnesses, including depression, irritable bowel
syndrome and angina. It seems that it’s the meaning of a particular
treatment to the patient that’s crucial. For example, research shows
that the colour of an inert sugar-pill and even the branding on the
box, can alter a pill’s effect. In this first programme, Ben Goldacre
looks at the growing body of research into the placebo effect, and
explores the factors influencing the strength of the placebo response.

Listen again to programme 1

Oh, and, er, here’s a nice mp3 for those of you who don’t like the
BBC’s ludicrous inflexible proprietary commercial audio streaming
formats:

Placebo BBC Radio 4 Ben Goldacre.mp3

Programme 2: The Implications for Medicine
Studies using placebo or ‘sham’ treatments show that what a doctor
says to a patient, along with the ritual of the therapeutic encounter
itself, can have a real impact on health outcomes. This raises
important ethical issues for those who work in medicine. A doctor’s
first commitment is to the wellbeing and health of the patient. Given
the undeniable benefits of placebos in the management of many
hard-to-treat conditions, can it ever be right to prescribe a placebo
without informing the patient? Could complementary therapies, many of
whose specific effects are unproven, represent the acceptable face of
placebo prescription? Has modern, scientific medicine, with its
emphasis on ‘magic bullets’ targeting specific diseases, lost sight of
the importance of the ‘art’ of medicine?

Listen again available after Prog 2 Monday 25th August

I’m an enormous fan of BBC Radio 4 science, and I’ve spent a fair
amount of time thinking about why they’re so great. As well as
resisting the drive to dumb down, there’s also one very important
structural factor: around 70-80% of a radio science documentary - by
necessity, for auditory colour - is made up of words spoken by the
people who have done the science themselves.

This is the kind of unmediated communication which is also so great in
blogs by academics, because it is academic scientists explaining
things in their own words, and even better, with the help of media
people. This is exactly what the print world needs more of: fewer
writers, and more editors, helping people who actually know about
stuff to express it in a structured fashion for an intelligent
audience lacking background knowledge.

Anyway, enough of that nonsense. The programmes’ page is here:

Brilliant. Really interesting stuff from Irving Kirsch and Daniel
Moerman on placebo response in terms of pain and depression, which I
might have expected, but the stuff about Perkins’ metallic tractors
and Haygarth was completely new to me. Fun looking Perkins up on the
internets though. jpg here of said tractors in action.

Instead of lying to patients and tellling them, “Prozac will make you
feel better”, doctors should say, more honestly, “If you take this
prozac you will feel better”. The empathy inherent in the
doctor-patient interaction, the sybolic gift (prescription), the hope
(there is something that can be done to treat your depression and
what’s more i’ll see you in a week to make sure) and the ritual
(taking the Prozac) all contribute to making the patient feel better.

Most docs know this anyway. The program didn’t make the point that we
(docs) do this all the time. It suggested that white coats and
pinstripe suits help. And big scanning machines with lights on help
to. But so does an awful lot else in (even an average) consultation

Clearly the word “Placebo” is woefully inadequate to describe the
variety of processes at work.

Would homeopathy be as effective if the practitioners said, “as a
result of the acts of empathy, ritual and symbolism, with a dash of
hope and good branding (thank you HRH Prince Charles) you will get
better. The tablets are an essential part of the process, but they are
completely inert” This reminds me of our recently departed agnostic
rector.

I suspect that it would still be effective, though less effective than
if they believe homeopathic pills really were active.

But we don’t live in a rational post-enlightenment age as the
increasing popularity of New-Agism, evangelical religion and
advertising demonstrate.

If people need delusions/ faith/ belief then to deprive them is not to
liberate them but to enforce an unnatural rationality upon them, so we
need to learn a lot more about healing than how to become
evidence-based prescribers. We should be evidence-based practitioners
by searching for evidence that takes seriously peoples beliefs. The
challenge is to do this without deceit, economic exploitation, or
dependency. Tough but interesting.

“If people need delusions/ faith/ belief then to deprive them is not
to liberate them but to enforce an unnatural rationality upon them”
Interesting point. My default position would be that people do not
need delusions / whatever and that a false belief would probably be an
unnecessary crutch, but I don’t really know what the effects of
‘depriving’ people of such a belief would actually be. Possibly the
wrong place to start this discussion, but I think it would be an
interesting one to have.

It doesn’t do the doctor-patient relationship much good to tell people
“If you take this prozac you will feel better” and have them come
back, not better.

i suspect that the rise of New-Ageism, evangelicalism and
‘irrationality’ is in part a back-lash against post-enlightenment
rationality and I doubt that the ranting of Dawkins and other popular
atheists depletes pews. The exploitation of vulnerable (anxious)
people by people pedalling expensive snake oil has a long history with
its roots firmly in my own profession (medicine) and I (and other
docs) should be humbled by this. The foundation of the NHS was an
opportunity to get out of this unpleasant exploitative side of
medicine by removing the need to profit from out patients but we GPs,
with a shady culture of shopkeeper medicine resisted it. The present
attempt to introduce market forces is probably not being sufficiently
resisted because so few really recognise this. To profit from peoples
anxiety by pedalling false hope is immoral. To suggest that someone
needs crystal therapy when they need to lose weight or increase their
insulin is immoral, but its a different matter to recognise and try to
understand what happens in a therapeutic relationship and use that to
the patient’s advantage.

Unfortunately i Can’t listen to the show at work

One remark: in the discussion the terms placebo effect and placebo
response are usen interchangeble but they aren’t. Placebo responses in
RCT’s (% of patients responding in the placebo treated group) can be
caused by more than true placebo effect. BTW, also in a lot of
epidemiolgy textbooks this distinction is not outlined clearly.

I understand that placebo responses can be caused by…

1/ Expectation bias in the patient: “true” placebo effect, patient
expect to get better and get better

…but also through…

2/ Expectation bias in the observer:
When a phycisian deliberately prescribes placebo, there should be no
expectation as to its mechanism of action, unless the placebo itself
is expected to work (There is an interesting selffullfilling
prophecy..;). For all kinds of allopaths/ CAM proponents it can be
argued that they are as misled as their “patients”, hence expectation
bias of the observer could well play a role here.
Interestingly, in an RCT the message given with placebo treatment is
“this might be a real drug or it can be placebo” while placebo is used
in clinical practice (antibiotics for sinusitis anyone..?Br J Gen
Pract. 1997 Dec;47(425):794-9) with the remarks “this will make you
better”. Expectation bias is potentially much larger in the latter
case.
All kinds of design flaws can increase expectation bias, like
inadequate blinding for example. In RA we have a drug anakinra that
has a side effect of big hematomes at the injection sites in 70% of
patients. There goes your blinding…(Ann Rheum Dis. 2006
Jun;65(6):760-2)

3/ Concomittant treatment:
I’ve been investigator in several RCT’s in rheumatology in which
placebo patients were at greater risk to be treated with steroid in
the placebo controlled phase due to the fact that disease activity
remained high. These so-called protocol violations have to be
extensively documented according to GCP guidelines, but are seldomly
reported in the final report (e.g. J Rheumatol. 2002
Nov;29(11):2288-98).

but the most overlooked is..
4/ Regression to the mean:
a combination of inclusion criteria that require a certain amount of
disease activity (e.g. joint counts in active RA or systolic tension)
and natural fluctuations of this value results in regression of the
values after inclusion to the mean lower values).

In RA RCT it seems to be that placebo responses are increasing. We are
currently studying this phenomenom. It makes sense, though.
Researchers try to enroll as much patients as possible in a RCT
(money, authorships) and patients want to be in the trial, so disease
activity is overestimated to qualify fo inclusion. After that disease
activity drops drmatically in both placebo and treatment groups (e.g.
N Engl J Med. 2000 Nov 30;343(22):1586-93). Patienst are pleased too,
because in case of response they get to stay on the drug. Finally,
high response percentages are good marketing “our drug has a response
rate of 70%” is better than “our dug has 50% response” although there
may be no difference if placeboresponse was 25% in the former and 5%
in the latter. Mentioning attributive risk (treatment response minus
placebo response percentages) corrects this but is not commonly
reported. Gee….I wonder why.?

Keep up the good work.

The Brand name vs generic aspirin and placebo study that’s described
at about 16 minutes is partiicularly interesting.
Does anyone know what the study is or if the brand-name placebo was
better than the generic aspirin?

Jamie Horder said,

August 20, 2008 at 12:49 pm

Den: Placebo responses are increased in trials of antidepressants too,
probably for similar reasons. There’s quite a literature on it - you
should read it if you haven’t.

To your 4 points I would add:

5. Experimenter demand effects. These are well known in psychology and
are the reason why taking part in psychology experiments is often a
rather baffling experience. Researchers go to lengths to avoid letting
their volunteers know what the hypothesis is because people generally
aim to please and will act as they think they “ought” to act. Which is
a real pain.

So in a clinical trial, if a patient thinks that the doctors expect
them to get better, then they may decide to report feeling better,
even if they in fact don’t. This is not a “placebo effect” since the
patient doesn’t actually feel any improvement - however, if you’re
using any kind of subjective outcome measure (e.g. pain, depression,
fatigue) there’s no way to tell the difference.

I’ve often wondered how much of the recorded “placebo effect” is of
this nature. I’m not sure how you would go about finding out.

Getonyerbike said,

Trying to eliminate these factors is useful for research, -i need to
know whether a prescription or procedure will confer any additional
benefit or harm above and beyond my theatrics, but in clinical
practice I’d want to exploit (integrate) these psychological effects
as much as possible.

Many docs try to integrate neurolinguistic programming or solution
focused counselling in their consultations; a long relationship with
their patients confers essential trust.

Perhaps I should make mock advertisments for generic drugs with
patient endorsements (MY PAIN CURED WITH GENERIC ASPIRIN! ASK YOUR
DOCTOR FOR GENERIC DRUGS TODAY!)or (TRUE STORY! SORE THROAT RESOLVES
WITH A TINCTURE OF TIME!) and insert them in the magazines in the
waiting room?

I’ve often thought that different costumes for different patients
would be therapeutic, a djelaba and incense for people wanting reiki
and pinstripes and certificates if they want a second opinion.

While Nature Cures the Disease”

RS said,

Jamie - I’ve often thought that patients trying to please the
experimenter, or even just feeling a social pressure, are likely to
inflate placebo effects.

I too was wondering how you’d examine it - I presume that getting
patients to rate comparator pains (experimentally induced pains - with
all the limitations that entails) would be more objective, but not
comprehensively so.

1.

Jamie Horder said,

August 20, 2008 at 11:46 pm

It’s a tricky one. The problem is inherent in the whole research
scenario really - if people know they are being studied they act
differently. I suspect that the only way to eliminate such effects
would be to make it look like you’re not doing research at all. So
rather than relying upon reports of improvement you could see if real
aspirin actually sells better than placebo “aspirin” (in a different
kind of packet) over a long period of time in a fixed group of people
who have the chance to try both and learn which they prefer. You could
even do something clever with varying the prices, to see how much
people are willing to pay for placebo vs. aspirin, and use that to
quantify the effects. Good luck getting that past an ethics committee
though…

I have to add my name to the chorus of congratulations for the
programme Ben - it was amusing and informative, and, thanks to your
lack of warning, an unexpected pleasure while I was doing the
washing-up.

I also agree with your comments above about radio4 - they seem to have
become the home of well-made science programmes, and also generally
cover science-based news items much better than anyone else, so
perhaps it seems wrong to complain, but for me, that only seems to
reinforce how ’specialist interest’, and ghettoised science features
have become.

It seems increasingly rare to even get a science documentary on the
main TV channels now, and when you do get one, they seem so petrified
of boring or perplexing their viewers that they throw every cheap
trick in the book at one. Journalists going on ‘voyages of discovery’,
atmospheric music and shots of test-tubes, constant reiterations of
what has come before; anything, it seems, rather than letting the
science, and the scientists, speak for themselves.

Surely the success of TED.com has shown that there are plenty of
people who are engaged by new ideas, who actually want to be told
about sciency stuff? Take back TV for the geeks, I say!

Well presented programme covering the fascinating ground on placebos
discussed by Ben Goldacre previously on this site.

What was the name of the branded painkiller used in the painkiller
trials? I want to write it on my generic aspirin bottle if it’s that
effective!

I’d be interested to know the effect on trial outcomes of subjects
believing that there is a significant chance of them receiving
placebos? I presume that the placebo effect is non-existant if the
subject knows that they have a 100% certainty of receiving a placebo.
But what if they are told there is, say, a 50% chance, or 25% chance,
of receiving a placebo. Does this ‘doubt’ significantly reduce the
effect?

A nit-picking continuation of studies in this fascinating area
perhaps….

gazza - as someone who is not fond of advertising and marketing, I
find it hard to type the name of the product. It is mentioned in one
or two previous blog posts though, like this one:
http://www.badscience.net/?p=186

If you want to know about trials where subjects know they are
receiving a sugar pill, Lee Crandall Park might not be a bad palce to
start: http://www.leecrandallparkmd.net/pdfs/placebo.pdf

haha yeah they’re great, and almost all of these are presented by my

used to be jdc - thanks for the feedback.

I’ve now got a newly branded pill bottle bought originally at discount
aspirin prices - I’m looking forward to the improved potency!

That paper you flagged up for me describing a small sample of subjects
who knowingly received placebos just shows what a complex mind game
can be set up between the receivers and the administrators of a pill
popping environment!

So a few of them had improved apparently because they persuaded
themselves there really was an active ingredient present; others
improved for a range of reasons despite believing the pills were
placebo but I would hazard a guess it was to do with the ‘ceremony’ of
the interaction between testers and subjects referred to in Ben’s
radio programme. Fascinating.

I have vague memories of a paper that tried to get round the ethical
problems with deceiving people associated with giving a placebo by
first giving the active drug, and telling them that at some stage they
would be switched to placebo, but not telling them when. The upshot
was that the placebo worked despite people knowing that they were
taking one. Does that one ring any bells with anyone?

Excellent! I shall wait impatiently for both. Will you be doing a tour
and signings? Richard and Judy book club, I say…

Yes Ben’s book. I shall be buying it.
Even though it isn’t published yet here is what the inestimable
comedian “Dr” Roger Coghill says about it:

0 of 5 people found the following review helpful:
1.0 out of 5 stars Ben Goldacre’s literary style, July 1, 2008
By Roger Coghill - See all my reviews
(REAL NAME)
Goldacre is a hack journalist who couldn’t make it as a doctor,
writing for the Guardian (a minor circulation UK newspaper) where he
weekly spews out attacks on alternative medicine and lampoons in a
very biased way anything that can make him a living, usually leaving
out the most salient facts for the sake of a good slagging story.
Funny he never attacks the many disasters perpetrated by mainstream
big pharma. His book isn’t worth the paper that Harper Collins (who
are also past publishers of my books) have foolishly printed it on. I
wouldn’t bother to open its covers, frankly, even if someone gave me a
copy for free. Pity that Amazon don’t have a negative star award
system.

Hasn’t read it and apparently knows all about it. Idiot!

Presumably it’s as evidence based an analysis as he is used to doing -
know the results you want (ie crap book) and marshall the facts
accordingly (my opinion of Ben Goldacre is sufficient to tell me it’ll
be a crap book).

If he has friends that know how sulky and bitter that review appears
to people I hope they tell him - I’d hate to think he really was like
that….

Why does Amazon already show such a heavy discount on the RRP of the
book? It’s half price and not even printed yet! I hope that doesn’t
affect the author’s share of the takings.

“Funny he never attacks the many disasters perpetrated by mainstream

Bad English writing skills aside, this goes to show he has never even
looked at Ben’s blog.

That’s because to do so would involve exposing him to dangerous
electromagnetic fields from his computer. He could be driven to
suicide in minutes.

Does anyone know if there is an easy way to record these programmes?
(without hooking up a stereo to my computer).

@Ben - “…it’s all in the book, ooh which is out in about a week now.”
Like trickcyclist, I shall be waiting impatiently.

@gazza - “Presumably it’s as evidence based an analysis as he is used
to doing - know the results you want and marshall the facts

Haha - spot on.

@Marten - “Bad English writing skills aside, this goes to show he has
never even looked at Ben’s blog.”
I’m glad someone made that comment. Another one that’s spot on. I
wouldn’t have dared criticise his Bad English though - particularly
given my claim that “Lee Crandall Park might not be a bad palce to
start” looking into unblinded placebo provision.

Nick 127 - I was about to try holding my stereo up to the computer
when I noticed that Ben has included a link to an mp3 version, which I
dutifully downloaded this afternoon. Much easier! It is right in the
middle of his article above….

I suppose if you take two or four pills a day then you’re drinking two
or four glasses of water, which could affect the stomach… what about a
test group that takes the water without the pill? Are they covered
already by the other 8 glasses a day = no particular clinical benefit,
experiments?

In the first twenty minutes, the mathematical significance of test
result statistics seems to be taken as read, i.e. that all the
experiments produced clear meaningful results. To be honest, I’d be
quickly out of my depth if you did go into it.

nick_127:
there’s a nice little freeware program that enables you to create mp3
(and other files) from the computer audio output channel - audacity
http://audacity.sourceforge.net/

Pleeeease can someone put up the second placebo mp3 file as I cannot
get bbc streaming audio!!
