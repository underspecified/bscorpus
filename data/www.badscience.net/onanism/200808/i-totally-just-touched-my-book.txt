I totally just touched my book

August 29th, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in onanism |

Okay, this is all a bit indulgent, but it was a total mission, so I
will now cheerfully declare, to my childishly ecstatic delight, that
in a rather exciting moment a few minutes ago my book totally arrived
in my hand. I quite like it. Since there are those who doubted whether
I would ever finish the beast, and you’re all plainly bastards, here
is a clumsy picture of me holding it before I dash out to the Nature
Scienceblogger Conference drinks. It’s out on Monday.

As you can see from the picture, on the front cover Charlie Brooker
says “the most important book you’ll read this year, and quite
possibly the funniest too”, and Sir Iain Chalmers, a founder of the
Cochrane Collaboration, co-author of the best lay text on evidence,
and in many respects something of a hero of mine, says: “Bad Science
introduces the basic scientific principles to help everyone become a
more effective bullshit detector”. Basically a knight says bullshit on
the front of my book, and so I can die a happy man.

(The full and more precise quote from Chalmers was: “Ben Goldacre has
succeeded where the ‘public engagement in science’ organisations have
so signally failed. Bad Science introduces the basic scientific
principles – reducing the effects of biases and the play of chance -
to help everyone to become a more effective bullshit detector”.)

This is a book which I hope will be given in frustration as much as in
love, to flaky relatives and friends, and what’s more I look forward
to changing my mind about bits of it, and updating the next edition in
the light of comments from readers.

For an alternative view on the whole project you may prefer this
review on the amazon.com site from Roger Coghill, star of Bad Science
and all round self-satirising comedy genius. It is funnier if you’ve
read the book. Excitingly Coghill has a new product on the market, and
already seems to be quietly sidestepping my questions over email.

To the pub, and hurrah!

Tsk tsk tsk, young man. Does your mother know you do such things? You

Shame on HarperCollins, though. Or might Coghill be a clever Poe?

Here’s looking forward to some more interesting discussions…

So you are now in the same media stable as those bastions of sober
reporting namely The Sun and Fox News. (The book is published by
Fourth Estate, which is owned by Harper Collins, which is part of News
Corp, which is at the heart of the Rupert Murdoch empire).

Good to see you embracing capitalism, red in tooth and claw. Next,
sponsorship from big pharma!

Sounds like a great book!

I understand the desire to name the book after your column. However,
among the multitude of books and other things that already have the
title “Bad Science” is one of my favorite books on the subject, Gary
Taubes’ “Bad Science: The Short Life and Weird Times of Cold Fusion”.
I hope the duplicate title won’t cause confusion.

It’s not just that Roger’s review is deleted.

Amazon.com has removed the entire ‘customer review’ feature from the

Oh well. I guess Amazon can’t legally afford to let the graffiti and
spam comments build up on its site.

Amazon appear to have taken Coghill’s comment down, presumably on the
not unreasonable grounds that you can’t review a book if you haven’t
read it.

Oddly Amazon.com thinks that if you are interested in the book you
will also want to see:

loser to win!

Is it just me or have they misunderstood their audience?

If you think that’s a biased review, you should see what Roger Coqhill

Congratulations Ben.

I know that you are a very busy man, particularly this weekend. But,
you should make time to complain to Amazon about their removing Roger
Coghill’s comments. They are the outrageous rantings of a failed
magnet and light healer. But, Amazon by stifling free speech, is
threatening the side of rationality.

You might want to take up Roger Coghill’s challenge to expose some
unethical and anti-science workings of Big Pharma. In yesterday’s BMJ
( www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/aug29_2/a1487) there is a report
about NICE introducing a cost sharing scheme for ranibizumab
(Lucentis, marketed by Novartis) used to treat the wet form of
age-related macular degeneration. The report ends by saying that
“Another drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), which also works against
vascular endothelial growth factor, and which is licensed to treat
bowel cancer, has been used off label to treat AMD, but NICE was
unable to make recommendations on its use in AMD because its
manufacturer has not sought a license for this indication.”

The BMJ report does not speculate why Genentech (manufacturer of
Avastin) has not sought a licence. Googling “genentech novartis”
reveals that Genentech and Novartis have some interesting business
relationships, see, for example
http://www.ahrp.org/infomail/05/04/05.php

1.

Michael Power said,

August 30, 2008 at 9:54 am

I Just discovered that the Avastin website offers you a $15 voucher at
Amazon.com if you complete their questionnaire. (You have to accept
the offer quickly, otherwise it disappears for ever!)

It would be great if Genentech could subsidise the purchase of a few
copies of Bad Science!

Epoch Santiago said,

August 30, 2008 at 10:28 am

Excellent, I will definitely be buying the book and also keeping an
eye out on Amazon for hilariously one-eyed reviews.

It also appears that Roger’s book is lacking in reviews here:
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Healing-Energies-Magnets-Roger-Coghill/dp/1856752240/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=boo
ks&qid=1220088362&sr=8-3

Though hopefully that is because no-one has taken time out to read it…

The UK Amazon site does still have a simple star rating box and now
separately a ‘customer discussion’ forum on the book - I guess the
replacement for the old system that had star ratings and reviews
together.

I’m certainly looking forward to the bitter cranks bad-mouthing the
book in this area of Amazon. Could be almost as much fun as the book.

1.

doctormonkey said,

August 30, 2008 at 1:31 pm

Congratulations

Also congratulations on the nice little bit on the Breakfast sofa on
Friday morning - it is refreshing to see someone challenging the
“conventional” on its’ evidence base as well as the “unconventional”
(plus I like annoying GPs)

I will work out how to quickly get my hands on the book without all of
my family buying it for me too… well maybe we should just get several
copies each?

seventhrib said,

August 30, 2008 at 6:40 pm

I’d forgotten who Coghill was and mistakenly had identified him as one
of the science bloggers, and was totally convinced that his review was
a very well written parody, right down to the ‘pity amazon doesn’t
have a negative star system’ punchline at the end. I even thought
commenters deriding him were fools missing the joke. my bad.

1.

Dead Badger said,

August 30, 2008 at 7:15 pm

Congratulations; I’m currently sustaining myself in the later stages
of a PhD by going on binding services’ websites and envisaging how
beautiful my thesis will look (the cover, in my case, belying the
horrific tripe contained within), so I can guess how satisfying that
must’ve been.

I can empathise with the expression in the photo, too.

1.

Jo said,

August 30, 2008 at 10:37 pm

Straight after SciBlog I tried to buy it from Hatchards but they
pointed out I’ve a couple of days to wait still… Can’t believe I
nearly missed its imminent publication, particularly as I’ve basically
got badscience and the miniblog anastomosed to my bloglines account

I will be behind jdc on Monday - congratulations Ben!

Robert Carnegie said,

August 31, 2008 at 1:59 am

I think we’ve done Avastin, haven’t we? If Mr Coghill has got that
covered as well then Ben can look at other things, no point in
repeatiing the same job.

1.

Robert Carnegie said,

August 31, 2008 at 2:04 am

…Coghill’s never got a patent on a magnetic petrol-improver product,
has he? They’ve been on the market since steam cars went out. No
innovation there. Expect to see them in Poundland made in China.
Already Poundland sells car accessories that baffle me, one more won’t
hurt.

Here’s a thought though, “fridge magnets” for cars. Leave yourself a
note by the door lock, “You’ve left your handbag / briefcase on the
sunroof.” Extra strong to stay on at high speed. Now all that I need
to do is patent - whoops

1.

Mojo said,

August 31, 2008 at 10:54 am

I notice that the story only says that it “is being patented”, not
that it has a patent. How long does an application usually take? I see
from this post at JREF that Cogill has been advertising it since at
least 2004. Doesn’t prior publication make things a bit tricky ar far
as patents are concerned?

interesting question, how does that kind of thing work? i’d imagine

whoever, i wonder if maybe someone like RNIB would know more about how
to shift the balances and make things like that happen?

Mr Coghill (PhD not even failed), what was your “normal” or “average”
distance to a mast and how did you calculate it?

Sorry, sorry, force of habit. Will buy the book obviously but
seriously Ben what were you thinking when you strolled up to the
Grauniad blog and told them that Science News and reporting was wrong?
I like the style, I like the courage, but that went down like a cobra
in a lucky dip!

Maybe you could use Coghill’s review for the second edition?

Checked my order status (on Play.com), and it won’t be despatched
until 10th September! I pre-ordered back in March!

REFEREE!!!!

To be fair they have dropped the price… Selling yourself short there
again Ben?

And I so wanted to read it all first before I ordered a copy to my
lovely sister for her Birthday… after she raved to me at length about
the benefits of the Vacunaut weight loss system she was using (for
money that could have bought her a nice holiday!)

When I laughed at her, she dismissed my scepticicsm, with the really
sciencey stuff they put on their website…

Now as a scientist with a little limited knowledge of metabolism, fat
storage etc. I would be hard placed to disprove conclusively the
claims made (and the effects paid for) by this system in an instant.
Who knows - it might actually work (I seriously doubt it!). But as an
objective Scientist, I can say that nothing they have shown has
demonstrated that the system works with any statistical degree of
significance.
Lots of syllogistic leaps (My dog has legs, a cat has 4 legs, so my
dog is a cat etc.)

Are the proponents of the system (a) well intentioned misguided
zealots (b) crooks and sophists or (c) …er actually right i.e.
pioneers!
Well.. I don’t know & don’t care.
But I do know they will charge alot of money for it without
sufficient proof of beneficial outcome. And relatively Intelligent
people are taken in.

Scarily… My sister is a Secondary school teacher… charged with shaping
the minds of successive generations.

Why can’t we have “healthy scepticism” as a curriculum subject…?

Now that would be cool… teaching sarcasm to 14 year olds??? Money for
old rope… man …I have found my new vocation!

Anyhow - Could someone tell me while I’m waiting.. in the interests of
health and safety… how much does the book actually weigh, and are
there any sharp edges?

(I was wondering about the projectile behaviour.. I may need to
conduct a risk assessment at some point, since I suspect that sooner
or later the urge to smack someone in the forehead with a copy may
well become overwhelming!)

I’m totally expecting my copy to be at home when I get back from work.
Looking forward to reading it especially as I’ll be seeing my
credulous in-laws tomorrow.

yeah i was annoyd about that, communication breakdown. they told me i
would pay for the index to be made, 300 quid, i raised my eyebrows in
“arent you all skanky” surprise, but didnt say, like, “no” (although i
might have said “you skanky fuckers”). then it was all a bit rushed
getting it to the printers on time what with things like BULLYING
MORONS trying to sue me for daring to question their ideas (they may
regret this, as you and they may come to see in the next few days i
think) and i only noticed they’d not done one at the last minute, they
said they thought i didnt want one, that it didnt need one, and it was
too late. so soz about that. i did want one. annoying. maybe i should
make a “print out ‘n’ keep” one now on the web?

“A gross oversight in this day and age” - Amazon review by Z. Carey.
Meaning the index. “2 of 2 people found this review helpful” - so far.

Ah well - when does Google Books get it?

I’ve just stuck a review up on Amazon, but mine doesn’t begin to
approach the poetry of Mr Coqhill’s who is to be commended for his
fabulous piece of what ever it was.

Ben, audiobooks aren’t restricted to big blockbuster novels: just to
books that might have a market in that area. Get your agent onto the
job.

you’re forgiven (about the index) Same thing happened to my wife’s
book. I think its a first book thing.

You really don’t need to have a blockbuster, Ben, to get an audiobook
deal. My first novel, Scuba Dancing (pub.Transita) was a romantic
comedy and went into both audio and large print. Have just heard that
my latest book, Murder Most Welcome, a Victorian mystery, is to go
into audio and large print too. Both published by small independent
publishers and as for blockbusters… I wish!

I just totally touched up your book. Almost had an orgasm when I found
it on the door mat on return from my hols. Sod unpacking - I put my
feet up and devoured it voraciously - loved it, laughed out loud, read
bits out to my increasingly annoyed husband and generally had fun!
Intellectual ambrosia. Yum indeed! God I feel enthused and my BS
detector is now set at DefCon2. I am now looking forward to a new
semester at wooniversity for all the wrong reasons! As (ehmmmm) an
annoying scientist doing a second BSc in a CAM subject (sympathy
please - it is bloody hard to stay sane) I am going to recommend my
university (sic) library import a box of your book.
And that it is added to the essential reading list of all core
modules…well I can dream! Thank you Ben!
