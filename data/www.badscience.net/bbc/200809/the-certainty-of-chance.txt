The certainty of chance

September 6th, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in bbc, times, statistics |

Ben Goldacre
The Guardian,
Saturday September 6 2008

Britain’s happiest places have been mapped by scientists, according to
the BBC: Edinburgh is the most miserable place in the country, and
they were overbrimming with technical details on exactly how miserable
we are in each area of Britain. The story struck a chord, and was
lifted by journalists throughout the nation, as we cheerfully
castigated ourselves. “Misera-Poole?” asked the Dorset Echo. “No
smiles in Donny,” said Doncaster Today.

From the Bromley Times, through Bexley, Dartford and Gravesham, to the
Hampshire Chronicle, everyone was keen to analyse and explain their
ranking. “Basingstoke lacks any sense of community or heart,” said
Reverend Dr Derek Overfield, industrial chaplain for the area. And so
on.

Exactly what kind of data is the good reverend explaining there? The
Times had some methodological information. “Researchers at Sheffield
and Manchester universities based their findings on more than 5,000
responses from the annual British Household Panel Survey.” According
to the BBC it was presented in a lecture at some geographical society.
“However,” they said quietly, “the researchers stress that the
variations between different places in Britain are not statistically
significant.”

Here, nestled away, halfway through their gushing barrage of data and
facts, was an unmarked confession: this entire news story was based on
nothing more than random variation.

There are many reasons why you might see differences between different
areas in your survey data on how miserable people are, and people
being differently miserable is only one explanation. There might also
be, of course, the play of chance: 5,000 people in 274 areas doesn’t
give you many in each town - fewer than 20, in fact - so you might
just happen to have picked out more miserable people in Edinburgh, and
miss the fact that misery is, in fact, uniformly distributed
throughout the country.

This is called sampling error, and it quietly undermines almost every
piece of survey data ever covered in any newspaper. Although the
phenomenon has spawned a fiendish area of applied maths called
“statistics”, the basic principles are best understood with a simple
game.

Dr Deming was a charismatic management guru who railed against
performance-related pay on the grounds that it arbitrarily rewarded
luck.

Working in a theatrical field, he demonstrated his ideas with a simple
piece of stagecraft he called The Red Bead Experiment.

Deming would appear at management conferences with a big trough
containing thousands of beads which were mostly white, but 20% were
red.

Eight volunteers were then invited up on stage from the audience of
management drones: three to be managers, and five to be workers.

“Your job,” Deming explained solemnly, “is to make white beads.”

(Fast forward to 4m30s in the video below…)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeTaLRb-Bs

.

He then produced a paddle with 50 holes cut into it, which was passed
to the each worker in turn. They dipped the paddle into the trough,
wiggled it around, and tried to produce as many white beads as they
could manage, through this entirely random process.

“Go and show the inspectors,” he would say, sternly. “Only five red
beads, well done!”

“14 red beads? I think we need to re-evaluate your skill set.”

Workers were sacked, promoted, retrained and redeployed, to great
amusement.

We ignore basic principles like sampling error at our peril, because
the illusion of control, which we all carry around for the sake of
sanity, is more powerful than we think, and countless workers have had
their lives turned to misery for the simple crime of pulling out 15
red beads.

Back in the world of misery, were the journalists blameless, and
guilty only of ignorance? For any individual, nobody can tell.

But Dr Dimitris Ballas, the academic who did the research, had this to
say: “I tried to explain issues of significance to the journalists who
interviewed me. Most did not want to know.”

I suspect it wasn’t so much not wanting to know as not needing to
know. It had no relevance to the brief for the story.

The Beeb had a ‘Have your say’ attached to this article. I don’t
normally read these as they’re nearly all from the “It’s common sense
innit?” brigade. Sure enough it was full of people either agreeing
that the article was just reporting the obvious or people disagreeing
because, well, in their opinion their town was the happiest. I added
my bit, pointing out that the the article had said that the result was
not significant. The moderators thought it not worth publishing. When
I looked back a couple of days later ther was precisely one response
(not mine) pointing out that it was a non-story. Mustn’t get in the
way of a good story must we?

The difficulty that most people encounter with statistics is the
interpretation of the statistic not the mathematics. The calculation
of an average is fraught with potential confounds and belied by the
relative simplicity of the calculation. Gaining a representative
sample of anything is non-trivial and there are many texts written on
the various approaches you can take. My field of expertise is medical
imaging and, as with most scientific disciplines, experiments are
constructed in an attempt to suppress most variables and focus on the
ones of interest Still it proves difficult to accurately quantify the
volume of a tumor or the change in minimum joint space width in the
knee. How then to assess the relationship between arbitrary
geographical markers and something as weakly defined as ‘happiness’ in
a population of people? I would have hoped that most sane people
wouldn’t have needed to read any further than the basic aim of the
experiment to be dubious of any informative result.

Which over-enthusiastic press office put this out in the first place,
I wondered. I’ve had a look at the output from Manchester and
Sheffield universities. Not guilty. But there’s this from the Royal
Geographical Society:

http://www.rgs.org/PressRoom/Annual+Conference+2008/geographers+map+happiness.htm

It’s not till note to editors number 7 that the truth comes out.

I don’t think the BBC is entirely to blame. The Royal Geographical
Society spun the story, with only tiny footnotes saying it’s all
bollocks. No surprise that Ballas’ work is influential in that Cities
Unlimited report either?

Also, the authors research was published their stats in Arxiv, not a
journal.

I bougt and read ‘How to lie with statistics’ on Ben’s recommendations
(thanks Ben!) and its really useful to use when presented with these
kinds of story. You have to Dig a little deeper before relying on a
statistic.

That Deming guy is a menace. Getting rid of evaluations and promoting
co-operation! Why, there’d be nothing left for most managers to do.
Think of the unemployment!

You might be interested to know that last week the BBC News website
had in its ‘most read’ box a series of articles by a Michael Blastland
explaining the myths behind statistics, how to read them, etc -
similar in a sense to this column - part 5 with links to the other
parts here:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7592579.stm

Maybe the BBC journos should be reading the BBC’s own popular stories.

I also bought “How to Lie wih Statistics” - very good, but a slightly
misleading title. It hasn’t taught me how to lie with statistics at
all.

I think I agree with those businessmen over Deming.

I think that Deming is against penalising people for red beads simply
because it is unfair. However, from a business point of view, it
doesn’t matter that your rewards and punishments are sometimes
arbitrary. All that matters is that the workers understand that they
need to whatever they can do to achieve results.

Oderint dum metuant, as some shite once rightly said.

Business isn’t about fairness and co-operation. It’s about “do this
because I say so, and I can fire you”. It’s unfair and illogical to
begin with, so making a fair and logical version of it won’t succeed.

That’s not to say he doesn’t have some good practical ideas, though.

@ 12 Pro-reason

I don’t think Deming is against performance related pay simply because
it is unfair, but because it is unproductive. In the red bead
experiment suppose that there was some subtle way to influence the
outcome, say the red beads where slightly magnetic for example. Now
what would be the best strategy for a smart worker who discovered
this? They would not tell their colleagues because then they would
loose their advantage. They would not tell the company because then
there is no game/experiment and no extra pay. Worse (from the
company’s point of view) the smart worker would have to be careful not
to exploit his advantage too much for fear of being found out. If
he/she won best employee every time people would begin to suspect and
try to discover the secret.

The “treat ‘em mean to keep ‘em keen” school of management is really
more about enforcing and maintaining power relationships, not about
maximizing profits. This may be relevant to military situations but if
you are trying to improve production or quality, cooperation is by far
the best way. The people who know how best to do the job are usually
the ones doing it, not those trying to manage the process. In my
experience organizations work despite their management rather than
because of it. I have often thought that a good way to destroy a
company or business would be if the workers did exactly what the
managers told them to do however my union has advised me that the
courts would consider this as industrial action!

“The people who know how best to do the job are usually the ones doing
it” - well, no.

They know how they are currently doing the job.

What about having experience of similar or even analogous work - that
might let you “improve” (from the worker or productivity angle) how
you do the work?

In this case it would be someone perhaps with oversight of the whole
process who is better placed, as long as they could see how the detail
was done too.

While the media have been wrong to run with the “happiness rankings”
the way they have done, with no evidence in the study to suggest that
these rankings weren’t the result of random variation, this ranking
table didn’t come from nowhere. It was irresponsible for such a
ranking table to have been constructed in the first place.

It’s not a new phenomenon that the media try to sensationalise
academic studies into scare stories, but you can hardly fault them in
this case when such a juicy piece of gossip such as a ranking of
British towns and cities by how happy they are is waved right under
their noses.

If the findings were not “statistically significant” then the
researcher should never have allowed the ranking table to be written.

Ben Goldacre said,

September 10, 2008 at 7:21 pm

well, we can see from the press release that this was irresponsibly
presented to the media in any case, but i am quite concerned by the
suggestion from people here and in my emails that academics should not
dare to release some forms of information for fear that it will be
misunderstood or overstated by jourbnalists. that seems like a pretty
ridiculous gagging order to me, the media arent the only consideration
when academics decide what utterances to make to each other, or “in
public”, whatever the difference might be bnetween those two these
days.

I wonder if there’s a way to publish scientific results so that the
tabloid version is naturally harmless? Maybe get a celebrity
interested in the work? There’s plenty of ‘em to go around. So that
becomes the story and not the connection to immigrants or cancer.

gimpyblog said,

September 11, 2008 at 7:23 am

The press release might have been badly presented but the ‘notes for
editors’ were clear enough in explaining the implications of no
statistical significance. I find it even more damning of the BBC that
the editors ignored the ‘notes for editors’.

September 13, 2008 at 4:00 pm

What I don’t understand is that
this study appears to have planned to only ever recruit a small number
of people from each of the places it wished to study. Does this not
mean that from the outset that it would have struggled to achieve
statistical significance. And if you could work this out before even
starting, then why do it in the first place?

RossAberdeenUK said,

Watching Deming speak at the end of the video there - his words sound
like an indictment of the situation the west is now in commercially,
due (I have read) to competition and achievement targets within the
stockbroking community.

In psychological terms, beliecing with certainty something which is
patently untrue is termed a psychosis. Does this mean that all of our
commercial institutions are in fact mad? Perhaps some Fish Oil
supplements will help.
