Bad Science teaching resources for schools

October 8th, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in teaching resources |

A couple of years ago I made a bunch of school resources for teachers
with the organisation NESTA and a group of teachers. Since I mentioned
them in the book a couple of people have asked for them, so here they
are:

www.scienceyear.com/text_only/sciteach/badscience/index.html

I think they’re good fun, and informative, but there aren’t enough of
them, and so if any teachers out there wanted to get together and
collaborate on making some more, and bung them up for free online, I’d
be very enthusiastic about that.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. Torpedoing bad ideas is the perfect way to teach good science
because science is, after all, about critically appraising the
evidence for a given claim.

2. There is a huge appetite for evidence based medicine: half of all
science coverage in the media is medical, much of that is about what
will kill or cure you (see also the Daily Mail’s project of dividing
all the inanimate objects in the world into what causes or cures
cancer), People are clearly fascinated by this stuff, and yet we are
completely ignorant of the basics.

3. People often claim that creationism is really useful in schools,
because it is a good way to teach about “controversy in science”. It
is in fact a terrible example: disentangling the claims of the ID
movement in particular requires a vast amount of highly technical and
marginally useful detail, and the evidence for evolution requires a
fair amount of effort too, when you get down to it. Creationism makes
for a very unclean teaching case, and the explanations around it
require a large amount of specialist knowledge that would not be
generally useful.

4. Everybody is interested in MMR and the merits of fish oil pills or
homeopathy, and more importantly, these are perfect opportunities to
teach cleanly and clearly not just about the answers from science, but
the process, the mechanics of how we can find out if something is good
for you, or bad for you.

5. It is also a great opportunity to laugh at people like TV
nutritionist Gillian McKeith, vitamin pill entrepreneur Patrick
Holford, along with various other millionaires and, more importantly,
national newspapers, all of whom pose as authority figures.

I’ve had quite a few emails from people who are using stories from the
column or the book already in lessons, do please post below if you’ve
any useful experiences of trying them out, pointers, or would like to
get something a bit more organised together; pub or wiki is fine, and
if there is a group like NESTA who want to coordinate and help get the
stuff out for free under a creative commons license then all the
better. Note to collaborators: I am overcommitted and unable to
organise things, but willing / able / very fast working once stuck in.

Otherwise the classes above are there for the taking, here is an old
story about a fun classroom activity where a teacher took on a big
corporation over dodgy science and won, here are a few scatty notes
(which, er, someone should update soon) on badscience activism, here
is a good recent media story with links to the originals, and here is
a website and book full of raw material for art.

You should devote a column to Point 3 - absolutely right and it needs
saying.

Hear hear! I am so tired of hearing people say that teaching about
creationism can be used to teach about controversy. (What
controversy??) There are so many better ways to teach the nature of
science.

Excellent post, by the way - I’ve sent the link to all the science
teachers that I work with.

As someone who very recently did a GCSE double award in science (2 A*s
Yay!) I would like to bring some stuff up on the education issue.

The point i shall raise is that some of these things are covered in a
classroom, homeopathy is disscussed and shown to be bullshit. It is,
admitedly, kinder to it than that in print, but the message is there.

There are some criticsims of Ben’s Opinions of Education in his book
which i have addressed in my blog -
http://peterd102.wordpress.com/2008/10/09/bad-science-by-ben-goldacre/
- I do hope some of you read this, dont bother with much of the other
posts -it is maninly about TF2 atm lolz.

I would like to see more on Evidence in lessons, earlier than GCSEs.
Teach reasoning in Primary Schools!

Actually, I’d love to pick you up on 3 too. It’s a great point that
needs raising, but also one the does need properly addressing. For
better or worse, creationism / ID (in its various forms) _does_ exist,
and there will be plenty of interest and debate around it. Simply
ignoring it because the debate requires complex understanding, and
writing it off in schools as “outdated crap” will be more likely to
engender teenagers to investigate it and give it undue prominence.
There’s nothing children resent more than being told something is
wrong or false without justification! How to address it of course is
another matter entirely, but, to quote your first point, “torpedoing”
it based on evidence based methods seems the better option to not
including it in the curriculum.

I agree that creationism is a terrible example of a controversy in
science, but can anyone suggest a good example?

Physics is full of controversies between scientists. Both Dark Matter
and Dark Energy is controversial as is each of the competing forms of
string theory. And, since Physics is the most basic of all sciences
next to math, it’s about as straight forward as you can get.

1.

phayes said,

October 9, 2008 at 5:28 pm

Hehe… I sure wish I’d left school with a sufficient understanding of
physics that I found consideration of current issues and controversies
straightforward.

phayes: “Hey Mum! Is it okay if I take my skateboard and go on over to
Tom’s now?”

Mum: “Have you done your homework yet phayes - you were only in your
room for a few minutes?“

phayes: “Sure I have, Mum. There was only physics homework today and
it was easy - we just had to show that in the zero-slope limit, the
heterotic string theory yields 10 dimensional supergravity coupled to
a super Yang-Mills gauge multiplet with E₈⊗E₈ symmetry.”

I agree with Ben on point 3 too.

Time for the XKCD comic i think - www.xkcd.com/435/

You do realise how awful creationism is when it isnt even a useful
example of bad science.

Stephen J. Gould and Richard Dawkins theories on gaps in the fossil
records are interestiong to use. Bursts of Evolution or How the rocks
were formed? (I must admit I am in the Dawkins camp myself). These are
still fairly complex examples, I cant think of a really brillant
example of ‘controversy’ in science off the top of my head. They’ll be
one out there though.

Jamie Horder said,

“I agree that creationism is a terrible example of a controversy in
science, but can anyone suggest a good example?”

Er…hmm. Good question. I can think of plenty of controversies in my
field (psychiatric neuroscience) but in order to understand the point
of even one of them you’d need to read and understand at least a dozen
research papers.

Maybe that’s the whole point. There are no “neat” examples of
scientific controveries that make good teaching material, because most
genuine scientific debates are so messy and specific.

In which case the best approach would be to teach students, in
excruciating detail, all about some obscure historical controversy,
and then tell them “…and the debate over evolution is even more
boring, so to save you time, just remember that the evolution side
won.”

The chemical/electrical neuronal transmission controversy (Eccles,
Dale etc) is a nice and clean but rather dated example.

Ben Goldacre said,

October 9, 2008 at 8:31 pm

hang on, what’s wrong with my suggestion of fish oil claims, mmr, and
homeopathy? those are popular “controversies”, and the background
understanding needed to appreciate the story is basic evidence based
medicine, which is useful for the rest of your life, every time you
open a newspaper and see a claim about a pill, or a vegetable, or
visit a doctor.

1.

Jamie Horder said,

October 9, 2008 at 8:44 pm

Oh yeah, those are great examples of controversies over whether X
causes or cures Y. Which in the balance are probably the most relevant
to the average citizen. I was thinking of “basic science”
controversies, but then maybe only scientists need to worry about
those anyway.

1.

The Biologista said,

October 9, 2008 at 10:10 pm

These are “basic science” misunderstandings… scientific debate (ie
within the community as opposed to within the public domain) is
another matter entirely. I would say that the MMR scare and its ilk
represent perfect examples of public-relevant controversies. I agree
with Ben on the creationism matter- it is far too complex a row and at
any rate is not really relevant to most UK students.

On the whole Bravo!
But I’m concerned by the fact that we’re all going straight to point 3
(not to mention the whole Reiss thing), then ignoring the elephant.
Its naive to think creationism is going to go away by merely ignoring
it.
Obviously all the IDers claims have been debunked & creationist
misconcenceptions dispelled in myriad media over & over & over - yet
it won’t die! It seems like we can’t afford to tire of refuting them &
give up, smug in the knowledge that if you bother to go & read up, you
see its a load of nonsense. A lot of people won’t do that & the
education system will have failed them.
I guess the fear is that we risk giving them a foothold by introducing
their tosh as a ‘viable alternative theory’ in the classroom.
Nevertheless, I don’t agree that the knowledge required to rebuke
creationism can’t be reasonably presented to a GCSE or A-level
student.

peterd102 said,

October 9, 2008 at 11:32 pm

Yeh Im a A-Level student and its quite plainly Obvious that
Creationsim is a pile of horseshit, and the rest of the students seem
clever enough to grasp that the earth isnt 10,000 years old.

These examples are examples of Wrong science, not a science
controversy as others were thinking of. The evidence is swayed in one
way for homeopathy ect. Is there a nice example where there is equal
evidence on both sides?

1.

The Biologista said,

October 9, 2008 at 11:47 pm

Yes I think we have more subtle dangers to confront than creationism.
I regularly engage in that particular debate, but at this time I think
it’s not one of our main concerns in this part of the world. There are
some moves towards teaching creationism in Northern Ireland, mind you.

1.

pv said,

October 9, 2008 at 11:54 pm

The only people who have ever suggested there was some sort of
controversy, as far as I’m aware, are proponents of Intelligent Design
(aka Creationists).
I don’t know about controversies apart from Ben’s suggestions but
Homeopathy would be a good example of pretend science or, in Feynman’s
words, “Cargo Cult Science”. In fact I think Cargo Cult Science should
be obligatory reading.

1.

AntibodyBoy said,

October 10, 2008 at 9:58 am

Ok, I see your point - I agree there is no controversy, just
misunderstanding & pig-headed denial of evidence. Surely this is true
of homeopathy, nutritionism, etc - I’ll stick my neck out here & point
out that just about everything featured on this site is chosen
precisely because their exists plentiful evidence to the contrary? Of
course its all worthy stuff & should be used as teaching examples -
but I guess I fundamentally dont see the ‘controversy’ in any of this
- cargo cult is exactly what it is. Perhaps more useful ‘controversy’
is found in areas where science cant really help us to chose the
‘right’ path, like proliferation of cloning technology, abortion
rights, etc.

I teach at a school which uses what is arguably the most challenging
GCSE syllabus. And still the discussion of real science is rather
limited in places. Constraints of time, syllabus and some students
persistent refusal to consider anything that goes against their
religious views is frustrating. For example:

I’ve recently been teaching a bit of human biology to Year 11 kids,
15/16. We were looking at enzymes and the digestive system, trying to
explain why it’s important we have a mucus lining in the stomach. I
asked what people are made of, hoping to get the idea of protein (i.e.
meat!). The answer I got? “Clay.” He’s been taught it and *had no
idea* that this was a religious metaphor. Imagine how tricky evolution
is!

On a more positive note - and more relevant to Ben’s original post - I
have a few resources, worksheets, activities, powerpoints - that I use
to try and teach about the real processes of science and how we
examine ideas to see if they are useful. Recent examples include
“mobile phone masts cause cancer” and “results of the MMR hoax”. I’m
happy to email them as attachments if someone can make them accessible
to all, ideally with contributions from the many other teachers who
are no doubt around…

diogenes said,

There may not be any good examples of questions in science which are
both current and in which the evidence is equal on both sides. This is
because in science if the evidence is the same on both sides it won’t
stay that way for long, at least if the scientists have there way.
They will find ways in which the two sides make different predictions
and go and test them. If stalemate and entrenched dogma is what you’re
after you might perhaps want to try philosophy…

If anyone wants some ideas, then http://www.senseaboutscience.net/ is
a good source.
They have some new material about interpreting medical research
papers.
From their email today I quote:-

Further information: what’s in the resource?

The lesson plans cover a range of abilities from Key Stage 4 pupils up
to A-level. These include:

Roleplay: an exercise where pupils play the different roles of
researcher, editor and reviewer, experiencing the different stages
that a piece of research must pass through in order to be published.

Science in the media: a look at how science stories are reported in
the news using real-life examples such as mobile phones and cancer,
cloning, and the HPV vaccine. Students are encouraged to question the
nature of the research behind the story, identify who carried it out
and most importantly, ask whether it has been published in a
peer-reviewed journal.

The Process and its Challenges: intended for advanced students, this
exercise looks at the limitations of peer review. Students learn about
real-life cases such as the scandal surrounding Korean cloning expert
Hwang Woo-suk, and learn what role peer review has to play in these
events.

The resource fits into the curriculum requirement (introduced in 2006)
that secondary school children must be taught “how uncertainties in
scientific knowledge and scientific ideas change over time and the
role of the scientific community in validating these changes.” As part
of the new STEM Directories project, details of the resource will be
distributed to schools throughout the country

The resource is located at www.senseaboutscience.net

Surely good science teaching is offtopic in the Bad Science
discussion.

Wonder Woman was made of clay. One version of the story has her as the
reincarnation of the unborn child of a prehistoric murder vactiim, if
I followed. The origin and constitution of other human beings is
different.

We’re mostly water - come to think that is not in the bible.

Of course the ultimate “Bad Science Teaching Resource for Schools” has
been sent out to 5,000 of them by one Tony Attwood of PR firm,
Hamilton House. http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6003538

As a means of “improving” exam results, it strikes me as akin, in
ethical considerations, to the cynical pocket-lining machinations that
have led to the current financial crisis.

I suspect that those responsible for the Durham “Fish Oil Farce”
believe that ethics is a county near London.
