Nice review of my book in the British Medical Journal by Richard Smith

Review of the Week

Becoming Ben

Richard Smith, director, Ovations Chronic Disease Initiative

richardswsmith@yahoo.co.uk

Ben Goldacre’s book assembles an impressive array of villains who deal
in bad science, finds Richard Smith

We’re lucky to have Ben Goldacre, and maybe as a result of his book
we’ll have more people like him. He is fighting what sometimes seems
like a one man battle against a tide of pseudoscience and an army of
quacks. His main weapons are his weekly column in the Guardian
newspaper, an impressive website ( www.badscience.net), and now this
book, which aims “to teach good science by examining the bad.”

Luckily Goldacre, a practising doctor, has all that’s needed for the
battle: a solid understanding of epidemiology, statistics, and public
health; a fluid, engaging way of writing, although with a weakness for
bad jokes; a gift for using the web effectively; a taste for glory; a
thick skin; good lawyers; and seemingly boundless energy (he tells us
in passing about his childhood hyperactivity).

The good lawyers are necessary because Goldacre is regularly
threatened with libel actions and even violence. He and the Guardian
have just had a major triumph in beating off the legal threats of
Matthias Rath, a doctor who has condemned antiretrovirals for HIV and
promoted his own nutritional supplements as the right treatment ( BMJ
2008;337:a1710, doi: 10.1136/bmj.a1710). It seems that Dr Rath has
made millions from his treatments and dubious claims and had the money
to sue the Guardian. It’s one of many indictments of the English libel
system that whoever has the most money will usually win. The Guardian
’s victory is important for health, science, and journalism
and—annoyingly for Rath—will help promote Goldacre’s book. And now
that the legal threat has lifted he has also promised a book on Rath.

Bad Science is in many ways a primer on using egregious claims and
media stories as the raw material for assessing evidence. The book is
aimed at the public, and many BMJ readers will know the basics—but
everybody will learn something. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on
“Why clever people believe stupid things.” Underestimating the power
of chance, we see patterns where none exist and causal relationships
where there are none. We overvalue evidence that confirms our
hypotheses; and instead of searching, like true scientists, for
information that will destroy our hypotheses we look for evidence that
will confirm them.

Although repeatedly writing that he blames the system not individuals
for the huge volumes of bad science put out by cosmetics firms,
nutritionists, homoeopaths, drug companies, and others, Goldacre
assembles an impressive collection of villains. BMJ readers will, I
think, enjoy reading accounts of these people, many of them with fake
qualifications, who make fortunes by using the jargon, graphs, and
formulas of science to sell simple and ineffective treatments for
complex problems. Most of these people, unlike most doctors, are adept
at using the media, and Goldacre admits to admiring their skills and
chutzpah.

It is an irony, therefore, that he directs most of his ire against the
media. “The blame” for the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) debacle
lies with the “hundreds of journalists, columnists, editors and
executives who drove this story cynically, irrationally and wilfully
onto the front pages for nine years.” He sneers unattractively at
“humanities graduates [who run the media] with little understanding of
science, who wear their ignorance as a badge of honour.” To Goldacre
“humanities graduate” is an insult, which seems silly when his broad
mission is to encourage deeper understanding of complex issues.

The MMR story is told completely and well, and the media have
undoubtedly driven the story in a wholly unreasonable way. But we get
the media we deserve, and I think it’s a mistake—made time and time
again by desperate politicians—to blame the media. The problem lies
deeper, as Goldacre himself observes elsewhere.

“Science,” he writes, “is our dominant explanatory for the natural and
moral world.” Those who seek to influence us—whether politicians,
health authorities, journalists, fraudsters, or business people—will
turn to science. But science is complex and is becoming more so, and
most of the population is scientifically illiterate. Our basic human
failings—of irrationality, greed, arrogance, laziness, criminality,
and so on—become mixed up with science. “Much of the nonsense in bad
science... isn’t something done to us,” writes Goldacre, “[rather]
it’s a cultural product... We do it to ourselves.”

And there’s nothing new about bad science. As long as there has been
science there has been bad science. This is made very clear, for
example, in the history of vaccination. I worried when I started
reading this book that its author might be in pursuit of a Utopia
where bad science was abolished. But quite the opposite: not only does
he recognise the hopelessness of trying to eradicate it, he is having
huge fun countering it. Without it he might be lost.

He thus stays away from simple solutions, but he does urge better
teaching of uses of evidence in schools—and I can see his book and
free blogs being used to create learning sessions that would be great
fun. This would apply equally in medical schools, where the teaching
of epidemiology and statistics is often horribly dull. Goldacre is
scornful of “the indulgent and well financed ‘public engagement of
science’ community,” but he urges those who understand evidence to
start blogs. In the world of web 2.0, scientists can grab attention
just as well as those who spread bad science. You too can become a Ben
Goldacre.

Well, I’m glad Smith defends humanities graduates. As a humanities
graduate myself, and as a long-time reader of The Guardian column and
frequent visitor to this site, I feel a bit miffed that we should all
be tarred with the same brush.

In any case, I’ve met plenty of science graduates who use
homoeopathy/read their horoscopes/believe in God, so I don’t think
that humanities graduates have a monopoly on irrational thinking.

Just looked up your book on amazon.co.uk to add to my wishlist and it
seems that someone is missing the point:

Under ‘Other customers suggested these items’ they’ve got 3 Gillian
McKeith books that have been ‘Suggested by 1 customer’…

Kim, Surely the point is those humanities graduates “who wear their
ignorance as a badge of honour”. I’ve nothing more than four ‘O’
levels from the ’70s and I can appreciate that there’s ignorance on
both sides but I’ve yet to meet a science graduate who’s glad he or
she knows nothing of Plato, Pindar or Selden.
I do not present my own experience as anything more than anecdotal and
I back your comment about science graduates being ignorant and
superstitious outside their own fields.Is the same true of humanities
graduates or are there no people in the field who think that Mendel,
Maxwell and Mendelev are dull and irrelevant? We come back to
C.P.Snow’s “Two Cultures” and the urgent need to give all humans a
much better understanding of both cultures before they specialise.
Ben’s book (I’ve given away five copies so far) should be prescribed
reading for everybody-especially politicians.

dirkgently -

That would be me. And unless Amazon have removed ‘em, there are links
to Ben’s book under Professor McKeith’s best sellers. Putting the
recommendations both ways increases the chances (I’m told) of Ben’s
book being recommended directly to McKeith’s customers.

Oh, and I’m surprised Ben’s not more upset that the BMJ is accusing
him of beating Matthias Rath off.

Polymaths may be in decline as a result of increasing specialisation.
Certainly listening to generalists discussing one’s specialist area of
knowledge is usually on the painful rather than funny. Scientists are
prone to ignorance about the social, cultural or historical context of
their field which is one of the reasons they often fare so poorly when
interviewed because they seem so detached from society. Clearly some
people flourish in narrow fields, but the interpretation of their work
in the context of the wider world depends on someone with a broader
knowledge base. I think education has been forcing people into
vocational courses and specialisation too far and too soon for too
long and we need to take seriously the need to educate modern
polymaths

Congratulations to you, Ben, can’t wait to read the book.

As a longtime Bad Science follower, English Lit student and science
enthusiast, I have to agree with kim - every time you have a rant
against humanities graduates, a part of me dies in the knowledge that
someone I admire so greatly apparently considers my life’s pursuit an
utter waste of time. Yes, yes, I know you’re referring to clueless
media people “wear[ing] their ignorance as a badge of honour” - but
would it hurt you to make that a little clearer?

SubMoron, if you’re “yet to meet a science graduate who’s glad he or
she knows nothing of Plato, Pindar or Selden,” then I envy you for
your social circle. Sadly, I have observed a modern trend amongst
science graduates for aggressively narrow cultural boundaries,
refusing to engage with a wider society. Call them the Illiterati or
call them the radical geeks, but there is a growing subculture that
will not look much beyond anime and George Lucas films, and it is no
less disrespectful towards the arts and humanities than those who
proudly proclaim their innumeracy are towards the sciences.

In defence of Ben, I think it is pretty obvious that he isn’t talking
about all arts graduates but just those who not only wear their
ignorance as a badge of honour, but also insist on foisting bad
science on the public. This must be a rather small subset of all arts
graduates.

I must also agree with Dok that there is “trend amongst science
graduates for aggressively narrow cultural boundaries”. In fact I’d go
a bit further. The audit culture has encouraged a breed of scientists
who not only have never read Middlemarch, but who can be pretty
cavalier about science itself -never mind the understanding the maths,
just work the system and publish lots of papers. That is what happens
when you have a system that rewards triviality and headline-seeking.

csrster said,

Mary Beard recently admitted to not having read Middlemarch (
http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1529569286/bclid1586429850/bctid1681848733
) so they wouldn’t be in such bad company.

I actually _have_ read Middlemarch, but for some reason I didn’t seem
to “get it”. I just couldn’t see why it was considered interesting or
important or one of the most significant novels in English literary
history. I’m not sure if that makes me one of the illiterati or not.

Humanities graduates aren’t the problem. It’s the disproportionate
number of them who end up feeding information to the public that is.

David Colquhoun said,

October 8, 2008 at 10:31 am

csrster. May I suggest that you try Rosemary Ashton’s biography of
George Henry Lewes. He was the man with whom George Eliot lived, a
remarkable polymath, radical, freethinker and a founder member of the
Physiological Society. There is little doubt that he influenced
greatly the modern scientific thinking and anti-quackery ideas of
Lydgate.

I don’t think it is that clear; in the book it is sometimes used in an
unqualified and unnuanced way that is both sneering and unattractive
and, from the number of time it comes up in discussion now the book is
published, it distracts from the main message.

Toenex wrote:

After Nick Davies’ arguments in Flat Earth News, I’m not clear that
the responsibility does lie wholly with ‘humanities graduates who run
the media’ unless that is code for ‘people who run industries that
employ successful advertising and PR companies to promote their
message and they do this via mainstream media all the while
undermining interest in anything but soundbite journalism so readers,
TV viewers etc. are indifferent to the quality of science or health
journalism’. Added to which, there is a roll of shame of TV doctors
who effectively front for companies whose products they endorse even
when this undermines the public understanding of science - are they
secretly humanities graduates?

1.

David Colquhoun said,

October 8, 2008 at 11:55 am

yes gadgeezer, we know you can find a PhD (real or bought) to advocate
any idea, however barmy. The power lies with the people who make the
TV programmes. Who is it who invites people like McKeith to make high
profile TV programmes? Could it perhaps be some of those people who
wear their ignorance as a badge of honour?

1.

gadgeezer said,

October 8, 2008 at 12:08 pm

I listed medical doctors - who may or may not have PhDs.

We know that you can find humanities or arts graduates who don’t
fulfil Ben’s stereotype but that is after interpretation and ignoring
some of what he wrote.

Are you saying that Davies is mistaken about the power of advertisers?

Could it be that some people are being faux-naif about abrasiveness as
a badge of honour?

outeast said,

Long-term readers of Bad Science (and the comments threads, where Ben
has repeatedly responded to this criticism) should know that the
humanities graduate ’slur’ is something of a standing joke.

OK, if you’re new to Ben’s writing that may not come across - but he’s
a bit of a geek, and geeks like in-jokes. It goes with the territory.

As it happens, I’m another humanities graduate myself - and having
been raised in pretty thoroughly anti-science background, I once fit
the description pretty well. I was never in a position of influence,
thank the gods, but I can certainly recognize the truth that lies at
the heart of the jibe.

humanities graduates?

gadgeezer don’t you think that’s a bit beside the point? There are
crooks and charlatans from all walks of life, and some of them might
volunteer for a bit of tv exposure to promote their particular scam.
But the people who choose who goes on mainstream tv or radio, who
get’s interviewed, who gets a show and who doesn’t… these are
exclusively the folks who commission the programmes, who are in thrall
to audience ratings and who decide what goes out every day as
entertainment, news or whatever. It’s a very arrogant, narrow-minded
business, with no interest in anything other than bums on seats and
ratings. Certainly no interest in science, never mind any knowledge of
it, except insofar as sciency “clothes” (dialogue, terminology etc)
are useful (like science fiction) to entertain or scare the viewer.
Honesty and unbiased information are never on the agenda when it comes
to the promotion of quackery.
The media industry just so happens to run and largely populated by
humanities graduates, and I think it’s just little disingenuous to
insist that it has no bearing on the matter.

What exactly is defined as the feild of ‘Humanities’ anyway? At
secondary school it seems hard to disentangle. There was History and
Geography in there which have a decent basis in science, and do seems
to be more about thinking scientifically - considering evidience,and
this was done much more frequently than in science lessons themselves.

My personal target is English Literature, which seems like a pointless
subject (at the time of writing, feel free to object in my blog -
http://peterd102.wordpress.com/2008/10/09/eng-lit/
).

kim said,

October 10, 2008 at 1:07 pm

Well, the point of studying English literature as I see it is to
discover that not everyone else sees the world in the same way you do.
Given that none of us is ever going to be able to travel everywhere in
the world, and certainly not back in time, it’s probably the best way
there is of finding out that other people’s experiences, values and
ways of life are different from our own.

It is also, incidentally, a very good way of understanding techniques
of persuasion - how a writer uses a particular technique to make you
think about something in a certain light. The ability to understand
this use of language is particularly helpful in enabling you to think
critically about things like adverts, newspaper articles and
politicians’ speeches.

I think the greatest benefit is that it makes you realise that your
own experiences and views are necessarily partial, and coloured by the
time and place you live in. In fact, if I may be so bold, this is
exactly where many science graduates go wrong. They find it very easy
to see things in black-and-white rather than in their full complexity.
In my experience, anyway…

experience, anyway…

That seems to me like a view of a view of a view. A misunderstanding
or generalisation of what view scientists are likely to take based on
a misunderstanding of what science is. In fact I’d say, on the
contrary, I’d be surprised if it’s the view of many scientists at all
in reality.
Basically there are some (many) aspects of the physical world that
just can’t be understood or appreciated without some knowledge of
science. Feynman claimed that it was impossible to understand the
physical world other than very superficially without a deep knowledge
mathematics.
He also said there is a beauty to be appreciated at levels smaller
than 1 centimetre.
The fundamental point of these two assertions was that while he, as a
scientist, could appreciate the beauty observed by an artist at the
larger level, he could also appreciate the beauty to be found in the
structures of things at the microscopic level and smaller. This is
quite contrary to the humanities’ or arts’ view that scientists only
see things in black and white. In fact I would go further and say that
the beauty available to scientists for appreciation is denied to those
who scorn the sciences. And it goes some way to explaining why most
science journalism is so ridiculous and crappy.

“They find it very easy to see things in black-and-white rather than
in their full complexity”

I wonder if this sentence is code for the idea that there are [more
than] two sides to every issue, each more or less of the same merit,
and the idea that ‘balance’ requires considering all points of view as
equally valid?

The concept of balance works in opinion based assessments, like
interpreting literature or appreciating art, but the geek view is that
it does not work as well when it confronts evidence based on
reproducible measurement. It really is as if there are two cultures
that are separated by a common tounge.
