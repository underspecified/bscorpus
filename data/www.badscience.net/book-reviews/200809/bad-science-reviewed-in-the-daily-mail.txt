Haha w00t I am “Health Book Of The Week” in the Daily Mail

September 30th, 2008 by Ben Goldacre in book reviews, book, onanism,
mail, bad science |

[Click on the image to read it].

I don’t know how I managed to miss this, but my cheeky tome “ Bad
Science ” was Health Book Of The Week in the Daily Mail last Tuesday.
There are three things I find interesting about their review.

1. I am Health Book Of The Week in the Daily Mail (and after all the
mean things I’ve said about them). To me this says a great deal about
the strangeness of the Daily Mail project - barrages of nonsense,
interspersed with occasional moments of incongruous clarity. This
phenomenon, for me, reached its pinnacle in their front page article
on how miracle pixie dust made a man’s finger grow back. You will
remember that this story was nonsense. After all the front page
excitement, hidden away at the very end of their article, was a quote
from someone who actually knew about this stuff, who said, quite
simply, that the papers entire front page story was all cock.
Brilliant, strange, and oddly endearing.

2. It’s really dry. I like Edzard Ernst, in the sense that I have
greatly enjoyed drinking beer with him in a pub, and his simple but
necessary project of producing systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
CAM treatments has been enormously useful for all, although the
results have upset some people. I also think that the vindictive
harrassment he has been subjected to by the CAM industry as a result
is a damning indictment of how angry and intolerant their profession
can be. But he is very square. The world needs different kinds of
people.

3. It’s right next to some absolute nonsense about Eye Gym. See also
[1] above. Magnificent.

I would not know about the idiosyncrasies of the Daily Mail, but if
only one Daily Mail reader feels compelled to buy and read your book,
the Daily Mail will actually have done something for humanity.

hahaha. Indeed they are an exotic and mysterious organ. I have
noticed, in line with your description ‘barrages of nonsense,
interspersed with occasional moments of incongruous clarity’ how in
the field of drug policy they adopt a fervently punitive position
(backed with all manner of bad science about the evils of drugs),
labelling anyone who questions it some sort of pro-drug satanist - and
then periodically run eminently sensible editorial calling for the
legalisation of all drugs. odd.

Ive blogged about one such recent foray here:

Why is one required to open a Wordpress account to comment on this
blog?

1.

muscleman said,

September 30, 2008 at 3:53 pm

Emilypk that is common to a lot of blogs and no big deal. One thing it
does is enable the site owner to delete offensive, libellous or
spamming posts and if necessary ban that account from their blog.

Think of it like this, you go to Ben’s house and to get in and join
the party you are required to identify yourself to him. However having
done so you can then don a masque and enter in whatever guise you so
choose, and have a ball.

1.

emilypk said,

September 30, 2008 at 4:00 pm

Muscleman, I run 7 blogs–one for profit, using three different
platforms. In my circle it is considered impolite at best to require
an account (blogger, wordpress, squidoo, whatever). Especially as it
is very easy to manage spam control and identify vistors by other
methods (e.g. typing a name and email address). Not every contrary
opinion (in fact, just a question) is based on ignorance.

1.

muscleman said,

September 30, 2008 at 4:08 pm

you are perfectly welcome to post ‘contrary opinions’, except that in
sceptical/science type blogs you will be expected to be able to back
them up. With proper evidence and there will be lots of people around
able to tell the difference.

A Ben has written science is all about being prepared to have your
ideas given a real hard going over. Too many people think that having
their ideas shredded is personal attack, it is not, or does not have
to be.

So if you have a contrary opinon. other than whining about the
registration requirements, then by all means lets hear them. Light
needs heat to be generated.

book of the week is book of the week no matter what!

The Daily Heil’s mission is to play for both sides. One side
understands little and has the memory span of a fish while the other
side looks on incredulously. Then they publish stories about how
scientists are always contradicting themselves.
It’s a profitable deception.

1.

censored said,

September 30, 2008 at 5:12 pm

emilypk - I believe it’s much easier for users to log in with a
verified account, than have to verify themselves every time. Besides,
it’s not a Wordpress account. It’s merely a registration for this, and
only this, blog.

On topic. I wonder if anyone at the Daily Heil actually read the
book?!

1.

Wikidd said,

September 30, 2008 at 5:32 pm

I think it’s even more incredible that The Daily Hate had a mention of
the third eye! For those who don’t know, that was the term the late,
great comedian/prophet Bill Hicks used to describe the organ that
allows us to see the whole of the universe without barriers in all of
its’ multidimensional glory. He recommended giving it a “squish” by
taking large amounts of psychedelic drugs!

Maybe they’ve been infiltrated by editors with a sense of humour?

1.

stever said,

September 30, 2008 at 5:37 pm

emilypk - because it gets about 30k hits a day this blog was being
absolutely deluged with spam, despite best efforts, and theres no
budget to mod it - so registration became a regrettable necessity.

kilometre.

kim said,

September 30, 2008 at 7:45 pm

Or it could simply be that the Daily Mail books editor is Sandra
Parsons, late of The Times, who takes a more serious approach to
health and science than her colleagues. Was the review in the health
pages or the books pages?

1.

brainduck said,

September 30, 2008 at 11:42 pm

t’other annoying thing about commenting on this blog is that it’s a
blog-specific login - so even though I already have a wordpress blog &
login, I have to bother to create a separate new login just for Bad
Science. Multiply that by the several other blogs I read which insist
on blog-specific logins, & it causes Grumpiness.

A propos of nothing - the text immediately above the article reads “he
starts probing around/model Caprice”. What’s that all about, Ben?

Why is this book no longer held in stock at The Guardian online
bookshop?

I bought a copy of this book a couple of weeks ago from the Guardian
website, read it and decided to buy lots more copies for friends.
However, it has now disappeared from the Guardian website - no mention
of it anywhere. I contacted them to find out why and just got a short
email saying it was no longer held in stock…. given it was written by
someone who writes for the Guardian I did find this quite odd. I then
noticed that out of all the categories they list of books they do
stock “Science” as a category was curiously missing. Does rather fit
in with the chapter on the media.

Luckily, Amazon stock it instead.

The book’s a lot cheaper at Amazon, or Waterstones if you can pick up
an order direct from the shop.

One thing that worries me is that it has such unrelenting positive
reviews on the Amazon site. Well deserved, of course. But I would have
expected some slagging off from various cranks - surely it hasn’t
given them pause for thought?

1.

NuclearChicken said,

This is a very surreal turn of events. Could the Daily Mail be trying
to discredit the book by promoting it in their own pages?

I would not be so quick to condemn “Eye Gym”. I’ve been using exactly
the same technique to strengthen my testes for six months, and can now
bench-press seventy-five pounds using only my scrotum.

1.

Groinhammer said,

October 1, 2008 at 4:46 pm

Thought it implied ‘Ben Goldacre recommends Eye Gym’ at first glance
due to the proximity. For a terrifying moment I thought Ben had
crossed over to the Dark Side.

When you look at the woo nonsense for too long, is their a danger you
could be sucked into the sparkly tights and ‘Ta Daaaa!’ world of the
credulous? I was looking into the duck hunters Everest that is
Scientology recently, and you do start to wonder what all the fuss is
about. It initially reads like old school Christianity - giving up
your wealth to the ‘church’, admonishing the unbeliever, secretive
texts and rituals, persecution of heretics, top dogs penchant for the
nubile and hard cash - nothing different to run of the mill historical
vatican policy as far as I could tell. The Xenu/Xemu bit reads like a
bad Star Trek episode though.

Ben - Have you looked at Nelsons products? I was looking at a pack of
their ‘Teetha’ (fast becoming a firm favorite with mums) which lists
the active ingredient as 6c homeopathic potency of Chamomilla. ‘As the
teething process can go on for up to 18 months you probably want to
find a natural remedy that will work in tune with your baby’s body and
one that is safe enough to be used every day. Nelsons Teetha is a firm
been a favourite (sic) among parents for generations. The natural,
sugar-free granules work with the whole body to soothe and calm your
baby, and relieve the pain and discomfort of teething. The pleasant
tasting powders are ready dosed so they can be taken anytime,
anywhere. Just tip into your baby’s mouth or spoon-feed.’ The
punchline is the precautions:
‘Keep out of the reach of children. If symptoms persist or worsen,
consult your doctor or homeopath.’

Consult a medical practitioner or any old bloke over the road.

Ben - just finished your wonderful book.

I am a veterinarian, but have decided to teach for a while. I am
rather passionate about good science (some Public Health post-grad
work got me all hot under the collar over the industry of
pseudoscience - alive and well downunder).

I have just spent this year doing a grad. teaching dip. at Uni of
Auckland and, while my year group is lovely and interesting, they do
not know a thing about critical analysis of scientific literature. I
gave our science lecturer your book and she was utterly inspired.

Anyway - my friends are getting a little tired of all my
‘bollocks-spotting’ lectures, so I now look forward to having a
captive audience of ten year olds upon which to inflict my tirades
against the abuse of science.

For the sake of our children, every teacher should read your book. I
will do my part to push it in New Zealand. If you are ever out this
way - PLEASE let me rope you on to giving a talk to NZ teachers. They
need your help (bribes of good red wine included).

Cheers, Ana

Oh yeah - for a laugh: enhanced external counter pulsation..

Mitton, I don’t think it’s a matter of preferring, but of making a
mistake. Since it’s in a quotation from the book, I just wonder
whether it’s their or our Ben’s.

Someone should contact Alanis Morissette immediately and use this to
explain to her the meaning of ironic. Well done Ben, at least someone
at the Daily Mail appears to have a sense of humour.

1.

Persiflage said,

October 2, 2008 at 3:40 pm

Priceless. Utterly priceless.

The Alanis Morissette reference occurred to me too, but you beat me to
it!

Isn’t this going to induce some serious cognitive dissonance in the
Daily Mail-reading public? I can see a sudden rush of
confusion-stricken patients to the local homeopa… no, doctor… no,
acupuncturist… no, doctor… Argh!

If they *really* want to do the job properly, they should run a
competition where the winner receives a signed copy of Bad Science,
another of Testing Treatments, a collection of healing crystals, a
homeopathic First Aid kit and a Q-Link pendant.

1.

Dr Aust said,

October 2, 2008 at 10:08 pm

Persiflage,

As Kat pointed out over here, there already is a competition of this
kind - it’s the “Food For The Brain” Raffle. You truly couldn’t make
it up.

BTW, the “medicine” Groinhammer pointed out above is another example
of why the MHRA should be ashamed of the changes in the rules on
advertising / labelling homeopathic remedies a couple of years back -
see e.g. David Colquhoun’s blog here, and the earlier posts it links
to.

Comment 21: so Eye Gym is not eyewash, it is bollocks?

Comment 22: Groinhammer? Look out 21!

I don’t remember if the “Eye Trainer” video game initially came with a
small print health warning on its television adverts “Does not do your
eyesight any good whatsoever” but it showed up pretty quickly. I
wonder if there’s been any more trouble about that.

That’s a really bad picture of Ben next to the article, in the picture
here. It looks like he’s nearly bald.

EECP grows new blood vessels to bypass blocked arteries? Is that like
opening other roads in the event of a motorway beiing closed, then?
And how well does that work typically?
