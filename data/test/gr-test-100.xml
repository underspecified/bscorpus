Farrah Fawcett has &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/arts/television/26fawcett.html"&gt;lost her three year battle with anal cancer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Farrah Fawcett, an actress and television star whose good looks and signature flowing hairstyle influenced a generation of women and bewitched a generation of men, beginning with a celebrated pinup poster, died Thursday morning in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 62 and lived in West Los Angeles.
 
Her death, at St. John's Health Center, was caused by anal cancer, which she had been battling since 2006, said her spokesman, Paul Bloch.

&lt;p&gt;To an extraordinary degree, Ms. Fawcett's cancer battle was played out in public, generating enormous interest worldwide. Her face, often showing the ravages of cancer, became a tabloid fixture, and updates on her health became staples of television entertainment news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, that battle was chronicled in a prime-time NBC documentary, "Farrah's Story," some of it shot with her own home video recorder. An estimated nine million people viewed it. Ms. Fawcett had initiated the project with a friend, the actress Alana Stewart, after she first learned of her cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I've written extensively about this on two occasions, first a year and a half ago when I learned that Fawcett had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/farrah_fawcett_turns_to_alternative_medi.php"&gt;turned to woo&lt;/a&gt; after her anal cancer, which had seemingly been treated successfully, recurred; then again two months ago when she was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/farrah_fawcett_and_alternative_cancer_cu.php"&gt;admitted to the hospital due to a complicationr&lt;/a&gt; from the therapy she was undergoing in Germany, including alternative methods; and then finally when I realized that my speculation of what therapy Fawcett had undergone in Germany was way off and I had to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/orac_screwed_up_it_looks_that_way.php"&gt;admit a rare mistake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of that really matters anymore..&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/farrah_fawcett_dead_of_cancer_at_age_62.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/farrah_fawcett_dead_of_cancer_at_age_62.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/RpEgRsmSpbE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245988101407"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/son_of_the_bride_of_the_thread.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a94d62dbec4c18e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Open Thread"/><title type="html">Son of the Bride of the Thread That Will Not Die</title><published>2009-06-26T04:31:02Z</published><updated>2009-06-26T04:31:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/nziPVoAdmN0/son_of_the_bride_of_the_thread.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;IT'S STILL ALIVE!

Apparently the same behavior has been observed in sheep, but they’re not as funny as wallabies so they don’t make it into the headline, nor are they pictorially represented in this blog post, as such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/697/521930displayimagephpla.jpg" alt="Wallaby"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was going to leave the dragon-chasing wallabies as good, clean Quickie-fodder, the sheer tsunami of tips people are sending convinced me a full post is needed. I have very little to add to the story, except this: from now on, when someone offers you an anecdote to support their personal wacky theory, whether it concerns aliens buzzing cornfields or ghosts haunting mansions or NASA faking moon landings, your number one response should now be “&lt;strong&gt;maybe it was a doped-up wallaby&lt;/strong&gt;.” You never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Seriously, thanks to all of you who sent this one in, and all of &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1227/"&gt;you who continue to send in your tips&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;Today, Peter Binfield, the Managing Editor of PLoS ONE, published a paper entitled "PLoS ONE: Background, Future Development, and Article-Level Metrics" that covers all of that in great detail. The paper is, of course, Open Access, so you can download the PDF for free &lt;a href="http://conferences.aepic.it/index.php/elpub/elpub2009/paper/view/114/51" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the related PowerPoint slideshow &lt;a href="http://conferences.aepic.it/index.php/elpub/elpub2009/paper/view/114/94" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/06/25/plos-one-and-article-level-metrics/" title=""&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The paper goes into a lot of detail on the history and inner workings of PLoS ONE, and so if you are at all interested in where our journal came from; how it operates; and where it is going in the future, then it is required reading.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I second that! A Must Read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as this is a peer-reviewed article, if you blog about it, and if you use the BPR3 icon, the link to your blog post will show up on the &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/post-search/list?search_text=journal.pone" title=""&gt;ResearchBlogging.org&lt;/a&gt; aggregator and will thus be eligible for the &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/tag/blog-pick-of-the-month/" title=""&gt;Blog Pick Of The Month&lt;/a&gt; for June.&lt;/p&gt;

I heard Jill say the name of Alex’s teacher. “He’s sick?” I thought. “This morning of all mornings?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Instead the teacher wanted to know if we’d gotten the message about dressing all the graduating kids in black and white for the ceremony? I had some memory of that but not a strong one — at this point in my parenthood only a drop of guilt can turn into a real past event in my head. Alex went to school in khakis and a T, and good luck getting him to wear anything else these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/06/alexgrad-300x225.jpg" alt="alexgrad" width="300" height="225"&gt;Teacher got him into a white baseball T. Alex was one of two kids in his special-needs class graduating, the rest of the graduates made up of kids from the typical school Alex’s classroom sits in. The kids were in summer dresses, little suits, some ties, all of their shoulders draped in the school’s purple grad banner. Most of the parents were dressed to match, minus the banners, of course. I showed up in cargo shorts and a short-sleeve button-down shirt and Chuck Taylors. Why hadn’t I foreseen this moment? For a moment I told myself that being the parent of a kid like Alex should give me a built-in excuse, but that sounded feeble the instant I said it to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t, and the moment soon took me in the throat. There were all the kids and all the awards, all the balloons and all the digitial camera phones and all the applause – no great amount of the latter but certainly no small amount of it, either, for Alex and his autistic classmate, even as Alex kept escaping on stage to see what was behind the drawn curtain. In his white baseball T and khakis. Once he got a laugh. Halfway through the ceremony, I saw he’d shed his banner. He won an award for reading, along with four typically-developing students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About that same time, it hit me that this was it. Jill has already talked about the kindness of this place, a kindness I confess I’ve taken for granted for six years. It hit me that maybe this was the end of this kind of kindness, for a little while, and I just didn’t know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving too was the assistant principal, off to assume the big chair at a special-needs school in Queens. She was a unit teacher when we met her a few years ago, rising soon to assistant principal, and this fall, when Alex gets off the bus in a strange place and it hits him that “school” now means something dramatically different, she will be far away. I’ll miss her and miss them all in the way I didn’t realize until this ceremony, when it feels like I graduated in a way, too.&lt;/p&gt;

The H1N1 pandemic seems to have caused over-reaction in some quarters. A colleague on a training course was greeted with all the enthusiasm one would expect for a leper turning up at a society wedding.
Background: two students and one member of staff at my workplace have swine flu.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient A, a 41-year-old Taiwanese male, suffered from intermittent dysthymia which presented with minor low mood, insomnia, anxiety, chest tightness, back pain, and subjectively mild occupational difficulty... patient A received a single chiropractic spinal manipulation. The chiropractor noticed a minor deformity in the thoracic spine, and a traction technique was administered. He experienced immediate relief from back pain. The following day he reported complete relief of chest tightness, dysthymia, fatigue, and insomnia, with HAM-D, TDQ, and VAS scores of 0 for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, no, I&amp;#39;m fine now, no need to do any more chiropractic on me, I&amp;#39;ll be off then...”&lt;/p&gt;

I've posted a few of the ones you find on the front page so far. This will allow people who don't have Blogger accounts to discuss our ideas. Joe has a dedicated staff there so I expect things will go smoothly. The link takes you to the DC page but don't forget to click on the banner to discuss and/or start threads of your own. To register click on the link in the upper left hand corner. For now we'll also allow comments here at DC for regular Bloggers. This is a test run.

I've been writing about using &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_talk_and_a_lot_of_pictures"&gt;less talk and more visuals&lt;/a&gt; to help Charlie throughout the day, and in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/aac_again_beyond_words"&gt;communicating with him&lt;/a&gt;. It's occurring to me that these visuals and images aren't necessarily how Charlie visualizes things. They're based on what we think might be an accurate, or at least a helpful, representation, of how he takes in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know we could be really really wrong. I was reminded of this recently when I showed Charlie a card for "bike riding" and he said "black car"---I took another look and there was the back end of our car in the photo, to the left of Charlie astride his bike: Same photo, different focuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The June 23rd &lt;a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami_dade/beaches/story/1109426.html"&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/a&gt; reports on an exhibition of artwork created by developmentally disabled adults. There's an interesting twist in how the artists were asked to conceive of their work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn't always easy for someone with autism to communicate -- much less share their innermost feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for Miami Beach artists Stewart and Dena Stewart, helping those who are hard to reach put their emotions on canvas has become a calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, the Stewarts -- co-founders of the Beach-based Center for Folk and Community Art -- have helped a group of developmentally disabled adults create pieces of artwork that reflect their life stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''We asked everybody to write something about what they would like people to know about them,'' said Stewart. ``Then, based on what they've written, we show them how to create their own artwork to go along with the stories.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Charlie has not yet shown himself inclined to represent his thoughts, wishes, ideas in writing. So we keep looking, though I'm still regularly stumped about how to understand what he's thinking.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I was away in Nature – with a real capital N,  and decided to insert an allegory this week instead of a medical subject. The genesis here was a sweeping of the mind and brushing away of cobwebs and detritus called worries and other preoccupations.  The application to this here blog is - methodology. The experience is one of discovery, and of loss, and of bearing the burden of inaction.   &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Some thirty or more years ago a family member became enamored of a new book, The Teachings of don Juan by an unknown author, Carlos Castaneda. But mention the name now and one gets one of two responses: Who is that?  Or, Oh, he is that literary fraud.  But in the late 1960s – 1970s, two social movements had captured imaginations of youth, academics, and much of the intellectual world. They made fantasy seem plausible, and fraud seem believable – psychedelics and postmodernism. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Advocates of psychedelics, most of whom experienced drug-induced alterations,  promoted revolutionary psychological ideas such as drug-induced multiple realities.  The other, postmodernism, was and is the intellectual and philosophical movement originating in academia that similarly views of reality(ies) as possibly multiple.  (The relation, if any, to alternate universes and relativity theories in physics I have to leave to philosophers.) But the ‘60s and ‘70s were decades of several revolutions in social and personal thought – paradigm changes – that brought fairy tales, delusions, and irrationality onto realms of plausibility, from which we are still reeling, and trying to deal with.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Carlos Castaneda wrote eight books (or was it nine?) on the same subject. He related meeting Yaqui Indian seer and healer don Juan Matus at an Arizona bus station and following him through mountains of Mexican Sonora and a series of hallucinatory drug-induced episodes and lessons of life. Later books introduced different main characters (la Catalina, don Gennaro.) At least three books made the NY Times best seller list, and all netted him millions of dollars.  His books sold well even well after his exposure as a fraud and plagiarist.  The psychedelic and postmodern mental states apparently became dominant enough and entrenched enough in modern folklore that believers could not yield their comfort with fantasy. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Then, after mentioning the name Castaneda, state the name Richard de Mille, and chances are neither one questioned will know who that is. Richard de Mille (1924-2009 died April 9. I found this out after starting this post. Richard (most people were on first name basis with him, as was I) was author of two key books on Castaneda, both written in the 1970s: Castaneda’s Journey, the Power and the Allegory, and The don Juan Papers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Through Richard de Milles’s diligence and intellectual power, Carlos Castaneda was exposed as a fraud, and his eight books describing psychedelic rituals and perceptions of Yaqui Indians of Sonora were proved to be mislabeled creative fiction. Castaneda did not deny the charge and never brought legal charges against de Mille. (After the first $1 million, who cares, might even have been good for business?) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I read Castaneda’s The Teachings on a ski trip in 1970 or so.  Fascinating.  Given the 1960s psychedelic experiences, don Juan Matus, the Yaqui teacher, who leaped vast distances and moved immovable objects or whose spirit could transform into an animal, kneaded and molded younger minds into trying to concurrently rationalize, imagine, and dream single experiences in differing forms. Castaneda described standard interpretations of reality as “ordinary reality” and a others as a “special reality.”  Another of his book titles was “A Separate Reality.” &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The process of reading and following Castaneda’s odyssey required toying with mind-bending ideas.  One such was human perception itself being faulty in that it disallowed more than one form of reality at a time.   If this does not make sense to the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century mind, it didn’t make sense to this 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century mind then, either, although not for lack of trying. .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I read the first Castaneda books, and was left in a limbo between, possibility and improbability and the author’s delusional thinking or drug-induced hallucinations. The confusion was aided by the appendix of the first book, The Teachings of don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge, which was the ostensibly real summary of Castaneda’s field work with don Juan for which he was awarded his PhD in anthropology at UCLA. The method used was ethnomethodology, in which the investigator is not a distant observer of a society’s social behavior, but an active participant in it. The investigation becomes experiential.  And, in the process, scientific method becomes something other than science. But that was the new standard of the time.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Complementing such neo-ideation, was/is the takeover of academic departments and faculty by postmodernism, the neo-philosophy that formalizes varying perceptions and formulations of reality, going so far in some views to proclaim that language creates reality. It was and is an academic world where almost anything is possible, and there are no ground rules for determining the borders. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Castaneda’s PhD thesis had a ring of fantasy. Castaneda could not produce his original field notes – essential in supporting a PhD thesis – claiming that they were destroyed in a flooded basement of his Westwood residence. (Floods in Westwood?)  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I began heated discussions about the writings because I became more and more skeptical and found what I thought were some errors of timing and of psychedelic plant use (no, I never smoked, inhaled, ingested, etc.)  But just because of an error or two I could not dismiss the rest of it – a PhD, after all.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;At about that time I was introduced to skeptical thinking through a local community college symposium at which several CSICOP members from Buffalo, NY spoke – and by an ensuing subscription to Skeptical Inquirer.  It was in an early SI issue that I read a review of de Mille’s book or books, which I promptly bought and spent weeks devouring.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The first book, Castaneda’s Journey, is itself an allegory as the title states.  Written as a partial imitation of Castaneda, de Mille introduces an imagined - or maybe not - meeting of himself and Castaneda, and an ensuing series of real-or-not meetings and dialogues in which de Mille is the student-seeker, and Carlos the mysterious shadow appearing-disappearing Teacher.  This short work is itself a masterwork of layered, allegorical story-telling.  This book is still in print, and I highly recommend it. Like good music or fine wine, enjoy the literary pleasure. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;But Richard’s other major works were as different as phyla. The don Juan Papers traces Castaneda’s academic works in cultural anthropology at UCLA, through comments from his advisers, others who had input into the granting of the degree, and outside observers.  The conclusion of most: the thesis was a work of fiction, perhaps based in some personal experiences, but mostly in works of others, knowledge of other cultural rituals and myths, synthesized into a nearly plausible epic analysis of the occult mysteries of native American tribes. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Perhaps most fascinating for us types is the inability of some academics to discard their beliefs, or to resolve their cognitive dissonance in some rational way…they continued to rationalize the episode of being taken in as good illustrative methodology, containing kernels of truth, and other face-saving imaginings. Academia. Peer review. Not always what we would like them to be. Humans run them. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; The department chairman retains his silence in the matter, as embarrassing as it is. To complement the work is a series of analyses and commentaries by other prominent social anthropologists. It is at times heavy going through anthro-sociology jargon and working concepts. Four hundred pages of it, fortunately and mercifully punctuated at crucial points by de Mille’s interpretation, and identifying of contradictions. Indexed and notated in detail, this is the work of an accomplished academician researcher.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;In both works, I marveled at de Mille’s attention to detail, to the lengths of comparing time intervals and dates of the same events in several books. It took a great memory and talent to see the contradictions, so often obscure and separated in place and context. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I asked Richard to contribute an article on his methods to Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, which he did.  [De Mille R, How I Learned Not to Believe Carlos Castaneda. Sci Rev Altern Med 1999; 3(2):11-14.] He has a short section devoted to some of this in each book as well. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Richard’s method derived directly from his academic career, about which I had forgotten. He had both MA and PhD in psychology, spent brief times at USC and UC Santa Barbara faculties, and more time as an industrial and career psychologist, and had done considerable research in various related fields. He said to the effect of, “I merely strolled over to the UCSB library and applied what I had learned.”  He became an authority on social anthropology and ethnography – and a professional skeptic researcher along the way. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;I later read his autobiographical and biographical portraits of himself and his prominent mother, (My Secret Mother, Lorna Moon.) a script writer in Hollywood, who bore him out of wedlock to Cecil B. de Mille’s brother, William. Sin and secrecy were the behavior modes at the time, not public confessions or live-in arrangements, so Cecil B. raised Richard as his son, not telling him his real father was Cecil’s brother until William’s death, when Richard was in his thirties.  Interestingly (to me) is that for part of his childhood he lived on the same L.A. street as my grandmother. We might have crossed “paths.” Perhaps not.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The heart of this tale is that Richard de Mille, himself the guiltless player of a real life mirage, was the key who exposed the largest literary and academic fraud in history, using techniques of research, objective methodology, intelligence, and diligence.  Studying his methods I was able to construct techniques for teaching that I used years later, and that many other skeptics have developed as well. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Richard de Mille was a mild, retiring giant intellect with (insert superlative) writing talent. He was generous with time and a most gracious human being.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;The lament:  I wanted to write a re-review of one or both of Richard’s Castaneda books, but did not get around to it. I always wanted to visit him in Santa Barbara where he lived, but delayed in that also. A lesson re-learned all too frequently.     &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear PZ,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The work of my lab has been subject to questions and harsh criticisms, some reasonable, some not.  The scientific ones are dealt with in a new book &lt;i&gt;On The Origin Of Form, Evolution by Self-Organization, an alternative to the natural selection paradigm&lt;/i&gt;, This is a substantially expanded presentation of the self-organization model previously published. 
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I welcome your assessment. If you are convinced now of its plausibility, as are many others, I solicit your participation in the dissemination of the idea for further investigation. A copy is on its way.  Meanwhile, please see  www.ontheoriginofform.com&lt;br&gt;
SP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh. Pivar, you may recall, is the fellow who tried to &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/so-sue-me.html"&gt;sue me for FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, all over my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/lifecode_from_egg_to_embryo_by.php"&gt;review of his book, &lt;i&gt;Lifecode&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That tends to damp my enthusiasm for any more books from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not reply. He sent me an update a few days later, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear PZ,
   
The new book presents a model of self organization amplified well beyond that shown previously, addressing, among many other issues, the reasons that the idealized models are inconsistent with parts of observed embryology. Many prominent scientists have now accepted the plausibility of the model.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you plan to comment publicly kindly view this new material. You will probably find the premise plausible
as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
see www.ontheoriginofform.com  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Stuart  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plausible? It must have undergone significant revision, then, since in its earlier incarnation, it was best described as surreal and absurd. Then the book arrives in my mailbox; you can even &lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556438869/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;preorder it on Amazon now&lt;/a&gt;, and just look at the encomiums published on the cover!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stuart Pivar's book, On the Origin of Form, contains ideas that deserve full scientific scrutiny, especially in light of the turmoil roiling evolutionary biology at present. Pivar is presenting, in a series of brilliantly rendered graphical diagrams that show his interpretation of how modifications of a torus shape can generate a vast panoply of biotic form, a new theory of morphogenesis.... This is a seismic event for science. Conventional evolutionary biologists are right to be very worried about this, because it has the potential to trigger the complete collapse of Modern Synthesis Biology."&lt;br&gt;

The assumption that is made is that some chemical or brain anomaly causes "insistence on sameness."  In other words, that "insistence on sameness" is a maladaptive behavior that may be correctable.  The casual qualitative research that happens in one's head simply from communicating with hundreds of people who share the same experience (i.e. are all on the spectrum) makes me question this assumption, at least for some of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of many of us is not that "insistence on sameness" jumps out unbidden and unwanted and makes our lives hard, but that "insistence on sameness" is actually a way of adapting to a confusing and chaotic environment, cueing into volitional action, or compensating for "executive function" difficulties.  Routines for some of us are the opposite of unbidden, unwanted, or difficulty-making: they are deliberate, desired, and adaptive.  (Which may explain in turn why some of us become unable to function well, or become extremely upset, when our routines are broken.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal stories are not, in themselves, science.  They do not "prove" anything other than that a particular person has had a specific experience.  However, the starting assumptions or hypothesis that are used in science frequently do come from observation, including observation of people's first hand accounts of their experiences.  If you hear enough autistic adults talking, typing, signing, drawing about how frustrated they are about not being able to get quality health care, then you may develop a more testable hypothesis or assumption for use in a study, like "autistic adults often do not receive quality health care."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading about these studies that assume autistic behavior is maladaptive, I always wonder if the investigators have spent much time asking autistic people about our experiences or why we may have the behavior they are interested in studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding our personal reasons for doing things is really important as it filters down to a practical day-to-day level because a therapy or medication that eliminates or suppresses an adaptive behavior could potentially be harmful, not beneficial, to a person (any person!) in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245958563372"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13953">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/487bd583f418e4ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="fred shapiro"/><category term="quote"/><title type="html">Quotes Uncovered: Pork and Patriotism</title><published>2009-06-25T19:26:20Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T19:26:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/quotes-uncovered-pork-and-patriotism/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">A while back, I invited readers to submit quotations for which they wanted me to try to trace the origins, using &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yale-Book-Quotations-Fred-Shapiro/dp/0300107986"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yale Book of Quotations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and more recent research by me.

Oh, I don’t fret over it for long, and I’ve never really come to a conclusion about it, but sometimes in moments of loneliness or after a relationship ends, I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if in fact I am hard to love, it’s because of the man I have become. Perhaps my personality, my attitude, and my many vices and odd peccadillos are enough to turn people away. Perhaps the culmination of those many things is what makes it hard to love me. Me, the grown man version of Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But apparently it is hard to love some &lt;em&gt;babies &lt;/em&gt;for much simpler reasons. According to &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1906642,00.html?cnn=yes"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, a new study released by Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital and published in the online journal &lt;em&gt;PloS One&lt;/em&gt; suggests that uglier babies are harder to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, men and women were randomly shown pictures of 50 healthy and attractive babies and 30 others with distinct facial irregularities. Each picture remained on the screen for four seconds, but the viewer could shorten that time by clicking one key or prolong it by clicking another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the men in the study were less likely to click off photos of unattractive babies, but clicked quite a bit to hold on to the images of the pretty ones. Women, conversely, left the keyboard alone when they were looking at pretty babies, but hurried away from the less attractive ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So . . . Do you see any flaws in the study? If so, how would you improve on it? Would you even bother? Is an ugly baby really harder to love? Are you now trying to recall the nature of your early relationship with your mother?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Good news, we're getting it back. The &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.savebritishscience.org.uk/"&gt;Campaign for Science &amp;amp; Engineering&lt;/a&gt; had this to say:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Campaign for Science &amp;amp; Engineering (CaSE) warmly welcomed the House of Commons&amp;#39; decision to establish the Science and Technology Committee. CaSE lobbied for it to be established following the merger of DIUS and BIS. In today&amp;#39;s debate &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/philwillismp"&gt;Phil Willis MP&lt;/a&gt; commended CaSE's efforts to bring back the Science and Technology Committee.&lt;br&gt;
Commenting Nick Dusic, CaSE's Director, said:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is great news that the Science and Technology Committee will be able to investigate science and engineering issues that cut right across government, including the science budget.&lt;br&gt;
Today's decision showed that there is strong support for proper scrutiny of science and engineering within Parliament. It is critical that future changes to government do not result in the abolition of the Science and Technology Committee. Today's decision corrects the mistake made in 2007 of abolishing the Committee.&lt;br&gt;
I look forward to working with the Science and Technology Committee in scrutinising the Government's science policies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Committee will be able to conduct wide-ranging inquiries, covering the full scope of science policy and related matters including the science budget. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/06/science_watchdog_returns_to_we.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245956893320"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13961">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fdba86f1a260263b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="employment"/><category term="wages"/><title type="html">Trading Overtime</title><published>2009-06-25T17:22:01Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T17:22:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/trading-overtime/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">The latest &lt;em&gt;Economist&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/businessfinance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13871834"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; about an Italian firm whose workers negotiated a deal during the recession for time off with no pay cut in exchange for promises to work overtime without extra pay when the firm's demand recovers.</summary><author><name>By Daniel Hamermesh</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245956494840"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/send_grrlscientist_to_antarcti.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55d326f8dd5954cd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><title type="html">Send GrrlScientist to Antarctica!</title><published>2009-06-25T19:26:09Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T19:26:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/B4silXXPtUI/send_grrlscientist_to_antarcti.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really not being mean and trying to banish a fellow science blogger to some barren, frigid desolation — hey, that&amp;#39;s where I live! — but she&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2009/06/the_gift_of_an_adventure_of_a.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;volunteering&lt;/i&gt; to leave New York for a month to live in Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked one of my SciBlings and friends, Scicurious of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/" title=""&gt;Neurotopia&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="SciCurious pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/SciCurious%20pic.jpg" width="235" height="267" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My name is Scicurious (please, call my Sci), and I'm a grad student studying Pharmacology at a Southeastern University of Good Reputation.  Every once in a while, I think I see the end of the tunnel, but it turns out I was fooling myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mad Scientist.  MWAH-HA-HA-HA.  Honestly, it's amazing how many of us didn't know what to do with ourselves after college, and now it's amazing how many of us don't know what to do with ourselves after grad school.  I guess I better begin thinking of that right about now, huh...it will definitely involve world domination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grad student.  It's a lot less glamorous than it sounds.  I don't suffer at all from paparazzi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really love learning in a wide variety, and sharing ideas with a large number of people.  I love that, since beginning to read science blogs, I've found out so much more about my field, and expanded my knowledge base in other fields.  I think it's the spread of knowledge to both other scientists and lay people that interests me the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my real work?  It doesn't.  I blog on my own time, and never on my Real Work.  However, you can find me on Twitter, and I hear there's a Facebook group as well.  I love blogging and sharing information and educating, but work and blogging need to stay separate for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But indirectly, there's been a massive effect of blogging on my work.  My knowledge of other areas has increased exponentially, and now it seems that the instant something big comes out in my field, I know.  So it's been a positive influence, over all.  And I've made some awesome friends and contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny, that.  See, I went to this coffee shop one day and met this guy Coturnix.  I hear you know him...  Someone had told me that he could help me break into the world of science writing.  And he told me to start a science blog.  So I spent the next day or so checking out blogs, and thinking "hey!  This is pretty sweet!"  And thus, Scicurious was born. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorites?  I hate playing favorites.  I have to say I LOVE "&lt;a href="http://whatis-wrong-withyou.blogspot.com" title=""&gt;What the hell is wrong with you, I'm mean, damn&lt;/a&gt;" because the title kills me.  I go there when I'm feeling down just to read the title and laugh.  Otherwise, I've got a LOT of blogs I read every day.  Everyone has their good and bad days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You led a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/History_of_Science/" title=""&gt;session about History of Science&lt;/a&gt; at the conference - how did that go and what did you learn from it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I've never led a session on ANYTHING before, so I guess it went well for my first time!  It was great to have gg and Laelaps there with me, I love those guys.  Gg in particular knows SO much about the history of science, and has so much to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we started some good discussions.  One question that really interested me was "why does this MATTER?!"  I was kind of shocked, because I personally love history, and so it never really occurred to me that people wouldn't think it mattered.  But it did make me think about why people should blog about the history of science. After all, a lot of times it's not easy to do, looking up and explaining old techniques.  But I think we were able to show a little of WHY the history of science is important.  I personally think that the history of science is necessary to explain a great deal of what goes on the modern biosciences, a lot of which can be really complicated if you don't have some idea of the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It seems that blog posts on three topics - Historical Science, Weird Science, and Science of Sex - draw a lot of interest from your readers. But as you know, most of currently done science is not that sexy - how do you balance this for your audience?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALL well-done, elegant science is sexy science!  I also like to explain a lot of the more complicated topics, and try to make science understandable to a non-scientist audience.  I try to convey how excited I was when I first learned about the topics, and I hope that gets other people excited about some of the "less-sexy" science as well, when it is conveyed by people who are passionate and who can explain how the heavy stuff relates to every day life. Sure, some science is funny and weird, and some of it's not, but all of it is important and helps us to understand our bodies and the world that we live in.  New knowledge is always pretty exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are the guest editor of the Open Laboratory 2009 anthology - any thoughts about it yet?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agreed to do what now?  Aiieeeeeeee!!!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I just hope I can do as well as the previous years have done.  We've already got boatloads of submissions coming in, many of which look like good contenders.  I'm just hoping I turn out something awesome and that I don't go insane doing it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I will say that I think there's a lot to be said for meeting bloggers in person.  When they are a disembodied series of words, it is very easy to misinterpret.  There is no tone of voice on the internet  And also, you can build up pictures in your head of these blogging gods, and in reality, we're all just people.  So it was very cool to meet some of the people I've been communicating with for ages, and see what they're really like.  Now sometimes I can even hear them talking when I read them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also really impressed with the sessions on anonymity and women and minorities in science.  Even though I AM a woman in science, it was something that I had never really thought about before.  I have since become a lot more aware of these issues, and I've been reading up a lot on them as well.  I hope that conversations about women and minority issues at conferences continue, I think there's a lot left to be discussed, and there are ALWAYS more people to educate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline09_interview_with_2.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/fwtkraHiyt8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245955305273"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1540">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/95faf5f9b1050edd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="passives"/><title type="html">Insufficient agency!</title><published>2009-06-25T18:10:15Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T18:10:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1540" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On her blog, Elizabeth Daingerfield Zwicky &lt;a href="http://www.otoh.org"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; an encounter between her daughter Opal (now 5) and the passive voice:&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll be the moderator for the Mythbusters panel at &lt;a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/"&gt;Comic Con&lt;/a&gt; this year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squeeee!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comic Con is a HUGE scifi/fantasy/comic/gaming/pop culture convention held every year in San Diego. I’ve always wanted to go, and last year, &lt;del&gt;the Hive Overmind&lt;/del&gt; Discover Magazine sent me there to be on a panel about science in science fiction (I have several blog posts about it; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/24/comic-con-day-1-doctor-who-panel/"&gt;start here&lt;/a&gt; and click through to the next ones, in particular &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/30/comic-con-my-panel-on-science-and-scifi/"&gt;this one with a video of our panel&lt;/a&gt;). They’re sending me again this year (and I’ll have more about that a little later), and I’m &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; excited to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then last week I get a call from My Close Personal Friend Adam Savage™, asking me if I’d like to moderate their panel! I said yes immediately (and then cleared it with the magazine; maybe I did that a little backwards), because despite all indications I’m not a complete idiot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2716534115/sizes/l/in/set-72157606342123292/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2716534115_c3fa52a230_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/donttrythis"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; will be on the panel, as well as Jamie Hyneman, Tory Belleci, and &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/GrantImahara"&gt;Grant Imahara&lt;/a&gt;. Kari can’t attend, as by then she’ll be a brand new mommy. That’s wonderful for her, of course, though a bit of a bummer for us. Adam and Jamie were on a panel at CC last year (that’s the picture shown here) and it was a riot. This year, the room is twice as big, too. Discovery Channel has more info &lt;a href="http://press.discovery.com"&gt;on their press release&lt;/a&gt; (PDF; click that link, select your location and &amp;quot;Discovery Channel&amp;quot; for network, then click the link on the right labeled &amp;quot;Mythbusters Comic Con panelists&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the panel we’ll be talking about the new season, what they have planned for the next, and how &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/08/27/mythbustin-the-moon-hoax-part-v-the-review/"&gt;their Moon Hoax testing episode&lt;/a&gt; would have been an unwatchable disaster without my science advice. I’ll really try to come up with some unusual questions for them, but I could use some help from you, me droogs. If you’ve got a good question for the ‘busters, put it in the comments below… and if I use it I’ll give you a shout-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And may I just say once again: squeee!&lt;/p&gt;

Every situation is unique, and it’s usually far more complex then just calmly explaining to the believer why they are out of their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many situations, it is possible to have a positive influence on someone who believes a con. It’s doubtful that you’ll be able to convince them in one conversation, but it’s very likely that you can give them the tools they need to eventually come to a more rational conclusion. You can encourage them to seek out the facts, teach them about common logical fallacies, or just demonstrate that it’s okay to doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some situations, though, deal with the so-called True Believer. The TB (not to be confused with tuberculosis—we’ve developed a vaccine for that) is well-known in the skeptical community as an unmovable brick wall of irrationality, someone best left alone to their delusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree that there are a good deal of hard cases out there, and probably even a good deal of people who will never change their minds about anything, I don’t think it’s healthy or correct to be pessimistic about the TB’s situation. For example, I’ve received lots of messages from former True Believers, talking about their journey into skepticism via blogs, podcasts, books, friends, and a good deal of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another reason why we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss True Believers: we may not be able to change their minds, but we may still be able to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred to me after reading &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124520056162621509.html"&gt;this Wall Street Journal article&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="http://consumerist.com/5295329/how-to-protect-susceptible-relatives-from-scams"&gt;Consumerist&lt;/a&gt;) about a very specific type of True Believer: the mentally incapacitated relative. These are mostly older parents and grandparents who have lost the batteries to their bullshit detectors, and so they fall for otherwise obvious scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article gives some extreme examples and goes into ways that you can help your loved ones, even when they refuse to believe they’re being conned. Some of their tips include putting your loved one’s phone number on the Do Not Call list, giving them a script to use when answering the phone, or filling their time with other activities. One tip is even helpful to those of us who are already skeptics: “Gather scam mail in an envelop marked ‘Forward to Post Master: suspected mail fraud’ and put it in your mailbox. No postage is necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering if any of our readers have elderly or mentally handicapped loved ones who fall for scams. If so, have you taken any steps to protect them? Are you on the look-out for scammers who may target them? Do you tell your grandparents about scams in the hopes that they’ll remember?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245953679854"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/06/25/women-in-space-we-um-salute-you/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/02524f7e579c5abe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Food and Drink"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="space shuttle cake"/><title type="html">Women in Space — We …um… salute you</title><published>2009-06-25T17:21:37Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T17:21:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/06/25/women-in-space-we-um-salute-you/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a diehard baker of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/04/30/the-physics-of-chocolate/"&gt;extreme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/01/07/drive-by-posting/"&gt;cakes&lt;/a&gt;, I understand the difficulty in complex cake construction.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, you're right. People shout My Name when they have sex, because I am all one can think of when they're orgasmic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is all wrong, a myth that another patriarchal myth has promoted to his advantage. I have carried out extensive empirical research in this area for approximately 35 years, and not once have I encountered a woman who shouted out any deity's name at any time during sex. However, I have discovered one consistent phenomenon, a remarkably robust pattern of behavior that I've seen over and over again, in almost ten thousand encounters. There is one name that godless women frequently evoke at the height of passion.&lt;/p&gt;

I admit that I was wrong. I thought that the &lt;a href="http://ling.ed.ac.uk/grammar/passives.html"&gt;grammatical term&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=passive+voice"&gt;&lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had developed a spectrum of everyday meanings like "vague about agency", "listless writing, lacking in vigor", and "failure to take sides in a conflict". But I've now reluctantly concluded that for some members of the chattering classes, it now means nothing at all, except maybe "I dislike this person".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence that drove me over the edge? Hank Stuever and Wil Haygood, "&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/24/AR2009062403581.html"&gt;Parsing The Book Of Mark&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, 6/25/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Wow. Was that a press conference or was &lt;em&gt;that a press conference?&lt;/em&gt; That genteel lilt of hubris, sorrow, guilt! But other than a very slow, meandering build to &lt;em&gt;I just needed a little strange,&lt;/em&gt; what did it all mean? What language was South Carolina's Republican governor speaking yesterday as he forlornly told the world of his travels and travails, of how sorry he is to his wife, to his sons, to his staff, to "the Tom Davises of the world" (not the Virginia one, all the other ones)? Is it a new Pat Conroy novel? Is it a megachurch sermon? Is it the language of couples therapy? The metaphysics of Oprah? Shakespeare? The psychobabble of cheating husbands? (&lt;strong&gt;Note all the passive constructions, the avoidance of first person.&lt;/strong&gt;) &lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Before we get to the "passive constructions" part of "parsing the book of Mark", let's look at that "avoidance of first person". The 2,747 words of the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/us/24text-sanford.html?pagewanted=print"&gt;NYT transcript&lt;/a&gt; of Gov. Sanford's remarks include 190 first-person singular pronouns, for a rate of 6.9%, which seems pretty respectable even for a confession. In comparison, Barack Obama was &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1495"&gt;slammed by another WaPo writer, George Will&lt;/a&gt;, for being &amp;quot;inordinately fond of the first-person singular pronoun&amp;quot; in his GM take-over speech, which contained 1.7% of the same words.  This would be a case of damned if you do (&amp;quot;inordinately fond of the first person&amp;quot;) and damned if you don&amp;#39;t (&amp;quot;avoidance of first person&amp;quot;) — except that at the Post these days, you&amp;#39;re apparently damned for doing if you don&amp;#39;t, and damned for not doing if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my topic today is &amp;quot;all the passive constructions&amp;quot;. In the section of Gov. Sanford&amp;#39;s press conference before the question period, I count 180 tensed verbs, of which I can find only four instances of grammatical passive voice, plus one or two more adjectival passives — and none of these are in the part of the statement where he describes his affair, or are connected to anything that seems remotely like psychobabble, of cheating husbands or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In three of the genuine passives, the unnamed but implied agent is &lt;em&gt;the media&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;… what I have found in this job is that one desperately needs a break from the bubble wherein every word, every moment &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;is recorded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;… it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;was always viewed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as, "You're doing this to climb some further political office." It &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;was always based&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on that idea, that I genuinely believed that that action would be bad for the taxpayers …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the last one, the unnamed but implied agent is God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;… if you were to look at God&amp;#39;s laws, they&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;'re in every instance designed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to protect people from themselves …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yes, I know that I should count up all the infinitives and participles as well, but life is too short. Please feel free to contribute your labor to the cause, if you like to count things and have some spare time — for now, I&amp;#39;ll simply assert in a qualitative way that looking at infinitives and participles doesn&amp;#39;t change the picture in a material way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, what about the currently popular interpretation of "passive voice" (or in this case "passive constructions") as meaning something like "vague about agency"? For example, when Bernie Madoff said that "I believed it [his Ponzi scheme] would end soon", Nancy Franklin in the New Yorker &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1242"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[H]e betrayed no sense of how absurd it was to use the passive voice in regard to his scheme, as if it were a spell of bad weather that had descended on him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the weird thing is, Gov. Sanford emphasized his own responsibility in first person active sentences, over and over again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;And so the bottom line is this: I have been unfaithful to my wife. I developed a relationship with a — what started out as a dear, dear friend from Argentina. It began very innocently, as I suspect many of these things do, in just a casual e-mail back and forth, in advice on one&amp;#39;s life there and advice here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;But here recently over this last year, it developed into something much more than that. And as a consequence, I hurt her. I hurt you all. I hurt my wife. I hurt my boys. I hurt friends like Tom Davis. I hurt a lot of different folks. And all I can say is that I apologize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, he describes the progression of the affair in two impersonal sentences: &amp;quot;It began very innocently … But … it developed into something much more&amp;quot;. On the other hand, these two sentences are surrounded by no fewer than nine sentences with first-person singular subjects confessing agency: &amp;quot;I have been unfaithful … I developed a relationship … I  hurt her. I hurt you all. I hurt my wife. I hurt my boys. I hurt friends …  I hurt a lot of … folks. … I apologize.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Sanford to describe his affair as something he alone did would have been offensively narcissistic, it seems to me — it takes two, as they say, to tango.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what in the world did Stuever and Haygood mean by all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to think badly of prominent members of the press corps — &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Stuever"&gt;Hank Stuever&lt;/a&gt; is said to be "a regular contributor to the Style section in the Washington Post" and "a two-time finalist for the Pulitzer Prize". But my guess is that these pundits were simply, in the technical sense of the term, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001903.html"&gt;bullshitting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. More precisely, they were spinning out associative clichés, with no concern for any particular connection to facts.  Their thought process was apparently something like this: Public figures stereotypically avoid taking responsibility, which translates linguistically into passive (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1246"&gt;"mistakes were made"&lt;/a&gt;) and impersonal third-person (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1530"&gt;"things happen"&lt;/a&gt;) constructions; Mark Sanford is a public figure; His statement must therefore have avoided the first person and been full of passive constructions. Q.E.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this kind of writing, I guess, cleverness is everything and facts are not relevant at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245945878918"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_yes_jobs_did.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b290904f6398bbe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">What's wrong with Steve Jobs: Yes, Jobs did have a liver transplant, but was it for metastatic insulinoma?</title><published>2009-06-25T16:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T16:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/b4h5TzLhMZk/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_yes_jobs_did.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_revisited.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the reason for Apple CEO Steve Job's five month medical leave of absence from Apple is that he needed a liver transplant, which, according to the story, he underwent a couple of months ago in Memphis. In my discussion, I assumed, for the most part, the most likely clinical scenario, namely that Steve Jobs' insulinoma had metastasized to his liver and that the liver transplant had been done for that indication, but, as some pointed out, it was possible that Jobs had somehow fried his liver without his tumor having metastasized. Unlikely, true, but possible. Unfortunately, news coming out over the last couple of days, while confirming that Jobs did indeed undergo a liver transplant, only shed a little more light on what happened and still leave a lot of questions. For instance, late Tuesday Methodist University Hospital in Memphis &lt;a href="http://www.methodisthealth.org/methodist/About+Us/Newsroom/News/Steve+Jobs+Receives+Liver+Transplant"&gt;issued a press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.methodisthealth.org/methodist/Healthcare+Services/Areas+of+Excellence/Transplant+Institute/Meet+The+Care+Team/Surgical+Staff/Eason%2CJames"&gt;James D. Eason, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, program director at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute, chief of transplantation and professor of surgery at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center confirmed today, with the patient's permission, that Steve Jobs received a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in partnership with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. 

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jobs underwent a complete transplant evaluation and was listed for transplantation for an approved indication in accordance with the Transplant Institute policies and United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He received a liver transplant because he was the patient with the highest MELD score (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) of his blood type and, therefore, the sickest patient on the waiting list at the time a donor organ became available. Mr. Jobs is now recovering well and has an excellent prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this press release leaves as many questions unanswered as it answers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_yes_jobs_did.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/whats_wrong_with_steve_jobs_yes_jobs_did.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/b4h5TzLhMZk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245945517566"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6177329154406007609">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca201a8f93ab92d1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Science Education" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Blogging about Scientific Meetings</title><published>2009-06-25T15:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T15:46:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/06/blogging-about-scientific-meetings.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The question is whether it is legitimate for bloggers to report on what goes on at scientific conferences and meetings.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are agreed-upon definitions of the word hero, then Joe Albietz must fit many of them. This good-natured, upbeat, intelligent, and skeptical man is a pediatrician who gets up every morning so that he can help — and succeed — in saving the lives of children. I’m proud he’s my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe’s written &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/609-help-re-establish-the-herd-immunity-of-nevada.html"&gt;a concise and informative article about the JREF’s vaccine drive in Las Vegas for The Amaz!ng Meeting 7&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccinations rates in Vegas were very low due to poverty and a transient population, and their herd immunity to diseases like measles and whooping cough is in serious trouble. Joe came up with the idea of getting donations from the skeptic community to support vaccinations in Vegas, and spearheaded the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $25 you can support a child to get a full series of vaccinations. You don’t have to attend &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM 7&lt;/a&gt; or do anything else; just send $25 and a child in Vegas will get protected against a raft of potentially life-threatening diseases. And while those children are getting their vaccinations, we will be at TAM 7 talking about how to fight people like &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/19/are-antivaxxers-liable-for-preventable-deaths/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/26/the-australian-antivax-movement-takes-its-toll/"&gt;Meryl Dorey&lt;/a&gt;, and all the others who are so vocal in making sure that diseases we once stamped out come back with a vengeance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that vaccinations don’t cause autism, and we know they have wiped out smallpox, and put such scourges as polio on the endangered list. Help us, so that we can help others.  &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/609-help-re-establish-the-herd-immunity-of-nevada.html"&gt;Go read Joe’s article&lt;/a&gt; and see how you can easily support this effort.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245943897850"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13965">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e1c062032dd9321</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="naming"/><category term="transportation"/><title type="html">The "Bill Golden Gates Bridge"?</title><published>2009-06-25T14:40:55Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T14:40:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/the-bill-golden-gates-bridge/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">In case you missed it, take a look at this plan for the cash-strapped New York MTA to sell off &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/nyregion/24naming.html"&gt;naming rights to subway stations&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Swedish island-province Öland's second-largest silver hoard ever was &lt;a href="http://www.barometern.se/nyheter/oland/skatt-gravdes-fram-i-majsfalt(1394185).gm"&gt;found recently&lt;/a&gt;. Dating from the 11th century and consisting mainly of about 1000 German and English coins, it also has some Islamic ones, one from Sigtuna and even one from India, a very rare occurrence. Some hack silver as well, and a piece of gold rod unless I'm mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The droning noise at the start and end of the above newsreel is a Bronze Age trumpet that had been lying in a bog for almost 2000 years at the time when the hoard was buried and would spend almost another 1000 years there before it was unearthed. Nice try, TV guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theories have ranged from the most likley…a meteor or comet…all the way to the other side of the spectrum. Regarding this event, a Dr. Ray Stantz was overheard to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have been a participant in the biggest interdimensional cross-rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you familiar with the Tunguska Event?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1908,  an air burst occurred near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Russia. Whatever it was, the explosion was equal to about 1000 Hiroshima bombs.  It was not a good day to be a tree when this happened. More than 80 million of them were knocked down over an area of 2150 square km. Hundreds of miles away, windows were broken and people were &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event"&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; knocked off their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:335px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tizona.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/tunguskaartdavis-jpg.jpeg" alt="Artists Conception of event" width="325" height="384"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artist&amp;#39;s Conception of event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the IDR theory (Inter-Dimensional Rip) as it was called, was never taken seriously (except by movie screen writers). The comet or asteroid theories however went back and forth as one seemed more plausible than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems that the comet theory may be the real winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090624152941.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for all the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research describes how the exhaust from the shuttle was tracked through the atmosphere. This was similar to Tunguska because if it was caused by a comet, then it too would have injected a lot of water vapor into the atmosphere at very high altitudes. When this happens, noctilucent clouds can be formed that are so high they reflect sunlight to the night-side of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These clouds (or at least very bright nights) were reported in 1908. Recent studies have shown that this water vapor from the shuttle also creates noctilucent clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the bottom-line of the new research but check out the link above to read about the interesting details.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245937769257"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13927">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8fc133b305ee2c89</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="internet madness"/><title type="html">LoJack for iPhones</title><published>2009-06-25T13:39:59Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T13:39:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/lojack-for-iphones/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">A while back we wrote about &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/lojack-for-laptops-the-free-version/"&gt;Adeona&lt;/a&gt;, a free tracking program that could help police locate and recover a stolen laptop.

&lt;p&gt;It is only recently that the University of Westminster suspended entry to degrees in homeopathy and remedial massage and neuromuscular therapy.  Luckily for science, they have a new Dean who knows bullshit when she sees it.  I suspect than she has been instrumental in starting to restore Westminster’s reputation.  The job isn’t finished yet though.  According to &lt;a href="http://search.ucas.com/cgi-bin/hsrun/search/search/StateId/DznxSo5l-E-1c2C8bLXFFVBCTGQQA-3kKP/HAHTpage/search.HsKeywordSearch.whereNext?query=5382&amp;amp;word=COMPLEMENTARY+MEDICINE"&gt;the UCAS site&lt;/a&gt; Westminster still offers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the possible exception of herbal medicine, which &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be taught scientifically. all the rest is as delusional as homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumour has it that Naturopathy may be next for the chop, so it seems appropriate to help the dean by showing a bit more of what the hapless students get taught.  Remember that, according to Westminster, this is a bachelor of &lt;em&gt;science &lt;/em&gt;degree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychotherapeutic Approaches in Naturopathy 3CMW606&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This module is a core subject for BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Naturopathy and option for BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Complementary Therapies; BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Therapeutic Bodywork; Graduate Diploma in Therapeutic Bodywork.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lectures 3 – 5 of this course are about the Theory and Application of EmoTrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMOTRANCE?  No I had never heard of it either. But it takes only two minutes with Google to discover that it yet another product of the enormous navel-gazing self-help industry. A new variant is born almost every day, and no doubt they make buckets of money for their inventors.  You can download a primer from &lt;a href="http://emotrance.com/"&gt;http://emotrance.com/&lt;/a&gt;. The web site announces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“EmoTrance REAL energy healing for the 21st Century”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three quotations from the primer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I thought of the lady in the supermarket whose husband had died, and I spend the following time sending her my best wishes, and my best space time quantum healing efforts for her void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter how “bad”; something is or how old, it is ONLY AN ENERGY and energy can be moved with consciousness in quantum time, easily, and just for the asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is EmoTrance a Science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Yes! But only if you can accept that all living creatures have an energetic/emotional system. Once you make that leap then EmoTrance is completely logical and just makes sense. Like all great discoveries, EmoTrance is simple, natural and you might find you have always been aware of these processes subconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back to Westminster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few slides about EmoTrance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day2-s2-vs.jpg" alt="day 2 slide 2"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day2-s3-vs.jpg" alt="day 2 slide 3"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day2-s13-vs.jpg" alt="day 2 slide 13"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/EmoTrance-Day3-s9-vs.jpg" alt="day 3 slide 9"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is pure vitalistic psycho-babble.  The usual undefined use of impressive sounding words like “energy” and “quantum” with no defined meaning. Just preposterous made-up gobbledygook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting to EmoTrance, the course Psychotherapeutic Approaches in Naturopathy (3CMW606) had a lecture on Flower Essences.  The evidence says, not surprisingly, that the effects of flower essences is not distinguishable from placebo “The hypothesis that flower remedies are associated with effects beyond a placebo response is not supported by data from rigorous clinical trials.” (See Ernst Wien. Klin. Wochenschr. 2002 114(23-24):963-6).  Here are two of the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Flower-essences-lecture1-s19-s.jpg" alt="slide 19" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Flower-essences-lecture1-s4-s.jpg" alt="slide 4" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last slide departs from the simply silly  to the totally mad.  Dowsing?  Kinesiology? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pendulums&lt;/strong&gt; I’m told from more than one source that the use of pendulums is not uncommon. both in teaching and by students in the Westminster University polyclinic  Apparently they provide an excellent way to choose a ‘remedy’ or make a diagnosis (well, I expect they are as good as the alternatives). If in doubt, guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course pendulums were popular with Cherie Blair &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1456688/Cherie-took-Leo-to-pendulum-healer-in-place-of-MMR-jab.html"&gt;who is reported&lt;/a&gt; to have taken her son Leo to a pendulum waver, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1454835/Jack-Temple.html"&gt;Jack Temple&lt;/a&gt;, rather than have him vaccinated with MMR.  At least her delusions affected fewer people than those of her husband (the latest &lt;a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/"&gt;Iraq body count&lt;/a&gt; is about 100,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kinesiology&lt;/strong&gt; was originally a word that applied to the perfectly sensible science of human movement.  But &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_kinesiology"&gt;Applied Kinesiology&lt;/a&gt; more often refers now to a fraudulent and totally ineffective diagnostic method invented by (you guessed) a chiropractor.   It has been widely used by alternative medicine to misdiagnose food allergies. It does not work (Garrow, 1988: &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/garrow-kinesiology-bmj-1988.pdf"&gt;download reprint&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Chiropractic Council&lt;/strong&gt;  It is a mind-boggling sign of the incompetence of the General Chiropractic Council that they manage to include kinesiology within their definition of “evidence based care”.  Their definition is clearly sufficiently flexible to include anything whatsoever.  The incompetence of the GCC is documented in superb detail on &lt;a href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/incompetence-and-the-general-chiropractic-council/"&gt;jdc325’s blog (James Cole)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence&lt;/strong&gt; (CHRE) is yet another example of the network of ineffective and incompetent quangos that plague us.. It is meant to ensure that regulation is effective but utterly fails to do so. The CHRE is &lt;a href="http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=20&amp;amp;storycode=4122930&amp;amp;c=2"&gt;quoted as saying&lt;/a&gt; “[The GCC] takes its role seriously and aspires to, and often maintains, excellence.”.   Like endorsing kinesiology and ‘craniosacral therapy’ perhaps? Quangos like the CHRE not only fail to ensure regulatory excellence, they actually endorse rubbish. They do more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reading list for the course includes the following books.  I guess the vibrational medicine (whatever that means) was covered already in the now infamous ‘&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;amethysts emit high yin energy&lt;/a&gt;‘ lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real magic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Hartman’s books seem to feature heavily in the reading list. I just got news of her latest effort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to a special update to the June 2009 newsletter to announce Silvia Hartmann’s latest book “Magic, Spells &amp;amp; Potions” is now available to pre-order from our site. The eBook edition will be released this Sunday, the most magical day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://DragonRising.com/store/magic_spells_and_potions/?r=DR0609MSAP"&gt;http://DragonRising.com/store/magic_spells_and_potions/?r=DR0609MSAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do pre-order this exciting new book, not only will you be amongst the first to receive your copy, but you will also be entered into an exciting competition for Silvia Hartmann’s handmade copal amber magic pendant. Each paperback book pre-ordered will also be signed by the author and contain a unique blessing for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is a serious book on real magic, potions and fortune telling if you are a beginner Silvia has provided ample sample spells and potions for you to practice working with before you start covering the advanced material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? No honestly, I didn’t invent that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that stuff of this sort is appropriate for a bachelor of science degree is simply ludicrous.  I have no doubt that Westminster’s new dean can see that as well as anyone else. She has the delicate diplomatic job of extirpating the nonsense,  I wish her well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have some &lt;a href="http://pollinators.nbii.gov/portal/community/Communities/Ecological_Topics/Pollinators/Learn_About_Pollination/"&gt;fun resources on pollination&lt;/a&gt; and food, like this one: &lt;a href="http://www.pollinator.org/Resources/Chocolate%20and%20Pollinators.pdf"&gt;Chocolate’s Sweet Little Secret (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The cacao flower, while only about the diameter of a nickel, is complex in design and behavior, necessitating a special kind of animal to pollinate it.  Recent studies in cacao plantations indicate that midges, tiny flies that inhabit the damp, shady rain forest, are the only animals that can work their way through the complex cacao flower and pollinate it.  A member of the same insect family as the “no-see-um” flies that plague us  with their bites, this millimeter-long fly is from the family Ceratopogonidae and the genus Forcipomyia–a  very tiny animal with a very long name.  These cacao-pollinating midges are endemic not to plantations, but  to the tropical rain forest itself.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the way in which we grow cacao actually contributes to low pollination rates, since the midges aren’t very happy away from the rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy surfing!&lt;/p&gt;

This is not a mystery because of any theoretical problems - it has just been difficult so far, with the technology we have had available, to investigate this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can look at planets around other suns, but so far not with the detail necessary to identify life. This technology is rapidly progressing, however, and so we will likely have tantalizing clues in the coming years, and maybe a definitive answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been listening for intelligent signals from space, but so far have only sampled a tiny fraction of what might be out there. This is also looking for intelligent life only - and perhaps most life is not technology in a way that would lend itself to sending out radio signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best chance we have for finding extraterrestrial life is in our own solar system. Mars is a possible candidate - peharps there are microbes still clinging to existence on that dry cold world. More probes may give us an answer, but some believe we need to put scientists on the surface of Mars to do the kind of sophisticated investigation we would need to really answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is Europa, one of the large moons of Jupiter. Europa is covered with ice, and we know it gets hotter toward its core, so it stands to reason that at some depth the ice is liquid water - and where there is liquid water there is at least the potential for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years another moon has been added to the list of candidates for life - Saturn’s moon Enceladus. It was first observed that plumes of some gas or liquid was being ejected geyser style from the surface of Enceladus, immediately leading to speculation that this was liquid water. Perhaps, then Enceladus is like Europa with a liquid water interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently astronomers have made this possibility more likely by &lt;a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.1238a91ad4198d1b19148e150db81cec.5c1&amp;amp;show_article=1"&gt;discovering that the plumes of liquid being ejected from Enceladus contain crystals of salt&lt;/a&gt;.  Salt water is even more likely to harbor life. It has previously been discovered that the plumes contain organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, astronomers say, Enceladus has the three ingredients we know are necessary for life - liquid water, organic compounds, and an energy source. The energy source is the tidal forces from Saturn itself - which stretches Enceladus as it orbits its parent planet, heating up its interior. The same is true for the large moons of Jupiter, the innermost of which, Io, is heated up so much by tidal forces that it is literally churning itself inside out with volcanic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have at least two candidates in our own solar system for liquid water that may contain life - Europa and Enceladus. This raises the interesting possibility that life in the universe may be more commonly found in such locations than on the surface of planets with atmospheres heated by their proximity to their parent star. Perhaps there are many more opportunities for life in moons orbiting gas giants. Perhaps there is more life living off of tidal friction than solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we can only speculate. That is the frustrating thing about our current state of knowledge of life in the universe - we have an “N” of 1. Until we start discovering life elsewhere we have no way of knowing what is common and what is rare when it comes to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of life elsewhere in our solar system, to me, is no intriguing and potentially important that I think it deserves dedicated missions to investigate further. I would like to see probes to Europa and Enceladus designed specifically to look for life. Perhaps we don’t have the technology yet, but I think its’ something we should start seriously working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we find life on one of these moons and it shares features with life on Earth, that would tell us something very profound about the origin of life. If the life we find is completely different, then we will have a completely separately evolved biochemistry to investigate, and we are also bound to learn a great deal about biology. Either way, the potential for new knowledge is astounding and deserves a high priority.&lt;/p&gt;

In a recently reported study, an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/celexa-drug.htm"&gt;Celexa&lt;/a&gt;, was shown &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/reducing_repetitive_behaviors_with_meds_not_the_goal"&gt;not to be effective in reducing repetitive behaviors&lt;/a&gt;. Another SSRI, &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/lexapro-drug.htm"&gt;Lexapro&lt;/a&gt;, is to be combined with research on genetics and brain scans in a five-year study (funded with a $9.6 million federal grant). The study seeks to "explore possible mechanisms behind this craving for routine." Geneticist &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/faculty/cooke.htm"&gt;Ed Cook&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/ldn/"&gt;Laboratory of Developmental Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/"&gt;psychiatry department of the University of Illinois-Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, notes that up to a quarter of individuals on the spectrum have "insistence on sameness." (My son certainly is in that number.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the June 24th &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/chi-autism-research-city-zone-24jun24,0,3324184.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant in the study gets blood drawn for genetic tests, including an analysis of the genes related to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is part of the brain's system for modulating mood and emotion. Participants' families are asked to donate blood samples so researchers can look for hereditary links. All the blood Cook collects from participants -- he's hoping for more than 250 -- will be shared with a national autism database for other researchers to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants with a high level of insistence on sameness are referred to the group's pharmacologist, &lt;a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/faculty/owley.htm"&gt;Tom Owley&lt;/a&gt;. The outgoing head of UIC's Neurodevelopmental Psychopharmacology Clinic, Owley conducted a preliminary study two years ago on the antidepressant Lexapro, which affects serotonin levels. Sixty-five percent of participants who took the drug were helped, according to results of a detailed questionnaire completed by their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/reducing_repetitive_behaviors_with_meds_not_the_goal"&gt;Celexa study&lt;/a&gt; is cited and the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/chi-autism-research-city-zone-24jun24,0,3324184.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt; article specifically notes that study. By combining research on Lexapro with genetics and brain scans, it's hoped that researchers can find out why a drug may help some individuals but not others, with a view to developing "medications targeted for people with specific autism symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son has been taking &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/too_many_meds"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; (SSRIs, though not Celexa or Lexapro; antipsychotics; others) since he was 7 years old. We've tried some other medications briefly; two of these---Ritalin and &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/catapres-drug.htm"&gt;Clonidine&lt;/a&gt;---were very unhelpful and, indeed, had something more like deleterious results (as a result of which, Charlie took them only very briefly). My son having very limited speech---and being limited in his ability to identify and describe what he is feeling, physically as well as mentally---he cannot tell us how he feels taking a particular medication. Trying a new one, increasing a dosage, taking him off a medication: The only way we can gauge (guess) how he is feeling is by observing him very closely. And even then, it sometimes (most of the time) not always possible to tell what could be the medication, and what's Charlie reacting to things that have happened around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's responses to medications have often not been what what predicted. I still remember the time I gave him an over-the-counter medication---Benadryl---after he'd gotten his arms and legs covered with flea and fly bites at the beach. Maybe it stopped the itching, but, far from getting drowsy, he stayed up past midnight and was very lively (and of course, we had company that night). So finding out ways to determine whether or how an individuals with limited communication might respond to a medication before they take it would be very helpful. [Understatement]  Not that it's that easy to have blood testing or brain scans done for my son---though, lately, he's done very good with &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/thats_ten_years_triumph_in_an_audiology_booth"&gt;various sorts of medical and other testing&lt;/a&gt;---you never know.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245917254642"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3644">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a0c2fb3c9f008c29</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="anti-vaccine lunacy"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="12-step programs"/><category term="Alcoholics Anonymous"/><category term="Bill W"/><category term="Jenny McCarthy"/><title type="html">At long last, I agree with ‘Age of Autism’ about something</title><published>2009-06-25T07:13:59Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T07:13:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/at-long-last-i-agree-with-age-of-autism-about-something/" type="text/html"/><media:group><media:content url="http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/84ccd467894d8e454d689effc211d515?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"/></media:group><media:group><media:content url="http://img.youtube.com/vi/KnkyZ5uOScI/2.jpg"/></media:group><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent blog, the anti-vaccinationists over at &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/06/jenny-mccarthy-is-the-new-bill-w.html"&gt;Age of Autism compared Jenny McCarthy to Bill W. of Alcoholics Anonymous fame&lt;/a&gt;. And having seen the statistics showing &lt;a href="http://www.cbtrecovery.org/AAefficacyrates.htm"&gt;the efficacy of AA&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn’t agree more on the comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;AA’s own analysis was that 50% of all those who try AA leave within 90 days, which they describe as cause for ‘concern’. Their own data shows that is actually optimistic. In the 12-year period shown, 19% remain after 30 days, 10% remain after 90 days, and 5% remain after a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retention rate of AA is 5% after one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;60% of those surveyed were getting outside professional help. This means that any success (or failure) rate, however it is defined, can’t be attributed entirely to AA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extensive study (Hester and Miller, Handbook of alcoholism treatment approaches) shows that peer-based 12-step alcohol treatment programs do NOT have a higher success rate than no treatment at all. Facilitated 12-step treatment (trained facilitators guiding subjects through the twelve-step process) were marginally better. “The two tests of AA found it inferior to other treatments or even no treatment but were not sufficient to rank AA reliably.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief, non-confrontational interventions and motivational interviewing were found most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/at-long-last-i-agree-with-age-of-autism-about-something/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/KnkyZ5uOScI/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, it’s not my comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Chase survived in part because hundreds of people prayed to Father Emil Kapaun to intercede on his behalf. It was absolutely a miracle.” — Paula Kear, Chase’s mother&lt;/em&gt;People in Colwich like to touch Chase Kear’s arm or his shoulder with their fingers. Or they hug him. “Miracle Man,” they say. “Let me touch the miracle.” With anybody else in Colwich, this would be just talk. But it’s not just talk to the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among people that Ambrosi will consult on Friday will be Chase’s neurosurgeon, Raymond Grundmeyer, who said in a brief e-mail last week that he considers Chase’s survival a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psst, Chase’s family. Here’s your chance to ask then for your money back, since the neurosurgeon says he didn’t do anything. Hell, with such miraculous healings, who needs neurosurgeons at all? Maybe we should all just declare:  God is my neurosurgeon! Of course this is absurd. I don’t know the details of the case, but a person surviving a terrible accident after being treated medically makes for a pretty low-grade miracle to me. Wake me up when god does something unambiguous like healing an amputee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% of them go to church only for weddings/christenings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% of them don’t think religious studies should be compulsory in schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;59% of them think that religion “has a negative influence on the world”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;55% of them are not bothered about religion (&lt;em&gt;Hemant adds: This means they’re essentially apathetic about religion.  Thanks, commenters!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50% of them have never prayed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;41% believe nothing happens to your body when you die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30% of them (&lt;em&gt;only 30%!&lt;/em&gt;) believe in an afterlife&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16% have never been to church&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10% of them (&lt;em&gt;only 10%!&lt;/em&gt;) think they will be reincarnated as an animal/human&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, then &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-8928-Philadelphia-Atheism-Examiner~y2009m6d24-Two-thirds-of-teenagers-dont-believe-in-God"&gt;this provides even more evidence against a common religious claim&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many Christian Evangelicals here in America claim that without there god there can be no morality. If that view held true, than we should expect to see these British teens to be self-absorbed brats who only care about themselves. However, the survey discovered the opposite to be the case. 90 percent of those surveyed believe that they should treat other people better than they treat themselves, trumping the “Golden Rule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I made small fun of FoxNews, which caused a few commenters to accuse me of hypocrisy and being a “lib,” whatever that is. Some went so far as to suggest that I and the JREF had a deeply liberal agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote Sherman T. Potter: horse hockey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to be clear, the JREF has no political stance whatsoever. We will criticize those that ignore scientific inquiry and praise those who embrace it, regardless of party. As a non-profit, we’re not permitted to endorse particular candidates or parties, and we have not done so. In the past few weeks, I have been critical of many media sources, including MSNBC, ABCNews, and yes, FoxNews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone investigating my personal political contributions on the Internet, will discover that I donated money to the campaign of Hal Bidlack, a friend of mine for some years now. I gave him a donation because I know him to be a man of honor, and I feel there are far too few of them in our government. I would have donated the money to his campaign regardless of his party, though he happens to be a Democrat. When I lived in Virginia, I registered as a Republican to support the campaign of James Burton, another man I believe would improve our government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a political independent, and I don’t know what party affiliations other JREF employees have, if any. I vote based on the issues of the day, and I care not for party. That disclosed, I have a more important message to convey: &lt;strong&gt;skepticism is not compatible with politics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245911680910"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d31594f71348f136</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><title type="html">Command Performance</title><published>2009-06-25T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/military/celebrities/edmcmahon.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Was sidekick Ed McMahon once Johnny Carson's commanding officer?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245908657277"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1538">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dcb451f9b2bee794</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Books"/><category term="Morphology"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">Slang affixation: it's all mystery-y-ish-y</title><published>2009-06-25T05:42:26Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T05:42:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1538" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195314638?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thevisualthes-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195314638"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/slang.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you haven't picked up a copy of Michael Adams' new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195314638?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thevisualthes-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195314638"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slang: The People's Poetry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, well, what are you waiting for? For starters, it's a lively and engaging look at English slang and its multitudinous forms. At the same time, it's a thoughtful interrogation of what "slang" actually is, and how we might determine its boundaries. One way that Michael expands traditional notions of slang is in his treatment of affixation, or what he amusingly calls "unorthodox lexifabricology." I talked to Michael about slangy affixation in the &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/dictionary/1898/"&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt; of my two-part interview with him for the &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/"&gt;Visual Thesaurus&lt;/a&gt;. An excerpt follows below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VT:&lt;/b&gt; In your book, you have a whole section on slangy  affixes (prefixes, suffixes, and infixes). This is lexical  material that is not easily made into a dictionary entry, necessarily. For instance, there's the &lt;em&gt;-iz-&lt;/em&gt; infix (&lt;em&gt;hizzouse&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;house&lt;/em&gt;) and the &lt;em&gt;-diddly-&lt;/em&gt; infix (&lt;em&gt;scrum-diddly-umptious&lt;/em&gt;).  Is your  goal there to show that the &amp;quot;poetic&amp;quot;  productivity of  slang can work on a sort of sub-lexical level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MA:&lt;/b&gt;  In a way, I think it's both sub-lexical  and super-lexical. The  very practice of using  infixes like that can be slangy, so that's super-lexical. The same is true with  suffixes like &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt;. The slanginess comes out  of the suffixing as much as it comes out of a particular suffix that you would  define.  But it's also true that because  those structures are so flexible and they can be used so readily on the fly or in the moment, it's easy for people to use them to come up with &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/?w=nonce%20word"&gt;nonce words&lt;/a&gt;. They're infinitely productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I  argued in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195175999?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thevisualthes-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195175999"&gt;Slayer Slang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and argue again in this book is that we think that there are constraints on these suffixes, but there  really aren't.  Always, eventually, we  figure out a way to get outside of those constraints, so that we can make up  new words. You'd think if you were  looking historically at the language, you'd say, "Well, you can see what some of  the rules applying to &lt;em&gt;-y &lt;/em&gt;suffixing are.   You can't add the &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix to a seven-syllable word."  But you can, if somebody decides to do  it.  And in some situation where that  could be a slang opportunity,  it's not just that  somebody could do it, somebody &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do it. We just won't know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VT:&lt;/b&gt; Or we'll know about it if we  Google for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MA:&lt;/b&gt; Well, exactly, and as I say in the  book,  one of my most astonishing adventures over the last several  years has been just plugging these in, really just saying, &amp;quot;Now surely, this can&amp;#39;t take the -&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;  suffix,&amp;quot; and then finding out about fifty percent of the time that it can. Fifty percent of the time it doesn&amp;#39;t, but  there&amp;#39;s no natural reason that the words that I tested that haven&amp;#39;t appeared  with a &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix yet couldn't take that &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Read the rest &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/dictionary/1898/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no better proof of Michael's contention about the productivity of the &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; suffix than a recent &lt;a href="http://blog.oup.com/2009/05/y-suffix-bananas/"&gt;OUPblog post&lt;/a&gt; by Mark Peters, whose &lt;a href="http://wordlust.blogspot.com/"&gt;Wordlustitude&lt;/a&gt; blog is a never-ending morpholicious nonce-word-athon. You might think that &lt;em&gt;-y&lt;/em&gt; would resist suffixation on words already ending with the /i/ vowel, but you would be wrong. Mark has found a ton of "double-y" words in the wild, like &lt;i&gt;jealousy-y&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;technology-y&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;secret identity-y&lt;/i&gt;. The nonce formation that takes the cake, though, is &lt;i&gt;mystery-y-ish-y&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;My faith tells me that marital sex, like all acts blessed with holiness, is a great mystery — and from thence comes its beauty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, it WOULD be wouldn’t it? Since Dawn’s not married, she can’t be having marital sex. It’s all mystery-y-ish-y. And she can imagine it’s pretty, if she wants.&lt;br&gt;
(May 23, 2006, &lt;a href="http://pandagon.blogsome.com/2006/05/23/turn-the-lights-off-youre-encouraging-the-child-molesters/"&gt;Pandagon&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mark writes, &amp;quot;After years of weird-word collecting, I&amp;#39;m pretty unfazed by words with multiple, redundant, exuberant suffixes… However, even I was gobsmacked out of my chair when I spotted &lt;em&gt;mystery-y-ish-y&lt;/em&gt;." Indeed, the mystery-y-ish-iness of English word formation never ceases to amaze.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, I commented about how he is not only undergoing the chemotherapy ordered by his doctors. As you may recall, Hauser is a 13-year-old boy who, after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and undergoing one round of chemotherapy, refused to undergo any more. His mother supported him, and ultimately a judge had to order Daniel's parents to make sure that he underwent standard therapy for his very curable form of cancer. Daniel's mother Colleen took off with him shortly afterward, rumored to be heading for Tijuana. Ultimately, Colleen Hauser turned herself and Daniel in, and Daniel started chemotherapy. What provoked my post was how Daniel's tumor was shrinking in response to chemotherapy after having grown while he was off chemotherapy and relying on quackery, specifically Daniel and his family's reaction. Consistent with the behavior of woo fans everywhere, Daniel and his family didn't attribute his tumor's response to the chemotherapy, but rather to the vitamins and other stuff in various "alternative" concoctions Daniel was taking in addition to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it's so predictable that woo-fans who "integrate" quackery with their conventional science-based medical therapy almost invariably attribute any good that happens to the woo and any complications to the conventional medicine, that I'm half tempted to call it a law and come up with a name for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, there was also a court hearing for an update on Daniel's condition in which Daniel's parents requested that the court rescind the child protection order governing Daniel's medical care and giving Judge John Rodenberg jurisdiction over his care. Given that the last time Judge Rodenberg gave the Hausers too much leeway Colleen Hauser bolted and ran with Daniel to keep him from chemotherapy, the judge's ruling was &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/48911802.html?elr=KArksUUUoDEy3LGDiO7aiU"&gt;about what you would expect&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/update_daniel_hauser_must_continue_chemo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/update_daniel_hauser_must_continue_chemo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/7t8S12KtjlI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245905051494"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/69e56b20d4a0b31e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">The biggest self of self is indeed self</title><published>2009-06-25T04:15:43Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T04:15:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Sanford1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="408764"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Sanford1a.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="45453"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gov. Mark Sanford, back &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1526"&gt;in pocket&lt;/a&gt;, explained himself (from the NYT &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/us/24text-sanford.html"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href="http://video.nytimes.com/video/2009/06/24/us/1194841154720/gov-mark-sanford-admits-affair.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I'm here because if you were to look at God's laws, they're in every instance designed to protect people from themselves. I think that that is the bottom line of God's law, that it's not a moral, rigid list of do's and don'ts just for the heck of do's and don'ts. It is indeed to protect us from ourselves. And the biggest self of self is, indeed, self; that sin is, in fact, grounded in this notion of what is it that I want as opposed to somebody else?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assertion that "the biggest self of self is indeed self" makes a poetic sort of psychological and theological sense, I think, though I'm not quite sure how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this might be a (perhaps garbled) quotation or allusion of some sort. But I doubt that the governor is familiar with Gerard Manley Hopkins' unfinished fragment &lt;em&gt;On the Portrait of Two Beautiful Young People&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;21   There's none but good can bé good, both for you&lt;br&gt;
22   And what sways with you, maybe this sweet maid;&lt;br&gt;
23   None good but God—a warning wavèd to&lt;br&gt;
24   One once that was found wanting when Good weighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;25   Man lives that list, that leaning in the will&lt;br&gt;
26   No wisdom can forecast by gauge or guess,&lt;br&gt;
27   The selfless self of self, most strange, most still,&lt;br&gt;
28   Fast furled and all foredrawn to No or Yes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;29   Your feast of; that most in you earnest eye&lt;br&gt;
30   May but call on your banes to more carouse.&lt;br&gt;
31   Worst will the best. What worm was here, we cry,&lt;br&gt;
32   To have havoc-pocked so, see, the hung-heavenward boughs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;33   Enough: corruption was the world's first woe.&lt;br&gt;
34   What need I strain my heart beyond my ken?&lt;br&gt;
35   O but I bear my burning witness though&lt;br&gt;
36   Against the wild and wanton work of men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Poser suggests that "the biggest self of self is self" might be a bad translation of some Sanskrit scripture; but if so, I haven't been able to locate the original. And in any case, that seems even further from Sanford's style than Hopkins is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audio for the whole passage is here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a more careful transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:smaller;color:#ff0000"&gt;But I'm- I'm- I'm here&lt;br&gt;
because if you were to look at God's laws&lt;br&gt;
uh they're in every instance designed to protect people from themselves&lt;br&gt;
um I think that that is the bottom line of God's law&lt;br&gt;
that it's not a- a- a- a moral r- rigid list of dos and don'ts just for the heck of dos and donts&lt;br&gt;
it is indeed to protect us&lt;br&gt;
from ourselves and the biggest&lt;br&gt;
self of self is&lt;br&gt;
is- is in- indeed self&lt;br&gt;
that sin is in fact grounded in this notion&lt;br&gt;
of what is it that I want&lt;br&gt;
as opposed to somebody else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see only one problem with the NYT transcript: the question mark at the end is inappropriate, since the what-clause, despite the subject-aux inversion, is not a direct question, but rather the complement of &lt;em&gt;notion of&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a lot is left out of a transcript. In this case, the performance of the phrase &amp;quot;the biggest self of self is indeed self&amp;quot; — especially the internal pausing — is consistent with the idea that the governor had something less poetic in mind, for example &amp;quot;the biggest danger to self is indeed self&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;the biggest danger to ourselves is indeed ourselves&amp;quot;. Or maybe &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1245"&gt;We have met the enemy, and he is us&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cited phrase by itself is here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — following a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1537#comment-34600"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; with misterfricative in the comments below, I suggest that Gov. Sanford had in mind a phrase like "the biggest source of sin is indeed self", and then performed a rare double-anticipation speech error. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My vote for the best comment on the whole Sanford saga goes to the lolcat version &lt;a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/06/24/todays-lolcat-picture-dedicated-to-south-carolina-governor-mark-sanford/"&gt;offered by John Scalzi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SanfordLolcat.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[But then, maybe &lt;a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2009/06/25/the-self-of-self/#comment-280624"&gt;the poem contributed by Salient&lt;/a&gt; at Crooked Timber is even better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;The biggest self of self is self:&lt;br&gt;
A part that parts its part to be a whole,&lt;br&gt;
The screw that once held stud to shelf&lt;br&gt;
When loose, is held to have a sovereign soul&lt;br&gt;
(and, so far as shear-stress will permit, gov’rnance of the whole.)&lt;br&gt;
Rust to dust: but living flesh to coal,&lt;br&gt;
which in its value must give of itself,&lt;br&gt;
return to air &lt;a href="http://www.starsandseas.com/SAS_Images/SAS_ecol_images/SAS_ecol_physical/cycle_carbon_4.jpg"&gt;what verdant Nature stole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(this too in bondage, each atom volatile while sole.)&lt;/p&gt;

As usual, I tend to be open to trying new technologies, but don’t like being at the bleeding edge (where people get hurt).  There’s no doubt that electronic reading devices have a long way to go, but there’s also little doubt that they’re the wave of the future, or at least a sizable part of it.  And the technology seems to have reached a point where Kindle editions of books are a non-trivial part of the market.  My own decision to get one was definitely influenced by the number of queries I received about whether my own book would have a Kindle edition.  (Answer:  yes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it’s arrived!  So the question is:  what’s the first book I should buy?  An obvious choice would be &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;, as the &lt;a href="http://infinitesummer.org/"&gt;Infinite Summer&lt;/a&gt; project is underway and (as I have learned) toting a thousand-page book around on a cross-country flight is less than perfectly convenient.  But, of course, I already own that book.  And, as &lt;a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/infinite-pagination.php"&gt;Matthew Yglesias points out&lt;/a&gt;, you don’t want to buy Kindle versions of impressive books that you can prominently display to buff up your credentials as a person of culture.  And the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; would be to display a giant, impressive book on your shelves, but one that was clearly unread and in pristine condition, even though you really did read it, only you read it on your Kindle.  Worst of all possible worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea, then, is to find a good book that I haven’t yet read, but not one that is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; good — not good enough that I’d rather have the dead-tree edition.  Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245901439128"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1536">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/905e14fa2b7a40e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">"The risk that the taxpayer does not bear a disproportionate burden"</title><published>2009-06-25T03:06:18Z</published><updated>2009-06-25T03:06:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1536" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/focus/2009/imf/index.pdf"&gt;IMF report on Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, point 47 of the "Staff Appraisal" (p. 28), dealing with a proposed "National Asset Management Agency" (aka "Bad Bank"), reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;47. With regard to NAMA, risk-sharing structures should be considered to address the well-known pricing problem. The pricing of distressed assets is complex and can slow down the transfer of assets from the troubled bank. Risk-sharing can potentially create better incentives for managing the bad assets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And they also guard against the risk that the taxpayer does not bear a disproportionate burden of the costs cleaning up the banks.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breffni O'Rourke, who sent in this example of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=overnegation"&gt;overnegation&lt;/a&gt;, comments that "My fear is that they actually mean exactly what they say."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phrase of the form "the risk that X" suggests that X is possible but not certain, and would be a Bad Thing. Some &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22the+risk+that%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;examples from the web&lt;/a&gt; where X is a positive statement (X in bold):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;a hidden asteroid in a stealth-path will hit the earth&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;br&gt;
The risk that &lt;strong&gt;HIV-seropositive drug users (DUs) transmit their HIV-infection&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;br&gt;
… the Risk that &lt;strong&gt;Hatchery Enhancement Will Reduce Genetic Diversity of White Seabass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;mass killings occur&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;a child will develop diabetes&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;I will have a major complication after my valve operation&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22the+risk+that+*+not%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;examples where X contains a negation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;acquisitions might not be integrated successfully&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;she might not be able to carry a future pregnancy to term&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;Adolor may not receive regulatory approval of Entereg (alvimopan)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;DHS is not creating the institutional knowledge needed&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;Glu may not launch the mobile game as scheduled&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
… the risk that &lt;strong&gt;there's not enough binder in the paint for it to stick&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;/span&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether positive or negative, X is something that the writer hopes to avoid. So when the IMF staffers write about "&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;the risk that &lt;strong&gt;the taxpayer does not bear a disproportionate burden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;", it's easy to see why Breffni is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

The video was horrific, showing adults restraining the boy as he flailed and jerked his body, and then vomited. Manifested Glory removed the video, but as the Scientologists have learned, nothing stays dead on the Internet. Here’s the news report, complete with clips from the original video.&lt;/p&gt;

If you&amp;#39;ve got a little time — there is a bit of tl;dr about it all — read &lt;a href="http://www.reasonproject.org/archive/item/debate_001_sam_harris_v_philip_ball3/"&gt;Sam Harris's exchanges with Philip Ball&lt;/a&gt;. Sam Harris we all know; Ball is a very reputable science writer who is also very much one of those &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m an atheist, but…&amp;quot; fellows. It&amp;#39;s an infuriating conversation because, as usual, rather than talking about what us &amp;quot;New Atheists&amp;quot; actually think, Harris has to constantly go back and address the blithe misconceptions of the accommodationist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Harris's conclusion in particular is worth reading anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realize that my tone of chastisement has probably grown very tedious and could be mistaken for hostility. But I can't help but feel that there is a great asymmetry between our points of view - both in how fully they have been thought out and in their degree of the moral seriousness. I see the perpetuation of ancient tribalism and ignorance (read "religion") to be a grave problem, and the source of much unnecessary suffering in the world; you claim that the problem is either not very serious or that it is unavoidable--in either case there is not much to be done. You do not seem to see what an astonishing number of the world's conflicts and missed opportunities arise from people's false knowledge about God, and when specific instances are pointed out to you, you deem them to be inevitable (if it's not religion it would be something else), or you defensively say, well of course I object to that instance of religious stupidity: parents shouldn't withhold blood transfusions from their children!... But the truth is, a comprehensive response to the problem of religious ignorance is possible, and a piecemeal response is totally unprincipled and bound to seem so. Our world has be shattered, and is reliably shattered anew with each subsequent generation, by irreconcilable claims about God and his magic books. Until we stop enabling these competing delusions--by our silence and by our silly attempts to change the subject--we will have no one to blame but ourselves when medieval ideas come crashing into public life--as they do, and will, to our great detriment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a weird thing to argue with an atheist who claims religion is unavoidable (Oh? So what's so special about &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?) and isn't that bad or is actually beneficial (So why aren't you going to church for your health?), but they're out there and they are irritatingly inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's the mischaracterization of outspoken atheists and the apparent contempt for theistic scientists. Here's &lt;a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/religionandtheology/1433/the_two_faces_of_new_atheism_/"&gt;another example of that attitude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should not overlook the New Atheists' support for science, progressive views and legitimization of non-belief as a viable alternative. Unfortunately, their record is also marked by an intolerance of religious people and the alienation of potential progressive allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That always baffles me. So if I say that I'm proud to be an atheist, I think theism is a profound fallacy that is incompatible with scientific thinking, that's &lt;i&gt;intolerance&lt;/i&gt; and then these religious allies are going to get pissy and decide evolution isn't worth defending anymore? That's an awfully broad interpretation of intolerance, and an extraordinarily dismissive opinion of the theistic evolutionists. I guarantee you that no matter how &lt;i&gt;rude&lt;/i&gt; a New Atheist might be to religion, Ken Miller will never give up on teaching evolution or trying to explain science to creationists. The accommodationists can stop trying to scare us into silence with these goofy, unrealistic threats.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.case.edu/singham/2009/06/24/the_new_atheists_vs_the_accommodationists"&gt;Mano Singham makes a similar point&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accommodationists argue that it is a mistake to insist that science is antithetical to religion because if science is determined to be an intrinsically atheistic enterprise, then even so-called moderate religionists will turn away from science and not support efforts to oppose the teaching of religious ideas such as intelligent design in science classes. This kind of mistaken solicitousness for the sensitivities of religious people, the fear that they will take their ball and go home if others are mean to them, is not new. During the run up to the Scopes Monkey trial in 1925, there were many accommodationists of that era who did not want Clarence Darrow to defend Scopes because they felt that his scorn for religious beliefs would alienate potential religious allies. We now view Darrow's performance in that trial as one of the high points in opposing the imposition of religious indoctrination in public schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no downside to godless vigor. Nobody has come up with a reason yet why we should sit down and shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

Details are sketchy, but it's safe to say in the world of 9, something has gone horribly wrong, the world has been destroyed, and the only survivors are some &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3871736601/"&gt;cute little sack people and an army of murderous machines&lt;/a&gt;.  One can't help but think that a few squiddies from the Matrix somehow tunnelled into Little Big Planet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it tickles my fancy, if only because it checks the requisite boxes of "post apocalyptic dystopia" and "technopunk machinery".  Which is good, because some of the people behind the film have been nice enough to send me these &lt;em&gt;ludicrously&lt;/em&gt; high res images of the Fabricator, a factory robot with misfiring synapses that has been building the war machines.  Click on the pictures below for full size images - they really are massive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the beast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/gallery/9/fabmachine_tex_head_l.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/upload/2009/06/first_look_at_the_machines_of/fabmachine_tex_head_s.png" width="500" height="339"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above image is a down scaled crop from this texture plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underneath the texturing are the bones of the machine, as lovingly illustrated in this artwork:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/gallery/9/fabmachine_l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/upload/2009/06/first_look_at_the_machines_of/fabmachine_s.jpg" width="500" height="312"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a detail from the above graphic, and yet it's big enough that I could make it into a desktop wallpaper, just for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/gallery/9/fabmachine_wallpaper_l.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/upload/2009/06/first_look_at_the_machines_of/fabmachine_wallpaper_s.png" width="500" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also been given an exclusive piece of artwork showing 3 and 4, two of the small "stitch punks" at the centre of the film's plot.  The PR bumf says:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Communicating visually, not verbally, 3 and 4 are the scholarly twins who voraciously catalogue everything they can see and find, recording and building a massive database for the group of the world that surrounds them and the history that led up to their creation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which producer Tim Burton adds:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"3 and 4 go back to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQcMeNh7Hc"&gt;the original experience&lt;/a&gt; of non-speaking characters. I think it works for them, it makes them different from the others, and I can relate to those characters because I didn't speak when I was a child either."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Err, okay Tim. Anyway, click on the below image to see the full artwork.  It will be available as a collectible card, my sources tell me that San Diego's Comic-Con 09 would be a good place to start looking for them, if you're into that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several specific initiatives were mentioned in the press release, such as more section 8 (housing) vouchers, better interagency communication, and increased funding to independent living centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all moves in the right direction, yes.  But conspicuously absent (still) in the press release is any mention of the core issue of institutional bias in the health care system and the need for significant &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/words_or_lack_thereof_from_obama_and_harkin_on_cca"&gt;health care reform&lt;/a&gt; in order to actually realize Olmstead.  It's continuing, to me anyway, to be very hard to believe that the administration is truly "getting it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that may not be very obvious to policy makers is that many of us who rely on "the system" have been lied to and let down so many times now that to eliminate something we care deeply about from all discussion ends up feeling like "&lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/last+straw.html"&gt;the last straw&lt;/a&gt;."  The first time a promise is broken, OK, stuff happens, and there are complex issues at play always.  But for many of us this is just one more thing in a long line of being ignored and neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to see some more aggressive action on core issues in health care reform--time for the administration to "&lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/put+your+money+where+your+mouth+is.html"&gt;put the money where its mouth is&lt;/a&gt;."

Creationist cults simply &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that life must be more than matter, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/smackdown_please.php"&gt;mind-body dualists&lt;/a&gt; (which includes most alternative medicine advocates) are &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that humans are more than an “ugly bag of mostly water” (sorry for the geek reference).  If you can stick with me here, I’ll explain to you a bit of the history surrounding this fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us intuitively feel that we are both a body and a person.  In every day life, it makes a certain operational sense to think of our “mind” as being something distinct.  From a biological standpoint, however, this doesn’t work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biology was one of the last of the “natural philosophies” to become a science.  It was clear to those who studied chemistry and physics that certain principles seemed to explain the natural world, but those who studied living things were mostly involved in description.  Still, biology has become a science in its own right. &lt;a href="http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01_2/autonomy.htm"&gt;According to Ernst Mayr&lt;/a&gt;, one of the greatest biologists of the last century, a number of events preceded biology being recognized as a legitimate science.  One vital event was the recognition that all biological processes were constrained by the laws of physics and chemistry.  Another important step was the rejection of two erroneous principles: &lt;em&gt;vitalism&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;teleology&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleology &lt;/strong&gt;is the idea that there is some larger end-point or goal that drives biological processes, such as the idea of the ladder of ascent where the development of life has had, as its goal, the creation of more and more complex forms.  Darwin’s synthesis of natural selection and evolution pretty much destroyed this idea.  Clearly, if stochastic processes can drive the changes we see in living beings, determinism is out the door.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2008/06/evolving_without_gods_permissi.php"&gt;Evolution has elements that are random (changes in environment, mutations, etc.) but other elements that are decidedly non-random&lt;/a&gt; (for example, convergent adaptations are difficult to call “random”—sure the processes that underlie them are random, but these processes and pressures lead to a non-random result).  But from a “cosmic” standpoint, there is no room left for teleologic explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More offensive to me as a physician is the idea of &lt;em&gt;vitalism&lt;/em&gt;.  This ancient principle says that the difference between living and non-living things is some sort of non-material vital force.  As the natural philosophers of the last few centuries became more sophisticated, they worked with this assumption and tried to define it scientifically.  For example, it was felt that organic and inorganic matter differed in that, if melted with heat, only inorganic matter could re-crystalize naturally with the removal of the heat source (since we obviously cannot add that essential vital force).  This seemed to give a “scientific” way of testing whether or not something was from a “living” source.   If this were found to be true, it might pave the way for more experiments that could help show that there must be some sort of “elan vital” that animates living matter.  &lt;a href="http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;amp;ProduktNr=223979&amp;amp;Ausgabe=225203&amp;amp;ArtikelNr=13463&amp;amp;filename=13463.pdf"&gt;In 1828, a chemist named Friedrich Wohler synthesized urea&lt;/a&gt;, an organic compound, from two inorganic compounds.  In other words, he created “life” from “non-life”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, and experiments like it, effectively destroyed the best attempt to use knowledge of natural laws to divide living from non-living systems. The implications were probably unimportant to Wohler and many others, but from a modern perspective, this is seen as the beginning of the end for vitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death of vitalism, and the discovery of genetics, allowed biology to grow into a mature scientific discipline.  There are no processes in biology that have not been amenable to scientific investigation or that have required a &lt;em&gt;deus ex machina&lt;/em&gt; to fully understand.  That doesn’t mean that vitalism is dead.  Since we, as human beings, operationally see ourselves and both “mind” and “body”, we will always be tempted to think vitalistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true in the most anthropocentric of sciences, medicine.  All alternative medicine is based on the idea that we are more than biology, that there is some force, some &lt;em&gt;elan vital&lt;/em&gt; that animates us and elevates us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiropractic uses the concept of “vertebral subluxation complexes” that block the flow of vital energy, despite the lack of any evidence for these things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acupuncture, &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, and other “energy therapies” claim to affect the role of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;, or vital energy, a non-organic, immeasurable  force that animates us.  Such a vital force has never been found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homeopathy makes claims that some sort of magic happens to water when they shake it just right.  In this case, it’s actually the water that has some sort of vital force imposed upon it, but then this magic water is supposed to be able to affect human biology via a presumably equally invisible and immeasurable process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something is immeasurable and un-observable, either directly or indirectly, then it is not medically relevant.  Remember, if you are claiming that an intervention is helping a patient, then you are claiming that it is measurable and observable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a measurable, observable phenomenon is better explained by known physical laws than by a vitalistic explanation, then why make up a silly, non-reality-based explanation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitalism, an ancient and discredited philosophy, has become irrelevant in modern thinking with two important exceptions: alternative medicine, and religion.  That, right there, should tell you something important.&lt;/p&gt;

This week, in &lt;a href="http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b31ca2928f7cb0fba7aa3341ff400e16.html"&gt;a University of Colorado study&lt;/a&gt; of the geysers spewing from Enceladus, astronomers found the water lacked sodium. They observed it using the 10 meter Keck and 4 meter Anglo Australian ground-based telescopes, and detected very little if any sodium in the geysers. If the plumes originated from an undersurface ocean then they are expected to have sodium in them. Instead, given the unsalty nature of the geysers, they surmise there may be pockets of liquid water under the surface which evaporates into space, or it could be from crustal plates of surface ice rubbing against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the Cassini space probe orbiting Saturn surprised astronomers when it detected geysers of water spewing from the icy moon Enceladus. This week, &lt;a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20090624/"&gt;in a JPL and Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics study&lt;/a&gt; of the outermost ring of Saturn, astronomers found the ring particles contained sodium. They observed it using the Cassini spacecraft, and detected sodium salts in the rings. This ring is known to be replenished by Enceladus’s geysers.  If the plumes originated from an undersurface ocean then they are expected to have sodium in them. Given the salty nature of the rings, they surmise there must be a global ocean under the surface which shoots water into space where it replenished that ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, say what? Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beats me. I’m a violent star-explodey kind of guy, not an exooceanologist. I imagine the authors of the two papers have their opinions on both studies, and I’d love to hear what they have to say. I’d also like to see the spectra obtained by the no-salt-in-the-plumes team first (because a non-detection of something is always on shakier ground than a positive detection of something) before I would come to any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thus is science. Two observations, two good teams, two very different conclusions. That’s what it’s like on the cutting edge… and we’ll need more observations to cut through all this. Happily, as Cassini orbits the Saturn system it will be passing directly through the plumes at least twice more, giving astronomers that many more chances to see what’s happening on that tiny little moon so far away. &lt;/p&gt;

Two different worlds: That's what services for children on the autism spectrum and services for adults on the autism spectrum are like, according to Shawn Lattanzio, Montgomery County's program manager of a Maryland initiative to help autistic students transition to adulthood. Today's &lt;a href="http://www.gazette.net/stories/06242009/poolnew181200_32541.shtml"&gt;Gazette.net&lt;/a&gt; highlights some of the post-school issues adults with disabilities face. Families are in "shock" when school services end and they see what programs for adults are like compared to that for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlook can be grim, advocates and officials say. The waiting list for housing and other state services can be decades long. Doctors oftentimes balk at accepting Medicaid. Jobs are scarcer than for non-disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several county and state agencies partner to make that transition as seamless as possible for the more than 5,500 students in Montgomery County between the ages of 14 and 21. The state gives priority to people in their first year out of school. The state's "New Directions" program, launched in 2005, lets parents decide how to spend their children's funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All but a few of the graduates will receive day service and possibly supported employment, Lattanzio said. The state pays for a fraction of the therapies, behavioral management and family supports that most had while in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anchor that can steady the transition most is finding meaningful employment, advocates and parents say. But less than half of developmentally disabled adults in Maryland had jobs last year, according to a November report by Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are programs and plans to help with the transition. But the recurring problem is that there just aren't enough programs and, indeed, &lt;em&gt;jobs&lt;/em&gt; for adults to transition into. &lt;a href="http://www.gazette.net/stories/06242009/poolnew181200_32541.shtml"&gt;Gazette.net&lt;/a&gt; describes the situation of 22-year-old Ashley Thompson of Germantown. She received a  "certificate of attendance" in 2008, the diploma awarded students when they reach 21, and has been working part-time at a private preschool and has also been volunteering with preschoolers at Germantown Elementary School. But her training has not been deemed sufficient for the school system that educated her to hire her: "School officials balked at the idea because she had only the certificate," her mother, Holly Thompson notes, because &lt;a href="http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/"&gt;Montgomery County Public Schools&lt;/a&gt; policy requires that paraeducators to have a full-fledged high school diploma and at least one year of college. Ironically, Thompson was regularly featured in Montgomery County Public Schools publications as an example of the success of special needs programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you leave the shiny world of services for those under 21 behind, the bloom is indeed off the proverbial rose. I think we all know what is wrong with that picture.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org&amp;#39;s Autism Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245879572149"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/crossword_guy_just_doesnt_get.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/237e1b2451fe9142</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Bad Logic"/><title type="html">Crossword Guy just doesn't get math</title><published>2009-06-24T20:10:55Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T20:10:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/jSjzZhJtxXI/crossword_guy_just_doesnt_get.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; One of my pet peeves about people and math is that most 
people don't really have a clue of what math is. I've been writing
this blog for something over three years, and by the standards of
a lot of people, I've almost never written about math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yesterday, my son's kindergarten class had a picnic. On my way home, 
I was listening to the local NPR station, which was interviewing some
crossword puzzle writer whose name I cannot remember; I will therefore refer
to him as "crossword-boy".  (It was not Will Shortz; Shortz is much smarter than the
guy they were interviewing.) At one point, they asked him something about 
Sudoku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; His response was a bit disjointed - he couldn't decide whether to talk about
the history of Sudoku or about his opinion of it. His opinion is that it's
incredibly dull and pointless, and that designing good Sudoku doesn't require as
much creativity as designing good crosswords. (Just that much is annoying: I'm
a Sudoku addict, and I've definitely noticed dramatic differences in Sudokus
from different places. Will Shortz's Sudoku books have great ones; most computerized
Sudoku games generate rather boring ones; the ones in most newspapers are 
obviously computer generated.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the course of babbling about how uninteresting, non-creative, and
unsatisfying Sudoko puzzles are, he let loose with the real stupidity: "You know,
Sudoku doesn't even have to use numbers, it can use any 9 symbols. It's not a
mathematical puzzle &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Because it doesn't rely on arithmetic, according to crossword-boy, 
it's not mathematical &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. He went on to say that it's 
just a &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; puzzle, not a math puzzle at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sorry pal, but logic &lt;em&gt;is math&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sudoku is an incredibly mathematical puzzle. It's not an 
&lt;em&gt;arithmetic&lt;/em&gt; puzzle, but it's a highly mathematical one.
 In computer science terms, it's a moderately
complex constraint-solving puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Math is more than arithmetic. It's more than numbers. Math
is really the formal study of logic and structure. Numbers and arithmetic
are one kind of structured system described using logic which can be
studied and understood using math. But pretty much &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;
with a precise, formal structure to it has at least an element of
mathematics. The structure of crossword-boy's crossword puzzles 
is fundamentally mathematical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/crossword_guy_just_doesnt_get.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/jSjzZhJtxXI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245879537514"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=5316">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/493f46cbe660135c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Environment"/><category term="autism"/><category term="graduation"/><category term="inclusion"/><category term="school"/><title type="html">Alex’s other principal</title><published>2009-06-24T19:47:38Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T19:47:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.b5media.com/~r/b5media/AutismVox/~3/5i4btFewv7U/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I can stop crying long enough, I can write a few thoughts on Alex’s graduation from elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex’s school, a NYC public special ed school, has a bunch of locations. They’re schools-within-schools: a few classrooms in a general ed school. In this case, an &lt;a href="http://insideschools.org/index12.php?fs=224&amp;amp;str=48&amp;amp;formtype=name"&gt;elementary school&lt;/a&gt; in Washington Heights whose only drawback is how far it is from our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other schools, the principal of the general ed school — Tracy Walsh — is unusually welcoming to the special ed students. Near the end of kindergarten, Alex came home with a graduation day t-shirt from PS 48. What’s this? I thought. Alex isn’t graduating. Alex doesn’t go to PS 48. On the back of the t-shirt were all the names of the graduating students. And Alex was one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years later, Alex came home with another graduating t-shirt. Alex is graduating, we realized. And there was his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/06/alexgrad.jpg" alt="alexgrad" width="480" height="360"&gt;On the way to school we got a phone call from Alex’s teacher asking if we were bringing black pants for Alex. Apparently a letter was sent home (we never got it) asking the graduating students to wear black pants and white shirts. Even if we’d gotten it, I think it would have been near impossible to get Alex into black pants: he only wears khaki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got there, June (his teacher) had somehow gotten him to wear an unfamiliar white t-shirt AND he was sporting a blue ribbon sash. Through the crowds of parents we could see Alex sitting with his teacher. We read the program: Alex would receive two awards, one for reading and a special UFT (United Federation of Teachers) medal of achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he went up to the stage, he was always accompanied by his teacher or an aide. Good thing, because he found the red curtains on the stage irresistible. People laughed, but not unkindly. They applauded when his name was read. Alex’s teacher read names for some of the awards, and the assistant principal of his school, who is leaving to become a principal, was honored. And I think this is what makes me so weepy. It was no surprise that Alex would be somewhat wander-y or would need someone to help him on and off the stage. But that his classmates and teachers and administrators would be so much a part of this big, glorious celebration was unexpected (I know, I should guessed from those t-shirts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like this in a lot of schools. General ed principals can be uncomfortable with our kids — and in some cases downright unwelcoming. I’m sad that Alex is leaving this beautiful school that was so accepting of how different he is. I know the rest of the world doesn’t have the same serene acceptance of people who are different. But really. Every school should be like PS 48. Every principal, every leader should conduct with the grace and kindness of Tracy Walsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought flowers for Tracy Walsh yesterday morning,  who shrugged off all thanks and said, “They’re all our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What those news stories I post about all have in common is they were written by an outsider reporter, by someone who is covering the protest, the town hall meeting, or the legislative decision, not by someone who is participating.  The news stories may have quotes from a parent or professional (and occasionally, very rarely, from a self-advocate), but they are not first person accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/6/21/745361/-No-one-asked-us"&gt;No one asked us&lt;/a&gt;, a blog entry by KibbutzAmiad on DailyKos, is a first person account.  It is a first person account by a support worker that includes the perspective of people who are affected by the budget cuts, but who were, for various reasons, not part of protests, town hall meetings, or giving input into legislative decisions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long quotes are considered bad form.  But KibbutzAmiad's post is so powerful that deciding what blurbs to crop out was beyond even my brutal editorial sheers.  Do read &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/6/21/745361/-No-one-asked-us"&gt;the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; as well; this is still only an excerpt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine being told that you will lose your means to get to work, your home, your means to grocery shop, and all the people that make up your daily life.  Imagine being told this and being unable to read, unable to do your own banking, unable to take care of yourself in the ways most of us take for granted.  You can't just move home with mom and dad - you are 40, 50, or 60 years old and your parents, if they are alive, are in no position to take care of you.  You have questions, you have terrible fears, and none of the people you have relied on and trusted to help you have any answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the past two weeks have been extremely difficult for all of us.  Every single person I work with is facing the loss of all the structures and components that make up their life.  They are all terrified.  They all feel helpless, and angry.  These are people who have spent a lifetime struggling to cope with a society that tells them daily that they are less than "normal", not worthy of much.  Yet for the most part they remain polite, and friendly, and optimistic.  But this has gutted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went to visit one of them, a 43 year old man named Will.  Will looks ten years younger than his actual age.  Unlike many of the people I work with, he is in good shape - he is careful to work out regularly and eat as well as he can on his budget.  He works at a discount store and does a good job, taking the train to work and back.  He smiles a lot, and makes an effort to be friendly, even to strangers.  This takes some extraordinary optimism on his part because strangers have not always been kind to Will.  He does not look "disabled".  But he cannot really read or write, and has an IQ in the low 60s.  He cannot drive or pay his own bills or - most significantly for him right now - handle the complexities of his medical treatment for stage IV melanoma.  All of those tasks are currently handled by the staff that supports him.  All of those services will end July 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..."No one asked us", he suddenly said, quite forcefully for him - he's very soft spoken normally.  "No one asked us if it was okay to do this.  No one asked us ANYTHING and we're the ones who are hurt by it.  It's not right.  No one asked us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, they sure as hell did not. In this nation, when changes in public policy are made, who gets asked?  The rich and the powerful.  Those least affected are carefully consulted and their best interests put front and center.  But as Scarlett O'Hara  succinctly put it, it's a sight easier to steal from the poor and weak than from the rich and strong.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've followed the situation in Oregon through my state's &lt;a href="http://www.oregonddcoalition.org/node/165"&gt;self-advocacy channels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/demanding_no_reduction_in_services"&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; before legislative groups &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/policy_advocacy_elearning_and_post-transition_education"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;, and done what I can to prevent the loss of funding which, ultimately, for all the enmasse protest of thousands in my state, I have zero control over.  Sometimes it seems like whether we are asked or not, we will all still lose.  How can we fight this more effectively, before it is too late?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S.

&lt;p&gt;I decided to spend Sunday afternoon taking in a movie and so I went to see Pixar’s Up.  I won’t spoil the film but there were times when there wasn’t a dry eye in the theatre, my own included.  After the movie was over and I dried my tears with some twitter therapy I began thinking  about how the film was able to elicit this response from such a large number of people.  Knowing there are people who are not moved by such displays lead me to today’s question.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Do you think empathy is a learned behaviour, or is it  hardwired?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like a simple question, right? We live in a galaxy — a sprawling city of gas, dust, and over a hundred billion stars — and we see hundreds of billions of them in the sky, so you’d think we have a decent handle on how these objects came to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That turns out not to be the case. Their formation is more complicated than you might expect, but &lt;a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/labs/"&gt;a new set of observations reveals an important clue&lt;/a&gt; in the birth process of the largest discrete objects in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the cool image: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/galaxyblobs.jpg" alt="galaxy blobs"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so it’s not the most photogenic thing in the world. But what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep optical images of young galaxies reveal that they are surrounded a vast cloud of hydrogen gas, many times larger than the galaxy itself. In a fit of nomenclaturial acumen, astronomers have dubbed these &amp;quot;blobs&amp;quot;. The thing is, to be seen at all from this great distance, the blobs must be tremendously luminous, and there’s no clear source of energy for them. Something must be powering them, but what? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two competing ideas: one was that the gas is simply cooling as it falls in to the galaxy, and that gas radiates away its heat in the form of light (similar to the way a hot iron bar will radiate its heat away as infrared light). That will then power the gas on the outside, causing it to glow. The other idea was that there is some central source of power deep inside the galaxy itself, lighting up the blobs like a light bulb in a smoke-filled room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But which is it? Ah, enter these new observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image on the left is of such a young galaxy with a blob around it. This image is optical (from Japan’s Subaru telescope and Hubble) plus deep infrared (taken using the Spitzer Space Telescope). You can see the blob, falsely colored yellow, and the denser galaxy embedded in it. Look at the upper left part of the blob: see that reddish glow? What could that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image on the right reveals it. That is the same picture, but added in (in blue) are observations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. X-rays are only produced through very energetic and violent sources, such as matter swirling around a black hole, or exploding stars. That would certainly explain what’s powering the blobs’ light! But usually these events also produce a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of optical light. Why don’t we see that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reddish glow in the left hand picture is the key. That indicates the galaxy is loaded with dust, made when stars are born and when the explode, too. Dust absorbs optical light, and what does get through can be highly reddened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now it looks like we have a complete picture of what’s going on here: as a galaxy forms from an infalling blob of gas a million light years across, a supermassive black hole coalesces in the center. Matter falls in, swirling madly around it, pouring out X-rays. Just outside this central region of the galaxy, stars are born at tremendous rates, creating lots of dust. The most massive stars explode in just a few million years, also blasting out X-rays, but also making even more dust. The dust blocks our optical view of the bright sources, but the X-rays still can leak out in quantities sufficient to heat up and light up the surrounding blobs of gas. What this means for the galaxy at large is that this huge amount of energy dumped into the blobs may slow and eventually reverse the infall, shutting off the process which forms the galaxy itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing here may be the last birth throes of a galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love about all this — besides the fact that we can know anything at all about what’s going on in an object a million light years across, billions of light years away, and billions of years in the past — is that we need all these observations together to figure this stuff out. The optical light alone presents us with a mystery, and the IR observations help but don’t solve the problem. But when you add the X-ray observations, they reveal the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And think on this… the blobs we’re talking about here are &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;, dwarfing the galaxies that are forming from them. They contain billions of times the Sun’s mass in raw gas, the building material of stars in a nascent galaxy. And these immense clouds are being lit up by not just supernovae — which are terrifying all by their lonesome, dumping out energy at rates that would turn the Earth into a crispy ember — but also by gigantic black holes smack dab in their galaxy’s hearts, which are blowing out energy in quantities to rival or exceed the supernovae themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all that power, the true source of energy illuminating the clouds so much we can see them from across half the Universe, is hidden from our telescopes. Or at least it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;, until we learned to slip the surly bonds of Earth and loft our eyes into space, where X-rays can travel freely, unimpeded by our pesky atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe is complex, and if we truly want to understand it, we will need to continue to explore it, and use the combined might of our scientific equipment to investigate it. There are hidden treasures out there, and the more we probe, the more we’ll find.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245865138444"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=13781">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b121bff251f4ce9c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="economists"/><category term="money"/><title type="html">Advice Worth $1 Billion</title><published>2009-06-24T17:10:08Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T17:10:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/advice-worth-1-billion/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" type="html">Usually, when people talk in terms of billions of dollars, they are referring to macroeconomic questions.

By following the advice of the economists, the group was able to purchase wireless coverage for the United States for $2.4 billion, while their major competitors ended up paying $3.5 billion for the same spectrum in the same auction. Thus, their advice was worth more than $1 billion to their clients.</summary><author><name>By Steven D.

So there's two new websites out there with quite similar names, &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt;. Both sites are about (obviously) autism and have a number of videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often in the world of autism, celebrity and sex appeal are used to promote pseudo-science that exploits autistic people, their family members and the public. We decided to put those very same factors to work in service of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Videos.html"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; are entitled "No Link," "Inclusive Education," "Words," and "Pet Peeves," and feature Leeann, the "friend of a family with an autistic child," well, struttin' and showin' her stuff. (Not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_the_good_goods"&gt;this kind of stuff&lt;/a&gt;.) The admittedly "tongue in cheek" videos are, it seems, made to get attention, with something of a reference to a quite well-known &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/evaluate_science_not_celebrity"&gt;celebrity&lt;/a&gt; (not &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/why_people_believe_oprah"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt;, but a friend) whose past included her "exposing herself" in some similar ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; are meant to teach parents and professionals about ABA therapy. You can &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; for a fee ($100/month for personal use) to have access to "hundreds of step-by-step video lessons" and online support from professionals. Some &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;sample lessons&lt;/a&gt; (imitating a peer, labeling prepositions/incidental teaching---familiar to those of whose children have been doing ABA, or to those who themselves are teachers/therapists) can be seen &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/SampleLessons.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt;'s stated &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/OurPhilosophy.aspx"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; is to provide "immediate access to effective and affordable Applied Behavior Analysis-based treatment tools for the growing population affected by autism spectrum disorders," hence the videos and online subscriptions. The Senior Clinical Advisor on the &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/WhoWeAre.aspx"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; is Bridget Taylor, the Executive Director of one of New Jersey's private autism schools, the &lt;a href="http://www.alpinelearninggroup.org/aboutus/staff.asp"&gt;Alpine Learning Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of a page on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/AboutUs/WhyRethink.aspx"&gt;why rethink autism&lt;/a&gt;, it's noted that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine what’s possible. Then think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rethink autism. We don’t just offer hope, we give you help.&lt;br&gt;
rethink autism empowers you to teach today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, "rethinking autism" on &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; refers to (I think) that, instead of thinking that it's not possible to teach an autistic child, think again, yes you can (with an emphasis on ABA teaching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; also asks people to think differently about autism, with such suggestions as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a person with autism may not speak, it does not mean they have an inferior intellect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.................&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be more concerned about an autistic individual’s quality of life instead of preventing them from being born. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to self-advocates and learn about neurodiversity. Include the organized community of autistic adults when it comes to making legislation regarding their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two very different, if very similarly websites, and maybe some would think they oughtn't to be discussed in the same post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="http://rethinkingautism.com/http___www.RethinkingAutism.com/Home.html"&gt;Rethinking Autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rethinkautism.com/"&gt;Rethink Autism&lt;/a&gt; are asking us to think, life with autism isn't----doesn't have to be----hopeless. We need, indeed, to think differently about autism and individuals on the autism spectrum, just as the &lt;a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt; has exhorted people to do with its &lt;a href="http://www.think-differently.org.uk/"&gt;Think Differently&lt;/a&gt; campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

When we went around the table telling what we did for a living, my response garnered some attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you a ghost hunter?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Er, well… no, not exactly.. you see…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw a ghost once.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s very interesting, but what I do at the JREF is…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it went. This is not an unusual exchange, and I’m not annoyed in the least. Often, such awkward openings lead to something more interesting, and that was the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Asian man approached me and said something very interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ghosts are cultural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though his English was quite good, I didn’t understand what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you mean ghosts only exist because they’re socially constructed?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In Japan, ghosts have no legs. In the US, they do.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1245861502384"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/24/the-blue-and-the-green/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/985a305b38323ebf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/fresh" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="fresh"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">The blue and the green</title><published>2009-06-24T16:34:04Z</published><updated>2009-06-24T16:34:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/24/the-blue-and-the-green/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via my evil twin &lt;a href="http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/possibly-the-best-optical-ilusion-i-have-seen-all-year/"&gt;Richard Wiseman&lt;/a&gt; comes one of the best color optical illusions I have ever seen. The original was apparently posted on &lt;del&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzhunt.co.uk/2009/06/22/green-and-blue/"&gt;Buzzhunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/color12e.html"&gt;Akiyoshi Kitaoka’s incredible optical illusion website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzhunt.co.uk/2009/06/22/green-and-blue/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/colors.gif" alt="Blue green spiral illusion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see embedded spirals, right, of green, pinkish-orange, and blue? Incredibly, the green and the blue spirals &lt;em&gt;are the same color&lt;/em&gt;. At first I thought Richard was pulling our collective legs, being a trickster of high magnitude. So I loaded the image in Photoshop and examined the two spirals. In the two squares displayed below, the one on the left is colored using the same color from the blue spiral, and on the right using the green spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/greenblue2.jpg" alt="green and blue squares"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, incredible! For pedantry sake, the RGB colors in both spirals are 0, 255, 150. So they are mostly green with a solid splash of blue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason they look different colors is because our brain judges the color of an object by comparing it to surrounding colors. In this case, the stripes are not continuous as they appear at first glance. The orange stripes don’t go through the &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; spiral, and the magenta ones don’t go through the &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; one. Here’s a zoom to make this more clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/06/bluegreenzoom.gif" alt="Blue green spirals zoom"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? The orange stripes go through the &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; spiral but not the &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; one. So without us even knowing it, our brains compare that spiral to the orange stripes, forcing it to think the spiral is green. The magenta stripes make the other part of the spiral look blue, &lt;strong&gt;even though they are exactly the same color.&lt;/strong&gt; If you still don’t believe me, concentrate on the edges of the colored spirals. Where the green hits the magenta it looks bluer to me, and where the blue hits the orange it looks greener. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall pattern is a spiral shape because our brain likes to fill in missing bits to a pattern. Even though the stripes are not the same color all the way around the spiral , the overlapping spirals makes our brain think they are. The very fact that you have to examine the picture closely to figure out any of this at all shows just how easily we can be fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I tell people over and over again: &lt;em&gt;you cannot trust what you see even with your own eyes&lt;/em&gt;. Your eyes are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cameras faithfully taking pictures of absolute truth of all that surrounds you. They have filters, and your brain has to interpret the jangled mess it gets fed. Colors are not what they appear, shapes are not what they appear (that zoomed image above is square, believe it or not), objects are not what they appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next time someone swears they saw Jesus, or a UFO, or a ghost, show them this picture. What you see in life is absolutely and provably &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what you get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas for that line of reasoning, I've noticed that more people are more likely to shout out a certain four-letter word when surprised or hurt or angry, which must mean that sex is god.&lt;/p&gt;
